We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I realize that I have a bit of a crush on her, and so I start to pay attention to her out the corner of my eye. Thats when I notice she stares back, and its quite a lot. There will be times where if her friends make a joke, she'll start laughing, and turn her head away from her friends to look at me. If she leans over to get something out of her bag, she'll look, she'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hall, her eyes will linger for a moment if she looks over to the whiteboard, and sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds. This goes on for about 2-3 weeks before I do anything.

In one of my classes (physics), we are free to work with whoever on assignments, and she sat with a few of my friends so I went over to her table. I could get her to laugh a few times, but its when everyone else did so I don't know if that was too special. We have to present to the class how to solve assignments on the worksheet with our groups, so the whole class gets to ask questions and know the process of the problem. When i'm over there, I ask the group at large if I should stay there to present with them or go back to my table, and she's the first one to tell me to stay. There is another girl at that table, and she'd look at me instead of the other girl when the other girl was talking to see how much I was listening to the other girl, though I hardly talked to the other girl. She'll turn and talk to me if I end up next to her before class, and there was a time when one of my friends invited me over to her table, and she was leaning over the table to see if I was coming.

So I see all of these signs, and one day after a class where I went over to her table I ask for her number. She gives it to me, and I text her that weekend. No response. I check with one of our mutual friends that it is the correct number, and it is, but that friend said that sometimes she hasn't gotten a response either. When she first gave me her number, I immediately sent a text so she had my number, but she saw me send that text, so she knows it's me. The issue is, now we've moved seats in physics so I don't have a excuse to go talk to her, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore.

About a week later, still no response, so I ask her after class if she got the text. The text was a question about soccer since we both play soccer, and she said she got the text but was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and just forgot. The weird thing is, that week she still was staring a lot. She was glancing over a lot in the first class, and when she had to give thoughts on the poem she was looking at me out the corner of her eye the whole time, and not the teacher (the teacher is in one corner of the room, and I am on the same wall but other corner, and she sits in the middle of the opposite side but facing me). She did that any time when she had to share thoughts in that class last week. In physics, she's glancing over a lot too, and one time when I was presenting with my new group, she was leaning over her table to watch, and didn't do that for other groups. We also were in the hall with our groups one class, and I was behind her group, and she repeatedly looked over her should back at my group, and when I moved to her other shoulder, she started looking over that shoulder.

She is a shy person, she'll talk really quiet when presenting or meeting new people, but she's not shy around friends and not shy around me. We'll make eye contact a few times each class, but I make sure to look only if she's looking first.

Is she interested but really nervous? She is shy, but I wouldn't guess that shy, and its not like I'm weird looking or interesting enough that she'd stare for weeks and not get bored, so idk what she's staring at if she's not gonna text back.

Is a double text in this situation okay too?

This was my first real relationship I’ve been in and we started dating our senior year of highschool, throughout college (went to the same school), and 3 months after graduation I’m single and later found out she was dating a kid from her new job a week later. I was a mess for a bit but I’m starting to feel better, doing some self improvement, and just trying to grow. Over the 5 years we were together I spent the majority of my time with her and would constantly ignore plans with friends in favor of spending nights in with her. Therefore, I’m lacking close friendships with people in my area. I have a small group of friends but we are honestly not very similar or compatible, we’re just familiar with each other so we hangout and go to bars occasionally on weekends. With all that being said, I feel like I want to try to date again (it’s been 2 months) especially Bc she’s moved on already but:
1. It’s so hard to meet/find girls my age especially when I don’t have a large friend group to network with
2. Im anxious about being 23 and bringing a girl I don’t even know back to my parents house if things get more serious. Do girls care about this stuff?
3. I haven’t tried to flirt with a girl since highschool🤣 I was very loyal to her lol and I wouldn’t even know what to say

For someone who was just in a relationship for 5 years, it feels like I know nothing about dating (or how to find/secure a date) and these stupid little things are making me anxious.

Just for details. I feel bad about being unemployed but she broke up with me the night before I was starting a really good job opportunity. I tried to gut it out for a few weeks but ultimately quit because I needed time to process my whole life shifting. I took that job for us to move out together even though the hours and commute was crazy. I was trying to do that for us to begin our lives together but now I’m just unemployed, living with my parents, and unconfident in myself or my situation right now.

My question would mostly be for the girls which would be: do girls care about someone being unemployed and living at home? This has really been bothering me because I feel like it’s a turn off for a lot of people. And for the record it has nothing to do with my parents they have been nothing but supportive since my breakup and my mom is constantly asking if I’ve met someone new yet, so it’s not like they’d care who I bring over, I’m my own adult.

Goes on to elaborate that she has had really negative experiences dating coworkers in the past. Says she really enjoys hanging out with me and wants us to give the friends thing a more genuine shot.

I already responded saying she doesn't have to explain herself to me and that I'm willing to give the friends thing a shot.

Brand new state. And I got a job working at a grocery store. I'm naturally an extroverted person. In time I made some friends, and in one of these instances of me hanging out with some coworkers, this girl came along.

We hung out. It went well.

I would see her at work. Say what's up. Nothing out of the ordinary.

And then a few weeks later I message her on Facebook, telling her how thankful I am that she spent time with me. I was a new guy in a brand new state in a brand new town, and having someone actually spend some time with me made me feel... not like a total outcast. I really appreciated it. I told her how much of a beautiful person she was, and how much I really appreciated it. Even the simple ""Hellos"" at work made me feel... welcomed.

Again, remember, I'm in a brand new town, in a brand new state, in the middle of the country. I went from Miami, a big city, to a small town in the country.

It was her birthday last week, and I gave her $100. I went to the store on my day off, and I used ""I had to buy orange juice"" as an excuse. I mean, I did have to buy orange juice. But I also wanted to give her something and wish her a happy birthday.

I have bad dating experience. My previous relationships have left scars. And I don't like opening up. Because it makes me weak. And when you open up and show your weaknesses, that's when people hurt you.

Maybe she thinks I'm this bad boy city Cuban guy. But then the second I start opening up and showing her my weaknesses, she won't like me anymore. Because the illusion of this ""bad boy"" will fade away.

Maybe I'm too much in my head. I just... I really like this girl, and I don't want to fuck it up. But I can't just eliminate my past dating history and the scars that they left.

I just... like I said, I really like this girl. I'm just afraid of the potential of taking it to the next step because... I've been down this road before.

We would casually play games with friends over the last 3 months but for the past 2 weeks I started dm'ing her we have gotten a lot closer. I actually first met this person about 1.5 years ago, but she has only recently started becoming a lot more frequent in my discord circle. I also had feelings for her in December of last year but after finding out she had a boyfriend it crushed me inside and so I ghosted her. I felt really bad for what I did and so a few months later I sent her an apology and admitted that I had a huge crush on her. She took it really well and said that it was ok and understood that I needed to take care of my feelings. She is just so nice ;\_;

Well recently these feelings have come back in full force, and a mutual friend had told me she had broken up with her boyfriend a few weeks ago. Now I will say she lives 1 state away but she is also aware that I have travelled across states to meet other friends online. She is also extremely private, and whilst I know a lot about her and her traumatising childhood (she had to move out of home at 18 into an apartment in a different state alone) she has kept her real name and what she looks like a secret (although I have never asked). She is also very different to most girls, and absolutely hates being referred to as an egirl or anything of the sort, and has deepened her voice so she might come across as a dude. She just wants to be treated as one of the boys, and I know that she wants to come across as a dude IRL as well.

Things were going super well between us, and 2 nights ago we twice stayed up till like 6am and 4am just talking about our lives. I thought we were vibing super hard, but now I can't help but get the feeling that she doesn't see us more than friends. I mean we had a bit of a heart to heart moment on of those nights but from the things she is saying it sounds like she's dealing with a lot of stuff mentally right now. Like last night, she was waiting for me to play a game but I ended up telling her I couldn't due to a stomach ache and then she ended up telling me she has had a constant stomach ache due to her emotions manifesting physically due to some stuff that happened to her 1-2 months ago. I can only assume it has to do with breaking up with her boyfriend which would mean that she isn't over the relationship yet (which makes sense). But it could also be something that I don't know about.

I'm just stuck and don't know if I should just come out to her about the way that I feel or keep chatting with her for a month or something and then tell her. I just don't know what to do. She is completely different to anyone that I've ever met and I really really like her. But I get the feeling that if I wait too long we will drift apart... It's so tough, and whilst I've given hints (I think) about the way that I feel I don't know if she sees it that way, or would ever reciprocate. Like would I be insensitive if I started flirting with her now? I don't know... I don't even think she knows that I know she broke up with her boyfriend as a mutual friend told me... I'm just so confused ;;;\_;;;

I was out with some friends on Saturday doing some casual day drinking, and I got home at about 7pm. He text me at 8ish asking if I wanted to meet him, and that he was out with some friends. Sure thing, says I, feeling a little buzzed but not overly so, and so I head out to meet him at a nearby pub.

Beginning of the night was a heap of fun, chatting, kissing, drinking. We stayed at the pub until around 2am, but I cannot for the life of me really remember leaving, or getting home. I should point out I’ve recently gone back on SSRI’s, after a few years of not being on them, and I totally forgot how much they affect my ability to hold my booze. I can go from feeling completely fine, to blacking out, in the space of a drink. I remember we had sex, we fell asleep, woke up in the morning with a hazy AF memory, had sex again before I had to get up and get ready to meet some friends. Everything seemed fine, we were chatting, joking, laughing, kissed goodbye. 

I text him on Monday, saying I'd had a fun night on Sunday, with a little bit of chat. He messaged back saying he was glad I’d had a good time, with a little bit of chat. But, I have a bit of anxiety now around if I was noticeably drunk, if I said anything dumb, if I should have acknowledged that I was too drunk, but we were both bemoaning our hangovers on Sunday morning so I thiiiink we were both in a similar spot. I also know I’m not an aggressive/angry drunk, but I can overshare/have no filter (similar to me in sober life tbh) and I just bloody wish I could remember what we spoke about!

We went out, enjoy the talk, things got spicy and we slept on the first date. We did it in the hotel as both me and him live with roommates and agreed not to bring anyone. It was extremely great physical match. 

After that night he messaged me making sure I got home safe and we both asked some stuff. Then me messaged me 2 days after and invited to go on a trip over the weekend. We went. It was also pretty good but a bit more complicated as after physical intimacy it felt like he wanted to discuss such serious topics and concepts and it was too much for me. I felt overwhelmed with his attitude because I was just trying to enjoy the moment, hug, kiss and etc but he wanted to go too deep(endless discussions about science, economics, different life situations for people) . But we still have spoken; and overall experience was nice also including physical intimacy. 

When we came back, I messaged him thank you for the weekend with a heart (he was the one paying for our tickets, hotel and etc). And he replied thank you too and some hearty smiles too and kisses too. 

But it’s been one day when he messaged me back and it was some pictures of vaginas(different forms existing)  and he mentioned it was something we were discussing. Yeah, we did have some sexual discussion but why would he pop up with that? It disgusted me for some reason that I don’t want to reply. To be honest, if he wanted to be sexy with me, that’s definitely not the line to go with. 

Then, I saw that he put the picture that I took of him on our trip. When I took it, I told: “well, now you’ll have the pic for tinder (we met there 😅). For me it was such self protective joke in order not to fall for him too much. But it was extremely hurtful to see that he actually put it online to the site.

He works at the same place i worked at for 4 years (but quit in 2017 when i left for college) we shared a couple years together there as well. 

This young girl, 17 i think, started working there recently, well call her Emily— well, Emily has a huge crush on my boyfriend. I get it though, he’s literally a shining star, and it’s a bit of a toxic environment, so i know his random cracks of jokes and kindness probably make everyone’s day. Before my boyfriend and so started dating, the first time i came into my old job with both of them working, i saw her standing suspiciously close to my (not yet) boyfriend while he was very clearly busy with work at his station, and i immediately (and without much thought) gave her the dirtiest look. I got a little jealous, so I kind of asserted myself by talking to my boyfriend about our plans later that night, got my free food (because i always get free food there) and left. She immediately, after i left, started talking shit about me (per my old bosses and boyfriend confirming this) and being saying stuff like “who the fuck is that and why is SHE getting free food”, because i guess they charge her for her food? Lol. 

ANYWAY, i asked my boyfriend what her deal was, because i can tell the way girls look at guys and if they like them or not, and he told me she has a huge crush on him and would always text him stuff like “we’re working together today 😜” when they would get scheduled together, he would never give her an answer or really even the time of day, being that she’s 17, clearly, and he’s been in love with me since we were kids. Fast forward my boyfriend and i become exclusive, and shortly after she posts an IG pic while they’re working together, and she sees my bf scrolling on IG, and pressed him about not liking her picture and asked him to like it, which he did, because he doesn’t really see the problem with it if she’s gonna be all weird and ask him to like her picture, he’s super passive and just would rather turn the other cheek then to create drama (or in my opinion, just isn’t comfortable setting boundaries like that— not my favorite, whatever, but with 0 ill intent or anything beyond a platonic coworker relationship) and i tried to explain to him that to a 17 year old girl it means so much more to her than just a “like” on IG. (She also has liked nearly every single one of his recent IG posts) He understood and simply unfollowed her, despite me not even hinting it asking for that (so brownie points i guess, don’t even know why he was following her anyway, he says he just doesn’t think it’s that serious) (guys are so oblivious lol) 
But this is super unsettling to me, another girl pressing MY boyfriend about not liking her picture? So i ask my best friends little sister (who goes to school with her) to just tell me about her and all she says is she’s known for “stealing peoples boyfriends.” So one time recently my boyfriend tells me they were super busy one night and my bosses were in a terrible mood, one started going off on her like super aggressive and really unnecessarily mean to her, and my boyfriend being the kind shining star he is, stand up for her just being like “yo that’s not cool just chill out”, nothing crazy, but she didn’t deserve to be screamed at like that, and he told me she was all up in his personal space the whole rest of the night trying to talk to him or whatever, and when he first told me that i got kinda jealous because I’d rather my boyfriend not be sticking up for other girls, but at the same time realize he was just being nice. But i feel like to Emily, him being nice seems like more than just kindness and she definitely is creating this fantasy imagination that she’s getting emotional attention from my boyfriend. So after this i do a little more digging, i ask my other best friends little sister who also goes to school with her what’s good, and she pulls up her Snapchat story or something and she’s bragging about literally stealing some girls boyfriend. Like okay? So i tell my boyfriend and he is just laughing he thinks it’s hilarious and tells me to not even bat an eye at this girl. 

Every time i come into his job, she’ll say some shit to my boyfriend with mad attitude like “oh your girlfriends here,” and most of the time she’ll hide in the back or avoid eye contact with me at all costs. I can tell i make her nervous, and she hates that i get free food always and she doesn’t lol, (because i worked there for so long and was manager and my bosses loved me). 

Today, i wake up to 3 follow requests on IG, and I’m not active on there at all so i know nobody’s posting me with my @ name to be found. It’s 2 fake accounts, and one from Emily’s best friend (very blatantly). At this point I’m just confused what this girls endgame is, i definitely don’t like the fact that she even thinks she has a chance with my boyfriend, i definitely can be a jealous person, but i know she’s also a literal child and he would never even touch her with a 10 foot pole and he’s very much in love with me. It just makes me want to be petty and go into his job and just fuck with her. Part of me thinks it’s absolutely hilarious. And the other part is like going into possessive mode and wanting to assert myself and make her look dumb. Need some advice or thoughts.

As a teenager, I always wanted a girlfriend, but i think i kind of acted/dressed/looked goofy and it was very rare that a girl seemed to be into me. I never made any real moves on anyone because I imagined there was no way anyone would want me. The closest I ever got was a girl that i guess i was ""seeing"" for a few weeks and then she dumped me. But all throughout adolescence, I knew the goal was to find a girlfriend, who would one day become a wife, with whom I'd have kids and grow old. I didn't understand the rush to have sex and be with a bunch of different people. After high school I bumbled my way through a few ""situations"" with a girl here and there, but nothing ever stuck. And I was always heartbroken and thought I'd never recover. 

When I was 25, still a virgin, and had only kissed maybe twice, I met a girl on a dating app. She was Peruvian but living in my area in USA, and since I took Spanish in high school, i kind of had an ""in"". Our first ever ""date"" which was just us hanging out on the couch at my apartment, she wanted to have sex. As I was still a virgin, had always thought it would be better to wait until marriage, and never expected this to happen so soon, let alone with the girl initiating it, I was caught off guard. I just told her I didn't have any condoms, and didn't go into a whole explanation. But sometime before our next date I bought some, and when i saw her on date 2, and she was down for it again, I threw all my inhibitions to the wind and lost my virginity to this girl I had only met days before. It turned out she was a prolific liar, a jealous manipulator, etc etc and we soon broke up. Soon after, I traveled to Mexico to visit a friend, and with my newfound knowledge that women could actually be attracted to me, after briefly meeting a girl there, I ended up in her bed with her, at her request. In my few days with her, I felt so infatuated, I couldn't wait to see her again. But when i got back home and texted her she basically let me know that it was just casual, and she wasn't interested in anything with me. I was crushed.

I got back on the dating app and met another Spanish-speaking girl, took her to my apartment, and had sex with her the first night. We kept seeing each other for a while, but i never really felt infatuated with her or anything. She was a pretty bad person, dishonest, violent, jealous. We eventually broke up and I didn't even really care.

Soon after, I went back to Mexico, and later Colombia, and eventually a number of Spanish-speaking countries. At home in USA, I never sense a girl having even the slightest interest in me. I'm terrified to even ask someone out, out of fear that they'll just be disgusted and all appalled. But traveling through Latin America, all i have ever had to do is be charming for a day or two, with my gringo accent, and the panties drop like crazy. In the past 6 years I've had sex with about 10 girls during my travels, and it never takes more than a few days. They often make the first move. With a few others, I've abstained on purpose, hoping that if i don't rush into sex, I'll be able to form a more meaningful connection that could turn into a loving relationship, but it never does. I've met some really awesome girls, who I've had a great time with, gone on trips with, and kept in touch with to this day, but as much as I enjoyed all of their company, I've never felt what I used to feel before ever having sex. Butterflies in the stomach, thinking about a future with someone, etc. I always feel like, ""This girl is nice, she's a lot of fun, I'm happy to have met her, but I don't feel love, nor do I ever see myself feeling love for her, or anyone. I've got places to be, and more things to see, people to meet, and she's got her own life here and why complicate things?"" Unfortunately this means I have hurt a lot of people, because even though I tell them going in, or when they ask, that I'm not looking for anything serious, often times they keep participating, hoping I'll change my mind. And i suppose I keep participating, telling myself that they know the deal, even though I know they're hoping somehow there will be more. 

To this day, I still have a number of girls that would probably agree to be my girlfriend if I asked at the right time. Most have have gone on to have meaningful relationships, and i find myself looking at their facebook posts, seeing them in love with somebody, and wondering if it should have been me. Wondering why I couldn't have felt more passionate about them when i had the chance.

When I'm meeting a new person, I'm not really bummed anymore about the previous ones. But when that new person is gone, sometimes I'm bummed about all of them at once. When i have someone in front of me, i don't really want it. And when i have nobody, I want everybody i ever gave up on. Sometimes I feel awesome (or tell myself I do), like the biggest mack ever in the game. But a lot of times I just feel like a gross, passionless sex fiend, who just constantly uses people to cover up my long-time deep-seated insecurities that nobody would ever want to be with me.

I don't know if I was always going to be this way, and i just had to lose my virginity to realize I'm incapable of feeling romantic love towards another human being, or if so many years of rejection and heartbreak turned me this way as a defense mechanism. I WANT to WANT, what most everyone else wants: What I always told myself i wanted: To be madly in love with 1 person who makes my life complete, and who i could never see myself being without. But I just feel like a robot, looking at humans through glass and trying to learn what it means when they feel things.

I don't know where to start. I'd appreciate any insight into what's wrong with me or 



As a teenager, I always wanted a girlfriend, but i think i kind of acted/dressed/looked goofy and it was very rare that a girl seemed to be into me. I never made any real moves on anyone because I imagined there was no way anyone would want me. The closest I ever got was a girl that i guess i was ""seeing"" for a few weeks and then she dumped me. But all throughout adolescence, I knew the goal was to find a girlfriend, who would one day become a wife, with whom I'd have kids and grow old. I didn't understand the rush to have sex and be with a bunch of different people. After high school I bumbled my way through a few ""situations"" with a girl here and there, but nothing ever stuck. And I was always heartbroken and thought I'd never recover. 

When I was 25, still a virgin, and had only kissed maybe twice, I met a girl on a dating app. She was Peruvian but living in my area in USA, and since I took Spanish in high school, i kind of had an ""in"". Our first ever ""date"" which was just us hanging out on the couch at my apartment, she wanted to have sex. As I was still a virgin, had always thought it would be better to wait until marriage, and never expected this to happen so soon, let alone with the girl initiating it, I was caught off guard. I just told her I didn't have any condoms, and didn't go into a whole explanation. But sometime before our next date I bought some, and when i saw her on date 2, and she was down for it again, I threw all my inhibitions to the wind and lost my virginity to this girl I had only met days before. It turned out she was a prolific liar, a jealous manipulator, etc etc and we soon broke up. Soon after, I traveled to Mexico to visit a friend, and with my newfound knowledge that women could actually be attracted to me, after briefly meeting a girl there, I ended up in her bed with her, at her request. In my few days with her, I felt so infatuated, I couldn't wait to see her again. But when i got back home and texted her she basically let me know that it was just casual, and she wasn't interested in anything with me. I was crushed.

I got back on the dating app and met another Spanish-speaking girl, took her to my apartment, and had sex with her the first night. We kept seeing each other for a while, but i never really felt infatuated with her or anything. She was a pretty bad person, dishonest, violent, jealous. We eventually broke up and I didn't even really care.

Soon after, I went back to Mexico, and later Colombia, and eventually a number of Spanish-speaking countries. At home in USA, I never sense a girl having even the slightest interest in me. I'm terrified to even ask someone out, out of fear that they'll just be disgusted and all appalled. But traveling through Latin America, all i have ever had to do is be charming for a day or two, with my gringo accent, and the panties drop like crazy. In the past 6 years I've had sex with about 10 girls during my travels, and it never takes more than a few days. They often make the first move. With a few others, I've abstained on purpose, hoping that if i don't rush into sex, I'll be able to form a more meaningful connection that could turn into a loving relationship, but it never does. I've met some really awesome girls, who I've had a great time with, gone on trips with, and kept in touch with to this day, but as much as I enjoyed all of their company, I've never felt what I used to feel before ever having sex. Butterflies in the stomach, thinking about a future with someone, etc. I always feel like, ""This girl is nice, she's a lot of fun, I'm happy to have met her, but I don't feel love, nor do I ever see myself feeling love for her, or anyone. I've got places to be, and more things to see, people to meet, and she's got her own life here and why complicate things?"" Unfortunately this means I have hurt a lot of people, because even though I tell them going in, or when they ask, that I'm not looking for anything serious, often times they keep participating, hoping I'll change my mind. And i suppose I keep participating, telling myself that they know the deal, even though I know they're hoping somehow there will be more.

I started noticing this guy at my gym, about a month ago, who I thought was really attractive. I ended up randomly finding him on social media after he was in a picture with someone I follow. I decided to follow him and he followed me back. After a week of social media interaction, he made it known he found me very attractive as well. We talked a little and I realized he was wanting to hook up with me. 
Now I have never been the type of girl who has casual sex up until this past year. Last august I got out of a 3 year long, abusive relationship. I knew I didn’t want to date for awhile but I also did want my sexual needs met. So I thought “f*** it” and wanted to hook up with him. We started saying hi at the gym for a few days and then we made plans to hook up.
It was amazing. There was instant, natural sexual chemistry and he messaged me right after I left saying he really enjoyed it. This was 2 weeks ago. We have messaged multiple times after we had sex to meet up again but it wasnt until today that our schedules aligned and we had sex again. 
He messaged me about an hour or two after I left and said he already wants me again. 
We both previously agreed that we just want sex. We don’t really message each other unless it’s to meet up. Sometimes he does ask me about my work day but that’s about it other than sex. 
He doesn’t kiss me during sex, he said he feels like it’s too intimate. I respect his boundary, but for me it’s a part of foreplay so that kinda sucks. But I guess kissing would make it easier for feelings to develop. 
I guess my question is, since I am new to having casual sex, does a guy want to keep hooking up after the first time because he thinks she’s “easy?” How can I be assured that he actually respects me so I don’t end up regretting/resenting him? I can’t call us a FWB type deal because truthfully we aren’t even friends.. so am I just a booty call? Do guys respect girls who just want sex? 
I am enjoying hooking up with him. I guess I’m now just overthinking and wondering if he actually likes me/our sex or if he just thinks I’m an easy lay.

So I’m 29 and have been dating since I was 14. Iv had more experience with casual dating and picking up in bars than most my age and I thought I’d provide my 3 rules which have resulted in respectful and pleasant interactions for all involved. 

This is from my perspective as a straight male but have helped friends of all persuasions with their endeavours. I feel these rules apply whether you’re promiscuous or just trying to talk to your crush in hopes of a happily ever after.

I will clarify, I have terrible luck in nightclubs. So this is more for pubs, bars, festivals and in general public. 

Rule 1: Eye contact. 

I can’t stress this enough. Eye contact is the single most important factor that determines whether approaching someone is even a possibility. I’m talking anything from a bit of linger when your eyes meet to full blown devouring. If you appear at someone’s side and they haven’t seen you before, or worse, have avoided making eye contact a couple of times, they will be immediately defensive. 

If you’re trying to pick up, let your eyes do the work. If someone likes the look of you then they will make themselves available to your gaze. They will be visible to you for a good portion of the time. 

The adverse is true also. If someone is open to some adventure for the night, their eyes will be doing the same. They’ll be seeking to find someone they like the look of and hold that gaze. 

Rule 2: Be yourself.

Why would you want to be a shallow, poorly written version of something you think you should be over the person you genuinely are. 

That’s exhausting and you will get tripped up on your lies. We all have flaws, don’t be afraid to some a little of them. If you’re a bit shy and bashful then be shy and bashful. 

If you’re a pickup line kinda person then go for it. As long as you’re not greasy about it then it will come across genuine. 

If you’ve had the eye contact and you’re now talking to them and it’s gone smoothly so far. Your job is to not mess it up. They’re interested, don’t give them too many reasons not to be. 

Rule 3..: I call it the rule of 3. 

You have effectively 3 topics/questions you can raise. If during these 3 prompts the person you’re talking to doesn’t initiate their own interaction. 

If they don’t delve into your discussion and if they generally don’t participate in the conversation. Then just wrap it up politely and move on. If the conversation is going smoothly and it dries up, go back to the rule of 3 and try to re-spark it, if not. Wrap up and move on. 

This will do two things. 

It will save your time and energy for someone who is interested. It may be that you read the cues wrong. Or they don’t like what you’re saying. Or your vibe doesn’t match theirs. What ever it is, it’s not a bad thing. Just move on. 

It will also stop your ego from flat spinning/spiralling out of control. We all like to be accepted and we all fear rejection. By doing this you can write the experience off as either a learning experience or just a pleasant conversation with a nice person. 

And that’s really it. From there it’s on you lovely people. 


Honourable mentions: 

Hygiene - For the love of god (fellas I’m looking at you here). Please wear clean clothes, wash before you go out, brush your teeth and keep some mints handy. There is no quicker way to turn people against you than a bad smell. 

Be polished - What I mean by this is try to present the best image of yourself as you can. Do your hair, wear some nice clothes, wash your shoes. This is as much for you as it is for anybody else. If you’re dressed good. Smelling good. Looking good. Then your confidence will be higher already. 

Fragrance - go easy on it. A spray on each wrist and dabbed on either side of your neck is all you need. It’s meant to be an intriguing aroma. Personal and intimate. People are meant to catch a wiff of it and wonder who has such a nice smell on. It’s not meant to tranquillise an elephant. Even the best smelling cologne/perfume will give someone a headache if it’s over applied 

Don’t be slimy - if you’re there just to get laid that’s okay. There’s bound to be a counterpart for you somewhere that night. But don’t let that be your dominating angle. 

And that’s it.

I'm an overthinker and major stalker, so please bare with me. 

So I've been talking to this guy for 2 months. It started casual on snapchat  (several snaps a day), but after our first date we were both alot more flirtatious. We met again, he spent the night but we didn't have sex because it felt too early. We were supposed to meet the week after, but he had to cancel on me because he had gotten some bad news regarding an MRI, and they had to run some tests to make sure he doesn't have prostate cancer. He got the news on the day of our third date and at first he said he wanted to still meet, but a couple of hours later he sent me a text saying he just couldn't get those bad news out of his head, and that he knew he wouldnt be much company. He asked if he could call me later in the evening, and we had a 30 minute conversation where he was very honest about everything that had happen. I was pretty impressed, because to me thats pretty private stuff. My mother has cancer as well, so I feel like I'm a good person to talk to about stuff like that. He also said that he had been looking forward to seeing me, and that we needed to find a new day as soon as possible. After our conversation I texted him good night and thanked him for a great talk. He responded with saying that I'm a beautiful person. Great, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to the problem. I have initiated every date that we have had, and I initiate every conversation we have. Everytime I send him a snap, he responds right away and either says that he misses me, that I'm beautiful, funny or something very positive. What makes me so confused is that he never send me anything anymore. The last week, he has not texted me first once, and when I ask him about rescheduling, he's very vague. He says stuff like "" I really want to meet up, I just need to get these test sorted"". Its only been 4 days since we were supposed to meet, but I just feel like a fool when he say stuff like "" we need to find a new day as soon as possible"", but when I ask him when he wants to meet up, he can't seem to find a day? 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just stop contacting him? My biggest problem is that I'm a major social media stalker, so I check his snap score all the time, and its not like he's not active. He sends and recieves aloooot of snaps, just doesn't send anything to me... And I can't stop my head from thinking those distructive thoughts that he send snaps to many other girls, just not to me.

We went out, enjoy the talk, things got spicy and we slept on the first date. We did it in the hotel as both me and him live with roommates and agreed not to bring anyone. It was extremely great physical match. 

After that night he messaged me making sure I got home safe and we both asked some stuff. Then me messaged me 2 days after and invited to go on a trip over the weekend. We went. It was also pretty good but a bit more complicated as after physical intimacy it felt like he wanted to discuss such serious topics and concepts and it was too much for me. I felt overwhelmed with his attitude because I was just trying to enjoy the moment, hug, kiss and etc but he wanted to go too deep(endless discussions about science, economics, different life situations for people) . But we still have spoken; and overall experience was nice also including physical intimacy. 

When we came back, I messaged him thank you for the weekend with a heart (he was the one paying for our tickets, hotel and etc). And he replied thank you too and some hearty smiles too and kisses too. 

But it’s been one day when he messaged me back and it was some pictures of vaginas(different forms existing)  and he mentioned it was something we were discussing. Yeah, we did have some sexual discussion but why would he pop up with that? It disgusted me for some reason that I don’t want to reply. To be honest, if he wanted to be sexy with me, that’s definitely not the line to go with. 

Then, I saw that he put the picture that I took of him on our trip. When I took it, I told: “well, now you’ll have the pic for tinder (we met there 😅).

Some time ago, she was, too, but we were too scared to take it further, and now I want to stop seeing her that way. 


So, long story short, this friend of mine and I have always been very close since we met. And right now we have been living in the same apartment because of ""University Reasons"".

I met her because she was the girlfriend of a mutual friend mine and hers, but, some months after they broke up, she confessed to me that she had been seeing me differently than just a friend. 

This happened half a year ago and, at the time, I didn't feel the same way as her, but, as time went on, I started to become attracted to her.

Lastly, a week ago we talked about it again, and she told me that she didn't know how to react, because of /private reasons I would like not to discuss/ and also because of the time that had passed. She wanted to, but at the same time she was afraid of ruining the friendship we had. I felt the same as her. 

So, ultimately, since she wasn't able to make a decision, I took it for the both of us, and decided that taking a step further wasn't worth the risk, and we decided to remain friends. 

As predicted, we have been feeling a bit off these days, as this discussion is quite recent, but I am afraid I won't be able to stop seeing her THAT way. Because, if that makes sense, I'm attracted to her personality and how she treats me, not to other superficial stuff like her body, supposedly because we have known each other for almost two years.

Story- 2 years ago I met a girl at my tuitions, I literally got soo in love with her , we became little bit friends,not much ,trust me just having a female friend in my life was very good,since before that I was never even closer to any girl before that.
We didn't talk much , but the time spent with her just for 2-3 mins only perhaps daily in those 2-3 months was a bliss moment for me. But what I mistaken was that I got soo obsessed with her, earlier she used to give small hints which I thought that's nothing much and I could be true as well, point is I never expressed my feelings and later when it's got a little late I felt her kinda ignoring me , then I realised that I have missed something. Since we were able to meet only till my tuitions lasted ,but I got obsessed with her, I felt she also used me for work related but nevermind, later I saw I was getting obsessed with her, I was lately listening sad romantic songs bla bla .
It was months since I saw her but I still had feelings which made me upset , then I moved on little by little by sending her text once in months, then now finally I am over her, not much contact and it never was , it's just I feel I still have something for her.

I couldn't make a move on her later ,cause I was unable to meet her and it's been 2 years and now at the moment I am not in the same state .
There is still part of me that makes me , but yeah I feel it's out of my reach now since I am hundreds of miles away from her.

I used to feel all this cause I am lonely that's why mostly, and even now when most of the things in life doesn't seems to work my mind wanders in those small moment of happiness I had in those 2-3 months.
That was beautiful ❤️

We met on a dating app and really hit it off, but every date, including the first one, always ends in sex, which leads me to believe it’s only going to be a casual fwb situation. There’s been some indication that he’d like to make things more serious, but for now I’m assuming it’s just a sex thing so that I don’t catch feelings or anything.

The only issue is, he’s quite literally the best I’ve had. Sex has never been particularly pleasant for me, all my previous sexual partners have (unknowingly) hurt me and as long as I’ve known it’s always just been such a painful experience. When I have sex with this guy though, it’s not like that at all - the chemistry is like nothing I’d felt with anyone else. I’m still unable to “O”, but it definitely doesn’t hurt as much with him and I was actually able to enjoy it. My problem is that I’ve never enjoyed sex before I met him, and I’m scared that if we’re just having a casual fling then he’s eventually going to move onto someone new and I’m back to hating sex again with other men. I don’t want to scare him away by asking the “what are we” question, because honestly I am fine with things being casual with him but I do just want to know where this is all heading and how he sees me. My housemates think I should stop wasting my time on him because they think he’s too old for me and just uses me for sex, but honestly for once I don’t even mind.
