So me and my husband ended up our marriage about a year ago and now I’m single mom of two years boy. Since I’m 23, my parents or siblings asking or suggesting me to find a good husband. However, since the reason my previous relationship ended up due to violence, I’m actually not too into or actively seeking to get married. I feel like I can be strong enough to raise my own son by myself. 
Because of that, even I’m on dating site, I just want a boyfriend. 

And since I’m just looking for boyfriend, I never told anyone or write my profile about my previous relationship or my son because if I tell or write about it, people will assume that “oh she’s looking for husband or dad for her son,” which is not I want. That making me feel guilty about I don’t love my son which is I love him so much. 

My questions are is it normal to single mom just want boyfriend? And should I feel guilty about hiding about it? 

I know boyfriend could be ended up husband but I do not want my future boyfriend involve my life like I don’t want to go all paperwork process for divorce or anything and people told me that if I’m not too serious about relationship, I should just get fwb but it is not also I want to because I’m not only want boyfriend for sex, but for actual dating….",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163666,public,self,Is it normal that single mom just want a boyfriend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tejm36/is_it_normal_that_single_mom_just_want_a_boyfriend/,no_ads,0,,,,,

They're friends. But they have done.. idk... experimentation, my gf says that's what girls do, ""well it's a girl thing"".

So I'm gonna start in the beginning b4 me. In high school, they pecked often. She said it was mostly on the cheek and I rarely on the lips so I can see how it could be a girl thing. The problem starts to intrigue me knowing that her best friend has questioned her sexuality alot over the years. She considered herself asexual and then bi, recently, atm I'm not sure what her sexuality is. She does have a bf now tho, a new revelation. so i assume, bi. 

The first time she came down, while I was with my gf, she msged my gf and said ""I can't wait to kiss you"", but hey maybe that's something all girls do.

I also got pulled into this situation more when my gf told me something happened between them, sexually. They had a sleepover once in high school (before me), they got high and chilled. They did this thing that her and I did in the beginning of our relationship, which in my opinion is a very intimate act. I'll try paint it the best I can. One person lays on their back, the other lays on top(of the other person). The person on top is in some sort of foetal position. Yeh I don't think I did a good job, just know it is a very intimate act in my opinion. While they were doing this the friend, was rubbing her coochie on my gf. I'm honestly not too sure what happened after that, but my gf woke up and felt weird. she said that she felt extremely weird, and she's tried to block it out as if it never happened.

Recently, (while we're tg) she came down to visit on holiday. The day b4 she left, my gf visited her to spend some time with her. They watched Jane the virgin. There are two different things she told me happened, so idk why or what go on. in any case..
1) friend had wine glass(no alcohol bev) and touched gfs boob. Gf explained it as tho it was a suggestive action.
2) friend stroked gfs leg.
either way why she touching my gf in such a provocative manner. (pls shout at me and tell me if I'm taking this too far lmaao) 

When I brought this up again to gf I asked her abt 1) but she said that never happened, I must've imagined her saying that.  she said 2) happened. Gf said that it's a girl thing, and that it's normal. She also said she won't do it or entertain it. But the problem isn't with her. it's with her friend. I've seen girls stroke eachothers legs, so I can see it being a thing girls do, but it doesn't sit well with me knowing that this friend tried to rub coochies w my gf. It's like if she had a guy friend who liked her and pressed his dick on her and then 3 years later, touching her. 


Any advice would be appreciated. If I'm overreacting, overthinking pls tell me. Also, (p. s. ) I honestly can't help having this weird gut feeling when I'm around her friend, a feeling I can't quite explain. Feel like I see her looking at me in the corner of my eye.

I met my boyfriend online in June last year. I wasn’t instantly attracted but after a few dates, I realised we got on so well and I thought he was quite sexy.

We became a couple and I was very happy. I was swooning all the time, he became so hot to me. I never had butterflies which I also analysed at the time and was worried I should have butterflies

Anyway, 6 months into our relationship, I no longer feel aroused or sexual chemistry when I’m in his presence. I used to always feel a little wet down there and surges like electricity when I thought about sex with him. 

This has caused me to worry that something is wrong with me. Like I’m over analysing and worrying that ‘omg I’ve never found his naked body physically attractive.’ I don’t look at random guys and feel horny and I just don’t really have a libido. However I also am feeling a little depressed lately and this worry I can’t feel attraction anymore is making it worse

I have noticed a pattern where people come to me only to gain emotional support as they try to befriend a particular friend group. I listen to them about how they feel insecure and under-confident, make them feel good about themselves and then they leave. I think I’m really skilled at making people feel good about themselves. I have been told I’m funny and deep too, so I’m a good person to be around. I guess I don’t have a proper friend group though, hence people leave in order to seek acceptance somewhere else. 

I had been to a guy I had a crush on for sometime. Since he used to text me everyday, initiate conversations and flirt, I thought it was going somewhere. We were goofy in a similar way and I used to have a lot of fun with him talking. We hadn’t met, we were supposed to meet since he asked me to. We live in different cities due to college but relatively near. I was excited to see him. 

One day he told me he is seeing someone casually and my heart sank. But he said he doesn’t connect with her as much as he feels connected with me I tried to not to think about it too much. We continued talking everyday. He used to call me and FaceTime me whenever he was doing anything fun. I felt good. Life was nice. 

One night he called me asking for relationship advice and that’s when I started feeling uncomfortable. I thought “why not be a good friend” and helped him out. The was reluctant to take him and he was desperate to get her. It kinda broke my heart to see him getting devalued somewhere else especially since I liked him so much. Nevertheless, after getting rejected a couple of times, he convinced her to be in a relationship with him. He still used to talk to me everyday, now using the word “friend” a lot. Used to send a lot of his solo pictures, asking if he’s looking cute. I started getting tired of validating him. 

Eventually I had to distance myself from him because I was getting uncomfortable. He sensed my change in tone, got pissed and stopped talking to me.

Last night I had a realisation that maybe he was using me all the while because he was scared to be vulnerable in front of this girl and was constantly talking to me so that perhaps he doesn’t get too attached. 

I’m looking for advice but pls don’t ask me to reach out to him as my ego is bruised. I’m heartbroken and would like to know how to not fall into this trap again. Maybe I was used for validation.

So  we went out last Friday, things started getting ugly as we talked and  both said a lot of things. I'm not making this post to make her look  bad, I think what we had was two people frustrated with online dating  taking it out on each other. And I'm not trying to say anybody shouldn't  have their own set of deal breakers. I'm just trying to pick up the  pieces and put my head back together, because she got to me. We weren't a  match, it was obvious, neither wanted to date the other. Here are some  things she said that got to me,

\-  ""I expect someone who has traveled the world."" - She took a trip to  Ireland and France once and acts like Christopher Columbus. I've been  around the US, but have never really had the opportunity to travel to  Europe, though I have the means and interest to do so. So I'm going to  be undesirable because I haven't gotten to Europe yet?

\-  ""I make 140k a year and own a house. I want someone with class"" - Okay,  umm, she doesn't know my salary, but I make a measly 50k a year and now  feel like a loser. She knew of my occupation and living situation  (renter) before we agreed to meet up.

\-  ""I like a guy who can hold a conversation in a noisy bar"" - I planned  for us to go to a usually low-key place to get a drink so we could talk.  But it was unusually packed and the wait time was an hour. So we went  down the street. This place had live music just off our table that was  so loud, the evening consisted of us nearly screaming in eachothers  faces. It was country music, which neither of us like, so we couldn't  really vibe to it anyway. Nonetheless I felt like I controlled the  conversation and she had little to contribute. Though I guess she felt  the same of me.

\- ""I could take a  dig at your looks and how you try to make up for them by driving a  Porsche"" - This was a response to me telling her that she looks much  bigger than her photos. She either used old photos or camera tricks  because she was significantly bigger IRL. I bought my Porsche when I was  with my EX GF so I'm not wasn't trying to compensate for anything  socially. It was a dream car that I earned with hard work and a trophy  to everything I feel like I've accomplished. It's actually worth 2x what  I paid for it today. But now I just feel like a douchebag poser driving  it and want to sell it. Can't even enjoy it now I just want to hide it  in shame.

idk  what to do now. I was already getting burnt out on OLD, but now...idk  what to do. She succeeded in making me feel totally worthless and  valueless. I need to speak to a therapist about all this, but until I  can do that Ill just throw it up on here, and take it down later.

I’ve also had guys pretend they want a relationship - we sleep together and then they say they don’t want anything. It’s soul destroying.

1. Evidence that he's into me so far is:
- 1st date was 5 hours long and he invited me to a weekend getaway at his family's house 2 weeks in advance (but I couldn't go/thought that was too soon)
- I met some of his best friends on our 2nd date (which went for 10 hours and he invited me to stay over but I had to go home)
- Sexual chemistry is great. He was pretty much dry humping me on date 2, wanted to take my clothes off, and said I looked 'radiant' at one point. We made out and cuddled for ages and he was coming up with all these ideas for date 3.
- He keeps saying ""I knew there had to be a catch"" about me as a joke (when I like music he doesn't like for example...)
- I had to initiate contact after the 2nd date the next day (after we got physical - no sex though), but he said 'I'm looking forward to it ' about seeing me soon after he gets back from holiday
- I've initiated the last few text conversations but he always replies within the hour (or mostly immediately) and sometimes with really lengthy replies/and sticks around to chat with me.

2. Signs he's not that into me:
- Hasn't set up concrete plans for date 3 yet or worked out a day to meet with me (despite throwing out options in person - e.g. hiking together, watching a tv series together, paragliding - he had lots of ideas). I'm dying to see him again and can't help but feel deflated that he doesn't want to lock something in quickly.
- I had to ask him for logistics of our 2nd date the day of (he told me to go to his place for a music gig but didn't tell me the address, so I had to check 2hrs before I was supposed to be there). But not sure if he's just a poor planner or assumed I would ask.
- This is the big one that's throwing me: can go 1 or 2 days without texting me (and has left me on read twice at night, without saying 'good night' or acknowledging what I sent him so I've felt kind of ignored mid-conversation at times)
- Didn't text me to see if I got home safely when I drove an hour home from his place at 2am

1.) Im from UK so we have college from age 16-18, then University 18-21. I am currently working, M(21 yo). Couple weeks ago in the shower was when I realised that this girl liked me during college. 


She was a really close friend to me in the first year of college and my best friend had asked her out and got rejected. I had thought  that she was really pretty and I liked her as well (Well call her 'S'), but out of respect of my friend who asked her out and also to respect her becasue i didn't want to ruin our friendship by asking her out. So i decided i will just stay as friends as she had not shown any interest at the time either.


Fast forward a couple months and i am about to ask out this different girl i like (Call her 'D') and my friend group knows i like her. My friend group at the time had around 6 guys and 6 girls including D and S and they knew i was about to ask out D.


So on the way back home that day, i get the bus with some of the girls from my group and they tell me that there is someone in the group that likes me. Looking back now i think it was S but at the time i didn't know as i literally thought she was out of my league. But i ask them who and keep guessing by giving all the girls I know from our group and other classes but they don't tell me. So i get home thinking they told me that because D likes me back and ask her out.


I get REJECTED.


D is still nice about it and we get along fine. Now this is the MOST AGITATING part of the story. 


2.) There is a Halloween house party coming up a couple days after i asked out D. D is not at the party but S (the girl I should have asked out) is.


Before i get to the house me and a friend had a couple pre drinks and are already slightly tipsy. Keep in mind this is the first house party I have been to and first time drinking alochol. I have smoked weed beforehand as well so me and my friend were half way gone by the time we reached the house.


We get to the house and Iam still sad that i got rejected but being drunk on the sofa. S is there as well and were talking and chilling BUT the thing is SHE WAS ON MY LAP THE WHOLE TIME, I MEAN AT LEAST FOR LIKE AN HOUR. There were other seats but she was on my lap and we were talking and jus havin fun. I was 10/10 drunk at the time and i assumed she was at least a bit drunk so i did not make any advances and that was that. We stayed as friends for that year and i think she was annoyed because i didnt read her signs at the party or before. 


Second year of college my friend group kind of jus died off and i didnt really see S that much anymore.


3.)Thinking back now S was the girl that my friends said that had a crush on me and the party is proof right? or am i wrong? 


Truth is we still follow each other on IG and I want to DM her and tell her I had a crush on her those years back and I still do. She had the prettiest eyes and honestly thought she was out of my leauge but i want to take my shot. We went our separate ways after college and haven't talked to eachother in years. How do i not be weird about this cos its been a long time and i also could be wrong that she was the girl that had a crush on me.

A very compressed amount of context since it'd be too long, I'm a teen, still figuring shit out, I feel like I have a double life(irl/online) because of how different I act in the 2 spaces and how extensive and actually developed my online """"life"""" really is. Obviously, my online persona is more me while my irl is more to go through the day, absolutely average with no unique traits, I don't stand out. I've been pretty unpleased with how much I hide myself irl so I've been wanting to change to be more true to myself, which isn't really accepted in my country(VERY conservative &amp; traditional) and here's when the actual rant comes in. People here, even people my age, would NEVER date me

To be clear, the idea of opinionated woman, or a woman who wouldn't give up her world views for a man is very looked down upon, even now my mom still tells me to learn how to cook for my husband, etc. I don't have a physical preference really as long as they're hygienic, but I've always found myself being into feminine men personality wise(because nurturing traits are contributed to feminity and blah blah blah you get it), I want someone that will but equal effort into planning dates, making me feel valued, can validate and talk to me instead of arguing and sulking, someone who wouldn't feel embarrassed of me for being """"weird"""", who would agree with my morals.

 I want flowers too, random gifts for no apparent reasons, I wanna be at their place and just be on their bed while they go on with their day, I wanna paint their nails, put on makeup and dress them up without them thinking it's ""gay"", I wanna spend days going to cool places together. I infact, don't wanna listen to them casually saying slurs, talking about girls' bodies with their friends, yelling and avoiding me while they're gaming, telling me I'm overreacting and invalidating my worries, cancelling our plans for ""the boys"", which believe it or not has been absolutely no guy in my environment. This is where it gets even worse, I don't get along with a lot of people at all, I rarely meet anyone I instantly click with or have good chemistry without forcing myself to adapt, and when I do they're usually toxic as hell cause I have the cod gamer humour except the bigotry, so not a lot of people (/hj). And wether you think my standards are high or not, I don't care, I don't wanna settle for someone I'd have to suppress myself for. 

And YES this is a stupid young person ranting about their baby years even though they're gonna grow up and experience and meet so much more people. Even though relationships rn aren't my #1 priority (it's myself), I feel left behind compared to my friends who have so, so much more options, this is so cliche but I do wanna grow up, not to my mid 20's asap but maybe just 18, even though people say these are my golden years I feel like shit, because of the pandemic has made me been able to do nothing and go nowhere, I feel like it's being wasted just being in my house, go to school sleep and repeat, staying in the line. I wanna be a little more problematic, wanna sneak out to their place, wanna go out late at night together, wanna go to places far away from home just because.

TL;DR: young person whining about being young(and the pandemic)

I'm not sure how to flair this so I'll make it a 2in1 and ask for advice on how to navigate this crave for romantic affection, or how to search out this affection and maybe teenage years in general cause man this sucks.

Evidence that he’s into me so far is:


* 1st date was 5 hours long and he invited me to a weekend getaway at his family’s holiday house (but I couldn’t go).
* met some of his best friends on date 2, which went for 10 hours and he invited me to stay over but I had to go home.
* He was pretty much dry humping me on date 2, wanted to take my clothes off, said I looked ‘radiant’ at one point. We made out and cuddled for ages and he was coming up with heaps of ideas for date 3. 
* he keeps saying “I knew there had to be a catch” about me jokingly when I like something he doesn’t like 
* although I had to initiate contact after date 2, he said ‘I’m looking forward to it’ about seeing me soon after he gets back from holiday.
* I’ve initiated the last few text conversations but he always replies super quickly and sometimes he’ll stick around and chat with me or send me songs 

Signs he’s not that into me:


* hasn’t set up plans for date 3 despite throwing out options in person. I’m dying to see him again and can’t help but feel deflated that he doesn’t want to lock something in quickly.
* I had to ask him for logistics of our 2nd date the day of (he told me to park at his place before a music gig but I had to ask for the address 2hrs before I was supposed to be there…although I figure maybe he’s bad at planning stuff? He’d bought the tickets though)
* he can go 1 or 2 days without texting me and has left me on read twice at night now, without saying good night or acknowledging my message which has made me feel ignored mid-conversation.
* didn’t text me to see if I got home safely when I drove an hour home from his place at 2am

Fast forward to about a week ago, T texts her that he would like to see her 1 on 1 to talk about what happened and she's eager to do so and also told me she would like to get the friendship back.

Am I wrong in being totally uncomfortable with this? the fact she's completely transparent makes me trust her when she says she doesn't want anything to do with him other than a friendship. However when I expressed my feelings to her she shut them down and while she acknowledged it's not fair to me she also said she already decided she's seeing him. Any advices?

For some context beforehand, I haven't gone on dates in 3 years and I haven't had a serious girlfriend before. I've gone on casual dates a few times per girl in high school mostly and went on a date with a girl who had a crush on me from work a year back. I wasn't really feeling her and it didn't go anywhere. That's all my experience. 

With that being said, I was wondering if it's possible to not have a type in women or have specific preferences for them? I feel like 90% of women my age I see in public or if I'm on Tinder, I usually find them attractive or cute at least. Sometimes my friends will ask me if I crush on anyone or if there's anything specific I want in a girl if I get back into dating. And I honestly don't know??? Like hair color doesn't bother me. I love brunettes, blond hair, dark hair, dyed hair. The color is usually fine regardless. I like most body types whether it's more petite, average, thicker, etc. Clothing is also not really a factor although some fashion appeals to me more than others. I hope all that gives an idea. Any aspect that people usually point to in attraction, I don't have like a preference or something I specifically seek out. Does personality traits count? Is part of this because I've been out of the dating world so long and I haven't had enough dating experience? 

Does this make me aromantic? or something like that? I have a high sex drive and I can find girls sexually attractive. Like sexually, I don't think that's an issue?

Time is moving so fast, and ideally i would like to snag myself a catch before these eggs of mine begin to shrivel. Now the question is where is he? I have travelled across the world and between states, and i am currently planning a trip to the Virgin Islands. Is he there? Para venture, he was actually reading this right now and thinking to himself, ""what is this person on?"" To answer that, I am on nothing. I am usually on a natural high. I think any drug would send me over the edge. Also, i am a lover and want to be loved. I want to hold hands while we drive, want to try your food first even though mine is right in front of me. I want to dress up and look pretty in your arms. I want you to be a tall handsome devil so we can complement each other, me with my femininity and you all masculine.

I recently graduated and have been working fulltime for 8months. She is an international grad student studying law. I used to live in her home city when I was young. Currenty both in Washington dc 

Background: Dated 5-6 times in the span of 2 months. The date themselves seemed to always be fun for both of us. We did things such as movie, several dinners and coffees, iceskating. She seems to be a relatively reserved/conversative/vanilla girl

Why I felt the need to confess/express my feelings: I really couldn't tell how she felt about me. Positives: Like I said the dates themselves went well and I can tell we are gradually opening up more towards each other. Negatives: She never reached out to me via text proactively; She sometimes reject my invitation for dates, about half of the time, saying she is busy, but not proactively rescheduling . 

What happened when I expressed my feelings: I asked if we can take the relationship to the next step. She said the dates with me are always fun, and said she thinks I am a super nice guy. but she feels like she doesn't know me enough yet or think we have a lot of common interests. I then asked her respectfully why is it that she kept on agreeing to my dates. I wanted to see if she put me in the friendzone or not. She said she wanted to see how far we can go, restating the dates are fun but didn't feel like we can be couples as of now. 

I told her that I actually agree with her point. I mean one of us is working while the other is in school. It felt hard to connect organically outside of our dates. So I offered her to continue our dates cuz I felt like she wasn't friendzoneing me. She very much agreed instantly (didn't seem like she didn't want to).

**Question 1 for the community: how do yall feel about this seems like her interest towards me is just not 100% yet. Can this be improved moving forward?**

Things I feel like I can work on: increase my texting frequency. I rarely texted her between dates because I don't want to come off as annoying. and tbh I don't know what to text her. My previous relationships were all in college. It was much easier to find conversation opener. My friends said I need to increase texting because I am not showing enough interests on my side and texting is the only other way to close the gap between us two. I tried to test the water recently, just having random conversations. Her reactions has been positive overall.

Another point is that I feel like I was not bold enough to be more physically intimate. I held her hands during iceskating and she seemed to like it. It felt very normal to make this move during the moment but outside of that I was not bold enough to make any other move. 

**Question 2 for the community: what is ya'll's recommendation on texting more and trying to be physically more intimate？Any other good strategy to improve my odds moving forward?**

Fast forward few weeks ago we decided to meet since he visited my city. I couldn't get over the fact that I'm going to meet this guy! The one that lives rent free in my head! Before meeting up, I sorta know that he's a nice guy and also looks pretty cute on the photos.

The day came and we met for the first time. It was kinda disappointing. He was not tall as what my ""idealized"" version of him thought &amp; photos. He has a nice but different personality to the ones I expect him to be, nevertheless, our conversation flows smoothly. My feelings went from 100/100 to 40/100 when I actually meet him. I realized that I want the version of him that I made up myself in my head than who he's actually is.

Since we live in different cities and are both quite busy with college, we planned to meet again 3-4 months from now. The problem is, I kept on falling in love with the idea of him all over again while not meeting him.

It only lasted 7 months because my younger stupid self was too filled up with hormones and I broke her off because of the silliest thing ever. Puberty, right guys?

Few relationships passed by, most of them lasted only a little longer than half a year. With the few girls I wasn't by any means a good fit and I stuck around too long in those relationships. I broke off the last relationship with my ex (F30) on Sunday. It was all very mature and respectful, it was kind of easy for both sides, so no problem. 

During this last relationship I got a text from my beautiful ex girl friend that she is in a rough situation right now because her 4 year long relationship ended in the worst way you can imagine. I agreed to meet her in a bar and I was kind of curious how she is like now. Turns out: The whole 8 years she tried to become a police officer and trained very hard, you can imagine that I was stunned seeing her after this very very long time. Like a solid 8,5/10 with 10 being Mila Kunis league.
It wasn't just the looks, talking to her felt exactly the same as 8 years ago. Immediately there were sparks (again), more like a lightning. Three days ago I told her that my girlfriend and me will break up soon.  However, believe me when I say that the timing was just perfect and the breakup and her texting me are not connected!

He initially said that he was looking for sex obviously and I said buy me dinner first thinking he would say no but he didn’t. We ended up planning to meet up and getting coffee but I never really followed through. Then we decided we would go out for Valentine’s Day. We ended up going out two days later and it was a great first date, even the waiter made a comment and thought we were already together and that this was the 5th date because of the chemistry. We had dinner then went back to my place and just watched New Girl and ended up making out. 

Beginning with our first date every time I would walk him to my front door he would kiss me before leaving it became a consistent thing. A few days later we ended up partying together and he spent the night and my complex towed his car and he didn’t really get angry with me and it didn’t make him not want to see me anymore but i thought it would (granted I was in an abusive relationship before) after that night we started to see each other at least twice a week, trying new things, new food, getting to know each other and obviously hooking up but it didn’t feel like the main thing. 

I started to really like him but keeping in mind what he initially wanted I tried to ignore how I felt. I really enjoyed his company and he enjoyed mine. He would invite me to places to be his plus one (I would joke and say I was his arm candy) and it started to feel like it was more than just friends with benefits. He told me he didn’t have a great dating history and that the majority of the women he had been with before were manipulative in many ways including sexually so it made him not want to be in any serious relationships. He’s started to open up to me about his family, what he wants to do after college, etc. he told me he trusts me and whenever I’m with him it just feels like it’s us. Im not sure what to think could this develop into something more?

I have a hard time putting it into words, but my ideal relationship would be a girl who loves chilling and listening to music and watching family guy and going for late night cruises and just talking. All that grown-up career stuff, and brunching with friends and whatnot is really not for me. 

My goals in life is simply to chill and get as many laugs in before I die as I can, whereas the girls I usually talk to usually wants more in life.

Now, because I have a hard time putting it into words, I made this word document with links to videos where I really like the aura of the girls in them (I know it's creepy, but I like to do it because it gives me hope by reminding me, that those type of girls exist)

Beginning with our first date every time I would walk him to my front door he would kiss me before leaving it became a consistent thing. We started to get to know each other more and hangout a lot and his car got towed at my complex and he continued to see me.

He told me he didn’t have a great dating history and that the majority of the women he had been with before were manipulative in many ways including sexually so it made him not want to be in any serious relationships. He’s started to open up to me about his family, what he wants to do after college, etc. he told me he trusts me and whenever I’m with him it just feels like it’s us.

I had protected vaginal intercourse but also unprotected anal intercourse with someone new. I asked him if he gets tested regularly, and he said yes. I noticed other used condoms in his trash that weren’t ours, which is a good sign. At first he went to have unprotected vaginal sex with me, but when I said I wasn’t on birth control he put on a condom with no arguments.

I’m just dealing with some post-unprotected-sex anxiety. I know it already happened, and I know I willingly took a risk. It’s just that my mom has HIV, and I do have a fear of getting that. 

This guy seems fit and active and like he might get around, but he said he hadn’t had anal sex in like a year, so I’m assuming that means he’s not having unprotected sex with just anyone. 

I guess all I can do is wait until the proper window to get tested. Most likely I’ll be fine, but I’m just looking for some reassurance without asking him.

I have come in contact by reaching out to women when they seem interested or by dating apps. The same thing happens every time.

Tired of playing the game, and I’ll elaborate.

I try to be as conscious and aware of myself as possible at all times. I understand that in western society, my composition on paper is not the most desirable - I’m not very tall, and I’m a minority (half Asian and half white). I shouldn’t really have to break down how this has affected my dating life. But, know that it has. So I have to be more creative, witty, funny, present, and ‘valuable’ than the next fella.

Of course, this is anecdotal, but I’ve noticed the highest success rate in a woman’s attraction to me is how I play the game. What I mean by this is communicating through hierarchy. 

I’ll break it down:

What I want to do - connect and be present. Empower and lift up my person of choice. Instill in them that they are valuable, they are beautiful, they are worthy of love, care and affection. Communicate my appreciation for them. Communicate my attraction to them. This transference of affection usually leaves me in the dust.

What seems to work - putting myself above my person of choice and non-verbally communicating to them that I’m of higher value than them, and I’m the one to be sought after. This includes little psychological games like deliberately not responding to messages, not answering questions, not devoting my undivided attention, not complimenting or praising. Hiding my feelings &amp; emotions. Making myself unavailable, or appearing to be. This seems to keep my person of choice on the hook and interested in engaging or continuing conversation. Because I appear to be ‘high value’, something that they have to work for. 

I believe I’m jaded and scarred from my past relationships with women, or maybe a childhood event. Maybe I attract the wrong people because of my personality. But I’m really tired of this. I want to communicate and exist in the moment. I hate having to hide things and communicate strategically.

If it’s not a self fulfilling prophecy then I believe it works because even if it’s not true, since I may be seen as a ‘less than desirable’ male, I have to accentuate my ‘value’ in one way or another. This means making my person of choice ‘earn’ my affection through trials and tribulations. I can’t tell you how many times I wanted to forgive someone, express appreciation to them, express a deep level of interest in them, but I ignore them or express my disapproval or annoyance with them. And they come back for more, with an energetic motivation to gain my approval. 

Maybe this is all common sense to the rest of humanity and I’m just super late. I’m probably just fucked in the head though.

TLDR - I wish I could be transparent with my feelings instead of having to play games with the women I like.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163731,public,self,Tired of playing the game,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tewxor/tired_of_playing_the_game/,no_ads,0,,,,,

in short: I was on a first date with a girl, she wanted to make out, I didn't catch the hin, until I was home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I asked her to meet again, she told me we could if \*I\* would want to see her again.Of course I want to she might not be the most attractive person ever but she most definitely makes up for it with her character. I don't see how she could think I don't like her at all just because we didn't immediately did something on the first date? So we did text a bit about it, but she wasn't very specific on what she wanted. I then asked her if she would like to call, wich she didn't respond to at all. That was yesterday night, today she texted me early to wish me good morning and ask me how I had slept. So we had some small talk in the morning, but not for too long since we both have to work all day. She later asked me how my day was, we talked some more and I asked her again about a second date. She was like ""I have a lot to do, are you free in two weeks?"" I have some experience with these two weeks, there will be something else then and it will never stop.

My heart feels empty.


My boyfriend just dumped me last night. 

Backstory we dated last year but he told me he didn’t have time for me. 

This year he reached out for a second chance and I did. I made sure he had time for me this time. He did in the beginning. 
I noticed he started not to have plans for us.  At first he blamed his ex’s, for not having the daughter which was true. And he was scared she would get mad if he had plans ( they haven’t been together for two years, she cheated the whole time) (every time I asked if he had feelings for her, he would deny it ) He would only ask me out if I made a comment that I was bored and had nothing to do. Sometimes I felt that he felt obligated to take me out. 

He’s going through the custody stuff but the mother has custody of her child but she still likes to live her own life so he has the child most of the time 

He called me last night tell me the relationship felt one sided. Meaning I was putting in the work and he felt bad. He said he had his daughter and still wanted to do other activities and then said he felt bad he still wasn’t making time for me. 

I told him let’s call it off.
I wasn’t gonna beg him anymore to spend time with me.

This week, we have been playing some video games online together.

What I have noticed so far is that we both have sort of acknowledged the fact that we don't want an obsessive dynamic. We have basically hinted at a FWB type of dynamic. We don't text at all, unless we want to make plans. Here is the interesting part: when we do hang out, we go out and make out, hold hands sometimes and do lots of activities together. Sometimes, I find myself being overly affectionate, which is something I'm trying to work on.

I'm just going with the flow at this point. I'm not sure exactly what her expectations are, and I'm absolutely not expecting anything. I don't mind a meaningful companionship. Doesn't really have to be a relationship, but I'm kind of enjoying this recent development. On Friday, we are hitting another live show.

I was banned from seeing her over 3 years ago. 

I still think about her and considered her the love of my life (thought about having a future with her)


To clarify: We never were a couple, and remained friends throughout our childhood, teenage years, and into young adulthood.

I was always so nervous about my feelings.
Over the years, we would look at each other for prolonged periods of time, smile. There wasn’t much in terms of actual conversation but there was what I would call “enhanced empathy”. 

She would come over to me and ask if I was ok. She would sit by my side. It felt like we were more than friends even though we weren’t a couple. 


I just want to know if my suspicions are true.
Much later our dynamic faded, and as I was about to leave town for college, I felt desperate to get back what I found as the only empathy and extreme care I felt in my life. I felt so safe with her and I wanted it back.


It didn’t end well, and some of that is my fault. I also blamed her and her family for hiding their wealth, and not accepting me. But I admit I have acted emotionally before.

TLDR: based on the limited info I have, was it more than friends? Did she ever feel strongly in anyway for me? Or was she the cold hearted manipulator that I convinced myself she was after she left my life… you decide.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163727,public,self,I have questions that need answering,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/teyng9/i_have_questions_that_need_answering/,no_ads,0,,,,,

1. Employees have many options, but not all are equally good. Same is for women.
