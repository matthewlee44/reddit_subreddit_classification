0,qd6npp,1634867440,Should I talk to this guy in person or on Hinge?,I play in an Ultimate Frisbee league and there’s a guy on my team that I talked to a bit during the first game. He’s cute and seems nice after talking with him. I downloaded Hinge and his profile has popped up a few times. I close the app every time he pops up because I don’t want to swipe left or try to match up with him while the season is going on. Season is only a few more weeks and we only have it on Tuesdays so not a lot of time to actually get to know him or flirt. Question is…should I shoot my shot in person after the last game or try to match up on Hinge after the season? I just don’t want things to be awkward if he rejects me.

1,qd6osf,1634867550,How to keep a man on his toes when dating you?,"hi! I need some advice please! whenever I start dating a guy they are always so sweet and want to impress me! Then I become too nice, then they loose interest. I over empathize.  For example, let’s say I’m dating a guy and he always holds the door for me and one day I’m like babe I got it! And since then they’ll stop holding the door ( just an example)Or if he wants to go one place and I want to go another I’ll go to where he wants cause I feel mean. soon they’ll take advantage of me when really I’m just a nice girl…. I’m very broken hearted because of my ex. And it makes me want to be very mean and cold. I want my future man to basically cater for me. This is what I want. But I want to be submissive to him too here and there cause I love it but I don’t want this to happen again. I want to be spoiled while I spoil back. Any advise?

She left me on read. I sent a follow up shortly later and asked her to hang out this weekend. She hasn’t really explored the city we live in, and I offered to take her out and show her around. She read that and didn’t respond.

After traveling, working 8 internships during school and 3 jobs since graduation - I've kind of decided to try and just experience what's it like actually dating someone.

15,qd7o14,1634870937,asking a girl out a 2nd time,"context: met a girl @ college, we talked for a bit, got her number and then I mentioned plans to hang out and she said she'd be up for whatever.

That same day, I texted her, she texted back, texted her again 2 more times back and forth (mainly inside jokes and just stuff about my life). 

The day after (Thursday night) I asked her how were weekend plans looking and we should get coffee, she texted she was actually headed back home for the weekend to see her family so she wouldn't be in town. I wrote back no problem. 

---

So at this point I'm at a crossroad. Note: I'm well aware regardless of circumstance after asking a girl out twice it's pretty much over unless she makes a move.
 
I plan to send her a funny/picutre text on Wednesday or Thursday, and then ask her out again. My main issue is that next weekend is Halloween, and I do not have any plans. She does not know that, but isn't it weird to ask someone out on the Saturday or Sunday for Halloween (in the US, Halloween is a Sunday night, but Saturday could be for parties as well)??? 

In that case, I would think it's better to wait 2 weeks from now to do the above (not Halloween weekend), or see the chances of randomly bumping into her around campus.

What do people think? I guess my main question is the best process of asking a girl out a 2nd time and whether the Halloween timing is poor. 

So far she's written back to all my texts so I take it as a good sign so far, but obviously knowing if I'm just texting to meet up all the time it becomes NEEDY so I plan to stop if the 2nd time doesn't work (aka ""I have plans for Halloween).

I know I'm overthinking it, but rather that than not take the best course of action.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd7o14/asking_a_girl_out_a_2nd_time/

I'm just feeling really lost an vulnerable, which on one hand makes me want to have someone significant I can lean on, but also is terrified that I'll lose myself(or the little ik about myself) in a relationship, completely imprinting on the first girl to make me feel special.

I was basically friendzoned. I would ask her to hangout &amp; she would agree but would always flake. I kept count, She flaked a total of 7 times. We actually only hung out 3 times. 2 of those times is because she wanted to. Whenever I wanted to hangout I would text to confirm. she would wait days, hours &amp; replay back with an excuse as to why she couldn’t make it. One time she even took 2 in a half days to respond. Something always came up. She’s a single mom by the way. I would see her hang with out ppl but with me something always “came up”. Whenever I would distance myself she would randomly hit me up saying “hey” etc. I noticed whenever she didn’t like a guy she would talk to me &amp; want to hangout. But when a guy came along she liked. She would ghost me &amp; we would go days &amp; sometimes weeks &amp; not speak. She would only speak to me again whenever her &amp; the guy she liked didn’t workout. Months later she asked to hang, I agreed. The day of she said she couldn’t make it. So I confronted her &amp; told her I feel like she’s taken advantage of me. And doesn’t respect me. We talk it out she invites me over &amp; cooks for me.

25,qd8e4e,1634873616,I am done trying to find love,"For me, it is just impossible. It really feels like I am not meant to be with anyone. Love is the hardest thing ever to find. I thought college was the most difficult thing I had to go through, but it is literally nothing compared to finding love. By love, I mean requited love. I guess for guys like me (or maybe just for me) love is not something that we were born to get. I guess I should just learn to be happy doing other stuff and forget about the pursuit of love. The pursuit itself sucks and everything about trying to find the right person sucks. Using dating apps sucks. Getting rejected sucks. Comparing myself to other guys that are doing better than me in dating sucks the most. Watching all those Adonis guys with hot gfs sucks to me because I could never compete with these guys. Also, not to sound like I am talking shit about women or anything, but usually, when I see couples, I always find the guys more attractive than the girls.  That just makes me wonder if one needs to be more attractive than the girl that one is dating. Again, that is just an observation from the people that I've seen on the street which is like less than 0.001% of the population, so I am not generalizing, just drawing conclusions out of my little bubble of experience. Putting that aside though, I am honestly just dropping the towel. I have been stressed out about not being able to find a girl to love for years and years. I have honestly become more jaded and jaded to the point that I just care a little bit. I just care enough to vent about it here. I mean if I have not found the right person at 27, why would I find her any later? After college, meeting people has become an impossible task for me. I only meet people 50+ at meet-up groups, and there are not many things that interest me around my area. Urgh, I wish finding a gf was easier, but c'est la vie.

I’m in the military, have been for a few years now and she just joined the Navy and is about to finish bootcamp. I’m not feeling confident in my future with this woman. She had had a history of being a tag chaser (only dated military guys) she’s had a history of talking to and fucking multiple guys around the same time, and just got done being a big partier. She’s calmed down a lot, but in our relationship I’ve had to tell her many times I feel uncomfortable when she’s had long conversations while I’m gone at work with other military guys, sometimes answering their calls and facetimes. I just found out late last year she agreed to meeting up with two guys that were flirting with her constantly, both are military, and one wanted to take her out to go drink. She agreed, while in a relationship with me. Her reason behind it was she was just being “nice” and since then stopped and “putting people in their place because you didn’t like it”. Also talking to guys flirting with her while I’m asleep past midnight, not flirting back but messaging back and forth with them. Just not cool in my books even if she didn’t explicitly say anything bad in the messages. So she’s going to be away at her navy schooling in Texas for half a year once she’s done with bootcamp and I’m just worried she’s going to lose it without me being there to give her attention and the long distance is going to get to her and she’s going to fall for another dude. She’s told me she’s scared she’s like her mom in the sense that she always has had the need to have a boyfriend around with her, and with us being in two different states and her with a possible military fetish surrounded by army and navy dudes away from me all horny and lonely in the barracks with a million dudes hitting on her cause they don’t care she has a ring on her finger, I’m worried she will cave.

Idk, I dated this guy fivish years ago now and tbh he wasn’t conventionally attractive but in my eyes he was my everything, maybe it was cause I loved him or maybe it’s jus my type. We had a really bad relationship tho that was centered on sex and a terrible breakup and ever since then I’ve only tried to pursue anyone that doesn’t look like him at all. Yea I’m probs prejudice but I’m jus scared that someone who looks like him will hurt me again. Either way, I haven’t found anyone attractive since him. I can recognize that someone is conventionally attractive and maybe think they’re hot but then I start to talk to them and lose all attraction. And it’s not always cause they have a bad personality, sometimes they’re really nice !! I jus get so bored and break it off after a week or less.
I also def “had fun” in hs and early college and ever since then sex has been really hard for me. Bad things have happened in my past and depending on my mood or the vibe if I’m w someone and finish I will start to sob or feel incredibly numb afterwards. If I’m lucky and that doesn’t happen, during the sex I get incredibly bored and I jus head home thinking I wasted my time.
I don’t even think I’m interested in relationships right now. Maybe it’s because I don’t find anyone attractive or someone I’m willing to stick around with, but I’m perfectly fine and comfortable typically just working, spending time alone doing any hobbies I have or spending time w family and friends. It’s just the past few days it’s been on my mind. I’m in my early 20s so I def have time to process and eventually probs meet someone that I love so I’m not worried but sometimes I still think about it yanno cause i don’t know anyone else who feels the same except my sisters tbh.

I did mention at the start of our connection that I am scared to go into a relationship right now because I don’t think I’m ready. He kept saying he understands and he won’t force me to go into one. 

Recently, we had a rather “deep talk” and I told him that I actually do like him more than a friend. He was happy to hear that but he didn’t ask me out or anything, so I assumed he was just honouring my stance earlier. After that “confession”, I noticed that he has been very cold and will only reply after a day.
Oddly, most of his texts are now very intimate (“want to kiss you now”, “I want to cuddle you” etc). Reading these texts confuses me even more because we never made our relationship official (I’ve tried talking to him about it but he would either ignore or he’ll push the question back to me).

Why does he do this and what is the best way forward here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd94r8/been_talking_to_this_guy_for_6_months/

I’ve seen a lot of women on here talk about wanting a more assertive man. Could I’ve been too persistent, too assertive with how I feel?

When we first met, she thought I didn’t like her - I was aloof; her friend told me to chase her. Now that I am, I’m getting the feeling she feels pressured. I know dating is being open to risk and getting hurt, but unrequited affection is also what made me cold and avoid dating to begin with. When I was just worrying about me, I didn’t feel bad like this. I slept easier.

I plan on making my trip, but visiting friends instead. Im thinking I’ll let her do the reaching out and if she doesn’t…that’s my answer. Is that too far the other way though? Should I remain resolute or aloof? Am I not being assertive in my own desires, or just a burden?

38,qd9h7b,1634877821,process of asking girl out on a 2nd date,"context: met a girl @ college, we talked for a bit, got her number and then I mentioned plans to hang out and she said she'd be up for whatever.

That same day, I texted her, she texted back, texted her again 2 more times back and forth (mainly inside jokes and just stuff about my life).

The day after (Thursday night) I asked her how were weekend plans looking and we should get coffee, she texted she was actually headed back home for the weekend to see her family so she wouldn't be in town. I wrote back no problem.

So at this point I'm at a crossroad. Note: I'm well aware regardless of circumstance after asking a girl out twice it's pretty much over unless she makes a move.

I plan to send her a funny/picutre text on Wednesday or Thursday, and then ask her out again. My main issue is that next weekend is Halloween, and I do not have any plans. She does not know that, but isn't it weird to ask someone out on the Saturday or Sunday for Halloween (in the US, Halloween is a Sunday night, but Saturday could be for parties as well)???

In that case, I would think it's better to wait 2 weeks from now to do the above (not Halloween weekend), or see the chances of randomly bumping into her around campus.

What do people think? I guess my main question is the best process of asking a girl out a 2nd time and whether the Halloween timing is poor.

So far she's written back to all my texts so I take it as a good sign so far, but obviously knowing if I'm just texting to meet up all the time it becomes NEEDY so I plan to stop if the 2nd time doesn't work (aka ""I have plans for Halloween).

I know I'm overthinking it, but rather that than not take the best course of action.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd9h7b/process_of_asking_girl_out_on_a_2nd_date/
39,qd9j8b,1634878057,Is the beated up platitude of the endless “improving yourself” worth pursuing?,"It many times feels like the process of bettering oneself is an endless uphill climb that one follows to reach a place that no one knows if it will ever be enough. Like when do you know that you are attractive enough or successful enough for someone? It feels to me like how in the Bible the Jews had to roam for a gazillion years to get their “promised” land to then get kicked out again to then keep looking for it, until thousands of years passed and they got a land that is in constant harrassment and they themselves also harrass others. Dating is like that. One needs to be on the bettering oneself edge 24/7 because there is always someone better than you that you need to compete against. Honestly, just the thought of being a slave of this endless process sounds exhausting. I am so exhausted after work. Using all my free time on the gymclinging to the hope that some one someday someday will find me attractive doesn't seem to motivate me as much anymore.

44,qd9two,1634879274,Take the hints.,"This is as much as a PSA as it is me reflecting on my mistakes.

The back story: I move to a new state in 2020 to start my first job. I knew nobody there, didn’t have a car there and the state borders closed as soon as I arrived meaning there was no way I could visit back home or have friends come to visit me. All the friends I met while there are work related and not the type you’d want to hang out with outside of work hours. I was also living by myself so, as you’d expect, one gets lonely very quick. I had done photography as a side job years ago, photographing models who were looking to build their portfolio. So with the aim of meeting new people outside of work, I thought I’d reach out to models in the new city I moved to, show them my portfolio, and see if they were interested in collaborating. It was a small city so there weren’t many models to reach out to. After contacting a dozen or so models I found on Instagram, nobody replied. Just as I’m about to give up, my phone buzzes and I see a reply from one of the girls I contacted. Turned out wasn’t a ‘model’ per se, but just someone who had dabbled in a photoshoot or 2. From the start, she was very talkative and wanted to know a lot about me…this itself may have been the first hint as models aren’t talkative at all prior to a shoot with a photographer they haven’t met before. I tell her about my job, hobbies and interests and can tell she’s impressed. She’s busy with uni exams for the next month and says we can only meet after that. I couldn’t really escalate it any further at this stage so I let it go and didn’t contact her until after her exams were over – whether this was a good or bad thing is debatable, but probably doesn’t matter in the big picture given the events that eventuated after we met in person.

After a month, we finally meet for the photo-shoot. My initial impressions of her were ordinary with small talk and formalities common with all the other models I’d met, but as the shoot progressed, more and more hints begun to appear. When directing her how to stand, the moment I put my arms on her shoulder, her eyes lit up and she couldn’t conceal her smile. I’ve never had that happen with a model before, although I didn’t think much of it at the time. As we walk around the gardens we were photographing at, she keeps talking and asking all sorts of questions about me, with some that could be construed as personal in nature. “Where are you from?”, “guess where I’m from!”, “what music do you like?”, “what’s your favorite dish?”, “what area do you live in?” (FYI these questions weren’t asked out of the blue but emerged given the context of what we were talking about earlier). As the sun sets, she gets a call from her parents asking her to come back as they were waiting to pick her up. I try rush to finish up the shoot to not keep them waiting, but she’s unfazed by their nagging and tells me to keep going with the shoot (another hint that she liked us spending time together perhaps?). At the end of the shoot, she tries to take a selfie with me but I scold her for it and yank her hand away, as I’m not a person who likes my photo being taken let alone plastered on social media. She’s not offended but laughs and makes a comment saying I’m like “the Banksy of Instagram”.

After I send her back the photos of her from the shoot, she loves them and tells me she’s shown them to her mum and her mum loves it too. The day after that, she sets her Facebook profile picture to one of the photos I took, tagging me in it and writing thank you with love heart emojis in the description. Hints fucking galore. But silly me just notes this down as a kind gesture and moves on.

Every day for the next three weeks we message each other about random shit - books we’re reading, movies we’re watching, banter about celebrities, linking each other articles on random topics (like sneezing), etc. One day I posted a story on IG with a photo of a burger at a well known burger joint, to which she replies “this burger joint is the bomb!”. Stupid me replies with a review of the burger I just ate, not taking the hint and asking her out to grab burgers together.

Guys… if a girl says that burger joint is good, it’s not because she’s a connoisseur of burgers. Take the fucking hint. She probably wants to go out with you.

The week after, she sends me some videos of a park she’s at during the middle of the day, saying it’s a nice park. I say “cool, I’ll have to check it out sometime” and leave it at that.

Looking back at it all, I can’t forgive myself at how naive I was. I missed opportunity after opportunity, her hints flying over my head. At the center of it all, was my crippling sense of self-doubt and lack of confidence. I was aware of this though, and made it a point to work on myself physically and mentally before asking her out. The day that I was finally ready to ask her out, you may ask? That day never came.

Months later she tells me she’s moving overseas to Spain. I tell her we should meet for one more photo-shoot before she leaves. This photo-shoot ends up being very different to our first one. She keeps talking about herself and her future plans, not asking a single question about me. The nail in the coffin is when she calls me “bro” and thus friend-zones me. At the end of the shoot, I buy her food (rookie mistake) and tell her I’m going to miss her. She just laughs it off and doesn’t reply in any way. That day was one of the saddest days of my life. It was like all your missed opportunities staring you in the face and giving you the middle finger.

I tried to forget about her after she left but this proved to be very hard. We were still on good terms at the time, and in her eyes, nothing bad had happened between us. So it wasn’t like I could block her on social media sites and forget she exists. Once in Spain, she no longer messages me like she used to. She didn’t post any of the photos I took of her in the shoot we did before she left. Yet, something inside me made me want to work harder on myself and meet her in Spain one day where I could tell her unequivocally that I loved her.

This goal was short lived, as a month later she started a podcast on Spotify about her dating adventures in Spain, talking about all the guys she’d met on Tinder. This drove me mad and I deleted her off all social media platforms. She still found a way to message me and asked me what was wrong, which is when I spilled out all my feelings for her. It was no use. She didn’t even address my feelings but lectured me on how I overreacted to her podcast by blocking her on everything and how she now thinks I’m impulsive. Ended with her wishing me the “best of luck” and not talking to me ever since. What could have been a love story between us ended up a disaster with me looking like the ultimate loser. It’s been a year since our last interaction and now (yes, only now) is it dawning on me the mistakes I made. They haunt me in my sleep, and I can’t stop thinking about them when I'm awake, even though I no longer have any feelings for her. My one and only wish is that I, nor anybody else, should ever make the same mistakes again.

Moral of the story: take your chances when you can guys. Take the hints. Hell, take the very first hint and do something with it. That may be your one and only chance.

Working on yourself is important, having high standards is important, but you don’t have to be the gold standard in order to ask a girl out. Having a relationship isn’t the end goal, but rather a steppingstone to becoming a better version of yourself. I just wish someone had told me this earlier. Thankfully this subreddit has provided me a wealth or knowledge and realizations that I've reflected upon thoroughly and will take with me with any future interactions I have.

Tldr; I moved to a new city in 2020, met this girl through my side job (photography), I liked her and she liked me (I think) but none of us say anything about it explicitly. She drops endless hints but I’m too stupid and naive to take them. If only I’d done something about it, my life would be very different today.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd9two/take_the_hints/

49,qda4ac,1634880552,Dating Men in Denver Colorado 👉🗑,"So I've heard the stories of Dating Men in Colorado and how they put no effort in to woman and dating. I had to experience it for myself for when I arrived to the city a few weeks ago. 

I used Tinder to meet locals in the area and matched with one guy he acted interested but wanted me to do all the initiating and communication. Also he wanted us to go on a date, but mentioned he is always ghosted when planning one. However I assured him that I wouldnt do such a thing after we set up a date and time. Well the day came for us to meet and he delayed in response then was like are we still meeting up??? I'm like we'll yeah I told him I was almost ready and he was like oh give me some time ima not ready yet like ..WTF! Anyways I head over to the place/ restaurant and wait for him there while I do some work on my laptop to kill time. This guy shows up 30mins later 😆 and said hey I'm sorry I though you were going to bail on me because I'm used to getting ghosted. I told him you shouldn't treat everyone the same and make others pay for others mistakes, because you might miss a good CATCH!  Anyways the rest of the date went well but the first impression was careless and low effort in an unorganized manner. Now I see why he was ghosted because he put low effort in even after the Date still low communication effort. Like bruh im not here to do all the talking!

Also right after that date a few days later I spoke online with another guy. He acted and seemed so sweet from the begining called me beautiful and everything blah blah blah..until I burst his bubble of how I enjoy a simple life and more of a minimalist, because I do not like to waste money on unessasary things. Him on the other hand did not like that commment, because he is an extreme high achiever, materialistic and likes to make alot of money. Apparently he had ran a buissnes with his family who he inherited it from and was an enterprenure. He also had two houses that he bragged about I honestly don't care about what material things men have , but I let him rant about it and his buissnes. That is why I brought up the topic to see how he would react. Anyways he bashed me and told me I have a low way of thinking and that that is how you stay poor from just talking to me for 2 days. He then proceeded by calling me names and said I was a worthless peice of sh** and that I should not even exist. It seemed like he had some narcissistic qualities. He's proceeded calling me a dog and sent me a picture of his dick telling me to come kiss it. Unbelievabe!

Sometimes I am not sure what goes on in guys minds like being an arrogant ASSHOLE is NOT attractive dumb weak woman fall for that nonsense! I am not here to boost your EGO. But this was just an experiment to see what the dating scene was like in the Denver area. Apparently most these men out here are trash.

This is the very reason I choose to be single. But I know there are a few good ones out there. Sometimes I feel like going full blown lesbian 😂.

59,qdajuo,1634882525,Is she actually interested? Should I persist? Am I a dumb-ass misreading cues?,"I'm a clueless dude, and I'm pretty sure that I at least have some sort of chance with her. At multiple events so far where we've both been, I've seen her looking at me multiple times, and holding the eye contact when I caught her looking. During a class presentation I was doing regarding personal strengths, she asked me a question that went along the lines of, ""Our strengths seem to line up pretty well, is that something you'd want in a study partner?"" A week or two later, after the event where we kept holding eye contact from across the room, we were chatting and found many similarities, which she seemed to find interesting. Two days later, after a class where she kept glancing across the room in my direction, we randomly met at the on-campus restaurant place, and after I initiated the conversation with her while she was in line, she came over and sat down at a table right next to mine and my friend's, and shifted the conversation to a more interesting topic than the one I chose. She turned 90 degrees to face me in the chair and scooted a small bit closer to me, and through most of the course of our conversation, which she seemed to want to try and keep going for much longer, almost all of her attention was focused on me, and she paid very little attention to the other people at her table. When it did become time for me to leave, I asked for her number, and it was given to me. I am absolutely certain that it is actually her number.

However, when I asked her if she wanted to join me at an event two days ago, I was considering attending, she didn't even respond to my text. Is she actually interested? There's another event tonight, should I bother asking if she wants to come with? Should I just leave her alone, revert to the default state of acquaintances? I'm a bit confused, and I don't know what I'm meant to do here. I really want to ask her to come with me to the next event, but I really don't want to be creepy, or pushy, or overbearing, but I also want to explicitly express interest in spending time with her.

 If it's not a bad idea to text her again, I was planning to text this message to her:   
""Hey, I forgot to mention that this is \[My Name\], but you've most likely figured that out by now. I'm sorry I wasn't at \[the first event I mentioned on Wednesday\], I figured that if you weren't going, I might as well spend the night studying.

62,qdaw88,1634884071,My insecurities make me want to flake but I know I shouldn’t,"I met a woman on tinder last week. We’ve really hit it off. She’s sweet and kind and is a great listener. She told me she’s always had to pay for dates from previous dates and I told her that I wanted to pay for our date just because I like her a lot.

We’re meeting tomorrow and spending tomorrow and the day after together. She and I have both been in abusive relationships in the past. In fact I’ve never really been complimented or told I’m worth anything. It was always me being the bad guy because I had female friends but even when I stopped talking to them all, they had secret male friends they didn’t want me to know about.

Anyways, as I said we’re meeting tomorrow. I’m nervous and I want to flake because I’ve got no confidence in myself. She keeps complimenting me and saying I look good and tells me I’m a good listener and have a great personality. All of which is new to me which is partly why I’m uncomfortable. I’ve matched with others on tinder or dating apps before and tried arranging dates. Some have given me their numbers and we’ve texted for a while but they’ve always ghosted me before the dates. She seems like she really wants to meet and idk how to react. I’m more used to flirting and ghosting than I am to actually meeting up.

I guess after all this rambling, my point is: I know I shouldn’t flake but I’ve been treated like shit by women for the past 6ish years of my life and I’m really out of my comfort zone. I’m not used to her being nice and caring. But I know I shouldn’t flake on her.

We met, went on dates but its never been more than kisses. We speak fondly to one another. 

So he stood up on a date and called me to apologize in tears, and rather than tell me what's wrong, he said he was deleting all of his socials and went dark. Tonight, I saw him online and I told him that I have always been in his corner and I am okay with just being his friend. I don't understand why he ghosted me ( after knowing him for 10 years!) He said its been a tough time for him and then promised that he would find me when he was ready. He wouldn't tell me what it was but we video called for 30 minutes and it was pleasant. He said he missed me.

I'm just unsure if I have been an unwelcomed visitor in his life. He tells me that he doesn't have a girlfriend and I know he lives with family.  I know his family.

73,qdbz1u,1634889104,Should my online friend [23M] and I [22F] still be talking to each other?,"

I met this guy on an online game about 1.5 years ago, during the beginning of the pandemic. We are on opposite ends of the continent. The two of us started off as being friends on the game, and eventually we would talk almost every night for hours. That eventually turned into messaging for hours daily outside of the game, and we eventually ended up voice calling and video calling each other. A few months later, we both told each other that we had feelings for each other, and we agreed that we would “casually date”: we would continuing talking to each other to get to know each other even better, but we would not date seriously yet. After a few weeks, we ended it due to some differences. 

We said that we would both be interested in dating each other seriously in the future, assuming that things open up for us. Our main concern was long distance, as well as the possibility of our chemistry being different in real life. We agreed that we would work to move on, and that we would work towards just being friends, like how we started off with. 

For a while, we did talk less (maybe every second day). However, up until this present point- we ended up talking daily for hours again. We still have feelings for each other, but we agreed that we would not date right now as neither of us are serious about long distance yet. We are also both too young to commit to an end plan. At the same time, neither of us wants to stop talking to each other as we enjoy each other’s company. But we also agreed that we would not hold back on meeting or dating other people in real life if the opportunity comes up. 

We do have potential plans to meet one day as friends, if the opportunity comes up, although this is not 100%. But as of right now, it does admittedly seem like we sometimes act like we are dating, or that we are more than friends. Is it unhealthy to be in this situation?

74,qdc139,1634889389,It feels like literally NO ONE is interested dating with me and it made me a very toxic person from inside over time.,"I’ve been in this game for 5-6 years and despite working on myself in many ways (either physically, mentally, or fiscally) I had zero luck. 

No, I didn't ask out every moving woman that I come across, I didn't rush things. I tried to find the “sweet spot” between taking things easy and making a move. My problem is I have no problem with communication. This means, at least in the beginning, I don't treat women differently than I’d treat a man. I have zero issues (AFAICT) until I ask them out. Once I do it, they seem to politely refuse which I’m okay with that. But you can see the slight disgust on their face (I can say that I’m blessed or cursed with reading emotions) which makes me miserable as I move on.

To elaborate on the “toxic person inside me”, It’s basically not being able to stand with other people's success. Whenever I witness a couple kissing or hugging, I feel like shit. Hell, the people who post their success here, in this subreddit make me feel even worse (makes me wanna OD on my prescription meds to put myself out of the misery). For the record, I never insulted someone for rejection. I have enough decency which I would NEVER insult women due to rejection. No sir. 

Of course, it makes me feel miserable over the years. For the first two years, I had tolerance, it was easier to move on. But now I have developed anxiety sprinkled with depressive symptoms as the years go by. I have come to a point where I’m being disgusted by myself. I once spat on the mirror when I saw my face or while I make Zoom calls, I cover my face on the screen with another program. How can you expect someone to be happy with themselves if you can’t even make someone, man or woman laugh. 

Everyone around me have been successful when it comes to finding someone which some of them have married (they occasionally post their photos on insta so it's safe to say that they are happy). 

If you’d ask “What about OLD?“ I’d give you a simple answer: “lmao”

Been seeking a girl for a few weeks now. She has some anxiety/depression issues that she is on medication for (not an issue, but might provide insight further on). She says she really likes me and finds me very attractive. She also says that she is the relationship type and often talks to me about wanting marriage and children when she's young. She's also passed numerous joking comments about marriage and shit like how I feel about a certain place for a honeymoon, as if I'd be there with her. My point is, she seems like she's not afraid of a serious relationship.

I've been trying to match her energy and not come on too strong myself. However, she told me she's not sure if she wants a relationship and that she feels like I'm more serious about us than she is and that although she does really like me and all that, she doesn't think she feels the same way. She said she doesn't want to lose me and really wants to remain friends. She is very conflicted and confused and doesn't fully understand either what SHE wants or if she's sure or not about me... I don't even understand fully what is wrong.

I respectfully (no attitude or passive aggressiveness) told her that I like her and find her very attractive and friendship with her isn't what I want, that she should take some time to think about things and that she should come and talk to me if she changes her mind.

That was yesterday so obviously it's unreasonable to think that she's had time to think things over, however I'm finding the wait and the feeling of not knowing how she feels and that what we have might suddenly end even though it's been nothing short of amazing so far very uncomfortable. I normally don't crumble under pressure and can handle stress in my studies o work, but I've been having symptoms of what I think is like anxiety since yesterday (high heart rate, tight chest, feeling hot and cold at the same time, not being able to focus on anything, feeling very uneasy, constantly having her on my mind, checking our chat over and over again). 

If she decides she wants to end things, should I accept things or should I ask if she'd like to talk about it to maybe understand it a bit more? 

If she decides she wants to continue, how can I best avoid making her feel pressured like this again? I don't think I've ever purposefully brought up being in a relationship with her or anything that would pressure her. And in any case, she's made numerous comments and jokes like that to me so I don't see why it would freak her out so bad anyway.

Lastly, how can I calm down? I'm not feeling good at all, all I want to do is call her, talk to her, see her, just talk it out. But I know she needs time and space to figure herself out.

She’s very pretty and attractive. She came up to me and asked me for my Instagram, and I politely gave it to her while we continued our night. She asked “Are you taken?”, I told her “No”. She said, “Are you sure?” I said “Yes”. At the moment, I thought it was funny of her asking that. The attraction was definitely there towards one another, and I thought we hit it off well because we both were into the same kind of music and artists. 

We didn’t know how old we both were that night. 

I shoot her a message the next day, and we started talking back and forth. Messaging was going great, and it was apparent we were eager to see one another in person, and not have to worry about screaming into each other’s ears while music is playing like it was in the club. A week later, I decided to set something up and ask out for dinner. She agreed without hesitation.

We met up for dinner at a nice restaurant, and we hit it off great. The chemistry was out of this world, and it turns out we had a lot more in common than I thought. She said she was active on Reddit too, so who knows if she’ll ever see this. We had a lot of the same interests, same taste in music and food, and we shared the same values and traditional views when it comes to a relationship and marriage. We talk about our lives, our careers, and our goals, etc.

The topic of age came up, and she told me that she’s 30 years old. Which I found very surprising, because she looked a lot younger than I thought. When she asked me how old I was, she guessed I was 32 years old… 

Let me be frank, I look a lot older than what I’m actually am, which 23 years old. I’m tall, bearded, weathered, workout a lot, and I have my shit together. The way I carry myself and talk isn’t of someone who’s in his early 20s. I take pride in that, and the best way I can describe it is that I’m an Old Soul. So it’s very off putting to people when I tell them my age when they ask.

…I chuckled when she guessed 32, and I told her to guess again, she said 28, and told her to guess yet again. That’s when I saw the shock in her face, and she finally guessed 23. That’s when I nodded with a smile. She nearly dropped her fork as she was eating. She told me that I was the youngest guy she ever went out on a date with, and it was big deal for her for a minute, but it seemed that she brushed it off after that and the energy was kept positive for the rest of the date. We were already planning other activities and stuff to do in the future together which was a really good sign. Overall, I can definitely say it was the best date I’ve had in a while.

The next day, she told that I was too young for her to date, but she would still like to be friends because we got along so great… I should’ve responded by saying “I already have enough friends, goodbye” . But the fool in me played along. According to her, she “wants to be friends before trying anything romantic”. Again, I played along… big mistake.

After that, the messaging slowly started to dwindle down, and it’s apparent that she was checked out. I asked her out again, and she agreed, till she canceled on me the day of. Another opportunity came up, where coincidently, we were going to the same music show, where she said she’ll buy me a drink to make up for the cancellation, just to cancel on me yet again an hour into the music show that night. I checked out mentally after that happening.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

Let me finish with this, age is just a number, it doesn’t measure maturity. So why does a woman that’s 30 years old, throws great connection and chemistry out the window just because of a age difference of a few years? We’re not talking decades age difference. I turn 24 in a weeks time, so that only strengthens my argument. 

It’s all frustrating behavior from my point of view.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qddlox/23m_going_out_with_a_30f_does_age_really_matter/

However, last night we hooked up. After I finished going down on him, he grabbed my face and kissed me. He told me, he wanted to taste him own cum because he knows he tastes good. I was completely shocked. That definitely ruined the mood for me. He noticed and we decided to not go further. 

I found his comment VERY off putting. He just got out of a bad marriage. I’m trying to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was just a little too excited.  

How do I talk to him about his comment? Or should I just let it go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qde4ff/guy_says_something_weird_during_date/
88,qde5hc,1634899180,"19M, Want advice on what to do after date changed her mind and doesn't want a relationship","So for context, I've been dating this girl for just over a month and we've met frequently and it seemed to be going really well, meeting quite frequently and she said she did love spending time with me each time we met. Naturally, I felt it was going really well and I did see us potentially being in a relationship

However, I got a call from her a few days ago, and her tone changed quite abruptly. She said she didn't feel ready to commit to a relationship (while I wanted to ask her that Q, I didn't yet at the time) which she felt was what we were heading. It might have to do w the fact we're both at uni and she wants to study abroad soon, but also she lamented the 'lack of physical contact' (which idk what that exactly meant, and I was honestly cautious about it in case she felt uncomfortable besides hugging a lot).

So as a result, I'm gonna visit her one more time soon and likely part ways from there. After that call, I did feel intensely heartbroken during the immediate aftermath (bc I felt it was going REALLY WELL, and I genuinely liked her a lot) although I'm mostly fine now and respect it's her choice. I'm not asking necessarily asking advice to change her mind bc I know that won't happen realistically. 

What I want to get advice on, is what to do to move on. It's deeply shaken my dating confidence (especially with the 'lack of contact' remark), but I'm also keen to improve myself and ensure I can date without fear or anxiety, and whether I should take a 'break' before I continue again and what (if anything) I should do to address the 'lack of contact' comment. Any advice is welcome and helps a lot!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qde5hc/19m_want_advice_on_what_to_do_after_date_changed/
89,qde8ty,1634899572,How to not get worked up over dating and expectations?,"Hello folks. 

Just looking for some advice. Recently I’ve been trying to work on myself in my time off to look better physically and to try being more social by going to meetups and bars. The working out part is easy but I’m having difficulties when it comes to socializing. 

I’ve always been an introvert and I’ve struggled talking to people, making friends and just generally being interesting. I recently became overwhelmed because of the lack of matches on OLD so I deleted those apps. Constantly checking and swiping and hoping but nothing was happening. I got upset, and I deleted them. 

I’m trying not to set myself up with high expectations but unfortunately I’m one of those people that if I want something, then I’ll keep trying to work on it until I get it. I’m this case it’s jsit talking to women. I keep having expectations but unfortunately I’m always in my head when trying to do anything social with them. I keep thinking if I look “good enough” if she “likes me” if I should approach or what I’ll say. All these things lead to me being overwhelmed and never doing anything. I get frustrated at my lack of experience and lack of balls to talk to approach women that I end up leaving venues early. 

I’m not trying to go out and hookup anymore. I know I don’t have game for that. I just want to socialize and maybe start a convo. I don’t care if she rejects me. But I can’t even approach women. A lot of times they all look super attractive at venues and I feel so ugly compared to other men. It’s why I’m trying to work out 4 times a week and do kickboxing so that I can Atleast have a physically attractive body and maybe even have the confidence to Atleast defend myself in life. 

Idk what to do to get out of my head. I feel like honestly ditching socializing but I know if I stop trying then I’ll just become a hermit again. But going out and getting no results due to my anxiety and fear is also making me frustrated. It’s like combatting multiple fronts between being social and regressing back to being depressed, anti social and introverted. All because I’m trying to go out and be social. 

I’m really struggling with this and just want yo get out of my head and believe that I’m attractive, that my hobbies are fun, that I’m not that boring and that I am a catch but when I look around and see everyone being attractive except me then it really puts a stint on my mind. 

Should I get off dating apps and stop going out and possibly regress while just going to the gym and trying to get fit? Or do I just keep forcing myself even though I’m my own worst enemy and get can’t get out of my head with my expectations?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qde8ty/how_to_not_get_worked_up_over_dating_and/

91,qdegbn,1634900433,Already planning out date #2 before date #1,"I met a girl about a week ago and we hit it off instantly. We're chatting online every day for hours and also talked on the phone for hours (at a time). We get along really well, and it seems like we're both really into each other. We've already planned out date #2 even before we've officially had date #1. Lol. In other words, we haven't met each other in person, but we've been chatting/talking a ton in the last week or so.

It seems like we're going fast, but it also feels very natural. I'm not confused or anything, more so that I've never met or felt this way about someone. I've been in long term (multiple year) relationships and don't recall ever feeling quite like this. Our backgrounds and values are very similar, and I feel like we're being our genuine selves. We've talked about many different things so far, from day-to-day to more big picture topics.

94,qdekse,1634900911,"Women, what are the ways you reject guys?","Something interesting happened the other day which got me thinking about how sometimes women resort to telling you they are not interested in a soft, non-confrontational, non-direct way.

I was hiking through a trail and on the way I found a female hiker  who got started also, making the same way as I was, after greeting each other and a brief small talk about the trail, before proceeding further, she told me she was actually waiting for her ""friend"" as it's usual, she should wait and ""would meet me ahead"". I got the message and continued my hike without waiting for her although I was looking forward to chat to someone while doing this amazing hiking.

So this is crystal clear she did not want to come along and chat with me and quickly thought a way out to avoid me for any reasons which is valid and no hard feelings.
