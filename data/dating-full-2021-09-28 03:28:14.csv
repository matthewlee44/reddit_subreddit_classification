Everything was was going well until I lied to her a couple weeks into the relationship. She brought up the topic of sex and asked me if I was a virgin and I said no and she said she was a virgin. A couple of seconds later I told her that I was a virgin too. I am not sure why I told her the truth after maybe I felt more comfortable knowing she was I guess?? We got into an argument that I lied to her and she can never trust me and I explained to her why I lied because from past experiences when I told the truth I got made fun of or it was an uncomfortable feeling when I was and the the girls I talked to wasn‚Äôt, it made me feel severely judged and I hated that feeling. She was okay and told me not to lie to her again and the next few days was a bit weird but it went back to normal and we made a lot of good memories together and I felt that she loved me as much as I did her.

Another big argument we had was over money, she is very financial literate and she invests her money while I am not so financially literate and don‚Äôt invest. I never asked her for money or anything like that. She saved a lot more money than I did and I tend to spend more but never more than I have. I tend to live more in the present and she tends to live more in the future which isn‚Äôt bad but it‚Äôs a difference between us. We talked about it and I started to save more and spend a lot less because we would like to get married one day. 

Over the course of the relationship we had some small arguments and I always felt it that it was my fault because I accidentally said something wrong and she took personally and we argued over it. She said some things that annoyed me but I never argued/talked about it because for me it was really that big of a deal to talk about it. I felt that during the relationship I was the cause of the arguments and sometimes I felt judged by her. One small disagreement we had was when we talked about our wedding and she wanted to invite her ex( they still are friends) I told her that I felt uncomfortable that she wanted to invite her ex at our wedding and said I had a weird fear that her ex may stop the wedding somehow and tell her that he still loves her. She assured me that she has no feelings for him and she thinks that he doesn‚Äôt for her as well. I was okay but I still felt uncomfortable. In the end I kind of gave up because it was going in circles and she kept on trying to convince me that he is not going to do anything and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore so I told her if he comes it‚Äôs cool and we ended the conversation. 

She is very in touch with her feelings and really into self love and self care and journals and can easily able to communicate her feelings and express her emotions while I am the complete opposite. Like I do love myself and sure I know I am not perfect and I am trying to improve myself like I am trying to be better at communication For me when we get into arguments I tend to shut down and stay quiet and my mind goes blank and have a difficult time forming sentences because sometimes I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to say sometimes. I am trying to change that but not 100% sure how to do so??? 

And recently we had a major argument because I got a hefty speeding ticket and I didn‚Äôt tell her right away, I told her a few weeks later because I didn‚Äôt want to be judged and start an argument.  She had told me in the past that she doesn‚Äôt like my driving because I tend to zig zag and speed a bit and after she told me I stopped doing it while I was with her but continued driving like that while I was alone. For me driving was an escape and it made me feel better but after receiving the ticket I stopped driving that completely and changed my driving habits. 

Now we are in a weird situation because she feels that she can‚Äôt trust/respect me anymore and I know I made mistakes and I told her that I am truly am sorry and will make changes to myself and I wrote a list of goals to myself and I am following it. We are okay but now it feels different, before we would talk a lot and now we talk but feels different. I feel this may be the end of our relationship and I really don‚Äôt want it to be because I really do love her and she know I do. I always made time for her, I was always there for her, I made her feel special, I always told her how I appreciated her for what she‚Äôs done for me and I know she did the same for me but now it feels like she makes it a chore to talk to me and our conversations are a bit brief than normal. I really want this to work out and I feel that I am the one that needs to do a lot of changing which I am definitely going to do.

A roommate opportunity I'm meeting tomorrow to see the place, is with a 45 year old woman, and the place has everything I'm looking for and a freaking jacuzzi. Moving in too soon with my ex is one of the biggest regrets of my life, so personally no force on earth could convince me to date a roommate, and I'm usually of the opinion that I should avoid dating women who get jealous of platonic relationships I have with women, but I'm wondering if I'm underestimating how it would look and how many women would be bothered by it. 

I was chatting with a woman from Tinder on another app with quick reply rate for about an hour, decided to run the question of what she would think if I ended up living with a 45 year old woman and mentioned the jacuzzi to soften it a bit (I had previously talked to her about other roomy options that fell through), and no more responses. I know this sounds funny, but it's not super important to me that she responds and we both exchanged a lot of red flaggy convo before that so it felt fairly safe, I'm just bringing this up because it sparked me thinking maybe this is a bigger deal than I thought. I'm only really concerned that it will hurt my chances with future dating in general. 

I have a close friends group I have known since high school that is mostly women, and have always considered it a deal breaker that someone is too jealous at the idea that I might hang out with my friends, but I wonder if there's something different about an older woman roommate I hardly know? 

If you would consider a dude living with a female roommate a deal breaker or especially highly concerning, I'd love to better understand why. Most of my adult life I had female roommates who were platonic friends and I didn't really think much of it, but I also didn't really date a lot of that time.

Con for Women: 
- Women have to wait to be approached, conventional attraction matters meaning more men approach less women.
- women have to use the correct body language to catch the attention of a man they like.
- Some women have to lower their standards as they age because they get approached less.
- Some women have to lower their standards because the men they want don‚Äôt approach them.
- Women have to practically artificially augment they appear to attract particular men.

Met a boy - lovely 22 year old australian banker who had just moved to the country - at a houseparty. Hit it off and talked for hours. Proceeded to ask me out on a date which was 6 hours long and subsequently many dates over 3 months.

Important moments to highlight in these three months to set the scene for the drama.

1. On our third date he asked what I wanted for this and established that although new here he couldn't ignore the connection and wanted to see where things go. Mentioned I was quite closed off and encouraged me to trust him as he thought this had legs.
2. By 5th date we established exclusivity and said heading towards girlfriend/boyfriend
3. By 6 weeks we decided to take a trip together. Happened at about 9 weeks and we went for 3 days which was amazing/felt very in love. No signs of him not reciprocating - in fact a lot of affirmation from his end
4. At 2 months he told me he loved me (drunk) in the back of an uber after my housewarming where he made not the best impression with my friends by stealing drinks/food. Also ruined someones birthday with an incident involving cake (it's far to specific for me to describe here). I had a go at him for saying that but making no moves to show me any commitment (e.g. asking me to be his girlfriend) and said it was unfair.

4b) Anyway, he affirmed a couple days later that he still felt that way (though never repeated it after) and that ultimately he was scared of responsibility. His job by this point had become very intense and he was hating it a LOT. Ultimately, after I made him realise i was so chill and we had so much fun/such a good time together I would never been a responsibility (because please i've been paying my own way since 18). Ultimately, he said we were basically at the point of being 'official' and would ask on the trip away. Clearly didn't happen

Generally he pushed our relationship and was very vocal about how happy I made him and how he couldn't believe how this had happened. We would see each other twice a week for 3 months and I had begun introducing him to my friends etc. This was the first relationship I had experienced (lets forget those situationships) since 2018 and I was so happy/we never argued and I felt very safe. I also let my guard down that I had been building for three years.

Fast forward to a week ago we ended up on a night out as the mutual connection went out where I was with my uni friends. He was again super drunk (context he didnt usually drink but was so wayward when drunk) and was drinking my friends drinks/being excessive with people in the group. My friend asked me to ask him to calm down as people felt uncomfortable so I pulled him to the side. He started getting upset about work (he had been trying to quit his job, but had relocation costs that he couldn't currently payback) and how london wasn't what he thought it would be. Bearing in mind we had spent the night together on wednesday and he had stayed over to go to work. On that night we were probably our most coupley too and he kept asking if I trusted him, if I was happy and how much I made him smile. So no sign of the shitshow to come. Anyway, I calm him down and we have a lovely time. I'm not sober at this point and actually we were taking very coupely photos/being very touchy. I can't remember how or why but suddenly says:

I can't commit to this.

In the middle of the club. In front of our friends. I'm drunk.

So, I walk away and pretend nothing happens until he follows me and convinces me to talk outside. Now, I don't remember much from emotion/drunkness but essentially he said he wasn't ready and wasn't stable. He didn't know what he wanted from life but it all tied back to his job. I kept saying that I get it but how did it impact us because I'd stand by him whatever decision he'd make. My friends start to leave the club and clearly im upset but I make him drop me home. We then proceed to continue to the convo in my flat and I cry hysterically in the bathroom. (Not my finest moment) My flatmates come back and I proceed to tell him that I'm confused because before the trip or meeting my friends I always gave him an 'out' to leave. I then start to say that it didn't matter where he was I wanted to give it a go. He says nothing. He then proceeds to say that he wants to be in my life 'to check in' and he didn't want me to close off from others (the audacity).

My flatmate tells him to leave and then I go to sleep crying. (not my finest moment part 2)

Next day he says that he's sorry he wasn't honest earlier but only realised this week (again lets remember there was less than 48 hours of me seeing him). I then make him return my dresses and we had a conversation. I essentially told him he was downright disrespectful for doing it the way he did and that I'm confused as he pursued the trip and the i love you blah blah. He proceeded to say whether he told me now or 2 weeks it wouldn't change and that I meant more to him than I had summed up (bs because clearly no respect). Also that he wasn't stable and had a lot on him recently. I then said I didn't want to be with someone who didn't want me and I deserve better. Also said we couldn't be friends because we were never friends to begin with and we would never bump into eachother. Ultimately I also told him that shit happens in life and at some point you have to take accountability and figure your shit out and not hurt people in the process. We hugged and he said take care before saying 'be open'. (the fucking audacity part 2).

It's only been like 10 days but because we only have good memories (sans break up) I'm struggling to be okay. Like I'm fine I have work and a strong social life, but I miss him for him. I remember saying he could be a binman but I believed so strongly our connection was rare enough to give it a go. He even said he had the best 3 months of his life and whilst I get and respect he may be going through something and needs to be by himself. I can't help and feel that I'm the one who lost. I feel so vulnerable and so betrayed (?) because I feel like my trust is so destroyed after I worked for so long to not let people in.

Did I miss the red flags? Am I stupid? The worst thing is I realised that week that I love him too. It was one of those loving in the simplicity you know.

Some of yall on reddit are very dramatic though so I'm only taking to heart the ones that are speaking reasonably. Lol. So she was showing me her piercings and firstly I had taken some testosterone pills before I worked out that makes me insanely horny and secondly her profile says she's open minded and loves talking about open minded things. So I told her that I love her piercings and that I think they make her look really hot and that piercings have always been a turn on for me. And then we talk about it for a little while and different kinds of piercings and then I bring up that the last girl I hooked up with had a tongue ring and nipple ring and I thought it was hot but also looked like it hurts. Then she said she thought about it once but was too scared and then i said I don't blame you it looks painful. Ok a little more small talk about it then I tell her how I love tits and how at work they were asking everyone ""ass or tits"" and I'm the only one that said tits. And then she says that well I struggle in that section mine is just a handful but I tell her that I like all sizes and would love them and she said oh then I said sorry I be too horny today then went into regular conversations with her. That's all that was said sexually just that. So tonight I ask her if she uncomfortable with that kind of talk and that I apologize that it was so random and told her I was on the pills but didn't ever want to make her uncomfortable. Really I'm just seeing what her boundaries are and stuff and how far I can go. So she says that I made her feel like she wasn't good enough. I don't know where the heck she's getting this from because I said literally nothing that implied that she wasn't good enough. I literally clarified that I like all size tits they are all great. So part of me says that maybe I shouldn't have brought up this conversation with her but the other part is saying we're both in our 20s and should be comfortable with sex talk by now and that I'm not using any girl or her for sex and want something real and a real relationship but guess what people in real relationships have sex. So why can't sex be talked about? And I'm not saying for her to have sex with me and rush things. Like sex isn't fun for me if she isn't having fun so I want her to be comfortable with it first but if you can't even talk about it you're not ever gonna be comfortable with it. And I'm a real sexual person looking for a girl that's somewhat the same and like not instantly I mean down the road after we're dating.

This is a message I get from 70% of the guys I am talking to EVERY DAY!

This is a clear symptom of low self esteem and bad past experiences, which you let them define your own reality of the world.

Let me ask YOU this:

IF YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT YOU DESERVE SOMEONE SPECIAL, HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO FIND HER?ü§î

üî∏I know you may feel lonely and depressed at the moment.

üî∏I know you may feel not attractive enough because women don't express their interest to you.

It may seem impossible to believe that you deserve someone special.

‚ùóThis is just a frame from which you perceive the world. It's a negative state that you are stuck in and defines your everyday life.

‚úÖThe good news?

Frames can change. And the only responsible for this is YOU AND ONLY YOU. Sit down, grab a piece of paper and set up the frames you perceive the world. 

‚úÖWrite down "" I deserve to be loved, I deserve to have someone special by my side"" Keep it on your desk and see it everyday. 

Suddenly, the world around you will change. People are going to give you love in unexpected ways.

Repeat this, with all your negative frames. Turn them into positive ones and believe them by default. 

As Wayne Dyer said: ""If you change the way you look at things the things you look at, will change""

Put the effort into changing your beliefs and stop complaining about your life circumstances, simply because

 YOU ARE THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES.

Hope it helps!üòâ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1031418,public,self,"""Finding an ideal partner seems superficial to me""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/px6h4y/finding_an_ideal_partner_seems_superficial_to_me/,all_ads,6,,,

I went NEET after school. the last time i was with a group of people my age was before high/online school, and i think I missed out on something incredibly crucial growing up.

I have learned a fuck ton about all kinds of subjects in my isolation, and now I'm just taking care of myself and my future, I have a plan, just no one to love along the way.

I feel something. I don't know exactly what, but it scared me. Enough to kick start my facial hair and wake me up to my damage. my family enabling me out of love and never forcing me to do anything had crippled me out of complacency, I was the ""good kid"" growing up.

The reality is that I've experienced much less historical trauma then my partner and have less current stressors and struggles in my day to day life. And I'm doing my best to support my partner in their stress, as a shoulder to cry on, a helping hand, etc.

But, this imbalance, where my partner is often looking for support and I am not is causing some distance in our relationship. My partner feels reluctant to share their struggles and hurts when I am not also sharing and expressing mine, but the reality is I just don't really have anything major and expressing trivial things seems inappropriate as well. I don't want to make up some hurt or pretend issues are bigger then they are, I don't feel like I'm burying my emotions or ignoring struggles.

Now she says to me that ""I still have feelings for you and that's why I want to work on it, but I need time to get over my ex"".

So in my morning class, I met and have been talking to a girl.

So one morning when I was walking with her towards her dorm building I asked if I could give her my number so we could talk over the weekend (class together is only twice a week, and since I wanted to talk to her more I figured this was a good step.)

Well, long story short she never texted me and didn‚Äôt even wait to talk to me after class as we normally did before that. I‚Äôm not sure why, we walked across campus next to each other talking random shit right before I gave her my number and everything seemed to be going great.

Anxious as hell, as I'm a kinda inexperienced guy for my age, I went to meet her up at a bar.

Like, I'm kinda good looking but also kinda weird, she seemed to be just like me in that regard and I really felt like there was something there. No kiss or anything (she left early) but I immediately got a text from her after she left saying ""hey, tonight was great! We should really hang out again sometime soon :)"" 

sooo I asked her what her plans was for the weekend, and... ghosted. Just like that. Not unmatched or anything, just ghosted. I was kind of shocked because she showed crystal clear interest in me before, during and after the date, but ghosted me when I asked her about her plans for the weekend...

It's now been a week since the date, and I'm still confused because she didn't unmatch me or anything. The optimistic part of me thinks that she's simply too anxious to reply (seems like we both have social anxiety), but the pessimistic part of me thinks that she just thought I was boring and too cautious (she's more experienced than me).

What do you think? Is it worth it to reach out again with some casual non-confrontational message or should I maybe just try to move on?

It's been two months.
A week or so ago, when he was video calling me, he went into the living room of his house and video called - as opposed to from his bedroom. And was in a hurry to hang up.
So ofcourse I felt suspicious and also it's been bothering me that he's in touch with his ex from college. So I went full FBI mode and found that she was in his city on THE SAME DAY OF THAT VIDEO CALL and was there for a week or so.
She lives in another state. 

I found some more intimate pictures of them on public blogs of hers. Turns out they have pictures atleast till 2018 and he had told me they just dated for two months in 2014 but were otherwise friends. She was also visiting him on the weekends when he moved to a new city for work.

I don't care what happened in the past but I'm a little weirded out by the pictures on public websites. Especially one of him lifting her up. It's messing with me.

AND I know I have no proof but my gut tells me they met when she was in his city recently and he hid it from me. It's possible that he may NOT have met her (am I paranoid?). He says they talk once a month.

I did bring this up subtly with him because I am wary of men due to past experiences with men who keep in touch with their exes. But he seems devoted and very sweet. But there is still a nagging feeling. I don't know how to shake it off.

I just don't want there to be SO MANY PICTURES of him with another girl :(

So, in my case, got out of a long relationship and back into the dating scene, just about to turn 30. I don‚Äôt consider myself to be ugly nor very attractive, but matching with like minded people on dating apps has buen extremely difficult. 

My takeaways from the past two weeks are:

- If you don‚Äôt pay, you don‚Äôt get as much matches. 
- There are way too many bots. 
- People seem to be into hook ups rather than having a decent conversation. 
- people match and don‚Äôt talk or reply in monosyllables. Smh 

At this point I feel like after lockdown the amount of people using these apps have increased significantly and the companies know that. The quality of the service imo has decreased significantly compared to 6 years ago (where I met my last partner).
