We’d talk nearly every day, we’re each others no.1 best friend on Snapchat (how much we interacted) and he suggested getting food at night and would hang out afterwards so I think he was interested. A close mutual friend, his best friend would tease me about liking him even though I’d never hinted or mentioned it and say things like “you make it so obvious you just want the pics from our night out to have a photo of [guy]” and asked me if I’d consider anything. So I guess he was gauging if I was interested for the guy?


One night we were drinking and we moved out to the smoking area outside with some friends and there were no seats so he insisted I sit on his lap instead of stand and this surprised me as he isn’t a very forward person or hadn’t flirted before but maybe the drinking gave him more confidence. I did and he sort of put his hand on my waist and nothing really happened. He invited me to the football with his best friend and his new girlfriend under the excuse that “she’d only go with another girl there”


Anyway, covid got worse and I had to move back home and sort of lost touch because I picked up a job and had study.

However I reconnected with everyone around Christmas time and found out my guy friend had just broken up with a girl he had dated for a month and had strong feelings for, I told him it was ok if he wanted to discuss it and vent as he was still a good friend and we stayed up until the early hours of the morning discussing it and reassuring him. 

She sounded really toxic and like she had major mental health issues, yelling at him him for making jokes and abusing him if he made a mistake and his friends if they called anything out then threatening to harm herself and abusing him when he got security involved. Yikes. He went to visit her the second night we were talking and she threw him out because one of her ex friends and the guys cousin contacted him about her and she saw the message. He said she was really pretty and he felt like she was out of his league and lucky and realised that was shallow and was glad she was moving back overseas.

Things started getting better and we were starting to become good friends again and he’d send me a funny snap each day or make contact every afternoon. He started to bring her up less . **I wasn’t trying to be predatory and get onto him now that he was single again and vulnerable just was happy to have my friend back**.


But 3 weeks later, yesterday I noticed (I’m not a stalker I was bored and was looking at maps to see where people were in our break) and noticed he was at her place out of town and it hurt. He was there the next morning so had stayed the night and then went to a nice cafe for breakfast and back to hers before work in the evening. He was there the next day. I don’t normally stalk friend but this was all I could think about and I couldn’t stop myself from checking. I don’t know if they were catching up before she moved back overseas or reconnected but I felt sad and angry that he promised his closest friends who were abused by her he wouldn’t go back and who told him she said to another mutual she was cheating on him and just used him as a fwb when I think she was insecure and he was the only one to indulge and put up with her.

For some context, I'm fat, plain-looking, I have clear skin, and I have brown hair, hazel eyes, and I dress nicely I got on and started swiping for a while. But I only got 4 matches in a month, 2 were bots, one was a prostitute, and only one was a girl willing to meet me, but she never turned up to our date. 

I didn't give up and kept going for another 2 months with the same result, but my self-esteem was getting affected so I stopped. I decided to give up dating women, and that I would just focus on my studies, and doing hobbies I enjoy. Classes in person started back up recently, and I was speaking to the female friend I mentioned earlier, and she asked me how it went, and I simply said not well. Somehow, I ended up asking her out, and she said yes, I made it perfectly clear it was a date as well, and we are going out tonight. She texted me this morning saying she is excited for our date, and I'm going in a few hours, I'm taking her to the aquarium because we both like sea life. 

The point is if you're an average/ugly guy dating apps are complete garbage, and they will not work for you the only way to get a date on a dating app is being a 10/10 6'2 ripped model.

So had a date with this amazingly beautiful girl.

We got to the restaurant. We hadn't really talked much. I just got up the courage to ask the hot girl from another department out. Sort of admiring from afar and making a couple stupid jokes that she giggled at.

We got talking and after the work, family and pets speed round.

We had nothing to talk about.

I brought up a book I was reading. She said she doesn't like to read.

I brought up a television show. She doesn't really watch tv

I asked her favorite movie. She isn't into movies.

Hiking. Nah

Camping. Nah

Fishing. Nah

Favorite childhood memory. "" Hanging with my grandma, I guess"".

Best friends. I don't really have one.

Highschool. I cheerlead and it was ok.

Sports. Eh

We sort of ate and ran out the clock. I am thinking, ok she is just blowing me off. We get out to her car and she grabs and sticks her tongue down my throat. She goes, "" we got to do this again"". I sort of made a random head movement and waved bye.

I've been single for about 4 years now. It has honestly been by choice, I have had some really sweet people ask me to let them take me out, but I have taken the time to work on myself. I honestly got to a point last year that thought I may be happier by myself, but thought that I should try dating since I hadn't done it in so long. I live by myself, and am able to support myself without any help and will be able to continue to do so going forward, which doesn't help me get out of the ""I'm an independent man who don't need nobody"" mentality. My schedule is really busy. I can be done by 3pm one day and 8pm another. I love my job and am really committed to it. 

All that to say. I joined dating apps and realized they weren't for me. I had about 4 really solid matches in the first few days of me downloading the app and asked to get one if the girls numbers. The girl would call me and leave me audio messages, but despite all that I never wanted to feel like a bother and never could think about when to text her, when I finally reached out she wouldn't text me back, but would watch my Instagram stories and interact with them. When I would reply back to her interactions (all of them being interactions with messages) she wouldn't reply back. I wasn't feeling the connection anymore and felt like something was off. I thought maybe since I had not dated in so long, and never did dating apps that maybe it was me, so a few days later I saw on her instagram that she had unfortunately gotten Covid so and reached out and told her that I was sorry about her having to quarantine. She was very grateful that I reached out and we talked a bit, but she didn't reply after I said ""stay in touch 😊"" because I wanted to let her rest, but also had work to do. Later that day I realized she blocked me on Instagram. I guess she didn't like that I cut the conversation off? I didn't have bad intentions, but I feel like her action was extreme. So that made me want to take a step back and led to me deleting the dating app. 

Literally about a week later I worked an event over the weekend related to my job. I was talking with a co-worker and noticed that a girl started jumping into the conversations. She even made a joke about something I said to poke fun at me. There was a moment where her and I had to go off and complete a task, but had to wait quite sometime so we had a very nice conversation. Our stories are surprisingly similar. She even has the exact same position as me and related to how busy and unpredictable our schedules are. I did something I never had done before and asked if she would to hang out sometime and she said yes and we exchanged numbers. She texted me something about the task we were doing that day a few minutes later and we messaged a bit after that, but we were in person so we mostly spoke to each other in person. The next day I texted her and we had a great conversation, one that I have never had with someone that I didn't know at all. Monday came and I hoped for her to have a great week (as to which she responded back with a nice message) I realize I probably shouldn't have cut the conversation off, but I am so dumb with stuff like this that I assumed she was going to be busy and didn't want to interfere with that. I reached out Wednesday about something job related and we texted until the next day (she was busy with work, but would still message when she had time) and seqwayed into asking her out to dinner, she unfortunately said she had a prior commitment and either she is a great actor or she really was bummed out that we couldn't make it happen. We then messaged about her commitment (which she had a big task). Work kept me busy so I messaged back about 2 hours later, she never replied. I didn't think much about it, because I know she was going to kept busy for about 4 days, but at the same time I know she could have most likely found time to message back. I was going to wait to let her initiate the next conversation, because I don't want to come off strong or thirsty, but nothing, it has been over a week. 

Everyone I talk to tells me I need to reach out. One of my female friends told me that I am the man and should take control, but that idea is so flawed to me. I will admit that just off the 2 conversations and one in person interaction with her she has left an impression on me, which has never happened before. I really can't stop thinking about her. Do y'all think I should reach out again? I don't want to be a bother or thirsty, especially since I am already thinking about her a lot and that seems too much too soon. I know I didn't say anything wrong to make her stop texting me, I truly think she just got busy, but she never followed up. So far she has really been engaged in all of our conversations. She will send multiple paragraphs back to back. Should I reach out again or should I let it go?

I just don't know what is normal to do and not to do. I also have never been the one to make the first move, so this is also new to me. I have this ""meet me halfway mentality"" but after typing this all out and reading over it I realize she did basically initiate the first move because she jumped into the conversations and then came up to me and started talking when we went off to complete a task.

so yesterday I had my first date with a girl I met over Bumble. For me it was my first online date, tbh I hate all this shitty online dating and I just installed it bc of covid, most of the time I dont really write my matches bc I'm already pissed of that I hate the whole game. 

But like a month ago I got matched with this girl and tbh she wrote me first, so we started our conservation and we both understood good each other, so we agreed to a meeting. After 2 fails from both sides, we managed to meet up yesterday. We met at a train station and went for a beer walk. We had a good talk imo and I felt comfortable. 

So like 2 and a half hour passes and she suggested to go to a bar. Corona rules rn at my place is a test when you dont have your 3rd vaccination. She got it but I didnt, so I wanted to make a test but we had to wait along time so we deciced to cut it off. We went a few meters and then she said that she wanted to go home. It upset me a bit but for sure it was okay to go home, so I bring her to the station back again and I wished her a good evening and gl for her examination she got next week. 

The goodbyes felt a bit cringy I got to admit, she looked at me like she was waiting for something. I asked her if we're gonna meet up again and she said yeah sure but like I said, I'm new to this online dating shit and I'm a bit confused.

She was smart, funny, independent, all the things I like about a woman, but she wanted to move faster than I wanted to. In addition, the interest at first felt a bit one sided, as although I liked her, she was the one who asked for my number, asked me out first, kissed me first, etc., so the interest didn't feel balanced. I felt a bit overwhelmed by it all, but didn't say anything at first. I feel most comfortable getting to know potential partners as they are without pressure for sex, so as friends, first before getting intimate, as I have a fear of intimacy due to trauma from past relationships. In addition, I want to establish a solid foundation of a relationship with the person first, in that I can truly be comfortable and myself around them without any judgment, as I have social anxiety. 

I told her that I wasn't ready for sex initially, and that I needed maybe three months to feel like I'm ready for it. She said that that was fine but that she couldn't wait forever, for like a year. However, I felt unconscious pressure from her to have sex in that I knew she wanted it, and I had a time limit to give it her. In addition, I felt guilty because I wasn't as into her as she was into me, and felt that I needed to force myself to get on her level for things to work out. This made me very nervous to be around her, to the point where I would physically shake when seeing her. I still had a good time getting to know her as a person, but often I needed my space, and would feel comfortable hanging out for three to four hours at the most, but the same would be true with any friend, I'm just a very introverted person. 

We met up a week ago, and she could sense something was wrong, so I told her that I have a fear of intimacy and that I would feel most comfortable if we dialed it back to being friends with the intention starting to date again later, and she said that that was fine. The experience made me very emotional, as I was revealing something very personal about myself to her, and so I broke down and told her of my anxieties in general and how I feel the world is a scary place. She was understanding and we cuddled for a bit until she asked if she should leave, and I told her that it would be best if she left, as I needed some time alone. I asked if she wanted to get drinks on Friday, as friends, and she said sure pretty emphatically. However, when I texted her last Friday, she said that there was a family emergency and she needed time and space to herself. I haven't heard from her since then (it's been over a week), and I tried to reach out to her to check in and wish her well,  but she never responded. 

Bottom line is that I felt that she was going too fast for me, I wanted to slow it down because of my anxiety about intimacy and getting close to people, I communicated this to her and thought she was ok with it, but I guess she wasn't. I can totally understand how she would feel though, as maybe she thought I was giving her mixed signals or couldn't handle my baggage or whatever. Did I fuck up and is there anything I can do to fix this on my end?

She contacted me online through a mutual friend who told her i like to send cute animal pictures. Our initial conversations were great we found out we live really close (20 minutes away by cycling, though we never met because our timelines never matched). We were friendly to each other and she even complimented me on that. She replied to my Instagram stories helped me with some math. She introduced me to an amazing band through her playlist she sent me. 

I wasted this opportunity, i fell into a porn addiction. We both lost interest in conversations. Im getting out of the addiction and im into her again but i dont see the same response from her.

(Basically this next paragraph is her not being that interested in my chats so skip if you want) 

I want to reignite the spark again. I put up a story on my Instagram talking about how our old talks were some of the best parts of the year just to get an excuse to talk to her again. I started sending to her some cute animal pictures again but all im getting are ""liked your message"" followed by a low effort one word message. I tried to talk to her about the band we both liked got a response with a few songs and thats it. Visited her apartment complex for a different reason but she said she couldnt meet me because her family is quarantining because of high covid cases their.

We do have a plan and shes interested. I found out she's never had cheesecake i used it as a dumb reason to set up a desert date i guess but she just thinks im gonna treat her to cake.

I just graduated from university and started a Masters program in a completely new field, economics, which demands a lot of adaption and energy for me as a person without a proper econ or maths background. On top of that, I am working 25 hours per week, and taking driving lessons weekly.

However, I am nearing 25 years old and the thought of putting off a relationship until I graduate from my masters kindof scares me. I was never a fan of the whole “ditch your love life until you graduate” mentality. I am in a dating app because I thought I could handle it, but I have been speaking to a guy for a week now, and it has been harder than I thought (keeping up with the text messages, making room for phone calls, etc). I feel so overwhelmed with my new program and struggle to grasp basic economic concepts, so it is really time-consuming and most importantly, requires a lot of focus, which I havent excelled in since being on this dating app. Guy I am talking to already made a comment about wanting us to speak more often and text quicker, which really induced a lot of anxiety. 

I am hesitating between two options:
1. Postponing my presence on dating apps until summer. That will give me time to adapt to my new program, and in summer I will have more time to get to know someone, which is the most stressful part imo (stressful is bad also because it affects my ability to focus). 
2. Staying on the app and continue to talk to the guy because he seems alright, and there’s no guarantee I’ll find someone in sunmer and that I wont pass out on great people this semester, and I don’t want any regrets.

I ask her how old she is and why she added me. She replies 18 (I am 19), and that she added me from a friend of a friend. (Me buttering myself up thinking she found me attractive or something 🤣😎)

So ten minutes or so go by of us just having a normal convo, like if we live close to each other and if she is still in school. Then she asks if I wanted to go to lunch and that she is paying. I am kinda stunned because I have never been asked on a date before by a woman, I have always made the advances in my life. So I am happy and respond saying, “yes, of course and I appreciate you paying.” 

I ask what time and she tells me what time and restaurant, I am getting anxious and excited at this point because it just feels sketchy (or I am just pessimist). I ask her for her number and she gives it to me, I then ask if we can facetime (just to make sure she is real and not a creep), she replies saying she is still in bed which is believable since it’s 9am and some people stay in bed on the weekends for the whole day but it still raises a red flag for me. 

So I am like, “Just saying, but if we can’t facetime before the lunch date then I will have to call it quits, just tryna be safe out here and make sure you ain’t some 50 year old creep tryna take me out on a date (nothing wrong with 50 year olds.).”

She replies with, “I get that and maybe later but not right now.”. This kinda sets my heart as ease knowing I will have clarification and all that.

She says and this is the turning point, I ask for a movie recommendation and she says, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”. I say, “😂of course you would give me a movie named after you.” (Her name: Hanna Smith)

She then says, “Guess what.”

Me: “What?”

Him: “I am a 9 year old boy”

At this point i’m like wtf.

He says, “You slid up on my sisters story and she told me to mess with you.”

Then I proceed to call them weird.

He is like, “how?”.

I said, “It is creepy asf and your sister should teach you some manners.”

Him: I know I did it on purpose 

I then blocked them but the fact that a girl my age sends her 9 year old brother to talk and fuck with a grown ass man is so wrong and weird on so many levels.

I suggested and decided to go for drinks before joining our friend group later but oh no one of our friends was already close by and caught up with us preatty much ruining everything. To make things worst i could have told him to ""leave us"" but froze and said nothing.

2nd fuck up: I was still feeling tired from overworking the entire week and therefore was failing to conect or be interisting like i normaly would. So what did i do to fix this ? Coffee and pleanty of Alcohol (big mistake). As i got drunk to get that ""confidence"" is was becoming needy at the same time and started showing it. I could tell she was getting repulsed.

3rd fuck up: And the cherry on top ? It was time to go home and i was supposed to take 2 of our friends home. Suddenly the crush was coming with us and was staying at my friends home for the night 💔

I’m not upset over this guy as I had realistic expectations going in but wow that experience left me with a similar “not good enough” feeling like my previous dates/situationships did.

In December, I matched with this guy on tinder (we’ll call him Nick) while I was back home from college and we had really nice conversations back and forth for quite some time before adding each other on snapchat. For weeks straight we were snapping back and forth getting to know each other and flirting every once in a while. I thought he was a really cool person and I was excited about getting to know him more.

When we both went back to college (we coincidentally lived in the same area for college even though we matched in our separate hometowns) We were still snapping and even started to send videos of us listening to music, giving room tours and just talking. I made the first move and asked if he wanted to FaceTime while I was cooking. We ended up talking for over 3 hours just learning about each other and we were laughing for a lot of it.

We both kept making small gestures that we should hang out and meet in person one day. Like one time he asked me if I ever saw a specific movie and I said no but to tell me about it. He told me about the movie and that he never saw it which I responded that we should watch it together which he agreed with. Another time, he mentioned that he planned to ask me to hang out soon and I was super excited.

A week ago, I was hanging with a friend and just kept noticing Nick being on snapchat but not answering me which wasn’t him at all. He always answered me back. After two hours of seeing him ignoring me, I check one more time and I’m unadded. I start freaking out in my head.

Since I have his number I decided to text him. This is how the convo went.

Me: “You unadded me?”
“I’m sorry if I did anything.”

Him: “No don’t say sorry I’m sorry I don’t know why I unadded you at all I’m stupid”

Me: “Is everything ok?”

Him: “For the most part yes this is going to sound weird but I didn’t want to keep saying like “soon” and stuff when you ask about hanging out but something happened when I came up here and I don’t really go out and like obviously I’m trying to go do stuff more but you probably notice I just sit in my room all day lmao. But anyways I don’t want to like get you upset by saying we will hangout soon when I will just bail on it but I am trying to go do more if you feel me :( So I didn’t want to lead you on in a nutshell”

Me: “So do you never want to hang out?”

Him: “No no no I do Eventually I promise and I think your awesome I just didn’t want to like explain all this but it’s out so I guess that helps”

Me: “I will never rush you to ever hang out with me, obviously I want to see you but it’s whenever you’re ready.”

After that, I told him to add me back on snap which he did when he woke up the next morning. He apologized for what he did the night before but I was still confused as to why he did it. I talked about it to some girlfriends and we kinda just came to the conclusion that he started overthinking, freaked out then unadded me. I tried asking questions and I still feel like I don’t know. He told me he’s still interested in me and wants to continue talking to me, but will we ever see each other?? Like how long do I have to wait? I am not scared about making a move and being like “When will we hang out?” but with that whole thing that happened, I don’t know if I should ever bring up hanging out because I don’t know when he is ready.

After the situation, our snaps haven’t been the same but we’re still talking sometimes and still snapping just as much. I am just still confused on what happened. I just need some advice and hear others ideas as to what he means.

The way you constantly make me laugh. The way you walk in the door and I just need your body pressed up against mine, your dick inside of me, to feel safe and loved. You make me feel so special and beautiful. 

But how at the same time do you also make me feel like the ugliest and most undeserving woman in the world? Someone who is not worthy of getting to know? Someone who is not worthy of your time, outside of when it's strictly convenient for you - on your terms, and your whims. How do you know just enough love to give me to keep me coming back time after time, allowing me to feed off the breadcrumbs of feelings you clearly harbor for me in between your sporadic visits? You are not good at sharing your emotions, so you probably don't realize how deeply those rare, loving words sit in my heart. 

We have still never talked about some of the most painful words I have ever heard in my life, coming from you. Part of the reason for this is that I want to cherish the few hours we have together in person, and not risk tarnishing some of the happiest moments we have to remind each other of the pain. But just so you know, I am the woman a guy can't wait to bring home to their parents. Why would you not want to introduce them to someone who works hard, is loving, kind and generous, has 2 ivy league degrees, and would do absolutely anything for you? What does religion have to do with love?

I want nothing more than to just put this all aside and to just see you today, even if it means days of depression afterwards as you characteristically immerse in your career and pullback on contacting me. But everyone around me is telling me no. They say I deserve more, and that if a man really wanted me nothing would stop him. They tell me you are selfish. And I'm starting to think they are right. We are getting old now and this has probably gone on for much longer than it should have.

I want you to listen to your heart. I want you to take a chance on me and put in the effort to build a life together, because we could have a really great one. I want to lie in bed with you, my head on your chest, holding your hand, and listening to music, forever. I will always love you. And I know you love me too. But this 'situationship' is not fair to me anymore, and frankly never was. I can't keep seeing you on the sliver of hope that one day we could be together, when you just answer that you're ""confused."" And each year that goes by, that sliver seems to be getting smaller and smaller.

She contacted me online through a mutual friend who told her i like to send cute animal pictures. Our initial conversations were great we found out we live really close (20 minutes away by cycling, though we never met because our timelines never matched). We were friendly to each other and she even complimented me on that. She introduced me to an amazing band through her playlist she sent me. 

I wasted this opportunity, i fell into a porn addiction. We both lost interest in conversations. Im getting out of the addiction and im into her again but i dont see the same response from her.

(Basically this next paragraph is her not being that interested in my chats so skip if you want) 

I want to reignite the spark again. I put up a story on my Instagram talking about how our old talks were some of the best parts of the year just to get an excuse to talk to her again. I started sending to her some cute animal pictures again but all im getting are ""liked your message"" followed by a low effort one word message. I tried to talk to her about the band we both liked got a response with a few songs and thats it. 

We do have a plan and shes interested. I found out she's never had cheesecake i used it as a dumb reason to set up a desert date i guess but she just thinks im gonna treat her to cake. 

While shes not able to meetup now i need some tips to get her interest and keep our chats going and im really sorry this was a huge story.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154332,public,self,I wasted an opportunity and wanna reignite the spark,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sayle2/i_wasted_an_opportunity_and_wanna_reignite_the/,no_ads,0.0,,

A week after I found out, he broke up with me and said he thought I liked him more than he liked me (ouch, right?). I decided to move on with my life, not hold a grudge and about 3 weeks later he asked me to have dinner with me. That night we got very drunk at dinner and he told me he regretted what he did, missed me and didn't want to lose me. Except the next morning he didn't remember half the night and I decided not to tell him. It was a conclusion he either needed to come to sober or it was something just said in the moment through alcohol. 

Now fast forward, and we have since had dinner every week, he gave me a $300 ring for Christmas, babysat my dog and even still tells his mom we have dinner. I did start seeing someone in the midst of things although it recently didn't work out. I found out last week that my ex had gone out on the first date since we broke up, and decided that this toxic cycle wasn't healthy for either of us and it was no longer what I wanted. I decided to slowly distance myself when I felt my ex preoccupied with someone else (totally fair). He felt me pulling away and began to push back, then asked me to dinner this week again. The following conversation happened over texts;

Me; ""maybe you should be asking this new girl to dinner""

Him: ""A\*\*\*, I've been one a date with someone.... one""

Me: ""There are a lot of things changing for me at the moment and I've realized I'm at a point in my life where I'm making a lot of larger decisions for myself. One of those decisions is finding out that you're seeing someone and realizing I need to take a step back and reevaluate what it is that I want. So I did. and you felt that pull so now you've decided to push back to stay in my life. I thought back to when you got drunk and never told you what you said; which is that you screwed up, regret what you did and missed me. I was hanging out to those words and not giving myself the chance to properly move on.""

Him: ""Yeah. I like hanging out with you. I like having you in my life. You're a good person and I don't want us to just stop talking. I've told you before I care for you and I don't want to lose that.""

Me: ""Well \*\*\*\*, do you honestly think any girl you date is going to be okay with you hanging out with your ex girlfriend regularly? Talking almost every day?""

Him: ""I don't know, that sounds like a them problem""

Me: ""But don't you see what that looks like?! If I'm more important than someone new that comes along then what the hell are we doing? I made my decision, I ended things with someone after it became a controversial topic and chose what was more important to me.""


I'm so confused here. My Mind is in a million different places and I know that if given the choice, he wouldn't commit but is it because he's too scared to be with me? Or too scared to lose me?

She also asked me if I am even interested in anyone in the group. I asked her the same thing and she said no and also talked about a guy earlier she wanted to meet

She has also said I'm hot in front of others before so idk haha.

We also had a game where basically I was supposed to kiss other people (I didn't as I did not want to make anyone uncomfortable) but she brought up this multiple times that i still had yet to kiss anyone.

She also stopped talking to her best friend recently so I also think it could be just her trying to reaffirm her friends she still has are better than the best friend she lost/cut off.

Met my friend back in college and now we are in our late twenties. We live in two different states and he’s invited me to see him but never has really gone to my state to specifically to see me. Just to see friends. Back in 2020, he’s invited me to hangout with his friends and to his family members wake. I didn’t feel comfortable going because of Covid. I sent him a surprise gift in the mail and he loved it. He told me that if I visit him, he’s going to treat me good. Told me to wear a nice dress and that he would take me out to dinner and show me all of these places. He told me he wants to move down there and has said two three times that he wants to marry me and have kids. But I think he was kidding about that. We have hooked up in the past and back in college, he only wanted to hook up with me. And he would always reach out to me and still does, to see how I’m doing. 

Back in college, he had a reputation of home wrecking relationships and hooking up a lot. I don’t think there is anything wrong with him hooking up a lot but I am just unclear what his intentions are with me now. 

I recently asked him what he is looking for and he said “when the right person comes along, then I’ll want a relationship” he asked me what I’m looking for and I said “I am looking for a relationship” and he said “when the right one comes, right?” I was a little shocked with this answer considering he’s told me he’s liked me in the past and has wanted me for a long time. After that conversation, he proceeded to tell me that when I come down, he wants to buy me lingerie and that will be his gift from him. Also said he’ll show me places and take me out. Then was texting pretty sexually. He also told me that he can be controlling when it comes to driving to places and planning trips.

Prepandemic, we went on a few dates. He took me out to dinner, held the door, paid and we kissed. He didn’t expect anything afterwards and he said he had a great time. Second date, we went for a walk on a path, danced, kissed, and then opened up to each other. He then went back to his state. He said he wanted to see me all the time. 

I am very confused. Some days he calls me beautiful, tells me he’ll treat me right, that he wants to marry me, he’ll open up, all green flags. We Snapchat everyday and he will text me and we’ll talk about anything. He asks me all the time for me to visit him. He said he’ll beg me forever. He’s never pushy about and knows it’s a lot to ask. He has drunk called and one time called me up randomly just to tell me that I’m beautiful. 

Then..he tells me something like that and that he wants to buy me lingerie. I don’t want lingerie I want flowers. Clearly, I am looking for a relationship. I would like to hangout with him more since I do see a part of him in my future. I also noticed he never likes any of my Instagram posts.

However, I’ve realized that this may have narrowed my options down considerably e.g. going for men who are good looking also means they have plenty of women to choose from and this leads to somewhat short-lived relationships. The last guy I dated for a few months I was really into and excited about only to eventually be told he didn’t feel the same way which did hurt a bit.

So I’ve been going on dates where I may not necessarily feel a spark but I feel like there may be something there. The problem is, I don’t think I’m that excited about them, even after the 3rd or 4th date, and I really don’t want to do to them what’s been done to me where I end up leading them on. Is it normal for feelings or attraction to build over a longer period of time? Or have you found that if you’re not that happy/excited/attracted to someone a month in, it probably isn’t going to happen later down the line?

A friend (M21) of mine (F24) and i started hooking up a while ago. We've known each other for about 4 years and both had a breakup of our long term relationships around begin october. I broke up with my 3 years boyfriend, he got dumped by his 2,5 years girlfriend. The breakup was the best choice for me and i've been feeling amazing since the moment he moved out (a month later). My friend had a hard time. 

We started talking more again (his ex didnt want him talking with me cuz he liked me in the past), started hanging out more and eventually hooked up. We've been growing closer and closer, im becoming friends with his friends, his mom likes me and were talking every day, randomly video calls me too. We're generally just having a great time. We're going out together, going to the zoo, shopping, dinner, lunch, gaming in the evenings, drinking with friends, going to parties together. Etc etc. We get along great and the sex is also amazing. We haven't really talked about what we're doing but we both made it clear we're not looking for a relationship right now but we also don't like sharing, a.k.a were not fucking other people. 

I've never had FWB or just sex with someone im not in a relationship with so its a bit hard for me to totally understand what's going on. I don't really care though, i just like what we have now. But i'm a bit confused about what he's feeling (i did say i want to talk about it sometime soon but yknow, just writing my feelings haha). Last weekend he came over with some friends, we had a great time. He was very clingy in front of his friends, asking for hugs, touching my legs, hugging while sitting on the couch, and this time even held my hand and kissed me in front of his friends and my best friend (first time they met). To me, what we're doing feels no different from a relationship. I'm not complaining, i thought it was cute. And again, i dont need to give it a label, i like what we have now and i don't want to change it. But he does seem to like me, or so i feel like. Can you blame me for feeling this way?

The confusing thing is that later that night he told me he posted some new music on his IG (he makes music in his free time), so ofcourse i checked it out. There were two songs. One for only his close friends, and one for everyone. The one for everyone was just a cool song, the one for close friends was a heartbreak song. Lyrics like 'hate the thought that youre not mine' 'my life's nothing if it isnt with you' 'try to smother with love'. It's very obviously about his ex, and i feel like the trying to smother with love refers to me. I knew i was a rebound at the start but with him kissing me in front of his friends etc, i kinda lost that thought. I'm very confused why he'd drop the hint he has new music online, it being a song like this. I asked if he was alright, to which he responded ofcourse, dont worry this is from a while ago. He then removed it from his IG. I now feel like i somehow misunderstand his actions, me being just a rebound to him. I also don't mind being a rebound but i'm just super confused as to why he would kiss me in front of his friends then. I do defenitely like him, being a rebound does make me a bit sad but i knew that from the start. I haven't texted him since the song thing, i feel like i need to chill a bit, get my feelings in order aswell. Before i get too attached thinking he likes me while im just his coping mechanism lol.

Tonight a went on a date with a girl from bumble. Our first and last date. We ate some Asian food and then we drove (with her car) to my place. 
The Street at my place was closed. There was a big Crane today and the city installed a cellphone transmitter on a roof. The crane was gone but the street was still closed. I told her ""I think we can just park in front of the barrier, the street is closed its Sunday and I don't think that you'll park for more then two hours, BUT no guarantee.""
She told me ""I think it's fine"". Long story short: we drank a beer and after maybe one hour she wanted to leave. We had a nice talk but nothing more, not my Type. Everything is good. I take a look out of the window. The road is open, all the barriers are gone and her car.......
We went down called the police. The police told us where we can find the car. She took it really easy and laughed it off. I was really sorry but I told her ""no guarantee"". We found the car and she leaves. 

The thing is, a tow away is very expensive. Even more on Sundays. I think it will be 250 maybe even more then 300€. I feel really sorry and I told her to let me know when she knows how much it costs. I don't have a lot of money but maybe I can help her out with 50€.

In the brief time I was in school some girls caught my eye, I am generally confident so I went and talked to them, but the problem I keep running into is I don't have a lot of topics of interest that overlap with most women.

I am mostly interested in history, enlightenment and modernist philosophy, politics, war tactics and strategy, engineering and physics.

Of course most guys don't have any interests in such stuff either but since I have had male friends all my life, I generally share a lot of common interests with other guys though not as passionately.

For example, if I meet a new guy, since I live in India, I would ask him about cricket and whether he saw the last game. This has good success rate since most guys do watch cricket, only a very small % don't. Other could be whatever is the latest marvel movie. and then the thing just flows.

This crush I have on her has been a thing for me for over a year and a half. I could tell this past summer at one point I had a feeling I made her uncomfortable she started to have werid and rude behavior towards me. I noticed people around her at church give me rude and negative vibes.  So something negative was said about me. So I started to leave her alone I haven't tried talking I see her she'll go the other way. She wouldn't even hold the door for me when she volunteers as a member of the welcome team. 

So since I've distanced myself from her I noticed she been coming around me when at chruch. Like she get pretty close to me but never says anything. Today she saw me coming into the chruch and just stared at me but didn't say good morning or hi. But she did to others who walked in. Then since i'm on the media team I man the camera for services and she was helping on the welcome team. She got really close to me MULTIPLE times today but didn't say a word. In between services we have a break which is a about 40 mins. She kept coming around talking to everyone else but me but she kept looking over in my direction. Her voice was high as if she wanted to be noticed. I wonder if this a flirting tactic? 

 A few points today during the break we looked at each other but nothing was said. I know I don't want to say anything because her and I gotten off on a bad foot and I feel I made her uncomfortable which Is the only explanation to why she started her rude behavior towards me. This past summer I asked her on two different occasions if there was any issues between us? And she said no but continued with the rude behavior.

And to be honest, I've been starting to take it personal because no matter what I keep being ignored for trashy men.

I’ve known this girl for the last 5 years, we really get eachother, but we’ve never dated. In fact, I wasn’t even attracted to her for some superficial reasons I’m over now, and started to see her for her personality, ideals, and character. (Shes still really hot tho lol). We both agree we have an amazing friendship and “there’s no getting rid of me”. Even if she outright denies me, I’d still want to know her for the rest of my life. 

But I’m facing some issues that are bugging me. Firstly, we live on separate continents (she lives in South Africa, I live in the US). I haven’t seen her in person for 4 years and when I tried to scrape what I could together to go visit (not solely her), COVID happened.

Second, I don’t really understand her. She’s given me signs that she is into me, but other times when I try to flirt, she starts friendzoning me. Then other times she’d ask me about my relationship preferences and such. Is that typical conversation you have with guy friends? Again, I’m cool with just staying her friend but the mixed signals make things confusing.

She told me upfront at times that she likes that she can confide things with me that she can’t do with anyone else. Like that the reason shes staying in school is because of the cultural expectations she lives in. That she doesn’t really know what she wants out of life. She’s told me that she really honors me, her theories on love and family, that she’s an advocate of not trying to force things. 

Maybe the third issue is me. I’ve made it very clear that I only date toward marriage and that I’m polygynous. She’s asked me about it before and didn’t seem to be against the ideas, but I can understand how making a commitment like marriage can be very daunting. Even if I don’t see it that way. She told me on a seperate occasion that she would consider a relationship after she’s 35 (she’s 21 rn, with no relationship experience).

I really love this girl with all my heart. I want to marry her and for her to find happiness ideally with me being a part of it. She makes me genuinely happy. I love every second I’ve had spending time with her over video calls, and we help improve each other. 

She’s a very busy person with school and helping to run her families business. So I try to give her her space. We talk for like 3-5, hours one day out of the month. And she’s a terrible texter.

Yesterday my boyfriend went to a Christmas work party that I couldn’t go with him because I had to work. He kept texting me that he was really drunk and wished I was here and how much he missed me majority of the night. I went to bed around midnight and he texted me at 2 in the morning that some girl kept inappropriately touching him that night, some girl that works in the office. He kept texting me sorry and that he did nothing “other than be friendly with women” and that he gave her a stern yelling about touching and that he wants me to come to the next party.

He then texted me when he woke up this morning and said that she kept trying to grab his arms to hang off of him and repeatedly touched his chest over and over again. At first it seemed like he stopped it right away but from his last text it sounds like he let her continue touching him until it was a lot. I am very glad he told me and I told him that I just feel very sad that it seems like he didn’t stop it right away.

This is not my situation this is my friends situation. I am trying to help her. She has been married to her husband 5/6 years but together 10 plus. He kept a lot of things from her. After they were married he told her he was bi and that he cheated on her numerous times she decided to stay because they were married.

He was an alcoholic when they first met and then he was in recovery. He decided to drink again eight months ago, and she has stayed and put up with it. One time when he was drunk he even held a knife to her. He verbally and mentally abuses her tells her hes not happy in the marriage. This past week he was caught drinking on the job and crashed his work truck. They fired him and sent him off to rehab. Also his son beat her up and almost killed her. She wants to leave her marriage but her family is very Christian.
