I hope that you're all doing great. This is going to be my 1st ever post on this thread, so I'm quite nervous, haha.

To be honest, I was really hesitant to write this, since I don't look like 'one of them loners' at all. I do have great social life, plenty of friends. On top of that, I actually play professional sports for living right now, so I would like to think that I'm also in a decent shape. However, I really do struggle with finding a partner. 

If I go on dating apps, I tend to have a lot of matches. Hell, even in my daily life I tend to receive quite a lot of attention from ladies. Untill the moment, they get to know me. 

I mean, there must be really something wrong with me, since it never usually works out for me. I guess most of the ladies have that image of me being ""all dominant and macho"", however I'm not like that at all. It sounds like a dream for me to have a nice and equal relationship with another lady, where I could provide and just genuinly make her happy.

We were both just starting our freshman years at uni and had a common interest in film. We talked for a couple days over text then stopped. We reconnected at our university's film club, and began to start hanging out more. 

One night after studying together, she invited me back to her dorm to watch The Sopranos. We ended up cuddling in her bed and holding hands. Afterwards I asked what she wanted out of our relationship, and she said it was too early to tell for her. I explained that I have been struggling with depression recently and probably wouldn't be able to handle a serious relationship. She said it was OK if we kept things casual.

After that we hung out a couple more times. I would usually be the one to initiate hang outs, and would almost always text first after that. At one point, we were cuddling in her bed, and I asked if she wanted to kiss, which she did. We made out for a while and I ended up grabbing her boob. Afterwards I asked if I made her uncomfortable and she said I didn't. Following that she became more distant.

Last night, we met up prior to a film club meeting at the dining hall. Once I got there, I texted her and she said that she was inside with a friend. A couple minutes later she walked out with an extremely attractive guy. We had a pretty normal hang out after that. Once I got back to my dorm, I sent her a voice memo explaining that I was kind of confused about how she felt about me. I woke up this morning to a text saying she just wanted to stay friends. 

I feel like a huge creep and dumbass. I feel like I should have read cues to figure out that she wasn't interested in me like that.

There's this girl I go way back with. Have known her for years. Used to have a thing for her, but I'm over it now. I'm almost certain she liked me for a while when we were teenagers. When we were about 18 she also invited me to her apartment, which I'm not sure, but it might've been because she wanted to hook up (I never ended up going).

So eventually I lost contact with her and didn't see her for 4 years. Then the old friend group decides to meet up again and she's coming. We hit it off and whatever, things are cool. On one occasion she was telling all of us that her boyfriend was pissed she came out with us. When asked why, she said because he was worried about me. I shouted out ""well I know I'm sexy"" as a joke, and it got a laugh from everyone.

Then later on, some one of the guys there (really nerdy guy with no luck with women) was saying he was ugly, and the girl said that he's an attractive guy, but then jokingly said not quite as sexy as me (wewillmake_greatpets) though.

Then we all went swimming together and two of the guys were talking about their dad bods, and how girls like dad bods. Then the girl turns to me and says ""and you're standing there like 'I have a sixpack, I'm not worried'."" (I'm in good shape, so she wasn't being sarcastic).

Later on that night, when we were all talking, everyone got drunk except for the girl and I, as we both don't drink. Every time someone said something funny or stupid, she would turn to look at me. And I mean every time. I was beginning to think ""the amount of times she's glancing at me is weird"".

So judging by the fact that she used to be into me, and then her behavior during the hangout, I think she still thinks your boi is attractive. Idk though, what do you think folks?

He's always online on Facebook though. I was kinda hoping he'd hit me up again and converse a little bit but nothing. Radio silence. This has happened before though.

We met on a dating site about 9~10 years ago and lived about 20-40 minutes apart depending on traffic. After about 2 months I found out almost everything she had told me was a lie, including her name, where she was born, her sister was really her aunt, her step mom was her bio mom and was disabled and not an abuser as I was told. She was a virgin but lied about having lost it already, not a huge deal on that one but with everything piled up I couldn't deal and broke it off. 

After a couple months of being split I got to know the ""real"" her as friends, or so I foolishly thought, and decided to give her another chance. BIG MISTAKE. 

So after dating for a few months it's now Valentine's Day. I decided to go all out, baked a cake, made homemade chocolates, cooked a romantic dinner, gave her a custom necklace, and finally made love. Post coitis, I decide now is the time to confess my undying love.

Suddenly she bursts into tears,  at first I thought out of joy, but it became clear she was sobbing and upset. I asked her what was wrong and she exclaimed ""I didn't mean to take it this far..."". I asked her to elaborate as I was very confused. 

She then confides she had been cheating with several different men, 6 in the past week alone. She had proof, videos, texts, etc she had planned to show me and break my heart. Yet, after seeing how much I genuinely loved her and ""what a great guy I was"" she realized her mistake and now wanted to ""truly commit"". Even offered to be open and let me sleep with other women to ""be even"".

I was so utterly destroyed I couldn't look at her. I took her home trying my best not to sob and break down while driving in silence. We broke up and pretty much went NC.

Years later she still contacts me out of the blue to try and hurt me more by saying things like how terrible in bed I was and she was a lesbian now because of me. I was very confused, but chalked it up to her going back to her old ways and laughed it off. 

Most recently she contacted me and I told her off about how she was behaving the last time we spoke. I asked her why she was reaching out again as I didn't want to waste my time if she was just going to be ugly again. She claimed to have matched with my younger brother on Tinder and that they were hooking up. I laughed and told her good luck. Called my brother and gave him my blessing, but he should be careful. Found out they did match but had not met. I expressed I didn't care if he wanted to hook up I couldn't care less, but he stated he had absolutely no interest now that he knew what she was up to and who she was as he didn't initially recognize her.

According to her, I broke her heart by rejecting her and breaking things off the first and second time so she would forever try to get me back AGAIN as if she hadn't already destroyed me once before. I told her to seek therapy, wished her the best.

I believe I just now realized she may have sabotaged a past relationship. I was catfished by someone who was trying to get me to cheat on my gf at the time, maybe 6 years ago. I assumed it was my gf ""testing"" me, which I still don't fully doubt because certain details matched the gf more closely, but now I'm thinking it could have been her and she just did some extensive sleuthing.

TL;DR: Ex gf is a pathological liar and set out on a campaign to break my heart and continues to attempt to hurt me even almost a decade later. Has anyone been through something similar and has advice? I'm concerned and know she needs help. Is there anymore I can or should do to give her closure or do I just go full NC?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127058,public,self,My(32m) ex gf(29f) keeps harassing me and I just wanted to share my story and seek insight.

So I am finding myself in situations where I go on a great date with Person 1, where we get along well and almost had sex, but we decided against it...while I still had a date scheduled a few days later with Person 2 in the near future.  So then the date with Person 2 ends up going great too, we have a nice kiss at the end of the night and they express a lot of interest in hanging out again.

Rather than being excited about meeting two nice people, and rather than being excited about the potential of sleeping with someone in the near future (sorry but listen, it has been a WHILE!), it instead all immensely stresses me out.  I am wracked with guilt and negative feelings over it all.

So:  What are the rules for this sort of thing?  For instance, if I see Person 1 again and we end up sleeping together, it FEELS very scummy to then even bother proceeding with Person 2. But this is obviously my own hang-up, making a lot of \*assumptions\* about both Person 1 and 2 and their views on sex, dating, monogamy, and intimacy let alone the fact that they also may very well be dating/sleeping with other people as well - we're all adults, after all!

So the OBVIOUS answer sounds like it exists in **some form of communication**.  The problem is, **I don't know what that communication looks like**.  Please bear with me, as I am bad at this, and rarely make it past either a) the first date, because I'm so unfairly picky or b) if I do, I tend to stick to dating/sleeping with one person for 5-6 dates out of this phobia of ""coming off like a slime ball"" rather than any inherent disposition toward monogamous sex.  

But I'm feeling very ""blocked"" about what that \*something\* is and I would just like to be prepared.  Like, **what does that conversation look like?  When does it take place?**  Clearly it's not necessary to outright disclose to someone, completely unprompted, that you are seeing/sleeping with other people, as this almost seems a bit cruel?  But it does feel like \*something\* needs to be said, at some point, at some time - something to just get on the same page about sex, dating, intimacy.  In my head, it sounds like something where you take a pause when you sense things are getting hot and heavy physically - like ""hey, can we take a beat for a second and just discuss expectations here?"" Or is that too big a buzzkill?  I'm also totally prepared for the conversation to not really swing my way - if they aren't on the same page, that's fine!  What I don't want is to make anyone outright \*upset\* or angry. 

As far as what I actually \*want\*?  I want to explore more, and with multiple people, but to do so clear-eyed and knowing full well that look, there's definitely a non-zero chance it might not work out - it certainly has not historically with most people after a few dates!  And given that I do not associate sex with ""relationship intimacy"" or look at it as a progression into something more serious (rather, sexual chemistry is just another thing we are discovering about each other), I want to make sure I am going into sex and dating without hurting people more than they deserve to be hurt.  There's enough pain and frustration in dating as it is.  

TLDR:  So I want to search for The One, I want to have sex with people, and I want to NOT be wracked with anxiety about hurting multiple people's feelings or making them feel gross or misled.  But it feels like I am only allowed to pick two of those!  Is it even possible to have it all?  Again - I sense that the obvious answer involves a conversation, but the what/when/where of that conversation is what freezes me in my tracks!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127058,public,self,Wracked with anxiety: How to date/potentially sleep with multiple people without being a scumbag?

I’m a 34 year old female. I’m tall, fit, blonde hair, and I had a 99% match ratio on OLD apps. 

I joined online dating 4 years ago after my divorce. At first, I thought it was fun. Suddenly I had the world at my fingertips! I could meet anyone! Woohoo! Dating, here I come!

I soon was sucked into the miserable pit that is online dating. Now I say this, because the very methodology is not conducive to a natural human experience.

Problem 1: Appearance based. 
I’d swipe on guys whose faces I found aesthetically attractive and go out with them, only to find we had no chemistry, they were dull, arrogant, rude, crazy, etc.

I’d swipe left on guys who I didn’t find attractive based on their photos, and ended up meeting guys through friends that I swiped on who I really liked based on their personality.

Problem 2: Endless faces. I’d match and talk with men and the conversation would fade out fast because there is always a new person to talk to. I did the same too. It was just an endless stream of that initial excitement from a new match, only to fade out into the next.

Problem 3: Self-esteem. Although I had a lot of luck getting matches, men made me feel as though I was in competition with other women. Constantly. I never felt good enough. Men made me feel like I had to entertain them or compared me with other matches. I actually became seriously depressed.

Problem 4: Safety. Meeting strangers online, I came across catfishes, and on two unfortunate occasions, literal rapists. 

I have since deleted my online dating apps, and can confidently say I am infinitely happier.

I also don’t really know if she’s even single. I saw her profile pop up on Hinge once a few months ago but it shortly disappeared. 

After a big pandemic slump and not having been with a woman for like three years, I worked on myself a lot and spent a lot of time building my OLD profiles and have finally started getting some matches with attractive women, but I can’t for the life of me garner the motivation to talk to them because I’m crushing on this other girl so hard. I can’t get her out of my head. 

So any advice on how I can stop thinking about her and try to actually take advantage of my potential options? I’m for sure putting all my eggs in one basket right now.

Why are we using our grandparent's playbook to date in the modern era? 

In my quest for advice/tips for dating, I keep coming across the same advice rehashed/reworded by a different person. I question the relevance of this advice in the modern dating landscape. 

Is it time we get away from the old order way of approaching dating and relationships? Should we be devising new ways to approach dating and relationships that work in today's world?

Unfortunately, telling men to be chivalrous and women to be demure is not only inapplicable in modern times, it could be setting men and women up for disastrous results. For example, my grandfather didn't have to worry if my grandmother was taking him seriously because she had a FWB. My grandmother didn't have to worry if my grandfather was willing to be exclusive because it was implied they wouldn't be multi-dating.

In a dating environment where, hookup culture, polyamory, FWB, multi-dating, sugar daddies/babies, Foodie calls, Bootie calls, and fluid gender roles exist; The old playbook is simply insufficient. 

The evidence illustrates that the ‘tried and true’ methods are not working for the majority of people. We have record highs in depression, suicide, opioid use, loneliness, anxiety, and singleness. Additionally, we have record lows in heterosexual relationships, marriage, and household income (intrinsically tied to marriage).

I'm hoping all the outside-the-box thinkers here can brainstorm what they believe could be some solutions to the mess of modern dating. Or can the steadfast people tell me why they believe the old order way of approaching dating and relationships is still viable?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127065,public,self,"If dating was once considered a battlefield, it's guerilla warfare now: Should we create a dating playbook for modern times?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvhk6b/if_dating_was_once_considered_a_battlefield_its/,no_ads,0.0,,,

This long scattered post is a composite of the things I have learned while dating. You might like some of it, you might hate it.

One of the biggest things I have learned is how to be content and love myself. I must admit when I started dating I used each date as a form of self validation, I had to be liked or loved. I wanted to build my ego and fill my voids with people, because I couldn’t fill them myself. I slowly realized my behavior was hurtful not just to the ladies I was seeing, but also to myself. Instead of taking the time to reflect why I was slowly become more disgusted with myself, I would just throw another date on the calendar. Eventually, I took a long break from dating just to work on myself. During this time I created and refined a daily routine. Every morning with my cup of coffee, no matter the time or where I am, I always journal and read something good for the soul. My journaling usually includes things I am grateful for, things that are stressing me out, a simple to do list, and general thoughts or ideas. After my journaling I workout, sometimes I have time for a full gym routine and three mile run. Other days I only have time for a quick HIIT or 15 minute yoga routine. My morning routine is one of the most important things in my life. One of the other things that took work was how to live a full day by myself. It was hard. I had to find hobbies. I had to learn to be ok with going out to eat by myself. I had to become content with the quiet in my own home. I accomplished this by selfishly asking myself what I really wanted to do that day. I would go skiing, hiking, travel to a new city, visit museums, and try new bars or restaurants. I will add that if my friends ever invited me to something I would always say yes, even if what I had planned was more fun. Eventually I actually developed a real relationship with my friends. We could talk about hard things. We could always bounce ideas and thoughts off of each other. We would help each other grow. At the end of my single stent I realized that I didn’t NEED to be with someone, but yet I realized that being in a relationship could still add to both of our lives. 

How I date now. I would estimate that I meet 70% of my dates through apps and 30% in person. I typically only use apps Tuesday-Thursday. I don’t enjoy being tied to my phone and I have to explain this to my matches and potential dates. On the apps I like drop a few witty comments, ask a few strategic questions. Move the conversation to text messaging. Then set up a date for weekend. I will happily admit that I pay for the premium services and change my location based on where I will be Friday or Saturday night (because of my job). The premium services allow me to spend less time on my phone and find matches I am more interested in. 

In person my technique usually consist of: A friendly smile, simple introduction, sincere complement and a non threatening ask. I always give the ladies my phone number (a business card with only my name and phone number) and never ask for theirs. I don’t want them to feel any pressure, so I leave the ball in their court. I meet these ladies in many places, grocery stores, coffee shops, hikes, malls, museums, airports (not while on the job), literally anywhere. 

When it comes to the actual date, my dates are typically more extravagant than my peers. Not because I am trying to prove how successful I am, but because I like doing fun and new things. Why not live a little?! Hike and tacos, concerts, sporting events, nice restaurant and a play. My strategic questions mentioned above typically give me a pretty good idea what my date would be interested in. I also have no problems if the date proposes an idea. Additionally, I also ALWAYS give my date a way out. Typically it is a simple text the day prior or of, “Hey! If you are still interested and available I am really excited to ___ with you today, I think it is going to be a fantastic time!” I can probably count on one hand how many bad dates I have been on. When it comes to conversation I personally have no boundaries. That being said I don’t like to judge. I like thinking about the context of what they are saying and try put myself in their shoes. I find most dates to be absolutely fascinating. Different backgrounds, experiences, hobbies, likes and dislikes, professions. I usually try to relate their experiences to mine, so I can ask deeper questions. 

I hate hookup culture but I understand it. As humans we are constantly competing to find a better mate. We try find a mate that can meet our needs and can provide the fittest offspring. Some would argue we are biologically designed to seek multiple mates. I find that after a relationship becomes intimate, a lot of the desire to grow together seems to stop. Metaphorically, we have climaxed as a couple. We think we completely know what this mate is like. So we move on to the next. I have hooked up before, but I find that I focus on how good/bad the sex was and tend forget about all that I have learned about my date. I find this is slightly dehumanizing and I generally don’t feel good about it when I reflect the following day. I want to build a relationship on something besides sex, then let the sex add to it in the future. 

For background my name is Jack. I am 32 years old. I am 6’5” and fit. Professionally I am an airline pilot. I am extremely extroverted. I would describe myself as a serial dater, but I am not a fan of hook up culture. I am not trying to come of as a cocky douchebag, I am just trying to share what I have learned.

First of all, take a look at the Tinder sub before reading. you don't have to of course, but it might make some of what I say more seen.

I don't think I know how to speak to women. I figured that I spoke in a good way to them but all that's happened makes me think far differently.

How is it that I mean? Well... It would be what I say and what I see and how I'm treated in return. I try to treat women as best I can and speak as well as I can too. But somewhere is where I'm doing wrong or badly and I can't see where myself.

Now, perhaps if my mother didn't die as a kid and if my unborn sisters didn't die with her I'd probably be doing well. I'd likely know how to properly be with them. This won't and can't be though so there goes who would've likely been able to help me most.

\---

For here, this next part, I guess I should put some examples of what I say to women, so you can determine where it is that I'm doing wrong.

\-""I don't know how life's been treating you lately but if anything's been unwell I apologize for it since it never will itself.""

\-""I hope I'm the first to tell you this today but you're really pretty and I hope you can see what I do""

(when I started this post I had more examples in mind but they're all disappearing now that it's time for them, sorry for the shortlist but you can hopefully see how it is that I prefer to speak to women.)

However, these must be horrible and stupid things to tell someone. Never have any of them even gotten a response or anything. &amp; that makes me feel like shit with how other men's who first words to a woman are ""please sit on my face and ruin my life"" &amp; ""You want some young big cock?"" and many other wordly offerings actually have something happen with what they say.

A request for facesitting can earn sex and relationships or a response, but a well-wish, an apology, or warning about a certain like can't even get someone a word back.

\----

What is a good bio too if you could tell me? Most of mine have always been me talking lightly about myself, warning people that I like to wear fragrances and wouldn't want to cause issues for the people sensitive to them and I usually end with a wish for wellness or an apology for life's mistreatment.

Again, these must be horrible since they never have anything happen. they must be stupid and awful and shit.

...But it's always around when I'm thinking that when I remember some bio's, from women, that are ""you better eat ass"" ""I'm here to have fun while my comatose boyfriend can't know"" and ""I love how I have a better chance of fucking your parents than you do""

...

...

***sigh***

TL;DR Where am I doing badly with how I speak or what I wish to say to women? My bios too, where is it that they are so bad no one can even say anything or match with I? Men's who first words to a woman being ""I'd like to mate with your mouth"" do far better than men who wish for wellness or anything.

Just for context, I know her from work (she works in a different department at work) and prior to this we were texting for several months before meeting up. We even went to get coffee twice in a cafe near our workplace during coffee break .

So my question is, did the two times we met outside of work considered dates? Or was it just two friends hanging out?

I haven't dated anyone since high school, so I feel like my lack of experience will make it more difficult to find and sustain a long term and meaningful relationship.

Meeting people through friends isn't an option since I don't have many, so the only thing I've tried is online dating.

I want something more long term, but I feel like I can't use other dating apps yet because my lack of experience will hinder me.

I am 27f and have had no real relationships so far due to severe anxiety, trauma and self-esteem issues. I was totally emotionally stunted for most of my life and have only recently become somewhat normal, after years of therapy. Therefore, I missed most of the dating experiences of youth, and faced with a potential romance, don't know what to do!

I met a guy (29m) online from another country and we really, really hit it off. We talk every day, have been for about 2 months. However, being very inexperienced, I can't stop worrying if I am doing enough to show him I am interested, without being creepy!

Are two months long enough to tell an online friend you are interested, or is that weird and desperate, considering you spend 3 hours talking every day?

Of course, I am also worried that he just considers me a friend. He is way more experienced with relationships and hasn't been too flirty (as far as I can tell!)

So my questions are mainly, do I wait longer, or do I tell him now? Will I come across as desperate? Is there a usual timeline for online relationships?
