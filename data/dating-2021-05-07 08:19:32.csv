0,n6ygf8,1620393970,"CMV: Having your first relationship during at most HS/undergrad is absolutely crucial for forming normal healthy relationships later in life, and missing out on them is detrimental for your social skills and love/sex life"," If you have never had a single friend by the time you are a teenager, you will have severely missed out on developing social skills and that is something you can never fully recover from 100%. By the same argument, if you are 20 and still haven't had a relationship, then you can also never recover from the lost experience. Other people will know their way around the opposite sex better, know what they want better, and have less trouble 'getting' how to play the game. For example, for me, I am 22 and about to graduate and still have no clue whatsoever how people attract each other, let it be known, and move on to more intimate situations/relationships. It boggles my mind some people can do it almost effortlessly too, jumping from girl to girl while it took me 22 years to not even get to step 1.

So yes. If you are 20+ and graduated from undergrad or college, and never had a relationship, you are socially behind in a way you cannot recover. Your formative years are over. Your brain is almost done developing. 90%+ of the population has way more experience than you. I get that HS relationships aren't the most stable and aren't meant to last, but they give nice experience. Besides, all the 'drama' people talk about happens after HS too. Divorce, crazy exes keying your car, forced pregnancies etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6ygf8/cmv_having_your_first_relationship_during_at_most/
1,n6yplp,1620394741,I want to call him out for wasting my time,"This guy reached out to me when I was ok with being in the pandemic and ok with being alone. He tried to get me to give him a chance again because over a year ago we hit it off and we stopped talking. I didn’t remember at the time but I gave him a chance and ended up falling for the familiarity and talking to someone. I remembered we had a great connection till he ghosted for a week because he didn’t know how to deal with his feelings. I called him out for it then and he said he’s been working on it. We kept talking daily and I stated to catch feelings again. 

One thing that annoyed me is that he would take hours to reply to text messages sometimes but when we spoke on the phone we would talk for hours. He told me he liked me and wanted to meet me but we’re in lockdown in Ontario. I also don’t know what he actually looks like besides pictures he sent me so part of me was thinking he’s a catfish since he didn’t want to video chat cuz he claimed he looked a mess cuz if his hair. After 3 weeks he said that he wanted to sneak to meet despite the lockdown and I agreed. Since I was so comfortable talking with him I told him I had a YouTube channel and he ended up finding my channel. A week later I noticed messaged taking longer and longer to get a reply and when he messaged he carried on like nothing was wrong. I got annoyed and blocked him on WhatsApp. And I have not gotten any calls or text messages in attempt to him trying to reach out. I honestly want to message him and call him out cuz he wasted my time and I’m annoyed because you knew my situation and you chose to disrupt it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6yplp/i_want_to_call_him_out_for_wasting_my_time/

She would give me excuses of exams, and seem legit. I was obsessed and overthinking, self doubting myself, and wondering what she is thinking and if she likes me or not every single day. It was torturing, but I couldn't get out of it. We kept on texting everyday, she always responds and she appears interested, but I don't feel confident to ask her out again. It was painful. 

Now here is another girl I am also interested in. We went out for lunch once. We rarely ever text, and one time I texted her, she just liked my text without actually responding with a text. But when I ask her out on a date, she gave me a straight YES. Simple. No strings attached. No doubting, no excuses. Just a 100/100 Yes. I instantly felt like ""what am I doing back then with the previous girl who give me excuses and never make time for me"", why did I have to go through those BS, when another girl MAKE IT EASY for me lol.

I also feel that judging interest from her text response is unreliable. The first girl text me much more enthusiastically than the second. But the second would go out on a date with me, thats all it counts!

She and I are church members and we have seen each other at church events. That’s how I’ve originally met her. I’ve also hanged out with her before and she’s also gone to my birthday party.

At church events she and I would talk about different things. She would tell me what’s going on in her life and I’d tell her what I’ve been up to. Back then she was dating another guy and went through a hard breakup. I was there to try and comfort her. This was back around 2019 before the pandemic was going on. I haven’t seen her or texted her for about a year until February 2021. She and I were FB friends though.

Fast forward to the middle of February of this year and she sees me at church and as I’m about to leave she yells my name. She was really excited to see me and wanted to see how I was doing. Later on that night, I texted her letting her know that I was nice to see her and she said the same. 

We didn’t have much of a chance to talk at church so I asked her how she was doing. She told me that she’s planning on going back to school to get her Master’s Degree and is helping out at a facility to get volunteer experience. I’ve also told her that I’m planning on going back to school because I was interested in pursuing a different career path. She was excited that I was pursuing my passion. 

Several weeks passed by and we kept on talking and talking. We would text each other about every 2-3 days. We would talk about many different topics. But what I recently noticed was that she would take much longer to reply. Her reply’s would be around once a week. Once she would took 3 weeks to respond. Granted, our messages were not short messages so I understand why she may have taken longer to reply.

Fast forward to a couple of days ago and I thought that I would be best to tell her that I liked her. I preferred to tell her in person, but I couldn’t meet with her or speak to her over the phone because it felt as if she was really busy and I didn’t want to seem like I was bothering her. Yes I know that text is not the best way to tell a woman that you’re interested in but I felt like I didn’t really have much of a choice.

Anyways, so I send her a text telling her that I like her and that I’d like to get to know her better and meet up with her in person more. She then tells me that she would be fine hanging out with me but as two friends. She pointed out all of the good qualities that I had and that I’m the most admirable guy friend in her life. She said that she’s not interested in anyone romantically right now, even me with all of my great qualities. She said that perhaps it’s not the right moment for her or she may not be the right girl, but all that she could offer me at this time was a friendship. She ended by saying that she enjoys our conversations.

I accepted what she said and told her that I’m fine with being friends.

What caught me off guard though was that she mentioned to me that she certainly wasn’t expecting for me to like her as more than a friend.

I guess that’s where I am concerned. I’m concerned that perhaps I'm not showing the right signs to a woman. I find myself asking “What I am doing wrong?”. Because I thought that by talking to her, showing interest in her life, and saying nice things about her I'd be showing romantic interest, but I guess that's not enough. It sounds like there's more that I have to do.

I guess what I’d like to know is what I could do better in order to show a woman that I am interested in  them romantically. Because I guess she didn’t catch that based on what she told me.

24,n71d3t,1620401888,Truly can't tell if she's interested or not anymore.,"We are both 21 and have been dating for a month and a half. When we're together everything is amazing, but then there are just random stretches of time where we don't talk. We've had sex twice, and after both times she's become so much less engaging. I'm convinced if I don't reach out, we'd never speak again, which is odd because we talk about future plans a lot. Our last moments seeing each other before things go cold (twice now) are always on great terms. For example, both times after hooking up, she was all over me, goodbye kisses, cuddling, etc. I just don't understand.

First time we went a week without speaking, I confronted her and asked if there was a problem between us because she wasn't being engaging, or initiating text. We used to reach out evenly. I didn't want to confront her, but I'd rather not worry about someone who was no longer interested. I had to know where her mind was at. I know she has a little anxiety, but that didn't stop her from texting normally before we got more intimate.

After I confronted her, she apologized and explained how she wasn't in the mood to do anything due to work stress. I told her I understand, and if she's ever in the mood to let me know. A few hours after that she asked me out and we went for dinner. Then the next day after dinner, we hooked up for the second time. Since then, we've had a short snapchat interaction, but overall it's been quiet. We did discuss potential plans after we hooked up however.

I don't want to text meaningless things all day, but it seems like she has no interest in talking to me anymore, or doesn't know how to anymore. Last thing we texted was her telling me she got home, then I thanked her for coming over. No response since then. Yeah, I could reach out again, but I don't want to have to beg for attention even if she suggested possibly coming over today.

Am I just overthinking too much? I'd love to ask her to be my woman, but our communication outside of faec to face has just been trash lately. I also don't know where her mind is at regarding relationships.

She agrees that it was mutual but since I was less intoxicated I should not have initiated the intercourse. 

I’m confused as hell because why would she have me in her bed, change into sexy lingerie, have me eat her but then later say I shouldn’t have gone for the intercourse.

I really liked this girl initially but now I’m starting to wonder if I should walk away right now while I still have the chance. 

I really like her and a 37/m guy who would like to be with a girl with a good career, well educated and likes cats also (I like both cats and dogs) I thought we had a lot in common. 

Guess it’s back to the drawing board and I should cut my losses and move on or should I still send her flowers or something because I might still have something there?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n722ch/you_should_not_have_have_initiated_sex_with_me/

39,n73vtw,1620408307,Is he not that into me?,"I am 27 year old female and i am confused about the signals this guy i like is sending me.   
Ive only know him for 2 months, we have been talking daily. I have defiantly made some mistakes in our communication and i am wondering if that could have pushed him away or if he is actively pushing me away. He is currently in another city so we only chat and videocall.  
I want to hear your opinion.   


* We text daily, but recently his text are shorter and sometimes a day passes between the replies. He also doesn't ask a lot. If i ask him about something he doesn't ask back, just gives a boring reply. This behavior has been going on for 2 weeks, but before he was really active.   

* He has mentioned his ex 3 times in two months. Is that a red flag?  I personally hate when people are talking about their exes. One time it was him telling something about a toxic ex, the other time he told me where he took his ex to travel, the last time was ""my ex got me into this type of music"". He was engaged to someone 2 years ago. Oooof.   

* He wanted to connect me to his mother, i was unsure about it because she doesn't know who i am. He just wanted me to text her. I joked and asked if he has connected a lot of people to his mom and he said ""no, never"". After some lurking i found out that he frequently connects female colleagues to his mom. Not sure what to think about it?   

* He is hot and cold. Sometimes when we call he is all excited and wants to know about me, talks about his family, asks me a lot, shows his dream kitchen, asks about my mom etc. Next time we call he is aloof, doesn't even look into the camera and starts to respond and reply to people. This has only happened once so far, he started to respond to texts...it kinda hurt thinking about how he responds sometimes every other day and when we finally call he shows off how he is texting others. I did tell him about it and he saw nothing wrong.   

* I am having problems with my arm. I work in the art industry and have overworked my wrist to the point of needing surgery. I am waiting for surgery now and the pain is killing me everyday, i am mildly depressed. He knows. But he doesn't show much care. I excused it with he is busy, and he is. But then he informed me that he is video calling his sister 3 times a week because she is going thru a hard time. Dont get me wrong, that is great :) But when it hit me that ive been making excuses for his behavior but actually he has plenty of time to show that he cares if he wanted to . I felt stupid.   

* Art is my work and my hobby. Its kinda off putting that in two months he hasn't cared about asking me what inspires me, even seeing my art...when he was talking about his ex and how she got him into a a certain genre of music, he said that it was fascinating to see how art and music connects because i guess she showed him that . Ive been trying to have those types of conversations with him and not much respons from his side. Thats sucks.  

* He forgets things about me a lot.   


I am going to have a video call with him tomorrow just to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I have a strategy of how to bring up the mom topic and also ask him about his future plans, to see where his mind is at. After that i am not sure. I really like him but i can't accept behavior like that. Also how should i end the situation? Just talk to him less and less and then not respond? Or just say that his behavior is off putting. We are not a couple or dating we are just flirting, but even from a friend i can't accept behavior like that :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n73vtw/is_he_not_that_into_me/

I'm young and all I have really known is online dating, mainly due to being uncomfortable with my sexuality (therefore not engaging in dating at all)  as well as geographical issues (I literally live in the middle of nowhere).

I was just wondering how 'natural encounters' work really, I mean perhaps I have a warped view of it all because I have never really seen it happen but I'm just curious?

42,n74ma0,1620410213,Anyone else struggling because they refuse to settle?,"This has been the crux of my dating experience, which admittedly is entirely online these days. I want to date someone I’m enthusiastic about, and settling has always made me feel like crap—it affects my self-esteem in a noticeable way. The women I’ve considered to be on my level that I *have* dated were totally awesome, but none of them were looking for anything serious, so those all lasted a couple months or whatever and then I’m off trying to find someone new. Obviously when you’re single and horny sometimes you make exceptions, but I’m pretty much at the point that I can’t even do that anymore. Pretending to be into someone grosses me out. It feels manipulative, and that’s not me. 

I feel like my main issue is that women in the 8+ range are inundated with matches and messages and infinite possibility; at the same time, attractive strangers on apps have zero value to them. Dime a dozen. Conversations with them lean toward the pulling teeth variety, and it’s clear many of them just want validation. So what really has to happen is you need to somehow meet them in person and wow them with your presence and vibe, have them see your gait and posture and hear your voice, but getting to that part through OLD is pretty tough and inconsistent. 

I guess I just have to wait until masks come off? If ever?

46,n75d53,1620412109,HELP! I don’t understand men!,"First of all I’d like to clarify that I am an over-thinking, over-analyzing kind of person with a heavily creative mind. Because of this I need some objective point of view because I might be literally directing an Award winning movie in my head. 

So i’ve been talking with a guy for over 2 months now and each day I am more confused than the last. When things began he would text me almost all the time and would call me the kind of nicknames you use in a relationship. Which I thought was super weird because I just met the man, but i let him. He would send me pictures of whatever he was doing and I could feel him a little more present. 

A couple of weeks ago dude started being a little more withdrawn and would text me less but we would speak over the phone longer, which i thought was ok, he showed interest. I try not to be all over him so I kind of “disappear” for some time of the day and just let him reach out. Whenever he does, it will be sort of like reproaching. Asking me why I haven’t texted him..... why the hell can’t he do it first? Anyway, any time I’m kind of absent he will send me songs with cute lyrics and tell me he is thinking about me or just throw hints at me through IG so I start a conversation. Heck but when I do, the dude becomes monosyllabic and only uses emojis, which drives me nuts because I am making up this idea in my mind that he is not interested in talking to me. So I man up and ask him if he would like to FaceTime before we go to bed and the guy just changes attitude, all happy saying that he would love to. Wtf! 

I have this hypothesis in my head, backed up by my therapist, that the guy is starting to get feelings and he is scared as shit and will try to avoid anything that will give me a clue. Are guys like that?

49,n75knh,1620412677,Got ghosted the day of the date and pretty sure she went out with someone else,"This happened a few weeks ago but still fresh in my mind. I was chatting with this girl on tinder for a few days and it was going really well, talking throughout the day and we were super compatible, which is rare on tinder so I was feeling pretty good. I suggest a date for Saturday and she agrees! We were texting until like 2am Friday night and everything was great, she was sending heart emoji’s through text and all.

Then Saturday night comes and silence. I hope she’s got a busy morning so I text around 3pm with a quick “hey we still on for tonight?” This isn’t my first rodeo so as the hours pass I realize this date isn’t happening. I check her tinder profile around 8 pm and notice her miles away from me number is different, she’s like 5 miles away from me instead of 20. So she’s obviously not at home and I kinda put 2 and 2 together and realize she probably went out with someone else. I check her profile a few more times through the night and notice her miles away is back to normal, (meaning she’s back at home) and then about an hour later I’m unmatched.

It seems she went out with another guy, wanted to see how that went and when it went well she unmatched me. Which feels really terrible being the 2nd option when the date was already agreed upon. And I understand I could be wrong. She could have been doing anything else, but at the end of the day she still ghosted me completely out of nowhere with no explanation.

This is mostly a vent about OLD really. This is not the 1st time I’ve been flaked on the day of. Most of the time I’ve gotten some communication though. It’s typically “I have a family member that’s sick I can’t” and then I don’t hear from them again. I know what that means now and it’s whatever. It’s difficult to say I found someone else and I get it. It’s just so hard to find something genuine these days, or get excited about connections when you finally find one. I don’t think we could have hit it off any better. It is so impossible to know where the other’s person head is at on the other side of the screen even though their words are telling you the best.

I’m young, and I know people don’t always have their first experiences at a young age, but they typically don’t try to. I try and I’ve still had huge trouble. Here are a few of my most recent experiences that make me assume relationships just aren’t for me.

My first experience with asking a girl on a date was late January, early February. I’ve asked girls to date me before this (they all said no) but I know you usually go on a couple of dates before it’s official. I texted this girl making a joke about her coming over and hanging out. Then she said that would be cool, and I asked when she wanted to come and she said she didn’t know but she didn’t have any upcoming plans. I’ve been ghosted since that day, Idk why. We’re both 14 (turning 15.) Now she acts like it never happened with my friend we both know.

My next time was sometime in March. I was texting this girl for a little while, she was cool. I said “Hey, I’m gonna get pizza after school. You wanna come?” and I got left on opened and unfollowed. I hate how I never can tell where I’m messing up.

The next time, which was honestly shortly after, I asked a friend of mine. She agreed, we set a time and place. She ghosted two days before. 😐

The last time, probably giving up after this, was today. I asked if she wanted to hang out after school. She said “eh maybe” and I told her maybe Wendy’s but it’s up to her. Left on seen. She was never a dry texter, but based off past experiences, Idk if it’s worth trying again. I’m kinda tired of putting in effort and never getting anything back. It’s like tunnel vision.

I'm going by the assumption that she's talking to other guys because it's OLD and she's super pretty and cool. What can I do to keep her interested and let her know I'm still interested until the date? Do I still text her, or kind of wait until closer to the date?

58,n76plj,1620415589,What do you guys think: Is he interested or not?,"So there is a guy I met on Hinge \[M, 36\] and we had a very robust texting relationship for about 3 weeks that lead to us meeting in person. He invited me over to his place for dinner. I \[M, 28\] thought it was a pretty good first date. We spoke about a wide range of stuff and we poked fun at each other the way kids who have crushes on each other would, but we know it's harmless fun.

Closer ot the end of the night, I asked him about his top3 kareoke songs and he (which I thought was so much fun) started performing each of them from 1-3. He was a great performer and I found it entertaining. 

When it came to my turn to share, he asked me the same question and I told him my number one, and somehow he managed to divert the conversation to something else which lead us to watching random Youtube videos on his couch. He then proceeeded to try to make out with me and invited me to his bedroom but I made it perfectly clear I wasn't there to have sex with him. In fact, just toprevent myself from hooking up with guys on the first date, I always wear an old underwear...like, the ones with holes in it that you mean to throw out but haven't because you find it comfortable as hell? (Or maybe that's just me \*shurgs\*)

Anyhow, I digress. He ended up jerking off while we kissed and came on himself. I shortly thereafter left (as it was getting very late) and thanked him for the food, entertainment and a (mostly) fun evening.   


Since that day, the texts have gotten so infrequent, days would pass without hearing from him. And when I do, it would be a short ""What's up?"". I would respond with full honesty and he would respond a day or two later with ""so what did you end up doing?"" or something to that effect. I have stopped responding in long paragraphs and just decided to match his energy. However, I asked him if he would be interested in another date this coming weekend and he said he would be busy working for for the next couple weekends and opted for a phone call instead. He didn't offer a date, or time for said phone call; and when I asked about it he did not respond. That was two days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is different form the hetero-normative questions you guys would usually get here but I thought I would still ask: **Is he interested or not?**

""Hey, you’re probably wondering why I’ve been quiet last few days. I know you’re really busy with work too, so I didn’t want to interrupt. I enjoy your company so much but I don’t want to waste your time any further - I don’t think us dating is something I can pursue right now. You’re beautiful and amazing. I just need a bit more effort and chemistry there than what there is between us right now.""

I have been on dating apps for two years and I see a common occurrence that is oddly strange to me. I match with someone with very similar interest and we hit it off very fast. It gets to the point where we message back to each other very quickly. Then out of the blue, they stop messaging, even though the conversation was going well. I understand there is a lot of ghosting in these apps, but that usually happens when the conversation gets stale or if we have been talking for too long and it does not head anywhere. For example, I recently matched with someone, she messaged first and we were talking about our love for animals and video games. we shared pictures of our pets and it was going great. Then ghosted. This is within a few hours of matching. Some people tell me I might get ghosted because I don't ask for a first date fast enough but this happens literally hours from matching. I know you are not supposed to get closure in dating apps but I wonder what happened. Lost interest? found a better match? randomly bumped into a stranger and found love at first sight?

Then, we were talking Tuesday night and I responded to something and I've heard nothing. He watches all of my insta stories promptly.

72,n78ksd,1620420494,"Remember that some people are simply turned off by people who are kind to them, and are addicted to tension and drama.","Often we tend to look at new partners through this lens that they are somehow marginally better than us, or more logical, or more emotionally mature.... even if just by a small degree. However, most people have screwy baggage to work through, and a good portion of people will completely ignore their bad patterns, toxic narratives and annoying habits to the point where they cycle in and out of relationships without much realization that they are sabotaging themselves and leaving a trail of destruction behind them.

My good friend of 20 years? She has dated 2 men in the past couple years who were devoted to her, mature and well liked by all of her friends and family... but guess what, her biggest complaint was that they were ""too nice"" and ""boring"". Despite the fact that one of them was a published author and the other was probably the funniest and most engaging person i've seen her with. The more people loved them, and gushed over how wonderfully they were together, the less she liked him. She would literally convince herself OUT of the relationship the moment someone said how great they were, which is not typical of couples who are looking for their friends and families approval. The men she pines over are usually jobless, vague about commitment, and consumed by either tattoos, cars or baby mama drama. 

One of my male friends has been depressed about being single for the last decade...despite the fact he's been on over 100 dates since I met him 4 years ago. He can't sustain a relationship longer than 3 months before getting bored and cheating on them. The women he pines over? Usually the ones so far out of ANYONES league that even the Hemsworth brothers would have a hard time getting into bed with them. One time he told me he ""lost respect"" for a girlfriend he had when she made him a valentines day gift. He was so repulsed by the act of affection that he promptly left and hooked up with some random girl at the bar. 

Every person who had their heart broken by these two people felt there was something wrong with them, and it sucked to hear about the long phone calls, and pleading for answers. It made me realize that we often have too much faith in other people and take their actions so personally that we immediately conclude we must be a terrible partner if they can't see how great and caring and loving we can be to them.

**3) Too many options**. Having too many options just makes it super easy to give-up or look for the next best thing. People simply don't work on the relationship and go back to swiping or exploring on the app for the next match.

80,n79zig,1620424245,Shitty date story,"It happened a few years ago.

 I met the guy on Tinder, he seemed decent if with a bit weird sense of humor. We talked for a fee days and agreed on get a coffee- like date. All good, right?

Well, apparently he lied about a few things, first, his age. I was 21 at the time, in his profile he said he was 23, while in reality he was 20. Same for his height, which for me is important (I like taller than me guys which isn't really that hard to achieve since I'm 5'3 myself, and its my personal preference, not to offend anyone). He said he was 5'7, and yet was 5'2 at best. Really, its not that hard to be honest about such things is it? Its gonna come out anyway, whats the point of lying?

Well, all of that aside, we decided to meet at 5pm and then head to our destination. I got ready, dressed up nicely- first impressions are important and all that, and waited. And waited. And then some more. When I was just about to leave I saw some guy running towards me and stopped, I honestly didn't think it was him, looked different than the pictures and not dressed for a date.

He was wearing slightly stained sweatpants and a few size too big, wrinkled, sweaty shirt That's was fucking dirty. And slides. I obviously wasn't too impressed he looked like he just got out of the bed, went for a run and came to see me after it. I mean, you're going to a date dude, not to get a beer after sitting on a couch all day watching football.

Whatever. We went to the coffee house, while for some reason he walked two feet in front of me(?),ordered drinks and a snack (he didn't offer to pay for it), then proceeded to a hellish awkward date, if you can call it that.

The guy seemed nervous, so i led the conversation, hoping he'llease into it or something, but the whole time it felt like an interview or a therapy session, and with me initiating everything it was sort of exhausting and not at all enjoyable to me. The part where you get to know each other didn't really happen, he would just sometimes drop weird or inappropriate jokes and then try to explain them to me if I wouldn't laugh. For some reason he thought that telling me he tried to hook up with an older woman was a good idea, but it just made me more uncomfortable. Seriously, what the fuck was that, trying to impress me somehow?? I couldn't wait for it to end.

And when we finally parted ways he simply tried to kiss me like hello? Consent? Lord gracious i couldn't walk away fast enough and then swiftly ghosted him.

Long story short, if anyone read this mess, please, dress up nicely for your dates and don't throw around inappropriate 'jokes', it won't leave a good first impression. And for the sake of everyone, be a decent person and ask first before kissing someone.

The height and weight of the ""average"" woman in the US is 5'3 and 170lbs. (source: CDC) 

The amount of women under, lets say, 130lbs are about 13.5%-27.8% depending on age groups. Those are closest reported weights and could be off. 

I see a whole spew of absolute bitterness/resentment, and I understand that it hurts feeling rejected. But then I see so many other comments about what men want here and it's apparent to me many dudes have NO clue what the average woman looks like/does. 

You want a thinner woman? The average woman isn't thin. You want a woman who's not a single mom? Over a certain age, many people have children. You don't want a woman over 30? Okay, you've eliminated more potentials. 

It's OKAY to only want a small % of the population and it's OKAY to have preferences, but I'm tired of men here pretending they'd throw themselves at any Sally without having standards.

When men talk about social media girls/Instagram/Onlyfans etc, they're talking about a small % of conventionally hot women who use their looks to get what they desire. When men say ""any average woman has a lineup of guys at her feet,"" they're talking about ATTRACTIVE women, not *just* average women. You don't have to be a model to be conventionally attractive, but it's still a small % of women. 

I think this is where the disconnect comes from.

90,n7auyn,1620426695,[F26] having trouble dating,"I’ve been feeling a little defeated about dating 😞 and it’s been hard on me. I don’t know where to start? Or where to find a guy that actually wants to build something? 

I’ve only had two relationships. Neither have worked out, despite being long term. I do have men that pursue me, but most of the time it’s a professional athlete or a friend. I’m just not interested in either. 

I consider myself to be good looking. I have my own income above $70,000. I’m family oriented, I can cook and clean. I’m honest and straightforward. I’ve never cheated in my life. I have a college degree. I’m not trying to be a pick me or anything. 

I just want a good man :/ somebody I can build a life with and explore with. I’m just not too sure where to start? I just wanted to know if anyone has suggestions? Is there a Reddit thread I can meet people in? I haven’t had any luck on dating apps. I just feel like most guys want something temporary on there. I live in Los Angeles btw!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7auyn/f26_having_trouble_dating/

92,n7b35x,1620427341,Girl hasnt responded to cancelled date.,"In short I met a girl online we talked for a few days and made plans to meet up, the morning of she cancels becasue her mother had called her saying g she had to go home becasue her brother had covid really bad but she wanted to reschedule.

It took it as shes telling the truth and said let me know when you get back and we can setup something. It's been 5 days without hearing from her. I'm wondering if I should wait assuming shes still at her parnets house or shoukd I send a text checking in seeing how brother is doing, just to get the convo flowing again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7b35x/girl_hasnt_responded_to_cancelled_date/
93,n7b62h,1620427577,"Would this be really, really weird?","Hello, essentially there is this girl who works at a market near my place that I frequent almost everyday. My friend and I (worth noting hes very much a confident alpha type, I'm more laid back in general noticed a girl working there a few months ago and we both were like whoaaa shes very good looking. Anyways since I mainly go myself I've had quite a few encounters with her, and even dropped my entire bag of groceries after she bagged them and we had one of those both reach for the same thing and look at each other cliche moments but didn't really think anything of it, basically just brief encounters as I've never actually checked out (from shopping) with her. Usually I go looking like shit as I'm not really trying to meet anyone at the grocery store.

Anytime my friend and I were in there she would stare directly at us really boldly and wouldn't try to hide it, didn't really think anything of it though and figured it was my friend playing usual eye flirtation games everywhere we go lol. Last weekend though I was in there pretty hungover on saturday morning wearing hoodie and sweats and I felt someone watching me while I was waiting in line on my phone, looked up and she was literally ignoring her customer and staring at me so intensely it was kind of insane, almost like a spotlight was the feeling I got, and I then realized she had probably been staring at me every other time. A couple days later I matched with this girl on bumble and figured out it was her until she messaged me the next day ""Hii"", I knew she was single since one time she was buying some groceries presumably after her shift and opened tinder and was screenshotting and sending her friends the messages from sooooo many guys without replying, which I just found funny because it basically affirms dating apps are so oversaturated.

Anyways I'm essentially just wondering if I should go for it, don't want to make her uncomfortable at work though and I'm kind of avoiding going back since I straight up said ""I feel like we've met before"" which was prob a little dumb, but I just wanted to highlight like yes I saw you staring at me like that, she didn't unmatch or anything. I'm pretty tall (6'3) and she is too, but I'm currently on a weight loss goal and have lost like 75lbs so far and transformed pretty drastically, yet my confidence and self-image is still very low so I figured she wouldn't have been attracted to me. I'm not really trying to date at the moment since I still have some improvement to do but obviously there has to be a starting point.

TLDR: Girl at store I go to almost daily has been staring at me super intensely and we matched on bumble and she messaged me, I didn't want to act like I wasn't aware so kind of want to ask her out in person but not sure if this would be really weird.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7b62h/would_this_be_really_really_weird/
94,n7b767,1620427666,Should I delete girl I was seeing on social media?,"So I was seeing this girl for like 3-4 months and honestly it was really fun but looking back she was never really available (emotionally and stuff like that) but I was just had like love goggles on so I didn’t see it. It was little stuff like coming to dates hungover, not really making the time for me sometimes, and she never really did take thing serious.

Once I started to sort of progress things she broke things off saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship and didn’t like the way things were begging serious. Turns out she just wanted something casual the whole time but sort of got carried away and so we went from seeing each other once a week, talking about things we wanted to do in the future, and know she’s just a stranger again.

Anyways, I saw her post a story on social media and i don’t know why but my stomach just got all queasy and I felt it drop a little. I mean I really liked her and we would just cuddle all the time and just stare into each other’s eyes and just kiss each other, but I felt like she understood me.

She asked for my social media’s but I plan on just unfriending her just on Snapchat bc that’s really the only social media that I use a lot. The only thing is that I don’t want to seem like I got hurt over her breaking things off, but seeing her smile or just out an about hurts my heart. 

It wouldn’t seem petty or weird right, I just don’t want to feel this every time I see her story or something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7b767/should_i_delete_girl_i_was_seeing_on_social_media/
95,n7b7y3,1620427729,Weird or am I crazy ?,Ok so I’ve been talking to this guy and we were supposed to go on a date . Before we even go on this “ date” this guy texts me and asks if I’m on the pill.... ok I understand it’s great your safe but it’s just an odd question to text me before I’ve even met him . It’s very presumptuous as if I will be having sex with him and made me uncomfortable. In no means am I a prude I’ve had sex on firs dates etc . It just made me uncomfortable Bc it’s as if he’s expecting it now .

96,n7bdd8,1620428162,Should I meet up with this guy again?," A couple of years ago this guy and I went out we went out to the movies, the arcade, and then we had sex. A few months after that, he said he had a great time with me. But that he thought we shouldn't go out anymore. And that he was sorry if he made me think we were anything more than friends. (Initially, I asked him if he wanted to be friends with benefits. I think he may have been in a relationship at the time but he said he wanted to be friends with benefits) Well at the end of last year he messaged me saying that he wanted to see me again. I told him I was surprised because he said he didn't want to see me anymore. He said he didn't want to cheat but now that his girlfriend is leaving him he doesn't have to cheat.  


I did have fun with him and I like his company but I've been talking to other guys. And I just don't get why he'd say he wants to see me again when he said he didn't want to hang out anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7bdd8/should_i_meet_up_with_this_guy_again/
97,n7bfnm,1620428349,Weird feeling,"So just a little back story. I basically decided in high school that I wasn’t going to look for a relationship because I got my heart broken and didn’t care to have that happen again. Fast forward to February of this year, I got into a relationship by pretty weird circumstances, but I was insanely happy. As happy as I had ever been. I really thought she was the one and she made it seem that way too but she ended up breaking up with me last month.

I took it pretty hard when it happened. I had no appetite, no will to live, couldn’t get a full nights sleep, and I was just all around a mess. Now I’m not as happy as I was, but I’m doing okay. We talked for about a month after it happened but I cut off any contact because it was making things worse. I’m still pretty lonely and I’m trying to adjust to how things were before and it’s weird because I was lonely for years before her, but it’s worse now that I know what it feels like to be loved and wanted. Regardless, I have goals and places I want to get to.

The only thing that worries me is that I won’t be able to find anyone like her. To me, she was perfect and I feel like I’ll always be comparing anyone I meet to her but I hope that changes. I just feel like I’ll never meet someone as beautiful as her who cared so much about me. I’m not going to try to find a relationship anytime soon but if it happens it happens I guess.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7bfnm/weird_feeling/
98,n7bgji,1620428414,"If you meet a girl you like, ask for her number before it's too late...","This week I was taking a work related course, everyone there were guys my age except for one girl. I thought she was really pretty but I didn't talk to her the first day as we were all strangers. After the following days everyone got to know each other better and I conversated a little with her in group.

Today was the last day at the course, so I decided I might as well go for it before it's too late and I never see her again. During one of the breaks I approached her and struck conversation, it went surprisingly smoothly and we hit it off very well, she was a bit shy but we turned out to have some stuff in common. In the later breaks I found she approached me and sometimes waited for me by the door until I left the class room so we could go on break together.

We had a final test for the course and I figured that once we were all done we would have a recap to wrap it up and say good bye to each other. I thought that  I could ask for her number or something then before we all part ways, or at least ask if she's interested in hanging out later. However she finished her test very quickly, gave it to the instructor, told him she had to catch a bus and before I knew it she was out the door and gone.

The only thing I got from her was her first name and the place she lived. I can not find her on any social media but she didn't strike me as the girl who even has social media in the first place.

So as the title suggests; things can happen very quickly so ask for her number before she's gone. All I can really do now is hope we cross paths again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7bgji/if_you_meet_a_girl_you_like_ask_for_her_number/
99,n7bjrl,1620428660,Just saying,"I’ve been single for awhile now.
And haven’t had much success in dating.

But lately at work I see couples together and it makes me yearn for that feeling.

Now I’m not saying everyone’s relationship is perfect because I don’t know them.

But the way they look at each other The silent communication that only they know.

The smiles when their eyes meet. 
The feeling that they are happy.

I know what that feels like. And it makes me yearn for love and a relationship.

Isn’t that what we all want. It makes my heart hurt to think It may not happen. 

Especially when I have so much love to give and want it in return. I want someone to look at me that way again

But here we are in a different time where you have online dating read a profile, message, FaceTime. We use these things to date.

Can you really get to know someone this way. I find it difficult.

People can be anything they want on these platforms.

So who do you meet a person who has made themselves someone they wish they were.

Or are you meeting some who tells you what they think you want to here.

What ever happen to being your authentic self and being happy with who you are.

And if they like you and you like them it becomes easy. Because you don’t have to think about a thing just be you.

I know I’m going hear about it. But it is really that easy.

When I use to meet someone if I liked you and you like me we would see where it went.

And if if for some reason it didn’t work that was ok We kept it moving no hard feelings. 

I miss those days. But today there’s so much mistrust, ghosting all kinds of tactics that has nothing to do with love.

That makes it hard to find love at any age

But I believe in love and after this pandemic I’m going to make it a point. To just be me like I’ve always been and hopefully I’ll find the love I’m looking for. My heart is open.

Be your authentic self and let’s go find the love we want and deserve.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7bjrl/just_saying/
