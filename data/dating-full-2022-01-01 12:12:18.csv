Also, TRIGGER WARNING possible assault. 

I (25F) have been dating this guy ‚ÄúH‚Äù (27M) for about 3 months now. He is funny, we have many things in common and overall very sweet. He has been the perfect gentleman on all of our dates. We have gone out on about 10-12 dates‚Ä¶about 1 a week since meeting. On our 5th date I had an allergic reaction and he rushed me home. I invited him up to hang a bit since we had to cut the night short. I took some allergy meds which ended up knocking me out very quickly probably since I had been drinking earlier. H had tucked me into bed, plugged up my phone, and left a glass of water for me on my night stand. Very sweet - at least I thought. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and H slept over for the first time and we hooked up. I woke up to him giving me head. We had a great night together and while we hadn‚Äôt discussed this particular preference before I just went with the flow. It wasn‚Äôt until later that morning we were chatting and he mentioned how hard it is to wake up me up. I am a heavy and deep sleeper. Its caused me issues in the past. I can sleep through almost anything (loud noises, my dog jumping on my bed, even water on my face). But his comment made me wonder what else he had done and for how long. However, I brushed it aside since everything else was great. 

On to last night. H was going to a NYE party at a friend‚Äôs place a few blocks away from me. I am getting over a nasty cold (not COVID) and decided to stay in. H got a little tipsy &amp; didn‚Äôt want to drive home or crash at his friends since there were already a few folks sleeping over. So he asked if he could come over and crash with me. I agreed but told him I was still a little sick and super tired so I am going to go straight to bed. He said that was fine. He came over and within 15 minutes I was sleep. About 2 hours later I woke up to him fingering me and jerking off. H just looks and says ‚Äúgood your up‚Äù and tries to get on top and kiss me.

I immediately freak out and tell him to leave. I told him he had crossed a line but he said he was only trying to ‚Äúturn me on‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm freaking out and second guessing all the times I‚Äôve fallen alseep around him. 

I have no idea if I am overreacting or if I should go to the police. I don‚Äôt have proof of anything but I feel so violated. Outside of this he the nicest guy I‚Äôve dated in a very long time.

The twist is, we are in the same uni and the same uni accommodation, same flat but different rooms, with another other 6 people. We were together for 6 months and new each other before moving to uni.

The people in my flat are my friends as well as hers so we are trying to be civil for the sake of the other flat mates. She goes on nights out with other different friends.

We don‚Äôt go out together but it‚Äôs impossible for me to not see her in the kitchen, social events, same club etc. We also have a flat group chat where she can see if i viewed/ opened group messages. 

Im back home right now due to the Christmas holidays and after two weeks of going no contact she reached out to me, telling me she misses me, and wants to speak to me. 

I understand stand this is not the best situation, we have a little over 14 weeks left in the accommodation then we move out for good.

In terms of no contact, how do i come about this ? She knows I‚Äôve opened group chat messages but not hers. 

I will be seeing her almost everyday when i go in two weeks back to uni so what do i do ? 

How do i reply ? Do i reply ? or leave on opened or delivered ?

So to start, I‚Äôm an early 20s male with no dating experience before this. I‚Äôve been using dating apps for like 3 years and have never went on a date besides with this one girl (f22). We matched in late November and have went on 2 dates. The latest one the week before Christmas. One where I came out to her and one where she came out to me (hour distance). 

Anyway on the dates I thought they went good, especially the 2nd one. She kept cuddling with me and I had my first kiss and on the 2nd date more of the same and we made out. We held hands everywhere we walked and when we got in my car she still wanted to hold my hand and was like warming it up because it was cold. After the date we got to talking about name origins and one of mine meant gift from god and she told me that I was like a gift from god to her and that she thought I was making her life better by being in it and it made me happy, because I felt the same. And then she also told me a few days ago that she couldn‚Äôt believe that someone like me with good looks and good personality could ever like her. So like just throwing that in there to show you guys that I think/thought she was into me. 

We also block texted every day since we matched in late November and here‚Äôs where the problem has come in. She hasn‚Äôt texted me back in 2 days and tomorrow we‚Äôre supposed to hang out. She always returns my texts within a few hours mostly because they‚Äôre like long blocks of text so it takes a bit to type out, but never two days or even one. I‚Äôm a classic overthinker and as shameful as it is to admit, I‚Äôve been feeling like shit while I wait for her to send me something back. I haven‚Äôt double texted yet, but I kind of want to even though it‚Äôs a huge no no according to everything I‚Äôve seen. Am I just overthinking or should I send out a text to her? I just hate feeling like I‚Äôve been put on the back burner. Another small thing I did notice was that she had unmatched me off the dating app, but this was like only 3 days after talking and before the dates and everything. But like I just can‚Äôt shake the idea she could have another guy lined up and I‚Äôm like the 2nd choice. Even though we talked every day and she‚Äôd tell me everything she did and we‚Äôd have super deep convos and everything. Like it seems implausible that she was talking to other guys, but I have no idea. I personally can‚Äôt even go on the apps anymore without thinking about her. Anyway, some advice would be nice.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144397,public,self,Am I overthinking or is something wrong?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtp9ci/am_i_overthinking_or_is_something_wrong/,no_ads,0,,,

If everything went well, the plan was for me to stay the weekend and go back Sunday. Only thing was that I lived an hour from him without a car but he said he had no problem picking me up and dropping me off.

I told him that I was hesitant about the date being at his home because most times when guys have dates at their homes they expect sex (at least in my experience). He reassured that theete was no pressure and that we wouldn't do anything I didn't want to do so I went ahead with the date.

At the end of the night when we were in bed cuddling things started turning to a more sexual direction than I was comfortable with. At first it was just making out (which I was cool with) but then he started to grope me so I pulled away and told I wasn't ready for that yet.

He then asked if I thought we were going to have sex at all this weekend and I said that I honestly didn't know and that I wanted things to be no pressure like he said cause I wasn't comfortable yet.

He then told he didn't realize how much he was going to dislike the drive to my house and said that if we didn't have sex that weekend that he couldn't see a relationship with me because he didn't want to make that drive for a relationship that was going to progress slowly in sexual terms. 

To me I interpreted this to mean that the drive to house would only be worth if I gave him sex, despite the fact he said he was looking for a serious relationship.

He ended paying for an uber for me back to my house last night and the experience left me feeling very uncomfortable and confused.

I often talk to guys on tinder who are like an hour from me and this is the second time something like this has happened irl but a lot of the guys I message also think they're owed sex if that have to make the drive. This is very frustrating cause I live in a small town with not many potential dates around so I have to go father out if a bigger pool of guys to talk to.

Do all guys feel this way?? I tell every guy I'm talking to that I'm looking for something serious and that I'm not into hookups and yet on FIRST DATES they always try to turn kisses (with again I'm okay with) to second/third base and then get upset/mad/disappointed when I don't want it. 

I'm at the point where I might start telling guys that I'm not interested in anything sexual at all for the first month of knowing them so I can weed out guys who only want a girlfriend mainly for sex. 

I get the sex is an important part of a relationship but the guys I meet up with always try to take thing 0-100 even though they claim they're looking or something serious. It's almost like sex is the foremost priority for them in relationships instead of trying to see if there's compatibility or an emotional connection.

I‚Äôm on mobile so please excuse formatting. 

We‚Äôve been together 3.5 years and our sex life has basically died and i think it‚Äôs because of how much he watches porn. 
We used to fuck like rabbits when we first got together, about 1.5 years ago, our sex life took a turn and we haven‚Äôt really brought it back. 
I‚Äôve voiced my concerns about the lack of intimacy multiple times, I have literally cried and begged him to fuck me more than once every 2-3 months. Even to just touch me more. Any time I try to initiate, I can‚Äôt get him hard and he doesn‚Äôt help me out. I can come out of the shower, completely naked, walk over to him and try to be sexy and he acknowledges my presence but never does anything about the tits that are in his face. 
I recently went on a trip to visit my best friend for a week. When I came back home, he was at work and I noticed his laptop in a different place than the usual spot. It was open and I picked it up to move it back to its spot and accidentally hit a key and the screen turned on and it was on Pornhub. I typically have no issue with porn but what I saw next changed my mind. 
I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done this next part but I was just curious. I looked at his history for the week I was gone. It was nothing but porn. Almost 10 videos a day. My heart sunk to my stomach. I then clicked on the different months to view the history, all porn. Almost everyday. For the last 6 months. 
At that point, I was so mad I was crying. I felt to unwanted, hurt, jealous and sick. He knows how I feel about porn. He used to wake me up from jacking off in bed next to me and I told him it was becoming a problem since it was every other night. He said it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot anything sensual, just helps him sleep‚Äù. I told him fucking his girlfriend before bed can help him sleep too but he said ‚Äúimagine I was asking you for more sex. I‚Äôd look like a pig. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair of you to say that‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt think there is an issue and always makes me feel guilty for wanting to have sex with him. His solution to the problem is for me to go find someone else to fuck if it‚Äôs ‚Äúthat big of a deal to me‚Äù. 
I really don‚Äôt want to stay with someone who would rather watch porn than have sex with me. It‚Äôs been messing with my mental health and self esteem. I‚Äôm not financially stable enough to live on my own or have anyone I can move in with so I don‚Äôt really know what my options are but I know I deserve better than this. 
I just don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about any of this without it turning into a big fight like it usually does and nothing getting resolved.

He pursued me. To be honest, I actually didn't even respond to his second message and assumed this would be another match that fizzles. But he tried again, saying something sweet like ""I can't get your smile off my mind"". Annnnnnd I fell for it. Once we started messaging again, we would do it for hours on end, eventually all throughout the day every single goddamn day. He had a silver tongue in text too. I was smitten. Couldn't get him off my mind. Couldn't wait to meet him.

He was going through some career changes, so we planned our first date to be Sunday December 18th. He lives 2 hours away and I was gonna make the drive to him to see his studio, he's a music producer and I thought his job sounded fascinating and I wanted to meet him and see what he did and his studio. Well, the Friday evening before we were due to meet he cancels. His excuse seemed reasonable, and while I was bummed, he initiated the reschedule for NYE weekend. So I went with it.

We continued texting as usual. Then, I noticed when I would ask about logistics of our pending date, he would go radio silent. For like hours. He would excuse this by saying he forgot his phone, was busy, etc... But it felt off. I mean we would be in the middle of banter, I would ask, and then boom, no texts for like 8 hours.

But eventually we agreed upon meeting today. Again, me driving to him. I was starting to have my doubts because of what I stated above, and I just felt like suddenly he seemed for reserved.

Yesterday, we are texting back and forth as usual when I try to verify that we are indeed still on for today and my plan was to solidify a time. Again, abrupt discontinuation of texts for like 8 hours. Now, we are also FB friends and so as time went on when I was scrolling FB I would see periodically when he logged in and out of FB, yet he was still not responding. I texted again saying I was starting to feel a bit strung along, could he please let me know about our date.

He gets back to me at like 10pm last night. Saying he was ""away from his phone all day"" (nope, you've been on FB) and that he was feeling overwhelmed. Then again silence. So I say I'm sorry he's feeling overwhelmed, ask if it's about anything in particular. And say, I don't want to be a burden or add on to his stress, but I'm getting the sense you're not interested in meeting anymore, can you please just let me know?

He waits like another 30 to 45 minutes to tell me ""I need to pass on tomorrow"". 

And that's it. That's all I've heard from a dude that texted with me and flirted with me and led me on for over a month. He cancels our date on NYE at like 10 pm. 

WTF. I'm so over dating. I'm super bummed. I was really looking forward to meeting him. I really thought this could be something. And now I feel stupid that a man I never met, but felt a connection to, for whatever reason made a complete 180 and blew me off. What the hell is that even about?

It felt like I was carrying most of the relationship and wasn't getting much back in return regarding emotional support and appreciation through verbal sentiment. I expressed this to her respectfully, and she told me that she couldn't provide this to me. The only times I got these words from her was when I asked how she felt about me/us; it didn't feel genuine because I needed to ask.

This became a real issue for me. I started to shut down, not putting forth much effort since I was upset at the whole situation. If someone I was dating brought up an issue to me that they were experiencing, I would try my best to change for them and make them happy if I had care and love for them.

But it seems like my girlfriend didn't care enough to put forth much effort to keep our relationship alive. I am beyond hurt because I thought that if you love someone, you would fight and make things work. I now know that this person was not right for me. Seeing as a minor issue could not be fixed, it would be hard to believe that we would be able to make it through actual problems down the line.

What I've learned from this whole situation is not to settle for less than you are worth, and if someone isn't providing something for you that you need in a relationship.. it may not be correct.

It went for about an hour and a half and seemed to go reasonably well (though as I have aspergers I'm not the best at judging these things - I only started dating six months, have gone out on first dates with about 8 or so women, only really progressed things further with one - I had a couple of rejections for second dates but I rejected the others as I wasn't feeling it). We both had plans that afternoon to buy christmas presents and to go away for Christmas, I came back a couple of days ago, she is coming back tomorrow.

I was going to hold off on texting her, given that we were both busy and I was 100 percent sure on how it had gone. Much to my surprise she texted me that night asking me about how I went buying Christmas presents. Since then we've texted back and forth more than 50 times.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume she must have at least some level of interest in me if not only she initiated the text but has proceeded to have that many texts with me so I intend to text her back and ask her out for a second date. For the first date we were originally going to go out that night before our plans had changed and I had suggested that we do mini putt putt and she seemed to think that would be fun so I'm thinking I might float that again as a second date idea and there are plenty of restaurants and bars etc around there to move on after if things go well.
