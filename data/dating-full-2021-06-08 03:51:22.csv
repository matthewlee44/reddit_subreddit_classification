So said guy and I met 4 years ago. We casually dated for a few months and he then ended things. We were both in really odd places in our lives, me being only 18 and just starting college (thus unfortunately developing borderline alcoholism and an  addiction to adderall) and him having things of his own to sort out. In retrospect, I think he was definitely in love with me. He said so when he was drunk one time and then another (both during the 6 months we dated) said I love you-he was on cocaine when he said it and I didn’t understand the drug at the time, so I just dismissed him, figuring he was not thinking clearly. *note* he doesn’t do a bunch of drugs, it was a one time thing for him. 

So after we “broke up” or whatnot, we hooked up on and off for about another year or so. We both then got into several  other relationships and did not see each other for two years. 9 months ago we hooked up again but it ended up being a one-night stand, which I now believe was mostly due to me being cold in result of just coming out of another fallout with an ex of mine.  He had tried to cuddle with me and I just kinda turned over, along with wanting me to stay for breakfast in the morning and me just leaving at 7am. When I told him after that night that I wasn’t looking for anything, he was kinda upset and said, “yeah, you made that very clear”.

So now, 9 months later, I recently replied to one of his Snapchat stories because I genuinely wanted to know more about what he posted. He ended up telling me that he would like to sleep with me again, which I agreed to. 

Alas, brings us to last night-we hooked up again and had a great time (or so I think he did, kinda what I’m trying to future out). Every time I see him, I find it so easy to just be open with him. It’s always like nothing had ever changed. Most of the time we watched TV together and ate popcorn. 

After last night, I had a huge epiphany. I realized that not only do I still have feelings for him, but I don’t think they ever left. I feel like he has always been that one person that continues to linger in the background, yet we always find our way back to each other. 

Question #1: 

Does he still have feelings for me too? Here are some examples of things that were said/done by him last night that make me think there might be a possibility: 

-he was more affectionate with me than required for just a hookup-we held hands a bit, we cuddled, and he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist in a way that almost felt romantic. 

-he asked me personal questions about my life and opened up about some rather difficult things in his own. We definitely got into some touchy subjects, yet when he was on the receiving end he did not seem bothered or taken back at all and listened intently. He seemed like he actually cared. 

-we both said before that I wouldn’t stay over because we don’t sleep well together-so when I was leaving he asked me if I needed anything to help me stay awake and told me to please drive home safe (in a way that seemed more than just respectful) 

-somehow we ended up talking about our futures including kids and such, and when we both said that we would like to have our kids home schooled, he kind of had this endearing look in his eyes. 

-THE SEX. It didn’t really seem like pure hookup sex. It definitely seemed a bit more intimate than that. A lot of kissing, a lot of closeness. 

-he took the time to show me a clip from a movie that he thought was funny that he thought I would enjoy as well. 

-he asked me what I had going on tomorrow (as in today now) Still not sure why but he did. 

-this is the thing that really made me consider him still having feelings for me as well-when I was leaving, it was almost like he hesitated, which he also did 9 months ago. He just looked at me in a way I can’t adequately describe. We both have Aspergers so I think it can be difficult for both of us to read these sort of things sometimes, but in my mind, it definitely seemed like it was a rather endearing look. 

-before I left, I mentioned how insane it was that we met 4 years ago-and he responded, “I know, and we’ve both grown so much since then”. He said it in a way that, I’m not quite sure, almost seemed like he was longing for something? I’m not sure but to me it seemed like their was something behind that. 

Question #2: what do I do? 

I am 100% sure I still have feelings for him. Furthermore, I feel that with how much each of us have grown whilst apart, we would have the potential to be a great, healthy couple for many reasons-which I will not list since this has already been long enough, lol. 

I personally think I should just tell him, after doing this on and off thing for FOUR years. I mean, what are we going to do, keep booking up after every failed relationship we have until one of us is married?! 

I want to play it cool and I see how that might be the better approach but I also feel like it has been so long that I just kinda need to cut to the chase. I think part of the issue we had when we first met was that either of us communicated our feelings, and it left us both heartbroken. For example, if he would have shown more interest at that time, I would have had reason to believe he was serious when he told me he loved me. 

My alternative to just flat-out telling him is to ask him if he wants to come to a show with me sometime (which we already talked about prior to the hookup and he said he’d be up for it). But I also don’t want all of this confusion lingering around, because even if he DOES have feelings for me, he may still think I just want to hook up due to how cold I was when we hooked up 9 months ago. 

TL;DR: Someone I once casually dated that I have been hooking up with on and off for years now is back in my life again and I still have feelings for him and I think he does too.

Very soft spoken and pretty, rather similar to me personality wise. In fact, we share many interests, such as the music we enjoy listening to, or the tv shows we watch. One of my favorite moments with her so far was a time when the two of us, wasted from a night of partying, sang along to our favorite songs, with our arms around each other while walking to the clubs.

Being around her and talking to her often makes me happier in general, even a day of stressfulness or boredom can turn a full 180 on my mood when I talk with her, never failing to make my day brighter. Occasionally when she gets too close to me physically, my heart skips a beat. I've even had a dream one night, involving the two of us cuddling on the couch.

On the other hand, she has shown some possible signs of interest towards me, such as touching my arm or shoulder when I make her laugh or when others in our friend group tease me, and most times when I say something during conversations within our friend group, she tends to listen (though this may be because I tend to be rather shy, so the moments that I do talk are less frequent compared to many others in our friend group). She's also complemented me a few times, saying she likes my hair and my clothing, even going as far as saying I'm like a model.

However, the most notable signs that she may have feelings I've noticed so far are:

- during a game of tag in my hall, one rule stated that linking arms with another player makes you immune to being tagged. In two instances she has linked both her arms around mine, when linking just one arm is enough, and I had not seen her initiate arm linking with any of our other friends.

- during a lab session where she was my partner, she had to hold onto my arm in order to attach something. She held my arm for a noticably longer time than necessary, long enough for me get slightly nervous. I thought this may be because I work out rather often, and also play golf every weekend, so my forearms have rather defined muscles that have garnered many compliments from my friends. 

- In another instance, she got to see my entire bare upper body's muscle definition when our friend group went on a trip to the beach, and later on she seemed visibly happy when I asked her for a shoulder massage after a workout session, to which a few of our friends teased her that she must've been waiting for me to ask for a massage (I could not see her reaction to these comments, as I was not facing her at the time)

- a couple days ago, she showed me photos of her workout progress over five months, asking for my opinion. She was initially hesitant to show me the photos, as she is showing a lot of skin.

Advice I'd like:

- I talked with my parents regarding my feelings towards this girl a couple weeks ago, to which they were hesitant at the idea of me dating her, mainly due to the fact we are of different ethnicities (me being Chinese, she being a European-Indian), mostly concerns regarding cultural differences, our families possibly having struggles getting along, and even further down the line, regarding marriage and having our own family. Though I managed to alleviate some concerns by reassuring my parents that this girl has many friends of Chinese and other asian backgrounds, hence her parents are likely very open-minded. Overall, my parents allowed me to make my own decision, but to make sure I don't suffer in the long term.
(Should I make the leap of faith?) 

- I have only talked to one other friend regarding my feelings, and she has assured me that she will continue to update me if she notices any signs that my feelings may be reciprocated. 
(Should I ask any other trusted friends for advice?)

so I'm a straight college guy (rising junior) who has never dated before because of trust issues but have made a lot of progress recently and think I'll finally be ready to give this dating thing a try once we get back on campus in the fall.

To prepare, I've read Mate and thought it was excellent. One thing that really stuck out to me was the idea of a mating market and how one should prioritize schools/cities/social environments with a balanced (or female skewed) gender ratio and accordingly that's made me examine what circles I'll be running in and I've come to realize that a lot of my interests will lead to spend most of my time around other dudes. Obviously, I'm not going to change all my interests just for girls cause that's pretty lame but I am thinking of maybe swapping out one or two of my interests for something with a better gender ratio. Here are some of my main interests:

\-I'm double majoring in Math and CS, both of which are male leaning at my school though Math is better with a 40% female students while CS is something like 25% female

\-I will be participating in the competitive programming club which is roughly 30% female

\-I will also be running a kind of nerdy social movement (Effective Altruism) club and I anticipate it'll be something like 35% female based on past event attendance

\-I will go to the gym a few times a week for an hour but I guess that's not REALLY a social environment haha...

But anyways, I feel like in these kinds of environments, even though I really get along with the kind of girls there, I will have a fair bit of competition due to the gender imbalance and since I'm below average in looks, only average in height and have decent but not excellent social skills, I doubt things would be too rosy for me.

Some other things that I genuinely am interested in include French (French club seems 70%+ female to me) and maybe cooking (I would imagine a similar ratio for cooking classes on campus?) and while I wouldn't vibe with these kinds of girls AS well as my fellow nerds, I definitely wouldn't mind dating some of them and it would be a lot more plausible for me too!

On my part I've been liking her a lot so far , and want things to go further .
We meet once a week normally on dates and she has stayed over at mine a couple of times already.
We click sexually amazing too.
But I'm too worried about pushing something like exclusivity to her yet and ruin what we have now , should I pursue that anytime soon or just go with the flow now , and wait till we're going atleast 3 months.
I'm a confident guy myself , but it's normal or not I don't know , as long as we're not exclusive and stuff I'm just a tad worried about her talking or seeing other people alongside , which she told me she doesn't do btw.

I want to start off by saying Michael is an amazing guy, and the only reason I’m thinking of ending things is because of my own inhibitions. We met through a mutual friend at a party and started going out soon after. Things between us moved incredibly quickly, more than I would of liked. I lost my virginity to him on the 3rd date and he’s told me he “loves me” multiple times. The “I love yous” do bother me as I don’t think he knows me well enough to say such a thing. We see each other pretty often, at least 3-4 times a week even though our work schedules conflict. Every problem that has arose between us so far is due to my lack of communication and I’m not sure how to improve that, or if I even can.

For contextual purposes, I’ll let it be known that I have BPD (Borderline) as well as pretty severe anxiety and depression. I’ve been single for a long time in order to work on myself, and I honestly though I was in a stable enough headspace. But lately things have been rougher than usual for me, and I’ve been falling into cycles of extreme depression for 2-6 days where I don’t open texts/answer calls and I often make impulsive decisions during this time. I relapsed and SH after being clean for over 2 years which goes to show how badly I’ve been coping. 

I ended up not responding to Michael for 2 days a couple of weeks ago because I was feeling so shitty, and he showed up on my door with a gift, incredibly sweet, right? I apologized and tried to reassure him that I wasn’t “ghosting”, I’m just someone who needs space during a low. But two nights ago I left his house at 3 AM after he fell asleep because I had a nightmare and  became extremely anxious and depressed. I meant to send him a text in the morning apologizing and giving an explanation, but I overslept and again hurt Michael and made him think he “did something wrong”. Although I apologized again, I feel like an absolute piece of shit, and it’s put me in another slump of depression where I again stopped responding to him. There’s just honestly no excuse for it, and I hate that I let myself sabotage a potential relationship with someone I really care for/possibly see a future with. I just feel that if we were to enter something long term, he’ll see the devastation I let my illnesses take on my life and he’ll leave or realize he deserves a mentally stable partner that doesn’t take him and his time for granted, which I feel like I’m doing. I want to have an in depth talk with him, but I find I shut down talking to anyone about my feelings and he is no exception. I’ve tried 3 times to open up to him about my issues, but I physically clam up and say “Nevermind” or “I’m fine”. I just wish I could snap myself out of it and be the best person I can for him, but instead I’m the worst version of myself right now. I’d like to think I’m pretty self-aware, and I know I’m self-sabotaging a good thing, but I still can’t stop myself.

Thank you if you read this ramble, I’m at a loss right now on what to do. I want to just drive over to his house and hug him and kiss him and tell him I’m sorry, but I won’t. I honestly think I’m being characteristically selfish in prolonging a relationship with Michael when he could do so much better. Although I do care for him deeply and the selfish side of me wants a relationship with him, I think it’s best if I cut things off now before we’re both in too deep.

In high school I never got much attention from guys. I only recall one guy saying he thought I looked pretty but that I was too quiet and so that's why his crush on me didn't last long. At maybe 17 I would talk to guys online and end up showing nudes. It didn't matter where I started talking to them I would just send because I liked their attention. Then on Instagram in my Junior year, I met this girl and it was the first time I felt feelings for a girl before, but I didn't question why I had those feelings. So we flirted and had an online relationship for 6-7 months. Until my parents found out about it. They were more so upset on though she was a 40 year old when I face-timed her and saw pictures of her. My dad talked to me and pretty much said what I felt was a phase and for some reason, I got insecure about why I was in a relationship with her in the first place. When at the time it shouldn't have mattered what he said. But after that, I broke up with her and I really hurt her. I tried to take it back but the damage was done and after we never really talked again. I feel me changing up definitely hurt her more for me being selfish. So I stopped messaging her. After a while, I talked to random guys again on Twitter. Mainly sending nudes and having very short-term online ""relationships"". I look back and think they would say to be together just so they can get nudes from someone. When I turned 19 I went to tinder and eventually met a guy there and we hooked up. I more so did it to get rid of my virginity without thinking. But in doing so the hookup felt good at the moment but I felt horrible after rushing into it doing it with a stranger. In a way, I lost trust in men and most of all trust in myself for not thinking more cautiously. Up until that point, I only had online interactions that felt not enough but also felt more safe being behind a screen. So the first time I slept with someone felt very emotional and I didn't comprehend how it would feel before I did it. But after a While, I went back to tinder to maybe try again but I would chicken out of fear. So eventually I went on an actual date with a guy, we talked for hours and we seem to hit it off. But eventually, it got into the topic of kids and he mentioned how he wanted kids and I said I never want kids. At that point whatever chemistry we had was gone. He looked up and said it looks like it's going to rain when it was sunny and that's where the date ended. When I got home I felt so sick to my stomach from sadness knowing there wasn't going to be another date. Although it was better to know each other's expectations in a relationship I still felt so sad and we never talked again. So at this point, I kinda wonder if eventually should I get back into dating? I don't want to be alone I feel so lonely.

It was a while ago when I dated this girl, we broke up a long time ago but every now and then I find myself thinking about our relationship, and wondering what could have lead her to this ""decision"", we had a serious relationship (at that point in time we already been dating for almost 2 years) and we loved each other very much, had great chemistry, until one day she told me she doesn't like to go down on me ""everytime we have sex""
From then it turned to no oral sex at all, when I asked her about it she used to say she never actually liked doing it which was a lie, because I KNOW she enjoyed doing it, she was SUPER passionate about it for most of our relationship.
I always kept myself clean, showered before having sex, and also well shaved, I always went down on her, even when the smell wasn't perfect, I still did and never ever thought about removing it from the ""list"", safe to say she expected oral sex but won't return the favor.
But again, she suddenly dropped this bomb which made me feel disgusting about myself, I considered this a deal breaker, we broke up a while ago.
I would not expect too much oral sex if it's just a fling, but in a serious relationship I would take that as if the girl is not attracted to me enough.

But in reality it's one of the most important things.

I literally feel sad when Guys explain how they're NOT getting any dates, even when they claim ""They have better personalities"". But hear me carefully, I'm not saying that you gotta look like a Supermodel to get Girls around you, or neither am I saying you have to be ripped like a Greek God.

It's just that Women too expect something better out of it. Just imagine if a Girl's maintaining her figure and body and her appearance and the guy literally does nothing and then gets disappointed when he doesn't get to date her, 🤷🤷🤷🤷. 

She might have gone out with you if you had taken care on your appearance. Most Women who reject guys atleast (30-40%) of them have rejected guys on the basis of looks, or else they'd have gone out with them on a date. (I'm not a Blackpiller) But you can stay a Fat Guy/ Girl and then expect a Fit/ Hot sexy Woman, that would be so unfair for those people who have maintained their bodies.

See improvement is the key, people gotta agree on that, Looks Matter. Now I'm NOT saying that ONLY your looks can get you everything in a relationship, but it's NOT, you need to have ""Good Looks and Personality"". That's the best Win-Win situation for you.

I have seen how guys feel low in themselves when they get rejected, instead of they have good looks they'll get more choices in Women, and they can get some better dates and relationships. ONLY having a Good Personality wouldn't get you a relationship. 

I have seen how your crush might like you for the way you treat them, but when it comes to Relationships and Dating they just back off, they obviously like your personality but wouldn't date you because of your looks, (sometimes) had you been good looking they might have been dating you.

I would never date a colleague but there’s two guys in another department (one is a manager) who has shown interest and asked to take me out. When I decline (because we work together) they keep asking on different occasions. The guys I meet through mutual friends and online dating have been more blunt and will say they want to have sex with me and they would if I let them. I’m not a human sex doll (I’ve been sexually ass@ult3d multiple times before). 

I just don’t understand why I can get sex but not commitment (bf). I have made it known that I want a relationship and I won’t have sex unless I am in one since I’m demisexual but guys will then lie saying “well I’m willing to be in a relationship to get laid” which is like saying I’ll tell you what you want to hear as long as I still get what I want. I had a guy friend ask me out of a date in front of his friends since he thought I wouldn’t say no but I politely declined and told him I’d hang out with him with a group of friends but I’m not interest in going on a date (with him specifically). He bluntly told me he wanted to sleep with me so I know he’s not genuinely interested in a relationship. Guys keep trying to invite themselves over my house and I’ll opt for a public outing if they want to hang out then they’ll say “you always want things to be on your terms and things to go your way”. 

I’ve distanced myself from guys and guy friends who bluntly keep pressuring me to have sex (in front of their friends) and when I call them out for only talking to me for sex they’ll get upset saying they’re not just talking to me for sex because they like my personality first but after they actually realize I’m not joking about sex they stop talking to me (after calling me out for not talking to them because I keep getting pressured for sex). The guy friend also bribed me saying he’d pay for our date if I go out with him but I don’t like bribery and I have my own money and don’t go out with guys I’m not interested in for free food. 

I’m a sexual being too and I like sex but I don’t like casual sex. Those days are over and I want something more serious but it seems like guys of different age ranges (22-33) are all on games. 

I’m genuinely tired so any guys I’ve encountered despite the environment I’ve kept strictly platonic which had led to guys lying about wanting a relationship, me getting comments about being a lesbian, or hating sex. I don’t think I have a bad personality and people have told me I’m cool to be around. I’ve taken the time to appraise the root cause and I’ve worked on my self over the years but the more I focus on myself and less on romantic relationships since I’ve had bad luck with that, guys seem to want my attention more and will lie to get it. Will this ever get better? I want to find love.

I feel like being 23 and dating should be easy but I have always found my past relationships in person in various university classes. Now that I’m in graduate school, I’m following a strict “don’t date in the department” rule for myself. (Although, I’m the only sapphic woman in my department anyway, so I guess it doesn’t matter.) 

Anyway, I’ve been using dating apps. I get (surprisingly) a lot of matches and lots of conversations. I’ve been able to go from the app to texting and then to a date, but after the first or second date, we either decide to just be friends (which I’m okay with. Made tons of queer friends which I need) or (this is the case I’m more concerned about) we just stop talking after the first or second date. I just don’t really know how to bridge the gap from the first or second date to more dates/getting more serious. I’ve never really done dating before, honestly. I’ve always just became interested in classmates and then ask if they wanted to be my girlfriend, so this is a whole new world and I’m having trouble navigating.

Also, I never know when or if it is right to tell them I’m a widow? I feel like it’s something important to say because I hear that you should tell this to future partners but also, it never seems like a good time to bring it up and I just never really want to.

She’s on my mind way too often. Our sex life is not what we both expected but I am okay with it and she told me she is too. 

Last time we met, I asked her whether she likes me or not. She didn’t want to answer. After asking like 5 times, she said, “well you’re still here, sooooo..” implicating that she does like me. But I just don’t get why she doesn’t want to be honest about it and say it out loud. 
When we talk on social media she comes across like she doesn’t really care about me, though. But I’m giving her the same vibe as well, she told me. That might be the reason why.

After a little fight we decided that we needed to communicate more, and we asked each other what we were looking for in a relationship. She answered with “anything really, i just don’t think I’m good at relationships”. I really don’t know what to do with this information, and since I won’t see her all summer I’m not sure if this means the will stay loyal to me.


So, my questions are:
Why is it that she doesn’t want to be honest and tell me she likes me out loud? And what does it mean that she said she’s looking for “anything really” in a relationship, and that she told me she’s not good at relationships?

The says there's ""another male"" annoying her, I said to ""get your mates to keep unwanted advances away"" and she said ""it's a long story flip sake he's a dick"" but didn't want to be rude to him but told him she ""was on her period sorry"" and how he wanted to have sex while on her period or something I couldn't make heads or tails about what she was actually trying to say. Then talks about ""that's when the hormones are the best"" complete with a love heart emoji, how she broke up with her boyfriend, (FWB or actual boyfriend? does she even know the difference?) played UNO in his car before he got angry/horrible and she left.

I literally told her I really shouldn't be talking about sex with her as it wasn't appropriate. Her reply:

Lmao wise up it's fine  
But it's yolo  
YOLO

She doesn't understand that ""YOLO"" doesn't mean sleeping around which I told her. Then goes off about hating men but ""I'm not included"", sends me a drunken selfie and how she's ""absolutely steaming""! Wishes that she was working since I was there and how I ""make the shifts okay"" with a smiley face and a love heart.

To be honest I'm starting to think I'm the actual problem here. I know I'm a fun guy to be around but all this unwanted attention is starting to get on my nerves. Just because I'm nice and fun doesn't mean I want to sleep with you, I'm not playing hard to get! Nor am I some kind of player because I haven't slept with anyone in almost a year! I'm almost non-existent on social media for a reason!

I haven't made posts about everything that happens in my workplace but I have made a few the past year since it's rather bothersome. A temp literally asked me to come back to her place in an entrapment ploy to get me alone like wtf. Before that there was a co-worker who I was genuinely interested and it seemed like the feeling was mutual but there was obviously something wrong about her. Pretended (I later found this out) to be dating her neighbour after telling me that her mother was looking forward to meeting me and wanted me to come with her to visit her family. Probably though it would make me want her more but it backfired because I ended up blocking her then she interrogated me about who I was dating (at the time) and wanted to see pictures of her. She quit not long after. Like wtf creepy.

Recently as well there was another co worker (20F) who tried to wrap her legs (jumping hug) around me when she gave me a farewell hug after I gave her a present (she deserved it), we won't see each other for 4 months and are genuinely friends and probably will be even a decade from now. But now I've got this teenager being infatuated with me! I've said it before and it feels like my life's a fucking sitcom without the laugh track!

Texting back and forth talking on the phone etc. And now it was finnaly time to meet.

I didn't want to go on a friday, because it was after my last night shift. But no matter what I said, she keept pressuring that date forward. Her kids will be with her dad, we get an extra day to spend together bla bla etc etc. Until I gave inn sure il come on friday.

Getting off work in the morning 05:45, I drive to the airport. Wait for my plane, fly down to the city. I call her up, where are you? Oh something come up, but if I take the train down to the central station she will meet me there *Omnius forshadowing*

Mkay, I take the train. At centreal station I call her back, nope she cant meet me here either. But I need to take the buss to city north. Oh come on! I thought, this is not what we agreed upon, I could be home sleeping right now.

At city north, I call her back. Supprise supprise, can't meet me here either. I need to take another buss. From past experience I realy don't like using overlapping buss station's. But I'm a grown up now I can't let stuff like this fase me.

Finnaly im in her small little town, finnaly I can se her in her car. With her two daughters, all 3 of them in sports suits. The two girls are 14 and 16, so they know what is going on here...

They are having a game at the local stadion, she is allso the handball coach for their team. 'Mama mia' I think for myself. At the stadion, I get to meet all of the other parents for the kids that are playing. Handshakes all around, I try to put on my best smile. And she introduces me as her boyfriend... Even though I have never seen her before in the flesh and that topic has never been discussed.

I cheer the girls on, and after the match we drive home. To the biggest house I have EVER seen. We pack the things the girls need for their stay with their dad. 

I probably should mention he is an architect and runs his own company. And she is a stay at home mom.

 Wearing the clothes I put on yesterday before work, her not yet divorced husband drives into their grandiose drive way in a BMW X6. Wearing a suit and tie, she introduces me agian as her boyfriend... I handshake him 'Nice to meet you sir' (I have never been pressured into a more ackward situation before) She told me we would meet alone.

Back in the house, she promises me that I can have a nap after dinner. She cookes up some sausages, but im too blown away by all thats happend, and too tired from working all night. That I can't put on my usual charm, I'm usualy the one that carries the conversation. Making her laugh, cheering her up etc. But now I just feelt like a flat tire.

Dinners done she sits on the coach and has a mental break down. 'Aaaaaaaaaaaa!!!' Her scream cuts thru my ears like a plank of wood on a table saw. 'I want my mommy' she cries. Not knowing what to do I try to comfort her. 'Don't fing toche me! Don't touch me!' She screams. I stand up, she calls her mom. 15 mins of hysterics later her mom pulls in the drive way with a tiny fiat.

Now they drive away, and I think. So it's some kind of love triangle this. And Im just a pawn. Now im alone in this huge mansion, I call my best freind. I started to tell him everything, and he just can't stop laughing at my sorry ass. He even has a problem catching his breath hes laughing so hard. I just hang, he calls me back. I turn off my phone, and goes to sleep on the couch.

Next day, she wakes me up. 'Oh you are still here?' She says. 'Well I want you gone NOW!' I said sure, just please show me the buss station. 'No! Because I don't want to be seen around with YOU' Wth I say you have introduced me to half of the township as your boyfriend all ready, atleast help me get back home!

In the end I had to order an taxi 'Don't use the local taxi company I know the drivers personally' she says. Yeah right I thought, ordering a taxi from out of town is gona cost extra. Ofc im using the local taxi company.

I get in the car, and the driver knows her well. I feelt like I had to tell someone about this crazy day so I tell him everything. And here comes that familiar laugh, hes cracking up into tears.

Last week we agreed to be exclusively talking, and seeing each other, neither of us want to label things yet because it's pretty early.

Anyway,
He knows about my issues with adhd, sensory processing, C-PTSD, anxiety and attachment issues and he continues to be the most supportive man I've met for years.

I gave him a rock on our second date (my love language is, this rock is neat so i want you to have it) and he put it on his desk next to all his sentimental items (he explained each items sentimental value) 

He texts me every day despite having a concussion and a deadline to finish his degree on Tuesday, which he's behind on, despite me saying he doesn't need to because I'm not anxious about the situation anymore and i feel more comfortable, and that he shouldn't text me with a concussion.

It takes him a few hours but he ALWAYS responds.

I had to rehome my pigeon, that I'd fostered since it was a chick, and despite his busy schedule and injury he is supporting me through it.

We've only been on 3 dates, but i stayed over and we were able to do our work side by side without it being weird.

He is insanely affectionate, he compliments me, he even showed me his bachelor project and explained to me what he was doing in detail, and sharing concerns about an interview he has to analyse.

He told me he wont be able to text or use his laptop because his doctor said he absolutely shouldn'(he was not obligated to tell me this at all, i hadn't asked, he just decided to tell me) 

Yet he still makes an effort to text me, and told me if i EVER need to talk, or even if i just need to hear his voice, not to hesitate calling him.

He also said multiple times that if i need to get out of my house (ableist parents) i can just show up without warning and if i ever just wanna visit, that as long as i text him before so he can tidy, his door is always open.

This is the first time i feel fully accepted by another person, with all my flaws.

I talked to him two days ago asking where this is going and we both mutually agreed that we aren’t compatible long term after he came and visited me last week in my town. Even though it’s mutual, I am very confused as to why I’m still extremely sad. I guess I also can’t help but feel like I’m not worthy for relationship and never will be relationship material given this is farthest I’ve ever gone with a relationship. I’ve only been in the hookup/casual dating world prior to this. 

I guess I’m especially confused because I told my dad about it yesterday and he actually didn’t have my back. He was saying that it’s my fault and that I shouldn’t have pushed for a final answer on if we’d become exclusive or not and where that guy sees this going. Which made me feel worse because I’ve been told and seen that a guy KNOWS by 3 months of talking if he sees potential or not. And the reason I wanted a final answer is because I start my new full time job soon and I can’t let this bother me. 

He also said were better off as friends given that we weren’t toxic to each other. But I’ve always heard stories of where people who started off non-platonic and tried to become platonic, and it NEVER works out. I strongly believe that it’s an excuse to ease the break up process where we slowly drift away from each other. (Given that we’ve already had sex and all too) Like he sent me 3 snaps yesterday. Isn’t it weird that he wants to remain friends?

I’m another instance, the girl said she would only marry men for her own race or white. And in all the interracial relationships I see around me, it’s a white male with a non-white female.

Sent her another snap about 14 hours ago asking her out again and she hasn’t opened it yet. This is typically from the frequency of her responses before the date but I was hoping after a night well spent together that she would be more inclined to snapping or texting me more often, thoughts?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,824863,public,self,Trying to determine if she’s into me or if I should ask for another date.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv8n40/trying_to_determine_if_shes_into_me_or_if_i/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,
