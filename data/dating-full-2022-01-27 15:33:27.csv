So to start, I (24F) broke up with my boyfriend (29M) after 3 years together several months ago. I currently still live with him in the house that he owns (separate bedrooms), and I pay rent. He also had requested that I stay in the house for now to help with bills. It's been a mostly amicable breakup thus far, however the general dynamic is that he is actively trying to win me back over, while I'm not very receptive to it and I currently don't have any true desire to work things out romantically. My reasons for breaking up with him would have to go in another post, but a very, VERY condensed gist of it is that I felt like my life was drifting in an entirely different direction than his, and I wish to focus on myself in regards to mental and physical health. Regardless if he tells me I'm selfish for it.

Lately I have been dealing with extremely low bouts of depression, and in general I feel like I'm struggling greatly with mental health. For example, I'm now starting to become aware that I've developed a bit of dependency on alcohol. Though I do still have enough self-control that I won't drink more than one drink between work days and even in some situations where I'm upset and *greatly* desire to drink, I don't always do it. 

A lot of my general frustration deals with the fact that I don't feel like I have true free reign to do what I want, or talk to who I want. Basically, to function as a single woman. I don't necessarily want to go around and have a bunch of hook-ups nor am I looking to just dive in another relationship, but I do want to basically just do my own thing, keep to myself and just exist as I am without him as a partner. Now while I do still greatly care about him as a person, and I wish no ill will- I get incredibly frustrated that I feel like I have to tell him where I'm going (so he ""doesn't worry"") or that if I'm out late he feels the need to message me, and if I don't answer that - he calls. He doesn't get angry or really try to pry in my business for the most part but I digress. I do always try to consider and understand where he is coming from, but God I'm tired of constantly feeling guilty when I shouldn't have to.

Another big thing that I've been pondering on lately is that, say we're sitting around the house and drinking. I'll usually get decently inebriated since screw it- I'm already home. Almost without fail, he'll ask if I want to join him in his room for the night (though not 100% to just have sex). I have, when drunk enough, slept in his bed with him a few times now. Not really cuddling him or even facing him but I still went in there (I kick myself for it later). This has now started to make me extremely weary of hanging out with him when alcohol is involved, I guess because I feel taken advantage of in a way? 

Anyway, in general he's trying to win me back over but situations like that make me weary or guarded which also feeds into my general irritation towards him, that in turn is spawning more arguments, causing me a constant state of stress and struggles with some pretty deep depression and lack of self-worth.

He and I had a really great connection, and we hung out over the course of several days. Over time, I caught feelings for him. I could sort of tell that he liked me too.

One night, he introduced me to some people he met. One of them was Jim. We were all drinking at a bar, and Jim went to the bartender and asked if we wanted anything. I asked him if he could get me a water. While he was getting it, I sat down on a couch because I was feeling drunk. When he bought me the water, he sat down next to me. Everyone else was still at the table talking.

Jim didn't do anything too extreme, but he was hitting on me. At one point, he put his hand around my waist. I had to use the restroom later, so I told him I was going to use it. He asked if I needed help walking over there. I told him I was fine. I don't remember much after that, but I was getting escorted back to my hotel room. I was talking really loudly and apologizing for getting so drunk. He was helping to carry me, and I remember him shushing me by putting a finger on my lips.

I don't know the details of what happened. All I know is that John told everyone that he liked me. The next morning, all of our friends told me what happened. I wanted to know the details, and they wouldn't say anything except that they were all there. I asked John later if he liked me. He denied what he said.vTurns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time.

I was really bummed out, but I figured that we could be social media friends at least. We live far away from each other, and I just thought that the situation could be chalked up to a simple misunderstanding. He left the Instagram request pending for two weeks, and then he rejected it.

We had a nice clear talk about keeping it without labels of exclusivity, because I'll be moving at the end of this semester and he wants to go back to Germany eventually.

The first time we grabbed drinks he expressed that he had a period of celibacy as he reevaluated the role sex played in his life and suggested he preferred the other person to make the first move. I followed that and we ended up in bed that first night. In the month and a half that followed, the sex just got better and better, with lots of eye contact, cuddling, tender caressing and kissing. We'd make out in hallways at parties when no one was looking. I had a few breakfasts with him and his housemates, and we could talk for hours. I was vulnerable about my depression and he was so sweet. When we departed for winter break we couldn't stop kissing to say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last Night:**

Over break we texted maybe once every 2 days, me more than him. He isn't a texter at all. He asked to grab a drink a few days ago but I was too tired, so he proposed him making dinner. I didn't know he was also inviting friends until day of.

We only hugged when greeting. When the friends left, I asked if he wanted me to stay the night. He fumbled a bit, saying maybe not tonight, but he'd see me soon. Something about wanting to ease back into things after being home for a month (he was quite homesick), something about logistics as his house is much colder than mine. I was busy feeling embarrassed and trying not to show it.

We continued chatting with our legs touching, interspersed with long moments of silent eye contact. I kept feeling like I had to look away, and at one point he said, ""You're looking pretty beautiful."" I told him that was unfair, ""so much for 'easing into things,'"" and returned the compliment.

Our friend texted to say some sketchy people were on my route home, so then he offered me one of his housemates' beds or his own. I told him I don't want a pity invite, I didn't want to intrude, I didn't want to be a burden. Each one of those he shot down. Fine. So I got in bed with him, and then he reached out to touch the tip of my nose. ??? I risked running a hand through his hair and gently stroked the side of his face, he responded by doing the same. He thanked me for not leaving and I thanked him for letting me stay. He said ""I'm sorry for being so slow."" I told him there was nothing to apologize for and just to communicate what he was comfortable with so I don't have to guess and make a fool of myself. Then he touched my hand gently and said good night. Morning came with lots of smiling and one really long hug, neither of us letting go. No concrete plans to see each other again, but I'm wearing his shirt rn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Today:**

He sent me a long text thanking me for coming and for ""how I handled yesterday"" and reiterating that I'm not ever a burden, saying he isn't so good at connecting to himself and communicating these days. ""I hope I can provide a similar atmosphere in which you can communicate your thoughts :)"" And also that he really wants to watch football sometime with me haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Confused Thoughts:**

There's no future for us really, I just enjoy his company, I guess I'd be happy with whatever he is willing to give for however long. He knows I don't want a relationship, we weren't exclusive to begin with, we were having very wonderful hot intimate sex. So both usual definitions of ""taking it slow"" seem to not apply. I'm used to FWB situations that are way more focused on the sexual aspect (such as a close friend I saw over break), boys I've dated who get distant leaving me guessing, or relationships where the other person is insecure and puts me on a pedestal.

Do I express my enthusiasm to reassure him? Do I stay silent and just follow his lead? If he doesn't want the physical aspects anymore why doesn't he just say so? Should I ask him directly? How do I refrain from jumping his bones??

Since about September this attractive girl started coming to the gym, and for the first few months nothing really sparked between us other then glances. However, in the past week, things have really begun to pick up.

Some context:

We both gave nice gestures such as bringing a bench over to each other, offering to use equipment, etc. I then held the door open for her and told her to have a good rest of her day last week when she left the gym. On Tuesday, I did the same thing, which she smiled back and said ""you too!"". Yesterday, we had our first short conversation when I noticed she she took her ear bud out (some of the treadmills intermittently work and I was conversing with someone else about it which prompted her to inquire), and I noticed throughout the rest of the session she looked at me across the gym for at least 3-5 seconds, three different times - and didn't look away when I noticed. Today the treadmill she frequents wasn't working at all, so I managed to get one of them working for her and we ran next to each other without talking anymore. However, after we left the treadmills, one time she glanced at me and I smiled back at her, which she returned with a cute smile of her own. And that was that, no other interaction. 


I know the gym can be a pretty private place, so I don't want to assume she's interested, but it definately feels like it. Should I make a move? I've personally never hit on a girl or have done anything like this before and I want to make sure I'm reading this right.

We met last year on Tinder, a few months ago, went on a few dates and on the 2nd date we had sex. We both seemed satisfied and he kept asking will we meet again etc., we both agreed to meet again.

But after we had sex, everything changed. The first weird thing was that he promised that night to drop me off home in the morning, but he didn’t do that eventually and didn’t even mention it in the morning - I had to go from an unknown neighborhood home alone by a bus. 

He only contacted me 4 days later, usually we would’ve talked every day. The snap he sent wasn’t even anything personal to me - seemed like he sent it to many people at once. I replied, but he didn’t keep a conversation going.

Only a week later he asked do I wanna meet again, I said sure, I’ll let you know when I’ll be free after my exam week. He said cool let me know then.

I then contacted him after my exams were done and told him we could meet then and then if you still want to, he said “yup that should work”; but he never made any plans nor did he contact me at all after that.

3 weeks go by and he sent me some mass snap again - I’m furious that he took me for granted and bailed on me, so I didn’t respond.

Now after 2 months he sent me “how are you (my name”

I (f22) had noticed that my coworker (m20) was being very flirty with me. After months of this, he finally told me he liked me and I was indifferent at first but I guess I’ve developed somewhat of a liking towards him too. Only problem is…I feel like I emasculate him too much. The small age gap doesn’t bother me too much but it’s something i’m mindful of - i’m used to dating guys who are a lot older. One thing that does bother me however is the fact that he can’t drive (he’s learning). He’s asked me out on a date but I’ve not really said yes because I’m put off by the idea of picking him and taking us to the date he’s supposed to be taking me on? i know it sounds silly! I do like him but when we’re briefly alone outside of work there’s no flirting or anything - i just feel like we’re friends sometimes despite of what he’s said to me about how he feels.

I feel like we just can’t progress with our (potential) relationship. He’s not really made a move on me…physically? but always goes on about how much he likes me, what I mean to him and how he hasn’t felt like this before.

""omg i'm soo sorry i didn't realize i had x planned tonight, but i'm doing dinner tomorrow night (sunday) with my friends, i get it if you don't wanna do that but i'd def like you to come""

i said no thanks because i'm a pretty shy dude and i don't wanna meet this girl at an entire table of girls.. so i was like no big deal we'll do it another time don't worry about it, so we planned on monday to get together tonight.

this morning: ""ugh, i'm stuck at work late tonight because one of the guys i work with has covid.. i'm so annoyed about this because it'll be the second time canceling on you.. i'm so sorry i feel so bad.""

me: ""lol it's cool life happens, you just let me know when you got time to get together and we'll make something happen""

her: ""i'm gonna really try for this weekend if that's cool with you?""

so we agreed to that. here's the fun part.. so she told me where she lives, and she told me where she works.. so we're friends on snapchat, and she sends me a snap with a black screen and text.. and then sends a text over snap... and if you have your location turned on, it says what town the person is in... and i can literally see that she's home LOL.

so i text her.. ""how's that long shift goin? hangin in there?""

she texts back: ""ughhhh yeah i can't wait to go home this is the worst""

so i don't want to come off like i stalked this girl or anything.. this was in plain sight for me to see.. didn't put any effort into it at all and honestly, never would've found this out because i never would've went looking for anything. so my question is.. what would you do? to me this is clearly a red flag and i'm probably just not going to talk to her again but.. curious to see what you guys think.

You SHOULD be attracted to me.” I knew he was right, but I just wasn’t. 

It keeps being brought up by my friends as I get older. I was at a party with a few girl friends and one of the guys asked me if I found another guy attractive (after a few drinks). I said no, politely. My friends were quick to jump in saying: “She’s messed up. Don’t listen to her. She doesn’t know what she likes.” Or something like that. It really rubbed me the wrong way and I ended up leaving.

I frequently get told that I’m too picky, that I must be gay, that I should be attracted to these men that everyone else is. I’m just not. I’m not asexual, I’m not aromantic, I just am not attracted to the men I’m supposed to be attracted to.  

I was in love once. He was a pretty man, much smaller and more delicate than the men my friends go for. He was like a size 8 shoe and his hands were the same size as mine. My friends couldn’t understand how I loved him but turned down 6’+ muscle heads. I really just loved his personality and thought he was beautiful. I was so attracted to him sometimes it hurt to look at him. But my friends didn’t get it at all. One of my friends even said to me: “I really don’t like his face.”

So I guess… why am I not attracted to the men I’m supposed to be attracted to? I don’t think I’m gay, I have no interest in women sexually, but I don’t like stereotypically attractive men. I like pretty men. Am I in denial about being gay? I really don’t want to interact sexually with a vagina.

I don’t find any male celebrities attractive other than Adam Levine and sometimes Ryan Gosling. I feel like an alien talking to my friends about boys. A lot of my friends have said I must be gay or asexual, but I don’t want to be with a woman or alone. I do find some men very attractive, like my ex, but it’s just not the “right” men. 

Is it possible there’s something medically wrong with me? Like hormone levels or something? Could I really be in denial about being gay?

They felt they were happier because what the men lacked in looks they made up for in kindness, gifts, trying to romance their partner etc. A guy I was talking to about this thinks that from the men’s perspective -that men and women think about sex differently. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. He said that men who never really had to try hard to get women’s attention took women’s attention for granted and if women gave them attention easily the guy was more inclined to look at women as sex objects or if a relationship didn’t work out have the mindset of “well I can always get a new one”. He said he didn’t feel that in general women really looked at men like this. I have no idea if there’s a difference there. He thought the key to finding a good man is to find one who is less attractive who will view you as “his prize” and work hard to not take you for granted. 

However some women think that dating down in terms of looks is doing a disservice to yourself. You will be dating someone who you aren’t attracted to or at least initially and have to work to develop an attraction to them. Sometimes men can get resentful (and we can see it here on Reddit a lot) when they are rejected by women over and over. They may develop a mindset of “I’m going to get revenge” or develop FOMO if they suddenly become more attractive to women either by wealth, losing weight, etc, and leave the woman they have in the dust for someone more attractive to make up for lost time-if they are superficial (which is sometimes hard to tell if your dating someone who is superficial unless they say things that make it obvious). Also dating someone less attractive may lead to insecurity for the other person. 

I usually have dated less attractive men then me. I found their personalities seemed to be better. However one downside was that they seemed to be insecure whenever I received attention from other men and I had to assure them more. A couple became to the point of becoming controlling and abusive, but this could happen with any guy regardless of looks .Thoughts?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155180,public,self,Should women date less attractive men?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/seabdt/should_women_date_less_attractive_men/,no_ads,0,,,

Just an honest one.

As the title says, I'm a 40-year-old guy who's never been in a romantic relationship. To start, I'm not the best looking guy in the world, but I don't think I'm ugly either. I consider myself well-groomed, I've worked out pretty religiously since I was around 18, and while I'm not cutting edge chic by any means, I buy and wear nice enough clothes. I have a decent job and make a decent living, too. I'm not rich, but I do all right. I also have a small but tight circle of friends. Outside of romance, I'd consider myself pretty normal when it comes to socializing, really.

I think my biggest problems are I'm introverted, have had generally low self-esteem for most of my life, and I'm just kind of boring. I'm a pretty big nerd, too. Even at 40, I still enjoy playing video games and watching anime. I also read a fair amount and write as a hobby, and I aspire to become a published author someday. So yeah, not exactly the most social or interesting guy, I guess.

I'd also add that I just don't know if I'm up for the competition that I've come to think of dating as. What I mean is when I was younger I had my fair share of opportunities to date. There were girls that I liked, got along with, and pursued to a point. But what always happened was some other guy would come into the picture, and at that point I would just defer. I was just never up for vying for a girl's attention against somebody else. I guess sometimes I felt that I didn't deserve them; that they would probably be better off with the other guy anyway. Again, low self-esteem. But at other times I admit that I just didn't want to be bothered. I always felt that if a girl really liked me, I wouldn't have to compete and pursue; that they would choose to hang out with me over the other guy. It never shook out that way, though.

So now, here I am at 40, lacking in experience in pretty much every way imaginable with regards to romance and women, and while I sort of want to give dating a genuine shot, I'm also unsure if I'm even up for it. I've looked at online dating sites before, and I've come to the conclusion that it's just not for me. It just seems too competitive for an introvert like myself. So that leaves meeting people through friends and family and dry approaches. Problem is, all of my friends are married (some more than once at this point) and they don't really know any more single women than I do. As for dry approaches, my lack of experience is already a hindrance, but it's made worse by the fact that I really don't go anywhere except work and the grocery. I workout at home, too, but I've heard gyms are a no-go zone when it comes to approaching women anyway.

I'm sure you can see by now that I'm kind of hopeless. I really don't even know where to begin as far as improving my dating skills goes. As I said, I like to read, so naturally, me being me, I bought a copy of *The Game* by Neil Strauss and plan to see if any of the info in there can help, but it seems like it may be geared more towards a younger audience than I. I also have doubts if I'm even dating material. I just worry that I'll put in all of this time and effort to meet someone, but even if I do, they'll never reciprocate in a lasting way because of what a late bloomer I am.

It's just kind of a bummer. Deep down, I really would still like to meet someone, fall in love, get married, and maybe even have a family of my own someday, which is why I'm here posting this. But I also fear that it's just too late now for any of that. At at my age, too, it seems like all of the good ones are already taken, which I realize is as much a commentary on myself as anyone else. I always come back to wondering, then, if there's even any point in trying now.

**TL;DR:** At age 40, is it worth it for someone entirely lacking in romantic experience to try and get into the dating scene, or would I be better off just forgetting about love and romance entirely?

Because that's what he said, that he wants to be single, but he wasnt admitting that maybe he had feelings but maybe was hiding them. It would make me feel a whole lot better. But he's not saying he had feelings at all. I think that's the only thing that would help. If he at least said he DID like me.

Do people like that go after emotional connection (the way he was) because they crave it from the opposite sex? Or is it really so separate? I feel jipped.

I just want him to admit that the reason he came after me was cause he liked me, we had so much in common, and he would go crazy over me sexually. But he wanted to stay single. That's all he ever saw me for, why would you come after me like that, he never wanted more from the start.

He made a big fuss that we were leaning on each other (it's been a shit time for both of us with pandemic)...but he doesnt care to lose that? I'm the one stuck missing having someone to reach out to.

But if he wants to be alone, hopefully it will actually force him to be alone. He can’t be getting the benefits of someone intimate to care for/caring for him. If you want to be truly alone and know you need to be single, don’t even try that? You dont get to have all that from someone. Be actually alone.

I can't believe he did all that chasing, he was the one pursuing and being persistant, I thought someone wanted to get to know me. And now I'm the one who's ended up crazy and begging.

I also know I could be more forward but we’re friends and I want to be careful.

Whenever I go out with a specific group of friends, they invite this really nice guy. I usually have a little crush on him but it’s hard to tell if it’s anything since we’re usually drinking.

Last weekend we went out with friends and everyone was getting tired and wanted to go home except for us, so we stayed at the bar and played darts and just socialized with the people around us. Eventually we were too drunk and needed to go home, but he INSISTED on walking me, and then when I said it’s ok I’ll Uber so he doesn’t have to (he lives by the bar) he said he would still Uber with me to make sure I made it home safe.

I live next to a Taco Bell and I realized he probably just wanted Taco Bell (he’s obsessed) but he still insisted on walking me the rest of the way to my door. I didn’t invite him up/nothing happened, but I asked him to go to a show with me this week since we realized we both love comedy shows. 

I also remembered that the last time we went out we went to probably 6 different places (it was a day adventure for a friend’s birthday) and he was sitting next to me at every place - I wasn’t intentionally sitting next to him and I feel like the odds of that happening are weird.

I’m updating this to say that we went to the comedy show last night and I am even more confused! In the days leading up to it he really wasn’t much of a texter, and then day-of we had a little bit of banter.

He walked to my place so we could Uber together, and then we sat together. I feel like he could’ve made more of an effort to touch me (and make it seem accidental) during the show bc the seats were close together. But then we stayed after and got drinks, and ended up staying at the bar until midnight.

It’s just confusing because we get along SO well and have so much in common, but then there’s no flirting. I mean maybe we’re just friends, it’s just - how lol. It’s so rare to get along like this with someone. He’s also never dated anyone to my knowledge (I haven’t either) and is friends with a lot of women so maybe he’s just a really good friend?

I (late 20s M) was in a relationship with this person (mid 20s F) for a few years. Prior to COVID, and before our work environments changed, everything felt great. There was zero animosity, no arguments, any issues we had were minor and were usually solved with a discussion. A little before COVID, her work environment changed and so did mine. I have to leave for extended periods for my job, which wasn't anything new, but the situation had changed because of what was going on around the country. Things became lackluster between us. More of a daily mutual existence than a real relationship. I had chalked it up to just new work schedules and new environment, so once everything got back to normal, so would we. I know, very assuming of me. Anyway, halfway into 2020 my job pulled me away from home and our relationship moved to long distance. Our schedules weren't aligned very well and I was very busy in a new role I was unfamiliar with. Fast forward a few months and now I'm home and things seem to have gotten back to our ""norm"". After a couple months we decided that we needed a change in our living environment (increase in square footage, mostly) and suddenly everything went downhill. I made mistakes, wasn't doing the things that I should've been. She became distant and started socializing with her colleagues more often. I believe this started during my time away, as no one was home and her new work environment is very social. I never felt like I was actually invited so I never asked. Its not my friend group, it was hers. I was very assuming, and it caused issues. She didn't communicate, which caused more issues. Eventually this led to a few arguments back and forth, but I thought it was settled. I eventually went out with her, but I didn't feel like I was actually with her. I figured since it wasn't my place to be there, her social life would be hers and we would still have our life. As things dissolved, I was dealing with my personal issues with going to the next stage of my life. I believed that i was involving her in these ordeals, but apparently not. It ended by her saying that she's no longer interested and the thought of commitment on this level scared her away. It has now been several months since that point, and I'm about to have to leave again for work. I'll be gone for several months and I feel that there's nothing I can do at this point. She hasn't made it clear to me how she feels, but I've found through other sources where she stands. Recently over the past couple months I've been making more attempts at trying to rekindle our relationship to no avail. I don't understand anything at this point and without being more specific, neither will anyone else. I've been hitting several crossroads in my life, and its come on very quickly all seeming to be at the worst time. I've tried talking to her about it, which doesn't lead to anything productive. My only insight into how she feels has been through means that I wish I didn't pry into, nothing illegal of course, haha. Anyway, I feel like I've done so much at this point and I'm not sure how long it will take me to find my norm again.

I ended things this week after 2 dates with another woman who took that approach.

I value confidence, vulnerability, assertiveness, power, intelligence, ambitious, go-getter women.  Women who try to emulate someone like Michelle Obama.  I'm under the impression a lot of these are the same values women have for the men they are into.  I am not sure how to filter for women like that - women who are lawyers seem to have a lot of the traits I'm looking for but I don't meet many.",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155194,public,self,Are any other men unattracted to the chase?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sec4cc/are_any_other_men_unattracted_to_the_chase/,no_ads,0,,,

I (26F) was in a relationship for 4 and a half years that my ex (30M) ended in November last year. He was the first person I spoke to online and we'd been together since I was 21 and this was my first (and only) relationship, I'd never even kissed anyone before this. Anyways prior to the break up he had been very distant and I hadn't seen him in person for about 2 months. He broke up with me because he didn't feel anything anymore and wanted to be happy on his own- it wasn't a mutual feeling for me but I let it go because I knew he had probably felt this way I while. I kept all of our messages, over 96,000 in the end because I hoped we would get back together. I had this feeling deep down he'd met someone else which was the real reason. Then at the start of January this year he changed his DP and my thoughts were pretty much confirmed and this was probably going on while we were together- I deleted all of our messages and photos and started back on online dating.

I've always had really low self confidence but it feels a lot worse since finding this out- I'm always comparing myself. I'm unemployed at the moment due to health problems- some of which were existing and some developed while in the relationship and I can't help thinking this was a reason as well. I'm not the most attractive person in the world (prior to our relationship I never had anyone interested in me), I put on a bit of lockdown weight and have PCOS which doesn't help and he constantly used to call me things like lazy and boring which have stuck with me. He always said I should go to the doctor and get diagnosed with ADHD/ASD due to how I was with lots of things. 

I've been talking to someone new for the past couple of weeks, which is great and he would like to meet on Sunday for lunch. He seems really nice and we have a lot of shared interests. I'm so nervous and every part of me wants to cancel- I'm only 5ft so any extra weight looks worse. I'm also not one of those girls that wears make up or dresses/high heels or drinks. I never had a 'pet' name for my ex, which annoyed him no end, I just didn't understand the point behind it. It was on an app where we both have to mutually swipe and all of my pictures were just ordinary in jeans and jumpers- nothing that would show me to be anything I'm not. I don't want him to think I'm not working because of choice but I don't want to tell him everything before he gets to know about me, I do foster cats at the moment to keep busy. I've also really suffered with disordered eating and eating in front of people which is adding to my anxiety. I've always struggled to fit in with people and I have one friend and we're quite close but she has her own life and I feel bad talking to her about stuff like this.

Any help would be massively appreciated in regards to confidence for this lunch and generally getting me self esteem back. 😞

He then suggested that we could cook something together next time.

It just seems like the majority of girls on dating sites are just so immature which does not help at all.

We were supposed to be going up this weekend with the same group for skiing but i backed out cuz she'll be there with the guy.

She cries some more and then i say i have to go to work as i had a meeting in 5 minutes. I didnt call or text her after.

Things have been mostly good and I have felt like I finally found someone I really liked. But lately I'm feeling weird about things. 

It took almost the 4th date to make out, and we haven't had sex yet. Which is all slow to me, but I feel like she wanted it to go slow.

I feel the lack of communication or enthusiasm on her part is making me doubt things. Granted, she does work a lot (12 hour shifts), but I feel the communication is lacking and it's making me think she just isn't that into me.

For instance, after not seeing her for a week, I went go go visit her. She flew all day and had to work this morning, so we both knew it would be a short visit. Her battery was dead on her car (she got security at the airport to jump her) so we went and got a quick start jump that she could use. I told her I was worried about her car not starting, so to text me in the morning when her car got started.

She didn't text. I was anxious about it and called her. She said she totally spaced on texting me. 

Also when I left last night, she thanked me for coming down. ""thanks for coming down"". It felt odd when she said it. I feel  ""I'm so glad you came down"" would have been better, but thanking me sounds weird. I don't know, maybe I'm overthinkimg the thanking part. 

However, If I went with her to get something that helped me start my car, and she asked me to text her, I would have texted her first thing this morning. It takes 3 seconds. Like am I really out of her mind that much? 

Finally, I offered to bring my battery charger this evening to her house to charge her battery. It's now 730 pm. She usually gets off at 7pm. She talked this morning about her maybe getting off earlier because she had to work at a further location. I haven't heard anything from her about possible time she would get off or be at home. 

When we are together, we have great energy, but now I'm getting in my head about these weird feelings of something being off. And actually the energy when we are together is started to get a lilttle off. 

And now I don't even want to text her, to see what's up with the battery charging, cuz I want to see if she is going to text me. She knows I was ready to bring the charger. 

But most of all, her not texting me or calling me this morning, in all honesty, hurt me. 

And now all this is creeping into other things. Like I don't even want to ask when we are gonna hang out again, because I am feeling like an obligation.

I had asked him out, because we had spent Christmas and new year together and well I liked him since last October, so I thought it would be good to make our relationship clear. He first had some worries about dating, since he is a exchange student, and will be returning to his home country this summer, but since I’ll also be going to work in that country around fall/winter this year, he agreed. 

Before that day he approached me first and has already stayed at my place before, and we had some make out session during those nights, but since I’m a virgin, I always said no to more. On the day we started dating I did tell him that I have no experience and he was pretty surprised by that, since I’m a little bit older than him. 

I’ve always been told by other people that I look like somebody who’s „pretty easy“, but I have never done anything more than making out with guys I liked. The problem is, that those guys always only liked me for my body. 
Im more on the chubby side, and since I’ve been younger I’ve always been told that I’m good enough for sex, but not dating. So I Never slept with anyone, since I was never sure about the relationship. 

Now my first ever boyfriend started being way more careful around me, even staying at my place and doing literally nothing. We almost never kiss since we started dating, but he does hug me a lot. He’s always telling me how he doesn’t like me making jokes about my own body. I’m quite insecure about some parts, so I try to joke about it from time to time.

I have never been in an actual relationship. I just find it weird if it’s something I’ve done wrong or what’s exactly happening. I know I’m generally not the best looking dude but I don’t think I’m butt ugly. I’m very active as I play basketball throughout most my life. So looks wise I’d say I’m just solid then personality wise I’m not outgoing or a social butterfly but if I get approached I can hold a convo pretty well I feel like I’m generally nice and always try to think on the positive side of things. To list a few of my examples on why I don’t know what went wrong here they are. The first time I’ve ever tried dating a girl was my freshman year (both of us were freshman) we texted for 2 weeks then a dance was coming up I ask her she says yes then hours before she blows me off yet I seen on social media she was there and well after that she ghost me without an explanation. Then my sophomore year I had met this girl who was a senior at the time things were good we would go to lunch go to the park here and there everything seemed good she would even go to my HS bball games . Then out of no where she started acting strange in the form that she wouldn’t text me as much. Then for a week she kinda blew me off we didn’t hang out or see each other as much. Then for one game that i had was away and I’m there waiting for our game to start and I see her with another dude and get a text saying that it’s not gonna work cause she needed to focus on herself an hour after our game  . It hurt more cause that was an older ex she had not even her most recent one so I’m just in defeat. Then most recently before my high school graduation I was getting to know this girl who is a junior (it’s only a 1 year difference) we started off by texting then things slowly grew. This time around the girl made it clear she wanted to take things slow . So that’s what happened we slowly get comfortable we start seeing each other more we go to the movies you know those type of dates. It’s been 6 months things get going it seemed like with both our intentions were clear that we wanted to date we both confessed we wanted more . So I planned to ask her out in December which was only days after we knew we wanted to date. Where is that everything changes she suddenly blows me off the first couple weeks of December. I’m just kinda lost then the last week of December she probably texted me once or twice . Then the first days of January comes by she apologizes saying it had to due with family issues which I didn’t really want to question cause at this time I trusted her and knew what it was like going through it. Well a week of us going back to normal she post this random dude all over her social medias and ghost me . So I once again get left with no explanation. I’m just stuck like what do I do . I don’t think I forced anything on them because I never asked for explicit things like photos or sex. I never was to harsh or rude. Maybe cause I’m too easy going ? To this day I’ve never been in a relationship and wonder what it feels like I’ve never even kissed a girl so maybe cause of that too? I think maybe I gotta toughen up more but not sure in what ways. I was the one planning stuff making it happen in these encounters so I’m not sure.

I am currently 26 and in living in South Dakota. I didn’t enter the dating pool until I was 24 due to body insecurity (am a bigger dude) and confidence issues. I’ve had a few nice dates from the apps but never really found anything lasting. For a long time I understand that I was visually undateable from dating app standards, but I’ve lost a decent amount of weight since I turned 24 which lead to me getting more opportunities for dates. The problem I’m finding is that I invest early thinking other people view dating the same way I do (dating to marry) and I don’t find too many people with that mindset, or people that have serious red flags that my therapist has had to reinforce are bad for me. 



What I’m wondering is, do you all face similar issues? Do you fall out of love with dating or dating apps? Do you need time to recharge emotionally after facing constant rejection? If you’re off dating apps, how do you meet people? I was so focused on school and my career that I didn’t have a ton of time to develop these skills or behaviors on a “normal” timeline and I feel like I’m at a disadvantage trying to date these days.

Backstory: It’s about a girl I’ve known for few years. We are not good friends but lately we’ve been getting closer. 

For about 4 months we’ve been meeting each other out in clubs, bars and at friends places (been some breaks though because of covid). She usually text me asking if I’m going out and I do the same. Always when we sit at a bar or at a friends place we always end up next to each other talking. 

So about two weeks ago we where going home from a party together with another friend and I really wanted to ask her if she wanted to come with me to my place but I couldn’t do it in front of my friend. She then told me as we split up to text her when I got home so she would know I got home safe. 

I texted her that I got home safe when I arrived to my house and asked her the same thing. I then shortly after gathered enough ballsack to ask her: You could sleep at my place if you want or maybe it’s a bit late (04:30). She answered: Yes it’s a bit late but maybe next weekend? I can’t remember much what was said after this but it was something like: Yeah sure, good night!

So last week she sent me a snap on Thursday I sent back which later led to me asking if she was going out this Saturday day. She said yes. I then got invited to a birthday party which she wasn’t invited to. When I got to the birthday party we texted and sent pictures to each other the whole night. I asked her to come to the birthday party since some of her friends where there and she asked me to come to the place she was drinking at but both of us ended u staying. I then proceeded to ask her at 02:30 (20 minutes after we stopped texting) if she wanted to meet. She answered: Hmmmm. Im already home about to fall asleep. I answered: okay and she then sent some fucking emoji

So when I take I look back at this I regret asking her these questions so late being drunk as fuck. I just feel like I’m being a bit to quick maybe? I mean we haven’t even kissed yet. 

I’m also known as a low-key guy which means I shouldn’t be typing shit like this
