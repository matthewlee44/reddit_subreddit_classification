Had a thing with a guy end of last year. We had a great time with each other, he was always polite, respectful and showed up. Always made sure I know that he appreciates me. For sure one of the most beautiful days last year for me. 

He unfortunately split things up between us, bc he just got out of a relationship and was about to leave the county to study abroad for a while. We made out with each other one month ago before he left on a party, he told me drunk that he‚Äôs upset we got to know each other at the wrong time and wish it would be different. I texted him last that I wish him well and that he should check up on me from time to time. I haven‚Äôt heard anything from him since then, but I miss the time we had with each other. I have been contemplating to text him to see how he‚Äôs doing. But i don‚Äôt know if he even wants to hear from me or is actually interest in casual texting. 

Or maybe I should just move on and be on my own or date someone else. But I do think about him everyday. Is that weird ? Am I just lonely ? Should I check up on him out of the blue ?

Never doubt yourself as a person you will meet someone when you least expect it and really hit it off, this is what i believe, in the meantime Im working on making myself a better more well rounded man for when the opportunity may come.

Never lower your standards or think you need to change to fit in, for example, I dont drink at all, never have.

I have way more matches, more first dates (+/- 7/year), the dates go in average well, I met great women and I regularly have 2nd and 3rd dates, more rarely I date the same woman for a month or more... but it is obvious that none of them were into me: I was the one doing the effort, the one setting up dates... half of them were fine with kissing, the only 1 wanting sex told me as well she wanted to see other people in parallel. 

I fully get that I could be not everyone cup ot tea, but 13 out of 14 were not at all into me physically and one more or less. This is wild. I can't find a reason to explain this, if I need to change my approach or what.

I asked friends about it. Most just said be patient, it will come. But 2 friends told me honestly that most women, including them, were a bit ""jaded"" with dating apps: they have the option to get hotter guys even if I am 100% ""relationship-material"". I understand that women may find better looking guys but that was already the case 6 years ago (for info, most of my pictures are rated between 4 and 6 on the attractivity scale of Photofeeler)

So I am the only one in this situation? If yes, it comes from me (and I need to change something)
Or are other people seeing the same pattern? In that case, I will focus on growing tomatoes

This guy has jerked me around for nine years. He‚Äôs known me since I was 16 and he was 18. He‚Äôs always made it clear that he would never be serious about me and always rubs his relationships in my face. He‚Äôs made it clear that he finds me not very attractive and says I‚Äôm mad. I self-harm a lot, and my self-esteem is low. He constantly baits and switches me. I can take it like he‚Äôs single to hook up with me and ignore me to find out he‚Äôs in a relationship.


He‚Äôs used me to cheat multiple times without me knowing. And if I try to ignore him because I don‚Äôt want to fool with him or because I know that he‚Äôs in a relationship, he‚Äôll send me many text messages or blow up my phone. And then if I give in, he‚Äôll act like he‚Äôs too good for me and that he‚Äôll never be serious about me and that it‚Äôs just sex. This is gone on for nine years. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be in a relationship; I believe that no man will ever want me.

He‚Äôs serious about other girls or dates them more seriously and takes them out on dates. He posts passive-aggressive stuff about me about how I‚Äôm not very attractive and annoying. He‚Äôll make a passive-aggressive post on social media about how I‚Äôm a h*e and that my personality is annoying.


I‚Äôve never asked anything of him, and I‚Äôve only asked him to be in a relationship when I was 18, and then I realized that I needed to move on with my life. I try to move on and not see him. I moved states and moved other places, but he‚Äôll beg and beg for me to talk to him and ask me to move closer home with him even though he‚Äôll never be serious about me. I don‚Äôt understand why you treat me this way or why you are in never be serious about me. You stopped to be bro over nine years, and I feel like I‚Äôm such a loser.

The relationship has been fantastic so far. Little extra details, I'm US military and have been overseas since October. Started dating a girl I knew from my gym back game in early December. I'm set to come home in just a couple of weeks. 

However, over the last 2 weeks I've noticed some odd behavior changes and I don't know what to think about them. I used to call her every morning (afternoon for me) to wake her up tell her I loved her. She would usually call me on her commute to work and on her breaks while she was at work. She has pretty much stopped calling me and would maybe send 1 or 2 short texts here or there during her work day. Usually she called me on her commute home as well but... again, that has pretty much stopped.
She used to send me lots of videos on Instagram or tiktok and she doesn't anymore. We used to have the little red heart in snapchat next to our name but now it's just a smiley face. She hasn't read my messages or watched the videos I've sent her on Instagram... and lastly, the title of this post already said this... but when I message her on Facebook, the little blue circle is just a hollow circle with a blue checkmark. 

Almost as if she has her phone off or turned off notifications from me so my name doesn't pop up on her phone. I only know this, because my ex did the same thing to me. When she would go out and cheat on me she turned off notifications so her phone didn't ring or make a sound when I messaged her so she wouldn't be interrupted.

My biggest confusion about all this is the fact that she seemed so invested in our relationship. She got us this metal frame with our names on it, bought me one of those custom 10 things I love about you books, got me a silver chain necklace, introduced me to her family through social media, has 2 vacation trips planned in April that we've already got tickets and reservations for, and has asked me to come live with her when I come home.

But lately her actions are just... so unusual. My gut tells me that she is seeing another guy, but she's keeping him really low key... and my gut has been right about these things every single time, which worries me. 

Maybe there's a logical explanation behind everything or maybe she's nervous about everything?

It doesn‚Äôt really matter what she did, I thought she liked me and I liked her. 

I asked her out for drinks the other day, and she said yes, but then about 5 minutes later she said, ‚Äúoh we should invite *our colleagues*‚Äù.

Basically I (22M) always try to do the possible to see my 4 years gf (21F), even cancelling other plans to see her, while she refuses to do the same.

For example today for the weekend:

* I have some plans plans
* She tells me she's free
* I cancel other plans to see her.

But then she tells me she cannot stay the whole weekend because she is busy, but still some time togheter is better than nothing...

Now... If i am ready to cancel my plan to stay with her, shouldn't she do the same? Am I unreasonable to say that since I'm rescheduling stuff to see her she should do the same?

I do not want to elemosinate anyone's time. At this point I think I will tell her that or she also cancels her plans or I do not want her to come.

They weren't the kind of people I'd surround myself with in real life, and that's when I realized that the apps weren't working for me. 

I use the friends and people I've surrounded myself with as the baseline reference as to what kind of person I would like to meet, and I was encountering that less and less. Between a lack of common interests, communication that felt more forced than naturally flowing, being in different places in our lives (me being childless and never married vs. a lot of divorcees, single mothers), age gaps (much older women on dating apps love me for some reason even though I look younger for my age), it often feels like dating apps force you to be more than open-minded than you should be, and then you end up regretting it when being open-minded still doesn't result in success. I'm sure there are instances where someone might match someone who has different interests than you or maybe came from a different lifestyle/background, and it worked, but usually there's still some common chemistry personality-wise that made it work out.

My advice is that if you are on a dating app, and feel like the people you come across there are nothing like the people who you'd want to hang out with your friends, introduce to your family, and envision being a part of your circle, then this probably means the apps unfortunately are working against you.

I find I am overall more attracted to women than I am men, but have yet to have any same-sex relationships.

I was browsing a boutique today for a very specific item, the cashier (30s-40s/F) at the front desk engaged with me in conversation about more than just that item (and I feel like it seemed to her that I knew what I was talking about), told me I could have the promo by using a different payment method to the one that allows for the promo to take place, and after managing to source my size, wrote her name and number on a piece of card and stapled it to the receipt, asking me to call her if there were any problems.  I asked if she gives her number out to customers, but she said she only gives it to nice customers.

I admit to searching and Reddit and Quora for answers, but there aren't that many, and none for my situation, because this isn't a restaurant or grocery store.  Also, my zero dating experience means I'm unable to tell if someone's into me, and had to be told by my friend last month that an Iranian woman watching us from outside the bakery was into me.

My current plan is to hope the item arrives safe and sound - the postal service is overall pretty good, as someone who works in eCommerce - and call her to celebrate its arrival, as well as be open to talking more, and potentially building things up if she's interested (I am).  As for the cashier, she is really pretty for her age, confident, and engaging in conversation; all qualities I like.   I am also into older people as a general rule, because I had to grow up very fast.

However, I am not sure what this was all about, because nobody's ever given me their number like this - save for a past therapist on our first meeting (at the time, I was not a phone person and so I'm sure she trusted me not to blow hers up) - and so I'd like to ask the people of r/dating...

1. What does it mean when a cashier gives you her number, in this context?
2. What can - or should - I do, past let her know if there are issues with the piece being shipped?
3. Is my plan of celebrating the piece's arrival sound? Should I do more than that when and if I reach out?

Forgive me if I've made any mistakes or broken any rules in posting the way I did, this is my first time.

‚ÄúIt was a lot of fun! :) I did make it back ok, thank you. I hope you have a lot of fun with your friends!‚Äù

She‚Äôs been with this guy for about two years now. I‚Äôve never met him. They seem happy on Instagram, however, I found out that this might not be totally true. Her and this guy have been to couples therapy to talk about their issues. At one point, they also deleted both of their instagrams to avoid him liking other girls‚Äô pictures and his other questionable behavior - which explains the brief Instagram hiatus when she was gone. 

Last month, me and this friend were supposed to meet up, however she had to cancel because she was upset and crying. This was because her and her boyfriend might break up. They apparently worked out whatever the issue was and didn‚Äôt break up though.

Cut to two months later, I see him on Instagram at a wedding in another country that would‚Äôve been a ~6 hour flight from here, having taken and made it ‚Äòofficial‚Äô with another girl he had taken with him (I assume she would have also flew all the way there with him for this wedding). Ouch. I would think with all the timing that there was most likely overlap between us and he just secretly chose her. I know that this information probably answers my above question, but then why did he make the future plans months ahead of time and invite me to see his friends? If I were to reverse the roles in my head, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have done that to him

I‚Äôm still single now and it obviously hurts to think that while I was in heartbreak land he was just fine and dandy having found the new one. I think I‚Äôve still been pining a little because I thought I lost a good one, but now feel like the way he handled that really wasn‚Äôt very caring or thoughtful?

Should I stay?

Hello. This is my first ever post. I am extremely nervous that my boyfriend will find this. I will probably delete this post after some time but I need help. 

Okay, so 2 1/2 years ago I met my boyfriend. We had an amazing first year together. We moved into an apartment. We bought and took care of animals together. He was so patient with my mental health problems. I never met a man like that. He is so out of my league. He was romantic. He would buy me flowers and tell me how important I am to him. We were intimate every other day. However, after the first year he became cold. He started to become impatient with my emotions. We are very different. He is a very unemotional person. I am a very emotional person. He can‚Äôt stand it whenever I become upset. He started to yell at me and say hurtful things. I started to become insecure with myself. I withdrew all of my emotions and we became very toxic.

He would hide his phone from me. He would delete messages and turn off his notifications. Naturally, I believed he might be cheating on me. My past boyfriend did and I became hypersensitive to all the signs that cheating brings. He would become defensive and we would end every night in a screaming match. He broke up with me one night. Saying he wanted to explore polyamory. I felt like my whole world just ended. So, that night, I partook in substance abuse. I ended up in the hospital. He was by my side the entire time. He strung me along saying we could figure it out just to make out with a random girl at the club 3 days later. I still had hope that we could be together. Then, once I was released from the hospital, I moved back into our apartment. There, he told me he just wanted to be friends and go separate ways once our lease was up. I was heartbroken again. 

However, I had a strong support system and moved on. During the four months we were broken up, he kept giving me false hope and then take it back. I was so confused on what would happen. But I loved him more than anything. Finally, he wanted to get back together. We haven‚Äôt been intimate in 5 months at this point. I wanted to be intimate with him again and one night we tried to. Before we could start he explained to me it was hard for him to adjust to me being his gf again not his friend. That he needed more time to be intimate again. I became upset. I started to cry and felt uncomfortable. He made me feel so unwanted. He got up and screamed that he hated me. Then he punched through our wooden door 4 times. It was the scariest moment of my life. He instantly apologized and we have been steadily fixing our relationship since then. We are at a good place. But, I have a feeling I should leave. I am an amazing girlfriend. I cook every night. I clean the apartment. I wash his clothes. Put away his clothes. Make the most financially. And do whatever he asks of me. I know I could have someone who appreciates me more. But, I love him more than anything.

We split on good terms and I have deep respect for him, but it just didn‚Äôt work out. 

Ever since then I started dating, kind of for the first time in my life. Stayed away from dating apps for a good half a year. Got to know some nice men while going out, but none of them really sparked a deeper interest.

I have to say I am somewhat good looking or at least, that‚Äôs what I am told by people and have no problem getting matches (now that I use OLD) or guys hitting on me in a bar.  So I can‚Äôt complain on this end and I understand other people have it harder.

But I am just fatigued by now. Most of the time going on dates feels like a duty to find a new person. It‚Äôs not really fun at all. 

Because there is always a nice conversation, but hardly ever a connection. And often I feel like people are actually scanning each other to tip of boxes and that‚Äôs that. Or guys just want to have sex. 

Additionally, I got dumped by the last guy I dated (which is a first - but I know everyone makes this experience and it‚Äôs important and good for building character). He was the only guy so far I actually liked and I don‚Äôt really understand what went wrong. 
So that was even more off putting. 

My problem is:
I am a woman who has her life together (big friend circle, good connection to family, interesting career, nice apartment), but get to feel so overwhelmed and lonely sometimes, because I feel everyone who has been dating for a while is pretty distant and cold. And I therefore, kind of lost interest in dating altogether, but don‚Äôt wanna die alone either.

And I know it‚Äôs pathetic and doesn‚Äôt help, but I can‚Äôt change how I feel at this point. 

Does anyone feel the same? Or has some input? Would love some advice! Thank you!

With Match, anyone can send you a message. If you want to respond to that message, you will ‚Äúmatch‚Äù with that person, and then you can message back and forth.

If you delete the message, the person can still write to you. In many cases (I think this may depend on if you have a paid subscription or not), the person can see if you‚Äôve read their message.

Of course you can always block someone at any time if you need to.

I receive many messages a day. I rarely respond because I tend to be not interested in these guys.

Men, what do you prefer?

1.) That I ‚Äúmatch‚Äù back with you, and politely thank you for your message and let you know I am not interested.

I tend not to do this for a few reasons. I assume you know I‚Äôve read your message, and you should assume my lack of response indicates a lack of interest. Also, men could get defensive and write back to ask me WHY I am not interested in them. Or they could get aggressive and call me rude names. 

Most of the times, the reason why I am not interested is simple, either they live too far away, are too old, too overweight, or an ethnicity I‚Äôm not attracted to.

I realised i have anxious attachment style today. How did i realise it?
Well for the past few days the guy that i have been dating has been busy with his work. So before this we used to constantly call and text each other and since he has gotten busy the texting has gone down tremendously. We do still text each other daily ( not frequently), but ya we don't go a day without texting each other or wishing each other good morning and good night. 

But, since he has gotten busy i find myself constantly thinking that he has lost interest in me or he really doesn't care for me etc. I constantly feel the need to message him asking what he is doing and all, and i also feel the urge to ask him if he still likes me ( even though I know he does, but my mind is just anxious ). 
I have such low esteem that i believe he will just lose interest in me like that or he must be texting other girls . 
Well, today i came across a video on YouTube about anxious attachment style and wow, i have never related to a video this much. And yes,i also realised that i have this because of my childhood and my relation with my parents. 

Now i am just lying here in my bed going through my past relationships and realising how much my anxious attachment style made me feel insecure in relationships which were actually good in the first place.

Anyhow i really want to heal myself. This guy that i am dating right now is wonderful and i don't want to ruin my chances with him because of my past issues.

A bit about us:

I've had a couple of relationships, the longest and last was for 8 years and we broke up like 3 years ago, and since then I've been looking something serious.

I'm his second girlfriend, his first was for a year, and they broke up¬†cause she kinda had no aspirations in life didn't work and things like that. Before that he was always studying so he never had time to focus on anything else.

I fell in love with him super quick, but I never had the courage to say it, I'm extremely shy, I have just managed to say that I liked him a lot last month. He also said it back. This past couple of months I've been so stupidly happy that I can't even describe, this week I dreamt't that¬†I was beside my friend and I just said¬†it to her out of nowhere ""I really really like him"", and she just rolled her eyes as she does in real life when I do that haha.

Now¬†for the problems. I sent him this article: Fuck Yes by Mark Manson(it didn't let me link it) It's an article that I like to think it's the way I want all my relationships to live by, that the person that is by my side is fuck yes about me, not just saying yes out of convenience.¬†

That made him think a lot about our relationship, and he brought it up yesterday. He said that he was not feeling fuck yes about us anymore. He said that he could really feel that coming from me, always making plans, always dreaming up stuff that we could do, and he never does that. He always start conversations and plans to eat, but just that. Then I asked him why is he not doing that. Then he said it's because of our pending conflicts that is keeping him worried about it.

We have 2 points that are hard/impossible?¬†conflicts to solve, and some smaller ones,¬†and I've been the one compromising on all of them, and he's been thinking about that and how that's not right, and that he might be keeping me from being my complete self because of that.

I have 2 cats, they're all I have, I basically have no family, they are my family. I'm here still because of them.

He's extremely organized and a clean freak of sorts, he's horrified of the fur. He brushes his clothes as soon as he gets home when leaves from here, but when he washes his clothes it's kinda getting to all the other clothes. He asked what do I do to prevent that. I said that there's nothing to do, I just live in fur haha. I thought at first that it wouldn't be such a big problem, but¬†as time progressed he got more sincere with¬†me¬†and told how much it bothered him. We had a very big discussion on this¬†I cried a lot, and said that I didn't want to lose him because of my cats but there was nothing that I could do, I can't compromise on them, and he cried to, I got stunned, never a guy had ever cried because of me, I was worried, happy that he liked me and sad at the same time. We decided that he would keep trying to get used to dealing with cats. He's also very against the cats on the bed, that they spend 90% of their days on.

Second, He can't sleep on the same bed with me (with someone?), my sleep is a mess, I talk a lot, have night terror and apnea (just not snoring), and he sleeps¬†VERY lightly, and is very miserable when he doesn't sleep well, he asked me once how important for me was sleeping together and I said that it was very important. After this we had another big conversation and decided that when I sleep at his place i would sleep at the other room, just so we would have more time together, meanwhile we would work on our sleep to improve it. I've done a sleep study and now have to sleep with a machine, but he hasn't started on his side. He also asked but what if it never works? I said we would need to get an apartment with two rooms then (this took¬† me so much courage to say haha).

An¬†extra, that he is extremely worried:¬†I like adventure and dangerous stuff, he's pretty scared of a lot of things, even some simple stuff, like going to a restaurant on the center on the city cause he feels it's dangerous. (I used to walk all around that area cause my uni was close to there and it looks kinda sketchy but it's fine). I think I might have forced him in some way, cause I always ask what he thinks he could do, like ride a quad bike or bungee jump (I wanna travel everywhere and do all things).¬†

He hears my travel stories and says that he feels that in all this time I could have traveled a lot but I didn't go cause he always had something with work, or he was always tired, that he was holding me back, I told him that I wanna go somewhere and experience something nice with him, always traveled alone, but I always to share that experience with someone I love.

So, he brought up yesterday that he did not make any progress on these points in all this time, and he was worried that we might just be postponing the inevitable, and that he could be just wasting my time, like for now that we don't live together we can pretend the problem is not there but this will be something big if we live together someday. I told him that even if we give up, if he gets another relationship he might get critical points like this to solve again, just giving up doesn't seem right.

¬†I told him that he has a lot of barrier like this with¬†no compromising at all on his side, and that I think that he could start working on expanding them. He asked how he could do that, I said he might just do the things a little extra, or therapy if you find¬†rude the mention of it, he said he didn't, which was a good sign.

Through all this we both cried¬†an absurd amount, and he said that he liked me a lot. At the end it was 1am and we needed to work today, so we're gonna talk more tonight. I don't know what exactly I'm asking here, but, are these things solvable? Does he want to break up with me and is using these reasons for it?¬† Are there more questions that I can ask to get a better conclusion?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163842,public,self,Been dating for 7 months but boyfriend is worried about our future,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tgenvj/been_dating_for_7_months_but_boyfriend_is_worried/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

Seems like a match made in heavy, or so I thought.   
We matched and got to talking, we like a lot of similar things and talked about games for a bit. Eventually, we got to meeting at a local karaoke bar. This where things went downhill fast. She just wasn't in to the whole thing at all.  
""So what games have you been playing?""  
""Oh uhhh sims I guess... It's whatever""  
""Oh my sister loves the sims!""   
Then nothing. The next 5 minutes seemed like an eternity with the awkward pauses. I tried what I could to make conversation and talk like we did online, but she wouldn't reciprocate at all.  
I got to thinking, ""Maybe she's had a long day and forced herself to come out her"" so I decided I was going to sing some bad karaoke and cheer her up!  
I asked if she liked to sing, she said she didn't. So I told her I was going to sing her favorite song. She told me her favorite song was Wonderwall (Which whose favorite song is Wonderwall?)  
I walked up to the stage, put in Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, and said into the mic, ""Anyway, here's wonderwall."" To get the crowds attention. Then Never Gonna Give You Up blasted.   
Everybody was confused, and I don't think anybody found it funny but I was already up there and I had a few drinks in me so whatever.   
I finished the sing, had a blast, but when I got back to my table; my date was gone.   
She didn't even bother pushing in her chair.

He's very sweet and kind. I'm very physically attracted to him (though we haven't kissed or anything yet) and I feel comfortable like I can be 100% myself with him.

But I don't know if I feel enough mental attraction. I think mental stimulation is very important to me because I'm used to falling easily and HARD for guys whom I find very intelectual, cultured, witty, the ones who could talk a lot to me about things like philosophy, books, movies, politics and history. But he doesn't know much at all about these things (although he seems very open in general). 

Our conversations are nice but they have more silences, and I don't get that feeling of the world disappearing and it's just the two of us, or that just 1 hour went by when it actually has been 5 hours, you know what I mean? Also, our sense of humor is not so similar, sometimes he will show me a meme that I don't find funny or is a little cringe to me, or he would laugh about something and I don't feel too much like it, so I have to fake laugh a little.

Right now I enjoy flirting with him and I want to see him again! But I would feel sad if eventually I make it official with him, only to end up feeling frustrated and break up shortly after. Or maybe I would like him even more with time, I should enjoy the present and stop over analyzing the future.

My girlfriend and I are very open and honest with each other about our past, even willing to share things in detail. My girlfriend has been in one other relationship that lasted two years, and she has also been with a number of other men after her relationship ended. I have never been in a relationship before and am basically new to dating, because I made the decision to not date and to commit to education until after college.

The thing is that I really have no issue with my girlfriend's past. It was before she met me and she's not that person anymore. And I know that she wants to be with me and that she'll stay loyal to me. But I still am experiencing jealousy and envy of the men she's been with in the past. The thing I feel jealous of isn't even the physical aspects of her past, but the emotional connections she had with these other men. I feel like pieces of her heart was lost to these guys and that she'll never be fully mine as a result. I also feel like she'll always hold the memories of these other men and that I'll be compared to these other guys, and wonder if I am unable to satisfy her in ways these other guys did. I can't help but wonder how deep the emotional connection was with these other guys, and how my connection with her compares to them.

I understand that these thoughts and emotions about my girlfriend's past are unhealthy and that I'm going to need to overcome them if I want to continue to build a healthy relationship with her. Part of the issue I guess is since I have no exes or real history with other girls, I am unable to relate with how she feels about her ex or those other men, so I struggle to put my mind at ease regarding her current emotions and thoughts towards them. I really want things to last with this girl, and know she feels the same, so I know that I need to get over these things.

We both sent eachother a message once a day because the messages were so long and a lot to process and this went on for a week.

I learned a lot about her and got to know her so I asked her out and she told me she was down and we could figure something out this week. She was really nice and sweet and I really got into her.

I responded to her on Monday during the day with a really long text answering a lot of questions, asking some of my own, and even asking for her snap.

Ever since then I haven't heard anything from her and it's Thursday now. I see that she is online but maybe she doesn't have the time or energy to respond to a huge text like that.

I've been talking to someone super great for a couple weeks now. I didn‚Äôt feel the initial spark but he‚Äôs been growing on me and I want to get to know him more.

I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve both at this point and that I should just stop trying to date altogether because it's just so hard. First guy obviously doesn‚Äôt deserve someone who isn‚Äôt 100% into him. And the second guy doesn't deserve a friend who still has feelings for him and has a big ""what-if"" floating around in her mind (sounds manipulative idk).

He lived in the room next to me.

It was the BEST night of my life! I thought he would start dating me. He even tried to sleep with me but I told him I wasn't ready. 

However, a week later ANOTHER girl was over and it turns out he had a GIRLFRIEND. When I asked him he said they were ""just friends"", but I went on his social media and he has pictures posing with her dating back 2 years.

Then the next week his girlfriend was in the hospital for surgery and I heard him on the phone saying he loved her, yada yada. Only then did he invite me into his room to watch and cuddle again (because his GF was in hospital). I really wanted to cuddle and experience those magic feelings again but I told him NO, I felt bad as he had a girlfriend. Then he said ""FINE, no one's forcing you to be in here anyway"", and I went back into my room.

Since then I kept to myself and eventually his girlfriend started coming over to our house and sleeping with him 3 nights a week....then 4 nights a week....then almost EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. He took her to a wedding and on a tropical vacation. They got closer and closer and I was left out! :(

I really wanted to talk to him or ask him out and I believe that if I had been more aggressive/friendly/fun, he might have taken me out on dates. Anyway, I tried to work on myself and went on dating apps, and went out with DOZENS of guys, however, they were all extremely unattractive and boring.
