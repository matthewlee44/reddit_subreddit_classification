0,orv96m,1627291627,Exes. Always a bad idea?,"So me (27m) and my ex (27f) have a long and complicated history going back over a decade and I'm wondering; is it always a bad idea to go back to an ex? 

For context, we got together at 16 and stayed together for about 2 years. When we broke up, the main reason was that I had cheated on her and we could not work past it, despite our best efforts at the time. 

We remained close friends throughout the years. While we only crossed paths in person a select few times, we always kept each other up to date on big things in each other's lives, both good and bad. We shared stories about our new SOs, deaths in the family and lessons we learned as life went on, pretty much everything. We leaned on eachother in hard times and cheered eachother on as we put in our best efforts to get everything we wanted out of life. Over time she even learned to forgive me for my mistakes I made as a teenager, and in turn taught me a big lesson in forgiving myself as well. 

I have always valued being a part of her life in whatever capacity she would have me, knowing full well that the mistakes that led to our break up were entirely my own. In my mind she was always ""the one that got away"" and I spent a long time hating myself for the way I treated her when we were younger. However, it seemed that try as we both did, we could never seem to fully cut ties with each other even as we started new lives with other people. 

Fast forward to the last 2 months or so. Upon both of us being newly single (early spring for both of us) the conversations turned to flirty, and then to sexting. We made plans to meet up last weekend to have some fun. No expectations, just fun. We both have a lot going on with our exes and we live a couple hours away by car, so
we both agreed to this and when we finally got together, it was incredible. It will definitely be a night to remember if nothing else. 

Since that night we have been talking consistently all hours of the day. 3 hour video calls, an hour on the phone here and there. The sex definitely hasn't cooled off our desire for each other, nor did it leave either of us feeling anything except for wanting more. 

My concern lies in that I might be getting a little too invested in this. We agreed to no expectations of anything coming from this, and while I'm certainly not expecting anything, I am cautiously optimistic. I feel as though she's giving me signs that she's definitely open to the idea of a relationship in the future, which was something that she had told me previously (years ago) was not going to happen. Shes happy just to get pictures of me, she calls me out of just reaction when she's having a bad day. We talk casually about the prospect of getting back together and it is not shot down. The possibility doesn't seem as closed off as I thought it has been for all these years. 

Am I reading too much into things? Is she just going along with my feelings in an effort to spare them? Is it always a bad idea to go back to an ex? I dont feel as though either of us are the same person we were at 16. Any perspectives or opinions would be greatly appreciated. If a woman out there could tell me what SHE might be thinking, even better. Thank you for reading!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orv96m/exes_always_a_bad_idea/

2,orvunx,1627294598,How will I know I'm ready to date again?,"In essence I dealt with a breakup quite badly over the last year - initially started dating someone a few months afterwards and realised quite quickly I was just trying to fill a gap so ended it.

I waited again and started dating someone a few months ago, but they ended it saying that she was too busy for a relationship, but again I felt like I didn't really commit to it in the same way as I did with my last long term relationship. (Although, that was partially as they were very hot and cold). I deleted all the apps etc and am generally feeling better because of it, but every now and again I feel this want for some attention which I was previously filling by dating someone - but know this comes from an insecure place. 

Essentially - how do I go about building up my sense of self and know that dating is coming from a place of looking to share things with someone rather than loneliness/desperation?

3,orvvx7,1627294760,How to ask for a selfie to verify the other person's not a catfish? Do I even need to?,"Hey all. Long time lurker, first time poster. Please bear with me.

So as the title states, I'm finding myself in a really unlikely situation where I'm talking to someone I met online and we're really clicking. In saying that, I'm all too aware that catfishes exists - I've been both (unsuccessfully) catfished and MLMfished in the past, when I was more naive and stupid so I'm really weary as a result.

The person I'm talking to hasn't engaged in any stereotypical catfish behaviour and is even interested in meeting up in person once the lockdown in my area lifts and new cases are low enough - which is very likely to be quite soon, I don't think it's a shifting goalpost situation like I've seen before with other catfishes trying to work their magic.

They have been able to talk about their line of work which I am somewhat familiar with, in a way that you'd really have to be *in* that industry with the lingo to go with it too.

Our communication so far hasn't really brought up any red flags, but I've only seen the few photos they've uploaded on their profile (we've moved to a different, much less crappy way of messaging since). Forgive me if this is weird, but I also checked with a couple of reverse search engines and no results came up either.

With the background out of the way, there is still the lingering thought in the back of my head that this might be a fake of some kind because it seriously feels too good to be true, but aside from asking for a selfie there's no other way I can think of to at least partly verify that I'm not being overly paranoid. I definitely don't want to come off the wrong way especially since they're from the opposite sex.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I should or can do here? Maybe there's something I'm missing or it could be my past experiences just making me a bit too worried for no reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orvvx7/how_to_ask_for_a_selfie_to_verify_the_other/

7,orwxbw,1627299501,Date went great technically but I'm just not feeling it,"So last Friday I went on a date with a girl. I'll start by saying she's not really my usual type, but we talked before and she's really cool and we have a lot in common, so we went out on a lunch date. 

By all accounts, the date went very well. We talked and talked, always had a topic for conversation, time flew by, and it was great, logically. Everything one would want from a date. In the end, we kissed (her move). I did kiss her back, and, later, I got drunk and texted her saying I was happy we kissed (very big mistake which I feel terrible about. I'm not exactly lying but I don't want her to think it was more than it was)

To be honest, despite all this, I'm not really sure how I feel. Did I have fun? Yes. Do I want to hang out with her? Yes. Do I want to date her? I don't think I do. But I don't understand why. Logically, everything went well

After my stupid text I would feel terrible if I now told her that I'm not feeling it, like I lied to her. It's just that, after sitting on it for a few days, I just feel the way I do. And I don't think it would be fair to her to waste her time, because I do think she seems like a great person and deserves someone that likes her

On the other hand, I'm also worried I might just be sabotaging myself. I've been single and lonely for almost 2 years and I'm concerned I might've grown comfortable with that and that I'm subconsciously running away from my fear of being hurt again

I don't really know how to do this, if someone has been through something similar or has suggestions, please help",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orwxbw/date_went_great_technically_but_im_just_not/

13,orxkju,1627302089,Met a girl at the pysch ward vol. 2,"More details than last time and filled in some blanks from my diary.

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and a lot of staff at a 24/7 facility. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. After maybe 2 weeks when I was a little more used to the place, one of the staff asked if I had seen this girl yet.

I had to admit that I haven't seen her. The nurse,my main contact, a Latina in her 50s said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when my contact introduced me to her. She was indeed pretty and seemed healthier than the other patients.

She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasnt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.

We watched a lot of Tv shows and talked. Our favorite show was catfish. I cant say exactly when we started flirting but it clicked right away. It started with her asking if I wanted a cup of tea and our hands briefly touched. We started doing this quite often. Her favorite was Vanilla and I preferred mint.

She started asking me a lot of very deep and direct questions. What I would do if I had all the money in the world, if I was the only person left in the world and so on. She was an extrovert and I was more of an introvert but with her, conversations were just easy. We could talk about anything for hours and we had a similar sense of humor.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.

We always sat at the same table during meals. Also some of the staff liked to join us. I remember how nervous I was when I asked her to play Mario Cart. I had no idea if she liked video games but she did and told me she used to play Skyrim. Her laughter when I touched her arm the first time after I lost. I fell in love with that laugh and it was one of the most memorable moments when I realized she was just as into me as I was into her.

She was also a good singer so we played sing star a few times. I wasn't the best but she enjoyed it a lot, and I appreciated her talent. And there was a painting room at the hospital. She was very good at painting. She went to arts school before she was hospitalized. And we often had group therapy sessions where we tried to paint something based on a theme.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasnt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.  I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated.

So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.  I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasnt ready and to be honest I wasnt really ready myself.

So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.  We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps.

And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors. They also became good friends.  

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I started visiting my sister quite often. My sister was often out of town too so I had the keys to her apartment. So I met my girlfriend (I would say), more and more often over the next months. Usually Friday-Sunday was the best I could do and we could go on 10 hour long dates.

It was still somewhat dysfunctional. She could have episodes where she didn't answer my texts for 7 days while lying in her bed crying all day. Dating me was stressful for her. It was stressful for me too but over time we came to understand each others illnesses better.

I visited her city this week. She was a little ill and hard to communicate with the first two days. But it got better and better. We have known each others for 4 years now and we haven't kissed.

We went buying some bubble tea. I touched her neck and massaged her for a few seconds. She asked me if I could give her a massage and I said ""maybe later"". I asked her to show me some dance moves and she did some bailey. She was a bailey dancer when she was younger.

I showed her some martial arts moves but it was mostly just an excuse to touch her. I had both my hands on her face and she did the same thing to me just to see if this trick of mine worked.  Then we walked for an hour or so trough a park. I have learned that I need to make her stop up every now and then and sit down or she will just get stressed and walk on forever.

After a little while I gave her that back massage she asked for earlier.  She got stressed out after a few minutes and wanted to walk again. So we walked a little more before sitting down under a tall tree. I laid down on the grass and asked her if she had heard this new version of the song ""Begging"".

So we laid there for a little while listening to my Spotify. Then I asked her if I could take a personality test on her to figure out what personality she was in Lucifer (a very good show btw). The test took about 10 minutes and she turned out to be an ENFP which was the Goddess of all creation. I on the other hand scored as an INFJ or Maze, Lucifers demon bartender.

I followed her home and we were about to part but I asked her how she was doing with her apartment so she invited me in to have a look. She showed me around her apartment and told me it was almost done. She just needed a kitchen.

We sat on her couch for half an hour or so and just relaxed. When I left, I expected that to be it for now but she told me that she needed to relax for a few hours and that maybe we could meet up later tonight.

2 hours or so later at around 9pm we met up again and went for a pretty long walk. It was still hot outside despite it getting late. We eventually got to a lake and she suggested we test the temperature. So we took our shoes off and sat there talking about reincarnation for a little while. A few fish and some ducks were swimming around and we were all alone.

She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim and I hesitated at first.  I told her that she had to go first. She hesitated as well and contemplated it for a good 10 minutes before she stripped off her clothes and jumped in.  I did the same thing.

It was the perfect moment to kiss her. I held her face and touched her lips. Behind us came a bunch of guys and she pulled away. A little ashamed we got out of the pond and we had no extra clothes.  The walk back was around an hour and we held hands a few times.

None of us were dressed for a bath really so we looked like two half drowned cats while walking back home. We were back at around midnight. It was getting dark outside and we were standing under the full moon.

I pulled her close with my hands on her waist. I then leaned in. She just smiled back at me. I went for the kiss and we kissed for maybe a minute. It was like the most natural thing in the world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orxkju/met_a_girl_at_the_pysch_ward_vol_2/

16,ory8g0,1627304473,Are my standards absurd or are dating sites just a bad option for me?,"I (31m) am in a weird dating pickle, not the least of which is that I'm a 31 year old guy trying to date. 

  
A few years ago I got pressured into an abusive marriage that basically destroyed me. Luckily we got divorced after less than 3 years, and I *quickly* got into a new relationship which recently ended after 2 years (on very good terms, mind you). During that last relationship, I rebuilt myself. It's a long story but short version: I am in a GREAT place now in general, better than ever, in my prime, but...

The problem is, I started attempting to actively date again recently and I am just completely unenamored by the vast majority of people on the sites. I get that I'm looking for someone pretty specific and relatively rare (24-34 politically-active average-to-fit nerd-friendly woman 5'6"" or shorter with at least a Bachelors degree and no desire to ever have kids, and that's just my baseline) but I don't think that's an *impossible* ask... I've got some strikes to be sure, but I'm an educated job-having career-solidifying guy with a lot of hobbies and interests outside of just ""looking for a girl"", plus I'm very much on the upswing to boot, and if I can be a little vain for a moment... I could be a lot *less* good-looking, at least.

Part of the issue is, I don't think people like the ones I'm looking for *use dating sites*. I'm still trying to date like I'm a 22 year old, and I'm finding the same kind of women I found when I was 22. But I was looking for very different things out of a relationship at 22. I'm starting to worry that at this stage in my life, everyone worth dating is either married already or has kids.  


So:

\- Do quality late-20s/early 30s women even use dating sites these days?

\- Where can I meet these people if not on dating sites?

\- Are my standards actually just absurd, given your assessment of what I'm bringing to the table?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ory8g0/are_my_standards_absurd_or_are_dating_sites_just/

What do I do? Can I just tell them look, I need to make sure I’m asleep by X time. I don’t have all night? What’s the best way to communicate that?

I have a date tonight. The guy is traveling here. We chatted on the phone the other night until 1am. I told him I can’t do that on our date and he was like oh we’re going to be up all night. He also wants me to sleep over. 

Can I just text him and be straight? Like hey I have to be asleep by X time. I have a super demanding day at work tomorrow so I have to be up a X. Are you cool with that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orz09h/avoid_staying_up_late_on_dateshookups/
25,orz109,1627307157,Are these too many red flags or am I just insecure or maybe we aren’t not compatible?,"When I met my gf after a month of talking and a couple dates she opened up big time on me and went into detail about her sexual past. She broke up with an ex of 2 years in early 2017 then between then and July 2019 she had sex with 8 other dudes. At least 2 were straight hookups and other ones they were more FWB’s type situations. She told me she was being used by most all of them, but deep down she was hoping they’d fall for her and want something serious but none of them did. She said she had sex with one dude out of pressure too but I don’t believe it because they had sex multiple times throughout a couple months. This dude she said they were just friends and only had sex cause she felt pressured to but she changed her story and said they had a thing for a while but then changed it and said she was pressured to have sex with him. Another guy she was fucking was still in love with his ex and sleeping with multiple girls at the time they were fucking also. She was having sex with both of these dudes for a while and even fucked both of them in one day. She told me they were both marines and had one pick her up over an hour away from the base but she brought a stuffed animal she made for the other dude. She had this poor guy drop her off at a Denny’s parking lot and lied to him saying she was going with a friend and went with the other guy to his room where they had sex and have him his present, then made this dude drop her off and have the other guy who first drove her all the way to base to go with him. He told both of them they were just friends then went and fucked the other guy. She kept talking to one of them after all of this despite knowing the guy had feelings for her and was talking to him despite us getting into a relationship. He tried taking her away from me and she told him to stop and I guess he did, but they still have eachother in social media and like each others posts and he occasionally comments in her story. Weird thing is she likes all his posts but stopped liking them when he got a gf and started posting pics about her and with her. Now tell me I’m insecure but that is hella sus and looks like she got jealous whereas if she truly saw him as only a friend I don’t see why she’d stop. She used to randomly bring up this dude and her past about other guys almost as if she was bored and had nothing else to say and it got to a point where it kissed me off so much I told her to never say anything about her past dudes ever again and it just made her feel bad and sad. We’ve been together over a year, she professes her love to me daily, tells me she wants to spend her whole life with me, and we generally have a very fun time together. There are so many more things I could list about her that doesn’t sit right with me but I guess the reason for this post is to see what you guys think of this girl. If you want to know more about her I can explain more because there’s a lot. But right now I’m just trying to figure out if all this is too many red flags or if I’m just insecure. Like I said I can go into more things about her to give you a better idea of what she has done while in the relationship",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orz109/are_these_too_many_red_flags_or_am_i_just/

27,orzbln,1627308087,"Question regarding the statements ""You deserve better than me,"" and ""I'm not mentally ready to date""","Hey all, first time posting here. So basically I'm looking for some insight as to what those statements actually mean. I don't date often but it seems like almost every time I do I end up with the woman saying ""you deserve better than me"" at some point. Additionally, 3 of the last few girls i've tried to date  have ended things with some iteration of ""I'm not mentally ready to date.""

So this is pretty frustrating, consistently getting told these things, and I want to understand the thought process behind these statements. At first take, I assume it's a bit of a cop-out, or a way to let me down easy without saying ""I'm just not that interested,"" and although that's definitely a possibility, it's also possible they actually mean what they say. 

It's really frustrating having things come to an end this way. I'm more than confident enough in myself to take it on the chin if the girl  says she's just not interested but actually being told that is a rarity. I don't know what I could possibly be doing to consistently attract women who ""aren't mentally ready to date,"" since it seems like my other friends never run into that situation. I know there could be a whole host of traumas or life events going on that make things hard that I wouldn't understand but I'm just frustrated running into this same deal over and over again.

If anyone here has said/felt the emotions behind these statements and can clue me in that'd be awesome, or if anyone has been in a similar boat.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orzbln/question_regarding_the_statements_you_deserve/

The past couple of months it seems like everyone I meet just doesn't have the time to ever hangout. One time I saw this girl twice in a weekend and we had an amazing time both times. We vibed. It was fun. We had a lot of sexual chemistry which was nice for once lol. And then after that we never saw each other again. Every week she'd be busy with her main boyfriend(poly relationship) and I get it lol. I do. But after waiting a month and a half of trying to see her each weekend I just kinda gave up and stopped trying bc I didn't feel like wasting my time. And now this seems to be happening with everyone I meet before I even meet them. Now the advice I'm looking for. Is this normal? Bc I have no idea. Having only ever dated while I was on drugs. I really have no experience in sober dating. So like. I want to know if it's normal to go through so many people that are either too busy to hangout ever or just don't feel like doing it and how can I work around this?

36,os02ut,1627310498,Wait but how long,"Hello everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.

I’ll try to keep it simple &amp; short.

I’ve (24m) always had issues to connect with my partners on an emotional level, which led to issues &amp; termination of the relationship. 

6 months ago, I ended one again, and did some reflection upon myself. Maybe my « selection » in partners was flawed. So I decided that I would not commit in a relationship until I felt like it was right. 

Anyway, 6 months go by, and I can’t seem to find someone in a serious way. Well, until last week. What was supposed to be only about sex turned into something radically different. We talked for 15 minutes and I felt an instant connexion, like never before. We talked all night long, danced, laughed, hugged, kissed once and slept together (not sex), as we discussed how we were both looking for something serious.

Next morning I leave, and text her one hour after « I skip the 48-72 hours where I’m supposed to act too busy to text, to tell you how great of a time I’ve had. Would you like to meet again next weekend? » 
To which she answered: « I’ve had a really good time as well, however I might need these 48-72 hours to reflect upon myself. I work in two ways, if it’s a one night stand it’s fast, if it’s serious very slow. I know it’s pretty standard but even kissing was bit much for me. I hope you understand. »

I was comprehensive about it, because what else do you want to do (&amp; I really understand), but it’s been 72 hours and still nothing from her. 

I’m not normally like that, usually I just don’t care too much, but it’s physically hurting. The thing is the contrast between how great the evening was and her follow up text is so big, idk what to think anymore. I know she spent a good time, you can feel these things, but maybe not as good as I thought.

37,os0416,1627310602,First time “casual dating”: How should I think/act about a relationship that feels serious but isn’t a “relationship”???,"A few weeks ago, I went on a date with a guy (met him only a few times beforehand) and we ended up spending basically the whole week together and the next. We became instantly comfortable and affectionate with each other, and he is really sweet and attentive to me. He’s always opening doors for me, making sure I’m happy and not hurt, driving me around, cooking for me, showering me with compliments, etc. He’s said that I’m special, that he doesn’t usually act like this, and that he rarely feels so comfortable around someone like he does with me despite not having known me for very long. 

But when I asked him what he was looking for, he just said “something more than a summer fling”, and even though for the most part he includes me whenever he talks about the future (like assumes that I will be there and we’ll still be “together”), he sometimes says things like “I’m scared that you’ll set the bar too high and I won’t find someone like you again” which assumes that we won’t be together in the future…

Recently, he asked me if I were to die and got one last wish, what would I wish for. I said I would wish for everyone to be happy. Then when I asked him what he would wish for, he said that everyone can take care of themselves, but he would wish for me to be happy.

I don’t have a lot of dating experience, and I’ve never done casual dating before, so I’m very not sure how this is supposed to go. From the way he treats me, our relationship dynamic, and the things he says, it feels like this is serious and he seriously has feelings for me? But we’re not “in a relationship” even though he said he likes me and that while he is sleeping with me he won’t sleep with anyone else and he’s not currently seeing anyone else… so does that mean he doesn’t like me *that* much (and just likes me as a companion/for sex)??

So I met a girl once on a night out a few weeks ago. We danced, made out, exchanged IGs and numbers and I walked her back to her place but we did not have sex, in fact I regrettably didn't even make a move (keep in mind she was not that drunk if at all that night)

Anyway I have two accounts (one photography one personal) and I ended up going on her profile from the photography account and her story image was lit up on my photography page but not on my personal page. She also hasn't watched any of my stories since I texted her to go on a date so I'm assuming she muted me too. 

I kind of get why you would mute a stranger's story, but to hide your story from someone is a little strange. I usually hide my story from family and friends who are really judgy of my going out lifestyle.

Maybe she got creepy vibes from me? Maybe she felt bad about not responding and wanted to seem like she's never online? But if so then why not just unfollow/block me altogether?

He asked if I had plans that day. I told him no. (Because honestly I though I was going to be with him) and he said he didn't have plans either. 
I suggested we could have a lazy Sunday together and he basically turned me down and went silent for another 9 hours...

Monday evening comes around and I get a text that essentially says, “you’re a great guy but I didn’t feel a spark”. I told her I appreciated her being honest and up front with me and that if she changed her mind I would enjoy seeing her again and getting to know her more. 

After this we never really stopped talking. For two weeks we continued to text and Snapchat. One night even talked about how she wanted to hangout and take me up on a previous offer I made to cook dinner for her. Although She has a very busy work schedule working long days, 7 days a week so no plans were ever made. 

This past Saturday around 10pm I got a text from her asking if I felt like hanging out. I went over and again spent the night. In the morning when I left I asked if I’d see her again soon and she said yes she just has to figure out what her work schedule is like.

47,os0xqh,1627312986,20M How do I stop being needy and stop craving female validation,"
Hello all, I’m currently a 20M in college. I don’t really have any experience with dating or anything. Haven’t had sex with a girl, or even kissed a girl. I’ve been working more on the self improvement phase of my life before I get into dating, so that’s kinda why I haven’t had any experience for the most part. I am trying to get in better shape, figuring my career stuff out, maintaining relationships with friends, and am also working so I’ve been focusing on myself lately. Even though this is the case, I wouldn’t mind casually seeing someone. 

However, I am around and still do talk to girls in college, but I’m not the type to really flirt or pursue a relationship. However, once in a blue moon girls will show interest in me, and I end up in situations where I’m texting/snap chatting these girls. As someone who hasn’t really had much experience, I do sometimes crave the female validation, and realize that once I get into these situations I get into “scarcity mode”. Not that I’m being too nice, but I just always seem needy and get so infatuated from the constant attention that I end up texting and meeting to the point where the girl loses attraction. In fact, I do end up letting them know my feelings, but by that point I’ve already talked so much that the spark is pretty much gone. And then we stop talking and ghost each other.

This has happened a couple times now, and it’s starting to get to me. Because I know that if I had just acted right and didn’t let the convo get to my head I could have had it under control. Often times when things fizzle out like this I end up feeling down because this need for female validation comes back, and it’s like when I’m working on myself i never think about it. But once I get wrapped up in conversation with a girl this neediness comes out, and I recognize it but I just can’t help but keep going because I know I never really get that kinda validation.

My question, from guys, but girls can give their opinions too, how can I stop being so needy? How can I stop craving female validation? I know one thing that people say is keep yourself busy, which I am, I have a job, I’m involved in clubs and activities, school, but I just can’t resist the interactions sometimes. But I want to kill this needy behavior because it really holds me back. I am thinking about maybe going to therapy to see if there is some underlying insecurity which I have, but other than that I’m not sure. Like I said, with these girls, I wouldn’t mind casually seeing them, but a relationship I don’t think I can commit to because I’m so busy. Then the neediness kicks in when I’m talking to a girl and then it fizzled out.

He made any excuse to touch off me in the gallery and putting his arm round my shoulder - he pulled down my mask and kissed me in front of one of the ""main"" paintings in the gallery when no one was looking (masks still mandatory here btw) and we made out lying in the grass in the park (lol) and while it was nothing more than that we both got a lil *carried away* and he asked me if we could ""go back to your house, or is it too soon?""

I said it was too soon and things were still fine after that - he even started holding my hand as we walked, arm around me in the coffee shop/in public etc - generally being very affectionate. We've been back and forth texting since.

I'm planning to ask him out for a third date since he asked me out for the last two and I was going to suggest maybe cooking together at my place and a movie and then see if it leads further. However, I like this dude and don't want to move too fast and ruin things?

Any advice? Is a date at home this soon a bad idea? BTW I'm ready to sleep with him personally but I guess I'm afraid in case I'm reading him wrong and he just wants sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os1ble/third_date_at_home_good_idea_or_bad_idea/

51,os1nep,1627315000,Am I being friendzoned after first date?,"Met a girl on an app and texted back and forth everyday this week before going out. We have a lot of things in common and never ran out of things to say for the whole night we were out. For me a first date is good if we have a lot to talk about, but idk about her. Here are several hold ups that I am concerned about:

* We were at a club at one point and I put my arm around her and she seemed receptive and stepped closer to me. But when we went to a bar after instead of sitting on the same side she was sat on the opposite side. Was she just being nice at the club and didn’t want to make a scene?

* When I dropped her off at her place she hugged me and I asked her if she wanted to go out again she replied “we should definitely hangout again, but probably after my exam in a week. Send me your food pics.” Obviously I should give her space for her exam, but the fact she didn’t set a definite date is eating at me. I felt like she only said these things to get me to leave? Idk. 

* Before the date we were very flirty in texts and I tried to be extra corny in some instances to see if she was receptive- she was. She also likes lots of Lols and emojis. But after I got home she just texted “I’m glad u got home in one piece, have a good night!!” Pretty bare response. Haven’t texted her since. 

* When we initially matched, we talked on the phone for a couple hours and she asked me if I wanted to hangout on Sat night and if everything was good we’d go to the farmers market the next morning. She never mentioned going to the farmers market during or after the date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os1nep/am_i_being_friendzoned_after_first_date/

57,os2e78,1627317089,Need help moving on from GF of 10 years,"So I’ve (25M) known this girl (26F) since last 12 years. First 2 years I was in her friendzone but dated for the last 10 years. 

Out of these 10 years first 6 were a solid ones but last 4 years were a complete sham riddled with breakup’s and doubts about the future together (which have always stemmed from her). 

I have felt so strongly for her since the beginning. Have loved her with all my heart and still do. Ours was a beautiful and fulfilling relationship while it lasted. We both wanted to make it work but sadly couldn’t. I was always ready to give everything I had to be with her, but she gave up on us during the last 4 years. She fell out of love but given the long history we had,  we kept going back together. 

Each time it was me who would initiate the reconciliation and she would agree to it hoping it might work again. But it never did. Every time we got back together,  we would fall apart within 4-5 months. This kept on going for at least last 3 years. 

But since we both are reaching marriageable age and have come to accept that this relationship is not salvageable , we called it off again in May this year. The breakup’s have always been civil. And never before did either of us try to date new people while being away from each other. 

However this time around we both sincerely started making efforts to move on. We both deleted our pictures from  our social media, downloaded dating apps and started talking to new people. 

Now ever since I came to know she’s been talking to a person she found on bumble, she’s been living in my head rent free. It’s starting to affect me physically. Although I am talking to other people as well and I know she isn’t doing anything wrong but I’m just finding it hard to digest that she’s already buried whatever there was and whatever could have been. 

Not being able to take it any longer I asked her whatsup with the new guy and she told me they’re just talking and might meet in a few days. We haven’t communicated once since we stopped talking in May. However I just came to know about her Bumble somehow and so I could not stop myself from asking her. 

It literally pierced my heart to hear it from her she’s willing to meet and date new guys. 

How do I distract myself from this and instead focus on myself while moving on for the better ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os2e78/need_help_moving_on_from_gf_of_10_years/

It was bad and I bled everywhere so it was like 2 minute sex. I didn’t think we would see each other again but he tried to win me over and cooked me dinner and came over to cuddle (we didn’t do anything the second time as I was on my period but he was very sweet and complimentary and I guess I was impressed by his effort). Guy 2 does not want a relationship and is not the relationship type. Guy 2 is aware I am dating and want something serious with guy 1.

Guy 1 I have been on 2 dates with and we plan to sleep together this week. It’s intense and he’s Italian. He has said repeatedly he is only seeing me but I have mentioned I’ve been asked on other dates. He said I’m the priority. I guess I’m feeling guilty because I know that guy 2 wants to fuck me the following week (he intentionally left clothes at my house last Friday and he admitted it was on purpose) but I am sleeping with guy 1 this week and if he asks me to be exclusive afterwards I will agree to be with him.

How do I let guy 2 down gently that I will not sleep with him once I’ve agreed to be exclusive with guy 1? I have never been in a situation like this before and it genuinely hurts my head and confuses me how I even got into this situation. I only continued seeing guy 2 again because I had a disagreement with guy 1 last week and decided to keep my options open but we have since made up and everything is good. When guy 1 was angry last week he suggested that maybe we should both see other people which is why I met up with guy 2 again (wrong thing to do I know but I was angry). But we made up two days after. I don’t know whether guy 1 is lying about not seeing other people or just playing me (he deactivated the dating app but admitted after our first date some girls were messaging him).

But the way she behaves is so weird, I have no idea what to do or what how to respond. I'll summarize everything in ""pros"" and ""cons"" because I couldn't find any other words:

""**Cons""**

* She never initiates dates.
* She never flirts.
* She never compliments me.
* She never initiates physical contact.
* She never mentions ""We could go there together."" or something along those lines.

**""Pros""**

* She allows physicals contact (which I have to initiate).
* She always wants to go on dates (which I have to initiate).
* She will text me first if I don't text her.
* She talks about our relation lasting a long time.
* She's aware we're on dates and not just random friends.

I just genuinely have no idea what to make of this. She has deleted her dating apps and she's definitely not one to date multiple guys at once. Hell, as far as I can gather she never had a relationship before.

Recently, he asked me to go out to a bar with him (29yrs old) and I (23yrs old) agreed to go with him. I picked him up and we went to the bar and I thought the night was going well. Until, we sat at the bar and we ordered our drinks. We had been drinking before going to the bar so we were a little loose. As we waited for our drinks we were getting a little close (physically). There was a lot of tension between us sexually. To the point where we were close to kissing but we never actually did. Because as we kept getting closer he started to tense up. Then when the bar tender gave us our drinks he said let’s get the tab and go. And I didn’t want to leave but he insisted we go on a walk in the city. As we went on a walk I asked him why we had to leave and he gave me varying responses each time I asked. Then we sat down by a fire and we were very close almost kissing distance. And then he started to tense up and get very nervous and anxious. His eyes started to tear up and he started breathing profoundly. And once again he distanced himself and said that he wanted to say something to me. A little background information on him: he was adopted from an orphanage at around 5-6 years old. And so, he has a lot of issues that he has been dealing with. One of them is RAD or more specifically avoidant attachment style. He also has a hard time expressing his feelings, trusting people, fear of rejection, can be socially awkward. I have noticed we go in this push-pull dance that Nancy Verrier mentions in her book “The primal wound”. And I just wanted advise of how can learn to better adapt myself as an individual.

I just want some advice or read about people who have had similar experiences with individuals who are emotionally unavailable, have an insecure attachment style, intimacy problems… I truly care for him, I would say I love him.

But yesterday at work A customer gave me her number and I was wondering if anyone could throw some advice at me on how to proceed with texting someone I don’t know anything about.

Been seeing a great girl for a couple months. Spend a fair amount of time together , sex, etc etc. Haven’t had an exclusive talk (holding off a bit as she did just get out of a long relationship in April, don’t want to put unneeded pressure on her). 

However, I would like to know if she’s been sleeping with other guys. It’s alright if so, I just don’t know personally If I’d want to continue forward if that’s the case. Mentally would not be good for me (as well as safety, too). 

Is it an okay question to ask? Is it too personal? Awkward?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os4qzo/is_it_okay_to_ask_her_if_shes_sleeping_with_others/

87,os52lr,1627324778,Would you date someone with a social media following?,"I had this semi-debate / conversation with a close friend of mine (we are both men) over the phone about dating, relationships, all kinds of topics relating to romance.

The topic came up about deal breakers and what deal breakers my friend and I each had.

One thing I said was a deal breaker personally to me was that I would refuse to date and/or commit to a long term relationship with any woman that has a relevant social media footprint.

Whether it's a sizeable follower count on their Twitter or Instagram (I specified 10,000 followers+ just to ballpark my thoughts), or a popular Youtuber or Twitch streamer, or in general have an online presence that has some sort of impact on the internet or in their online community.

My friend that thought that it was an irrational deal breaker to have because of how prevalent social media is in our modern age, how prevalent the desire to have the attention of a massive online community is, as well as the attractive life that influencers partake in and advertise.

However, I believe that there is a sizeable percentage of the female population that have no interest in social media, don't want to be a part of social media, or uses things like Instagram passively to just chronicle their lives for memories and to show their friends their adventures.

My main reason for it being a deal breaker in the first place was having to emotionally deal with the constant massive amounts of attention my significant other would be receiving, which from my perspective, would all come from basically strangers. If my SO was a Twitch streamer, there would always be people fighting for being on the sub donation leaderboard. If they were an Instagram influencer, people in the comments and in the DM's would be going hard on my SO constantly, and it would affect me as much as it would affect her.

The other reason I laid out was that I personally never want any of my relationships to be publicly displayed on social media. Inevitably, it will get to a point where people with major online socials will want to update their lives and show off their long term partners as part of their new identity, and I would feel like I'm being paraded around for my SO's clout. It would make me feel really uncomfortable. Obviously there are outliers, some men and women out there with massive Twitch channels for example have kept their relationships secret, but there will always be pressure from their audience to say they have a boyfriend/girlfriend or not.

My friend and I had this conversation a week ago and this topic is still on my mind, so I wanted to ask you all:

Would you date someone with a social media following? Why or why not? If so, is it because it would be exciting or fun? If not, please tell me your reasons.

But then today he told me he’s applying for jobs all over the country, including some 2 hours drive away.

We've been asking alot of questions about each other and learning alot when we see each other. Our second date lead to sex that night which was so good and he stayed over afterwards. When leaving he told me to text him later today but I'm worried if I do will spook him since he's not a big texter.

I'm also still not 100% sure where his head is at in terms of if he wants just sex or seeing where this is going. He has been very interested in getting to know me more by asking questions about my life, family, past experiences with school and growing up.

One of my friends invited her brother to come as well so we talked there and stuff and he actually told me you should try talking to my sister she’s single, I acted surprised but I had actually started texting her after the party. So we texted for a whole week and stuff I made it clear as well that I was not Jewish because I knew that could be an issue because she comes from a Jewish family. So anyways asked her out on the weekend we went on a nice date went really well, we really clicked. And we actually kissed at the end as well. So next day I text her again having a really good chat a bit of flirting and stuff. Next day she sends me a message that she can’t do this anymore because I am Jewish.

99,os6q56,1627329568,I've made peace with being single but this is a rant,"I've been single for a few years now. 35 year old white/asian guy.

I used to get pretty fixated on finding a girlfriend and hated being alone while watching so many successful relationships.

Now, I've accepted that I live a life that women are not interested in participating in and I decided that my personal values are more important.

That sounds pretty heavy. The personal values I speak of are just anti-materialism and minimalism. I cherish things that cannot be bought with money but rather, hard work. Running, playing bass, practicing a new language, and other fleeting hobbies. I also strongly dislike car culture in the United States. Also, not a fan of exceptionalism and individualism.

The minimalism and lack of owning a car puts off most people. I get it. No one wants to be a chauffeur but I also don't want someone to drive me around. I choose where I live specifically because I know I won't be driving. So, close to a grocery store, mass transit, and keeping my commute to work in mind.

I like my lifestyle. I take pride in it.

It's weird though because a romantic relationship is different from a typical friendship. I have friends and I go meet up with them. Me not driving is never an issue. Occasionally for wilderness trips but I try to balance friends driving with other contributions I can make. I'm planning a camping/fishing trip next week that doesn't use cars. I am doubtful find a romantic partner who would be cool with assembling a backpack, take mass transit out to somewhere and then walk miles to where ever.

It seems that people are not interested in romantic friendships. What they want is codependent life-building relationships. I just want someone who wants to hang out with me. Literally all I ask. Just someone to seek out my company.

I said I'm over it but me writing clearly shows I am not. It's just wild that I would get a car, just for dating. Just for dating. Car payments, insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel, registration, not to mention that a car over all is something I need to be mindful of. All that, just to date.

So there it is. Do I live my life by my personal standards alone or do I get a car just to date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os6q56/ive_made_peace_with_being_single_but_this_is_a/
