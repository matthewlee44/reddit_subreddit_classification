I am looking for advice, I am a 26 yo male and my dating life for the last 10 years has been.... well , I dont have a dating life.

I have been on dates and never got past the first date before they ghost me or simply just say they are not interested.

But

I have recently met a Spanish girl who is only here for 2 months ( 1 month remaining)
We have seen each other every weekend and we have been talking throughout the week aswell.
I feel like we are really making a connection but me being me i am too shy to ask.

But it has worried me that she just sees me as a friend and I don't want to put unnecessary pressure on her and ruin a friendship if thats all it is.

I am so so bad with things like this and I don't want to let this opportunity pass me by.

Should I tell her I like her? How should I do it?

Which is totally not the idea. 

Even if my girlfriend was 250 lb I'll still do my best to protect her should anything happen. It's more of a looks thing and maybe a bit of a fetish.

I always have the mentality in my life that if something can happen it will. The way I'm wired has brought alot of anxieties in many areas such as chemicals... I will think about the toxins that get leached into plastic water bottle , the dyes in our clothes , working on cars I worry about all the carcinogenic fluids , etc....

Now when it comes to dating the one thing that has crippled me has been the fear of contracting cold sores. I don't have them (yes I know I may have them but don't know ,but as far as I know I don't ). 

You can get them even when they are not visible on the person you are kissing. I've tried to just go for it and not think about it but it brings me alot of stress an anxiety. I can't enjoy myself at all. 

Yes, it. May not be a big deal and be seen as a pimple ..but for me and my mind it isn't . I don't know how bad I will get it . I would be worried 24/7 that I'm shedding it and  reinfecting myself on other parts of my body if I got it  ( if it may happen it will In my mind) .

So I hooked up with a girl for the second time last Wednesday, please see the previous thread on top. Invited her back to my place, I cooked her dinner. We got to know each other, we were cuddling as we watched a Christmas movie. I said let's take a walk to digest and she said she would love that. She mentioned several things about how she is not good of a texter due to her ADHD, told me about her friends. We held hands as we took a walk and she kept bumping into me, her shoulders/waist sliding against me, and she would sometimes strengthen the grip.

After we hooked up at my place, plenty of kissing, cuddling, she said she really liked my hair and massaged me. We slept together with her cuddling with me, and had morning sex. I sort of got a little too excited and gave her a few hickeys and she texted me, ""holy! it's so dark! you're banned from my neck.""

I replied to her text and told her to have a good day at work but she didn't reply.

She sent me a snap of her hiding her hair and I replied to that and she didn't respond.

We don't really text or call, although I would like to. We also haven't discussed what this is, although I'm going to bring it up next time I see her. I called her last night at around 9, (she told me she goes to sleep at midnight,) but she didn't pick up the phone.

I'm thinking maybe I'm just being too pushy? Thing is I got the vibe she was really into me, and I really do enjoy her company.

What should I do? Should I just shoot her another text later today and see if she wants to hang out again? I'd love to take her out on an actual date or hang out with her again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qv9mk9/second_night_with_a_girl_i_really_like_spending/

I'm almost certain she liked me for a while when we were teenagers. When we were about 18 she also invited me to her apartment, which I'm not sure, but it might've been because she wanted to hook up (I never ended up going).

So eventually I lost contact with her and didn't see her for 4 years. Then the old friend group decides to meet up again and she's coming. We hit it off and whatever, things are cool. On one occasion she was telling all of us that her boyfriend was pissed she came out with us. When asked why, she said because he was worried about me. I shouted out ""well I know I'm sexy"" as a joke, and it got a laugh from everyone.

Then later on, some one of the guys there (really nerdy guy with no luck with women) was saying he was ugly, and the girl said that he's an attractive guy, but then jokingly said not quite as sexy as me (wewillmake_greatpets) though.

Then we all went swimming together and two of the guys were talking about their dad bods, and how girls like dad bods. Then the girl turns to me and says ""and you're standing there like 'I have a sixpack, I'm not worried'."" (I'm in good shape, so she wasn't being sarcastic).

Later on that night, when we were all talking, everyone got drunk except for the girl and I, as we both don't drink. Every time someone said something funny or stupid, she would turn to look at me. And I mean **every time**. I was beginning to think ""the amount of times she's glancing at me is weird"".

So judging by the fact that she used to be into me, and then her behavior during the hangout, I think she still thinks your boi is sexy. Idk though, what do you think folks?

If you‚Äôre seeing a new girl and it‚Äôs not as great as it first was when you started seeing her.. why would you go back to your old girl to tell her how shitty things are with this new girl ? 

This man really hit me up after months of not talking or seeing each other to talk about how unhappy he is in his current situation and still has feelings for me and the doors not closed for us but then stays with this girl who he is unhappy with?

37,qvaemj,1637076838,She think I'm attractive right?,"Yo so here's the 411 peeps. There's this girl I go way back with. Have known her for years. Used to have a thing for her, but I'm over it now. I'm almost certain she liked me for a while when we were teenagers. When we were about 18 she also invited me to her apartment, which I'm not sure, but it might've been because she wanted to hook up (I never ended up going).

So eventually I lost contact with her and didn't see her for 4 years. Then the old friend group decides to meet up again and she's coming. We hit it off and whatever, things are cool. On one occasion she was telling all of us that her boyfriend was pissed she came out with us. When asked why, she said because he was worried about me. I shouted out ""well I know I'm sexy"" as a joke, and it got a laugh from everyone.

Then later on, some one of the guys there (really nerdy guy with no luck with women) was saying he was ugly, and the girl said that he's an attractive guy, but then jokingly said not quite as sexy as me (wewillmake_greatpets) though.

Then we all went swimming together and two of the guys were talking about their dad bods, and how girls like dad bods. Then the girl turns to me and says ""and you're standing there like 'I have a sixpack, I'm not worried'."" (I'm in good shape, so she wasn't being sarcastic).

Later on that night, when we were all talking, everyone got drunk except for the girl and I, as we both don't drink. Every time someone said something funny or stupid, she would turn to look at me. And I mean **every time**. I was beginning to think ""the amount of times she's glancing at me is weird"".

So judging by the fact that she used to be into me, and then her behavior during the hangout, I think she still thinks your boi is attractive. Idk though, what do you think folks? I'm not into her or anything, so I'm not going to ask her out (she has a boyfriend anyway), I just want to boost my ego.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvaemj/she_think_im_attractive_right/
38,qvagle,1637076987,"I'm looking for something more, but don't know what to do... Please help?","Long story short, I met this woman at a friend's birthday celebration at a bar. We were very into each other, she came back to my place and we hooked up. The morning after we took a shower together, and I ordered her a uber home and said to text me when she got home. (Which she did.) We made plans to meet up next Wednesday, and she came over I cooked her dinner. We got to know each other as were watching a Christmas movie cuddling. I said we should take a walk together and we held hands. She didn't seem to pull away, and she kept bumping her waist/shoulders into me.  
She mentioned several things about how she is not good of a texter due to her ADHD, told me about her friends.

After we hooked up at my place, plenty of kissing, cuddling, she said she really liked my hair and massaged me. The sex was amazing, she came many times. We slept together with her cuddling with me, and had morning sex. I sort of got a little too excited and gave her a few hickeys and she texted me, ""oh my god! it's so dark! you're banned from my neck."" I replied to her text saying I would make it up next time I saw her, and told her to have a good day. She didn't reply. She sent me a snap of her hiding her hair and I replied to that and she left it open.  
We don't really text or call, although I would like to. We also haven't discussed what this is, although I'm going to bring it up next time I see her. I called her last night at around 9, (she told me she goes to sleep at midnight,) but she didn't pick up the phone.

I'm thinking maybe I'm coming off as very clingy or desperate? I'm thinking I'm pretty much the hook up buddy, because she doesn't open up her weekends, (she's only available Tuesday/Wednesday,) nor does she reach out or text/talk to me. Even though neither do I, but that's because I don't like texting/calling in general. I prefer to meet face to face.

Should I shoot her a text later today and see if she wants to hang out again? I'd love to take her out on an actual date or hang out with her again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvagle/im_looking_for_something_more_but_dont_know_what/

40,qvamei,1637077429,Just needed to vent a little after having a terrible dating experience with a woman...,"I (28M) went on 3 dates with a woman (28F) and it was a bizarre experience.

We met through an app, she was a slow texter (one message every night, sometimes not even that) so I asked her on a date and she agreed.

First date was okay. She was 10 minutes late (no text to say she would be), but she was great. Incredibly opinionated on anything and everything that it threw me off how fast she responded and functioned in general. Conversational, personal, clearly put a lot of time into her appearance, and she extended our date so we could walk and get dessert. We hugged goodbye, and that was that.

Second date, felt incredibly off. She did not seem happy to see me, was a few minutes late, and she did not put much effort in her appearance. The night was alright but it felt like she didn't like me at all. I ended up asking her if she wanted to go on a third date and she lit up and said yes so happily that I was taken aback. She later explained she was not an emotional person. Hug goodbye, did not feel comfortable kissing her, and that was that.

Third date was horrid. 15 minutes late with no text (I thought I was stood up). She was emotionless, felt very cold (more than usual), zero effort in appearance, and kept giving me a forced smile when I would stare at her. Claimed she could only stay an hour or so because of schoolwork (one grad class) and she had a male friend drive over from a nearby city last night to take her to dinner so she couldn't do it then. She kept speaking to me like I was an idiot when I couldn't answer questions about alcohol (I don't drink often) or didn't hold opinions on random things.  Asked me to ask her questions but never returned them.

She claimed she was never wrong, did not want kids because she was selfish, and kept asking me why I didn't know certain thing she knew. Hell, she even got irritated with me because I wanted to get a cat and then eventually a puppy....she claimed the puppy would kill the cat and I was being irresponsible. Any rebuttal I made was met with an eye-roll and more condescending lecturing. And every topic felt that way. Her opinions were never wrong and I refused to argue with her...it's as if she wanted me to argue with her. 

When I asked her what she wanted in a partner, she said ""I want someone who is my equal, who doesn't bend the knee to me"". At that point I became terrible company and just let the date become awkward with dumb questions and silence.

Ironically enough she offered to walk around for 15 minutes through the nearby shops to extend our date (despite me feeling that we both wanted to be nowhere near each other).

We haven't texted or spoken since then (mutual ghost). She rarely texted regardless.

She seemed to be her more genuine self during the last two dates, and I think the first date was just a mask of sorts. I just remember feeling something was off on that first date despite having a good time.

Very disappointing since we had a lot in common (family issues) that makes me feel alienated from most people. If she didn't come off so cold (intentionally or not), i would've been interested in trying to understand her and give it a shot.

47,qvb4u1,1637078770,How often should you take initiative in a row?,"TL;DR; If you feel like you clicked with someone, and it's just pure fun when you're with them, and you've already taken the initiative twice, how would you feel about taking a third initiative in a row?

For some context, I matched with this girl on hinge once and then on tinder. We quickly realised we had plenty in common, and when we eventually met up, we realised we had A LOT in common (we went to the same high school (we had the same struggles in high school as well), studied the same major, have similar taste in books, literature, movies, et cetera). We've met up twice, and on both occasions afterwards, I would say that I had a good time and she would agree that she had a lot of fun as well. 

I believe we've got a bit of a connection. When we would be cracking jokes, we would be finishing each other's jokes. We've got a similar pool of weird references (vine, movies, songs) which keep on popping up. There are some personal things we sort of see eye to eye on. I don't know in what direction it's going to go, but I'm not trying to worry too much about that. I'm just sort of living in the moment and just enjoying the time. We both work in the same city, but in different areas so unless there is a formal request, the chances are slim that we would bump into each other. We've been texting, but it's totally scattered because we're both very bad texters. (we even spoke about it, and shared a few jokes over it)

Here is where my anxious mind kicks in; I took the initiative to meet up on two occasions in a row. I really want to see her again, but i'm overthinking if i'm being too forward going already. If we had the same classes or had more frequent bumping into one another, I could easily get a feel of the situation. If I should back off or if she doesn't mind. But because it's text-based, my usual way of sensing her is thrown off. I'm just so nervous, and I would like a second opinion on the matter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvb4u1/how_often_should_you_take_initiative_in_a_row/

We have talked to eachother continuously since then except when we just couldn't cuz of any personal reasons. We used to play games together and talk about anime/shows. Then we kinda upgraded and started binging shows together and talks went from minutes to hours. I started catching feelings and im sure she did too at some point. Days passed and after like 5 months one day i finally gathered enough courage to confess knowing there's literally no future together considering the distance between us. We talked about it and how edating just doesn't work and stuff and we were back to normal , like back to being friends. 
We are super close now(3 years almost), like there are stuff about me that only she knows and vice versa. I suppressed my feelings for her cause i didn't wanna ruin our friendship trying to edate.
Now the problem is , I know this been happening since a while now but i have ignored it till now but its to the point where i just cant. It feels like she only messages when its convenient for her. Like when she's bored or have some shit going on with her.
Like she would ignore my messages for 6 hours straight and only reply when she's ""bored"" or got nothing better to do. 
Sometimes i just feel like i deserve better than that , considering I've been there for her everytime she's needed me. But whenever i want to talk to her she's not really interested. I do very much respect her but when she acts like this i just feel like blocking her and moving on with life. But again i dont wanna stop associating with her ever.

51,qvba08,1637079147,Men‚Äôs advice. Never project romantic fantasies onto someone you just met,"The worst mistake a guy can make when he is first dating someone is to project his romantic fantasies onto the girl. This will skew reality and his ability to accurately assess if she has the characteristics he truly wants.

This often comes from a mindset of scarcity, while confusing love and lust. Men are visually driven, so when we see someone we‚Äôre attracted to physically, we will often assume she is someone we want to be with, before getting to know her at all. 

Men and women are different in this regard. A woman can have a high level of physical attraction to a guy, but if he fails to properly engage her emotions, she will begin the phase him out.

It‚Äôs not easy. Having true chemistry with someone isn‚Äôt an everyday occurrence; but that doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be once in lifetime, or even a infrequent occurrence‚Äîif you are a developed, dynamic person. We want to hold onto what we desire. It seems counterintuitive, but this approach almost always leads to failure.

Your only objectives in the early stages of dating are to have fun, get to know the person, and have sex. Additionally, date other people and keep your options open. This is a safeguard against neediness.

Things will develop if both people involved want a relationship. Trying to force things, or putting the other person on a pedestal with unrealistic expectations sets a imbalanced dynamic from the very beginning.

That was until i fucked up something.I really hate when someone falls asleep while we are talking on the phone and she knows it,she did it 4 times in 5 days.So i told her that and we were arguing for a whole day,she was talking about me not being patient with her.So we ended up making a deal that she wont do that and i will not annoy her if she does it once or twice.

Then another fuckup occured.After that i became so needy like i never was.I guess i felt guilty after arguing and started texting like crazy,showing too much intent.I got ignored in a way by her,so i thought i shold apologise to her irl.So i did that,we are okay now and im still getting the looks at school,but not those hugs and kisses i used to get before arguing.

So the question is now,should i do some hot-cold tactic where i one day show love to her and the other remain silent,or should i pretend like we are starting over?Since i really want to be with this girl i'd continue talking to her until i get rejected or until we get toghether.

59,qvcloe,1637082511,Am I about to get ghosted for being slightly clingy ... and paranoid?,"Hi everyone,

I've (26F) been talking to this guy (30M) for a total of 5 months (4 months consisted of being in a harsh lockdown so we were on the phone for 2 hours every other day with consistent messaging) and we've been on about 4 dates over the past month. He basically initiated all 4 dates but I chose where we went for our last date.

After our last date (which was a Thursday night), we continued messaging/banter (which included him saying we need to go a museum for our next date) until Saturday. I stopped replying on that day (both on messages and insta) because there wasn't anything for me to respond to.

It's now Tuesday and I hadn't heard from him at all (which is slightly weird as we don't text all day but it is still somewhat consistent) so I messaged him if he was free for a call - he replied within the hour and said sure. I called and asked how he's going and that I was checking in on him, saying I felt like maybe the vibes were off because he would normally call me. He immediately joked/lie and said he was gonna call you but that I seemed busy (referring to an Insta story I put up of being out to eat earlier that day) and then he said ""truthfully, I am so exhausted from work. I'm sleeping badly and get poor quality sleep etc."" He then went on to ask if I was alright and what's wrong. I said nothing at all and said I'd let him go if he's tired. He said ""we never normally just have 10 minute phone calls but that if I need to go, that's fine"" I just said no I'd end the convo there and that should get some rest after working out (he was at the gym) and to feel better.

He messaged me about 5 minutes later asking if I was alright and I responded saying ""yes, just wanted to check in on you :)"" and he replied ""okay good"".

For context, apart from 4 phone calls I made including the one above, he has always called me throughout the past 5 months. 

So I don't know why but I guess from his ""I'm busy"" reason (he rarely says he's busy to me), the overall tone of the convo that I really can't explain and my clinginess that I showed by calling him to 'check in on him' - I'm worried I'm about to get ghosted ... or at least he's going to slowly fade. 

Any advice on how to deal with the slow fade out without acting on my paranoia/clinginess? Just not sure how to deal with this and I really don't want to get hurt.

I've (20m) been dealing with this girl (20f) from my hometown for about 4 years now. We started talking about being in a relationship during senior year of highschool, but she picked one of her coworkers (a notorious cheater in our school) over me when I confessed my love to her. As the years go by, she gets played by several ""toxic"" guys (by her own words) and goes down a road of self destruction (drinking, smoking, random piercings, etc). I joined the military after highschool, and we've always kept in touch since then. Every now and then, she'd tell me how she regretted not getting with me in highschool and how nice i've always been to her. She's always been cool to me, and she's one of the only women that I talk to at this point (I don't have a lot going on dating wise). I've always had feelings for her, but we've never really made it past the ""flirty friends"" stage. After a while, my feelings for her started to die off. 

Last weekend, I drove home to see the family and I eneded up hanging out with her again. We slept together, and she's now the second girl I've ever been with. I thought my feelings had dwindled since we left highschool, but I guess I was wrong. We were supposed to hang out the next day, but she flaked (she has a history of flaking when we plan to hang out). I was only in town for 3 days, so we didn't get to hang out again. That day before i left town, I decided to tell her how I felt. I told her that I loved her with every fiber of my being in front of her doorstep, and she said she always knew. However, I realized that being in a relationship with her is unrealistic, and after everything, I wasn't sure if I could keep being her ""flirty friend"" whose always there for her when she makes bad decisions. We kissed one last time, and i left town immediately after. Part of me wants to continue dealing with her and have a casual FWB situation for when I come back home. However, I know myself, and I'm not sure if I can do something like that. I told her I needed time to think about everything, and she told me that she loved me and reconsidered her ""no dating"" rule after I last spoke to her. I'm really confused, and I need advice.

83,qveq88,1637087929,KICKED OUT OF HOME AT 18!,"SOMETIMES PEOPLE GO TO ONLINE DATING to find someone they can lean on.

Like it happened with this girl, I have met once. She was 19 and she wanted to register on a dating site to find love. She told me her story and I felt so pity for her!

She told me that her parents had a USSR vision of life. They were convinced that a girl must get married at 18 and not later. They even picked a guy for her. They said she must have a first child by 20, otherwise she will be counted as SPINSTER! Of course Lina did not want to marry SOME GUY, who her parents picked for her! Who she even did not LOVE!

They had a fight and her father put an ultimatum. She rather marries that guy or leaves his house. Guess which one she picked? Yep! She left! 

She cried, screamed, she were hysterical, she had suicidal thoughts but.... she was suggested to go into a church. There was a convent in her city where only nuns lived. And they welcomed her there. She got a duty list and a room.  She told me that she felt very lonely there because all the nuns are much older! But she at least has a home there and a food. 

So this was basically her reason of joining the dating website. She asked me if she should write her true life story in an ""about me"" section. I said YES! Did I give her a good advice? would such a truth scare people away of her profile??

84,qvevpt,1637088327,Did I just get asked out?,"I (26f) have a huge crush on this guy (26m) from my university, and I think it might be mutual? We talk a lot and have thus far kept things juuuust this side of professional (it's taboo at the moment to date because of the circumstances - work stuff and specific university rules - but it won't be after the semester is done). We have tons in common, and he regularly shifts the topics of conversation when he talks to me from our class to more personal stuff, like what my hobbies and interests are and what my life goals are. He also keeps volunteering information about himself and his life, his background, his interests, his plans, and his favorite books and music (and recommending them to me). I'm the only one in our group he does this with, it seems. I mean, it's mostly just us two when we're together, honestly, so I guess I don't see him around enough other girls to compare the interactions. He also tends to get extremely close when he talks to me, leans in a lot, and gets really animated when I'm around.  

He asked me to meet up after the semester is over so that he could give me some ""pointers"" on something vaguely school-related. I'm interested in doing research on x not necessarily for my degree, and he has some experience with x, so now he wants to answer all my questions and keeps volunteering to help me with ""whatever \[I\] need"" after the semester is over. It's not just that he wants to help, but he wants to meet up in person to help. This seems to have finally crossed the line into ""I'm not just spending time with you because I have to; I actually *want* to engage with you outside the confines of the university"". But I could be misinterpreting and he might just be nice?

Because of the professional limitations this semester, it's really hard to differentiate flirtations from friendliness. Like, we are full-stop not allowed to date in our current positions, which end in December. But that goes away in a month, and it seems like the closer we get to the end of the semester, the more intense this stuff seems to be getting. I really don't know how to read it. Obviously, I want him to be interested because I am. But he could just be really nice, I don't know.

I'm not bad with girls at all, I go out often and hookup with girls on a regular basis, I have many friends who are attractive but just haven't sparked any interest for to pursue whatsoever.

Every time I hookup with a girl I have no motivation to make further plans to get to know her to see if I can see myself building a relationship with this particular girl. Many of my friends have gotten feelings for me or there is clear chemistry but I just cannot do something about it. I have always been this way and it has not bothered me the slightest, but suddenly I feel a crippling loneliness destroying me from the inside.

I have a lot going for me, I do very well at university, I'm not unattractive, I am very fit and I feel that I do very well in social situations and people seem to be drawn to me. For some reason I just cannot find connections with anyone on a romantic level. I have reached the point where I have too many female friends because I have some kind of friendzoning midas touch or some shit...

My brain looks for turn offs in any girl and for some reason expands on that shit until it is the only thing that matters and it is now ruining my life. I have started withdrawing myself socially to improve and compensate for this by studying and exercising like a fucking demon, but I know I am just doing this to mute my insecurities.

Now my life has changed, I am withdrawn, most girls know that I don't want anything intimate because my community is pretty small, so now I started hooking up with my sister's age group and I am now classified as the guy who has been with all the younger girls.

Fuck. I am 21 years old and I have no idea how to develop a relationship, I have unconsciously set the bar way too high for any possible candidate and I hate it, I don't want it, how do I fix this; please, any advice would be much appreciated.

We were both just starting our freshman years at uni and had a common interest in film. We talked for a couple days over text then stopped. We reconnected at our university's film club, and began to start hanging out more. 

One night after studying together, she invited me back to her dorm to watch The Sopranos. We ended up cuddling in her bed and holding hands. Afterwards I asked what she wanted out of our relationship, and she said it was too early to tell for her. I explained that I have been struggling with depression recently and probably wouldn't be able to handle a serious relationship. She said it was OK if we kept things casual.

After that we hung out a couple more times. I would usually be the one to initiate hang outs, and would almost always text first after that. At one point, we were cuddling in her bed, and I asked if she wanted to kiss, which she did. We made out for a while and I ended up grabbing her boob. Afterwards I asked if I made her uncomfortable and she said I didn't. Following that she became more distant.

Last night, we met up prior to a film club meeting at the dining hall. Once I got there, I texted her and she said that she was inside with a friend. A couple minutes later she walked out with an extremely attractive guy. We had a pretty normal hang out after that. Once I got back to my dorm, I sent her a voice memo explaining that I was kind of confused about how she felt about me. I woke up this morning to a text saying she just wanted to stay friends. 

I feel like a huge creep and dumbass. I feel like I should have read cues to figure out that she wasn't interested in me like that.
