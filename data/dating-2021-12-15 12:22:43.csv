0,rh5oxo,1639592721,My Current Dating Vent? I guess you could say lol,"21yo M

Im not sure what the flair to put so sorry if its not the correct one, just looking to vent/talk it out.

Dating past: Been single for about 3 years. My ex and I broke up because her and a buddy of mine went behind my back and started talking, going on dates etc. Dumped me for him and then I guess he had a change of heart so she lost both of us. After the break up I tried going out with 2 other girls in the 3 year span. The first girl I was talking to ended it because I was ""lame and boring"". Okay I get it our personality and interests don't match that's fine. 2nd girl I was talking to I matched with on bumble, talked for about a month then found out she had a boyfriend the entire time. Couple rejections here and there afterwords.

Now: I asked out a coworker who is the same age as me so figured why not. She said yes and so we went on a date last week. I personally thought it went really well. We went out for some coffee and food for roughly 3 hours shooting the shit, laughing, coming to realization that we have alot in common (wierdly alot) and so I asked her for a second date on sunday for this coming thurday and never got a text back. This for some reason put me into a dark place mentally especially yesterday just because I got my hopes up and was all excited because she is absolutely stunning with a great heart and well put together in my opinion. I thought things were going well, our texts she seemed interested, engaged in our conversation very well, bit of flirting. But now no text back when I asked for a 2nd date. It just confuses me because I thought things were going well. Spain without S lmao",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh5oxo/my_current_dating_vent_i_guess_you_could_say_lol/
1,rh69vh,1639594212,Caught him lying to my face. What should I do?,I had been dating a guy for about 6 months and things were well for the most part but recently I caught him in a lie. Initially when I heard him tell the lie I was in complete shock because I knew for a fact that the words coming out of his mouth were not the truth. So I gently called him out on it by saying what he was saying wasn’t adding up to things he’s told me before but that only made him lie more to cover up the inconsistencies. I honestly don’t know if I should actually let him know that I know he’s lying or just wait it out and hope he tells me the truth on his own or just end things before it gets too serious. I’m conflicted because I really do like him but I feel like it’s early enough that if I end things I’ll be ok and I can move forward and find someone else or if I should try to have a conversation with him about the lie and see if we can work together to move past this.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh69vh/caught_him_lying_to_my_face_what_should_i_do/

Is dental work a turn off? My teeth used to be pretty fucked up due to poverty and neglect growing up and I've had a ton of dental work done to get them all fixed up and looking better, so I'd consider most of my teeth to be ""fake"" (most of them have fillings + 4 crowns on the front).

I got a new pair earlier this year, but I always thought something was off about them. I recently discovered that one ear was lower on the side of my face than the other, which was making my glasses look crooked when they were actually straight. I took a lot of pictures of myself this year doing all kinds of things like traveling, graduating from college, participating in events, and other stuff, and they were all with glasses that looked crooked. I can’t use any of those pictures on dating profiles, but now those events have already passed and I feel like the pictures were all ruined by the appearance of my glasses. It’s hard for me to look at pictures of myself and not notice the glasses looking asymmetrical.

I've met a couple girls online this past year of being single, but nothing that felt like it was right. I'm learning that I'm not really one for hookups unfortunately. I feel like our culture is all about quick flings now, but I really enjoy meeting someone amazing, connecting in other ways, building trust, and then having sex in time. Don't get me wrong, I have a very high sex drive, but for me it's so much better to connect and explore sexually with one person than to sleep with a new girl every week.

I think there are some things holding me back rn, for one I'm probably moving across the country in less than a year, but I've been on tinder for the past month or so and have become overwhelmed. I have over 60 new matches I haven't messaged and it's like idk what to do with myself. It was never like this before I don't think. It definitely wasn't hard to start a conversation, but now I feel like I'm hesitant, idk what to say necessarily, and I feel like I'd get lost in too many conversations. Me and my ex met on tinder, ik it can be a good thing, but I'm just not sure if I'm feeling it.

They then only mentioned it after I've queried in casual conversation if they have.

I'm curious to know, for those that don't mention their children on their profile and don't actively mention it until it comes up, has that helped you get closer to the type of partner that you're looking for, or has it caused any issues?

9,rh7tlw,1639598254,How big of a red flag is being a M24 and not having had a serious relationship yet?,"So basically I’ve never been in a serious relationship yet. The longest run I’ve had was 4 months. And that was the one girl I fell in love with

It is honestly just because I really don’t fall in love easily, really nothing more than that. I end things quickly because I think that if I feel I’m not going to fall in love with someone, it would be unfair to them to keep things going. My logic here is to try and end it before it gets to serious because then the hurt is bigger. 

I did this 3 times, with girls who were great and I genuinely thought it could work out. But it didn’t. I wouldn’t do anything with a girl unless I think there is a possibility of something serious 

I have been in love only 1 time in my life and got dumped after a couple months, which hurt me really bad. It’s 7 years ago and I still think about it sometimes. How ironic that I did the same now a couple of times. 

Girls I talk to always find this super weird, and keep asking me why. I tell them that I don’t fall in love easily and they always think that there is something more going on and I don’t open up much. Which sucks. 

Girls, do you care about this? How big of a red flag is not having had a serious relationship yet? Or am I just being too picky? But you don’t choose who you fall in love with so how can I be picky if I don’t even pick? I know you can’t force yourself to be in love

I wrote this because I’m lonely and feel like I’m incapable of loving someone and I’m starting to think that I’ll never love someone again and be alone for the rest of my life.

But due to the c\*vid crisis, It's near impossible to meet someone since everyone tends to do social distancing.

Is social media the way to go? Instagram in particular? I wanna try something new, so I started showing some activity on there as well. Stories, pictures, stuff about the places I visited, a new picture of me here or there, or a meme. I do this so that everyone that is interested could take a look and see that what type of person I am, which is I guess better than just having 3 pictures and nothing else.

I also started adding a lot of girls. Now, I really want to meet someone, but most of these girls don't really know me in real life, so it's really hard to engage in conversation. I understand perfectly that it is a bit awkward to engage with someone's stories with a cold approach like that, but I'm always 100% friendly and respectful, engaging with a positive and organic comment. I've set myself up with a rule, if I comment 5 times during the span of 1-2 months (a story per week or two weeks, for stories that I find interesting, not every single one) I will take this a negative answer and stop trying to strike up a conversation. 

Do you guys have any advice about this? It seems very bleak and futile at times, and I'm starting to consider it a chore, instead of enjoying it. Maybe I should like a couple of pictures as they get posted, before I go in full on comments on stories?

14,rh84vv,1639599073,How to text a girl who is a slow and dry texter?,"So I matched with this girl online. We talked for like 2-3 days before I asked her on a simple coffee date. She was really slow at texting and pretty dry, but i figured meeting face to face would open her up some more. The date went okay we were there for like 90 min, she laughed at my jokes and I got to know her a little better, and she even agreed to a second date. She gave off some signs of being insecure and that she considered her self a boring person at times. She doesn't have many friends and is a teacher. So I chalked it up to her being a shy and busy person. 


She didn't text me after the date, so I shot her a ""Had a great time"" message later that night, and she responded with she had a good time too. I padded out some details about our second date, as well. After conversation I decided that I wouldn't text her first so waited about 2 days to see if she would hit me up first. I noticed on the news that bad weather would spoil our hiking date so I hit her up about it, and offered to reschedule to a different date and asked for alternatives to see if she wanted to do something else. She said she was still down to meet up, but didn't offer an alternative. So I put out the idea that we could go to a really trendy museum instead. She liked the idea and agreed to meet with me at certain time on friday and I put out there that I'm down to pick her up if she wanted since downtown parking is terrible. She said she would let me know.

I can't tell if she just isn't into me or just not that great of a texter. Our conversations are very polite and positive not too goofy.

Dog barked twice more, which I'm not a rocket scientist but dogs usually bark when they're seeking attention, either from her or from company. Barks end, by this time I'm oblivious to what she's talking about, I just want to know why is she telling me something that's not true? ""baking pie"" So I ask what kind of pie is she making? I'll spare the details, which had strange ingredients, I tell her it sounds amazing, she says she is almost done prepping and states the minutes it takes to fully baked. I tell her I gotta go because she became irritated that I didn't pay attention to what she was telling me, avoid arguing because I was setting up for check mate, I was deep in my thoughts wondering why the lie. I call her after baking time, she picked up. Asked her about her pie, she said it was great, told her to send me a pic. What was that for, got defensive and I got no pic. I wanted to see the strange ingredients, 😆😂😆. Once she saw I had her ✔️ mate she wanted to see me, so I tell her bring me a slice of the pie or don't come at all. She calls me while at a gas station and tells me she doesn't have it and wants to still stop by, Spidey sense go on, 😂😆😂 again because as the dummie is in the car I hear the car door open and close, not only the door I hear but the clicks of the dashboard when you leave the keys in the ignition. This is not common knowledge, but if you understand cars then you know what is what. She showed up, I didn't make a fuzz, QUESTION?????????? So, why the lie? Or am I crazy for assuming the lie? She's a FWB, we discussed how I didn't want to see her if she had any other relationship within our agreed two week minimum. Yet, she still wanted to hookup, I kindly declined. Drugs? Can't be cheating we're no official couple, she says we're not exclusive until I asked and she agreed, I never asked. Am I bugging? Am I getting jealous? I'm getting attached/feelings?

Well we just talked again on the phone and discussed the whole situation. She understood that i have every right to be upset since we were going somewhere but she also said my reaction was a little intense since we werent exclusive yet and my angry reaction suppprised her since Im always calm and emotionally chill and seeing me in an upset and emotional state took her by suprise and she was also upset bc she knew she screwed up

 we agreed to see each other again and go on another date. But the talk on the phone was still pretty stiff and a little awkward...the date is coming up and how do we not make it awkward and get the flow back?

I then eat, study( full time student), and sleep. I really take the “sacrifice your twenties” idea seriously. On my off days(2 weekly), I do data analyst work for my university. Always day I don’t have time for a relationship. 

Two days ago, a very polite young lady couldn’t stop complimenting me at my work before I could even introduce myself she complimented my hair, glasses and physique. She even raved about my piercings(she has a golden hoop nose ring on her left nostril and I have two in mine. I made sure she and her guests(I’m a waiter) were well taken care of and she and I kept making jokes. She asked for my number but I was so busy it slipped my mind. About 15 min later, she said to me “please give me your number before you disappear again”. So I did and saved the contact icon as a selfie of her and I. We don’t text often(holiday time is busy in our industry) but I suggested we grab drinks today. She said she couldn’t make it but in the same message, asked if I’m free in two days.

Just wanted to get some opinions on whether she was being flirtatious or just really friendly. I know she’s keen and I’d like to show that I am as well but I don’t want to be presumptuous

Now before you tell me that ""I shouldn't shit where I eat"", this is just a part-time thing for me along with my studies and we don't have a no dating colleagues policy.

I feel like I'm getting played. As she gets closer, I carry on liking her even more. I don't know what to do really.

25,rh9gmn,1639602658,Should I(m18) try to keep in touch with her(f18) or is being quiet for months going to tarnish our friendship as a whole?,"So this is a long story to get the main situation..

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.” 

Some other stuff that happened that I don’t want to somehow cram into the story

- when we were playing video games together, she started talking about baby names and which ones I liked. Then she followed up the names she liked with my last name. 
- after the whole situation, her mom followed me on Instagram. 
- she out of the blue started checking up on me when I went off to college",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh9gmn/should_im18_try_to_keep_in_touch_with_herf18_or/

That was until university it was a goal to find someone, however I was limited thanks to covid and started using multiple dating apps. And to this day I'm still using it, but I feel like it's a waste of time. However it shows results quicker but also can be disappointing.

Here's some basis about myself that im willing to share,

I talk to myself with characters from any given Fandom. Heavy rock. Cartoonist. Student. If this isn't weird then what the heck I'm I. A unique personality? Someone who doesn't see himself with children in the future? Has a secret issue dealing with lust so probably want to provoke it by hooking up? Wants to have a second chance on what a relationship really does?

It's indifferent, but at the same time there's hope. However I don't think people at any place would be interested and I just kept myself on my own and not really approach women, no matter how much my lustful side is beyond broken and out of control.

So I ask, is it better to try it from a traditional perspective than just virtual? Should I Uninstall the dating apps? Start from scratch. How can I control my lust and bring out the passion without being disappointed. What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh9ruo/should_i_try_traditional_dating_instead/
29,rha0h7,1639604078,Advice from a Counselor: 4 things to look for in a partner,"Hello,

Thanks for clicking and I hope this read serves you well! I will say that I am a Counselor by trade but I have always had a fascination with love and relationships so my advice here comes from both my personal and professional experience. I want everyone to find their person that brings out the best version of you and that you can grow old with. It sounds great yet seems so unattainable for many people. These 4 things I am going to say you should also look for in yourself. It can be hard to give an unbias opinion of ourselves but give it a try and see if you see these 4 things in yourself. REMEMBER-You can't expect from a partner something that you also lack.

\#1- Impulse Control

This is the number one thing to look for because it is what I believe to be the basis of most conflict in relationships. People that react on impulse, rather than thinking and then acting, are bound to cause problems. Impulse control problems are the route of most couple conflict that I have seen. The best thing you can look out for is the predictability of a partner's response to any given situation. Basically, do you have an idea of how your partner is going to react when you give them bad news or when they are faced with aversive stimuli? If the answer is yes, and you don't like their response or feel it is inappropriate then there are only two options in this situation. Have a conversation with your partner and let them know how you feel about their behavior and create a plan together to work on it. It is this or break up. In every relationship I have ever seen or heard of, if one partner does not see a need to change when there clearly is one or does not put in the effort to change despite seeing it, then things never work out. The problem forever persists because nothing gets resolved without putting in the work to resolve it. 

If you have bad news to tell a partner but you are afraid to do so. Write down how you think your partner is going to react. Then tell your partner the news. If they reacted how you expected then show them what you had written and see how they respond. Are they defensive? Do they get angry? Are they concerned or apologetic? Whatever it may be, let them know that it's not okay and you expect change and not just an apology. No one should have to put up with such poor behavior. Let them know that you can work on it together and if need be maybe therapy can help as well. If they are not willing to or you see no effort from them to change then all you can do is leave. That's it unfortunately:/

\#2- Responsibility

Controlling oneself is very important but everyone from time to time might have an off day. Maybe you say something that is uncalled for or do something you regret. It happens, but all anyone can do is take responsibility for what they said or did. A person without a sense of responsibility is bad news for any relationship. Do you or your partner always pass the blame or go on the defensive? Neither will resolve anything and usually what happens is that people ~~forgive and~~ forget. This is a common cyclical pattern of behavior in relationships where something negative happens, there is an argument, some stewing in anger and hurt feelings, and then some time goes by and eventually both move on. Nothing was done to actually resolve the conflict and create changes that will prevent similar future conflicts. If you notice this about yourself or your partner but don't know how to fix it then I suggest going to counseling. Either individual or couples. They both can help. 

Find someone that takes responsibility for themselves and can listen to you when you call them out. They might want to tell you their side and you should listen but if what they say does not justify sufficiently what had occurred then don't back down. If you forgive or forget too easily then it will lead to resentment somewhere along the way.

\#3- Follow through

Don't you hate it when you have plans with a friend and they cancel last minute? If that friend does it to you multiple times then you likely won't continue being friends with them. What about if a partner does it to you? I find that people often give their significant others a lot more chances than they give their friends. Logically, it doesn't make sense because a friendship and a relationship are very similar. I always say the foundation of every relationship is a friendship. If you won't put up with this behavior with your friends then you shouldn't with your partner either. That goes for any behavior as well. You have to expect follow-through from your partner on a consistent basis. This is partly how trust is built because your partners behavior becomes predictable and predictability is comfortability in relationships.

Follow through can be more than just making and keeping plans. It is anything that someone says they are going to do. My dad and I have this problem. We always procrastinate and put things off and that can be kind of irritating to a partner. It's important to ask yourself how important is follow-through to you. We all have different thresholds and my mother for example has plenty of tolerance for it because my dad has so many other great qualities. I do my best to be cognizant of my partner and what follow-through she needs from me. I am not the best at it but she sees that I try and that is enough for her. You can't let this one build up inside of you and if your partner can't take some responsibility on changing their lack of follow-through then they probably are not the one for you as well.

\#4- How they treat others

How does your SO treat you? How do they treat their family, friends, co-workers, etc.? A good rule of thumb is that a person is only as kind as the way they treat a stranger. It doesn't matter if your partner treats you well. If they don't treat others well then eventually you will also be treated poorly. Are they rude to servers or do they seem to be involved in a lot of workplace drama? Usually people that are unkind to others either don't realize it or they rationalize it by blaming everyone else. Nobody wants to depict themselves as the villain so they make others into the villain.

I see a lot of people feed into this aspect of a person way too much. People try to be the healer, protector, savior, etc. Whatever it is called it is all the same. I have clients that come to therapy because they want someone to call them out on their stuff because nobody else will. Kindness isn't always about being kind. The motives behind one's kindness tend to not even be something we question with a partner but you should at least until trust is built. Often people want to be ""the savior"" because that is how they will earn a person's love. If your partner is always the victim and you are always there to protect or save them then they will never grow as an individual. True kindness in a relationship is wanting the best for our partner and behaving as such. No one is perfect but noticing victim patterns or savior patterns in ourselves or our partners is a good start at recognizing there is something dysfunctional.

Closing thoughts:

No relationship is perfect and partners may have a lot of good qualities that out weigh the bad ones. The things I listed are just foundational behaviors that create most issues I see but are often the hardest to resolve because they get overlooked or there is no effort being put to change them. My personal approach has been to look for someone that has these 4 things first; good impulse control, takes responsibility, has good follow-through, and treats others well. This is the foundation I think everyone needs in order to be as successful as possible in all relationships they make. 

Personally, I have been in two relationships. One lasted 6 years and the other is new as of this year. I think Reddit can keep my secret but I plan on marrying my girlfriend and I already got the ring! My first relationship ended because we were not the right fit and we wanted different things in life. It lasted longer than it should have because these 4 things we had covered and for the longest time is seemed stupid to just give that up. I think that shows that there is more that matters than just these 4 things but the foundation it creates when you and your partner both have them is very strong.

31,rhaakp,1639604840,I'm a women who asks out guys,"Now I've always asked out guys my whole life pretty much and I go through what the guys go through and I get rejected just as much as the same. 

That being said im really getting tired of hearing that I need to lower my standards or date inside my league ( when I don't even know what my ""league"" is! ) now my standards are realistic and reasonable and I know what I want in a partner. Now me personally I've never been in a relationship before or had my first kiss nothing really. Not really interested in dating apps because I don't live on my own and they give me terrible anxiety I downloaded tinder once and it just made me extremely uncomfortable.

I'm the type of person if I where to go on a date with someone I'd have to be friends first with them and get to know them on a little bit on a more personal level before going on a the date anyway. 
I mean I could be demisexual? but I don't think you can be two sexualities at once I could be wrong about that but I am bisexual so I don't know really.

Anyways I always get asked what I would ""rate my looks"" now look I don't think everyone is going to find me attractive and that's perfectly fine but I've had men my whole life make me feel bad because of the way I looked or the way I dressed I did suffer a lot of bullying in school pretty much my whole life and last time resulted in a guy stealing my book back to make a ""point"" which i don't what he was trying to make.

I've also had guys who were interested in me but they only wanted one thing from me and I just didn't want to do that right now since I'm waiting till marriage ( because of trauma as a child that i faced ) 

And I run into the problem when i do meet people I'm interested in they never reciprocate or they are emotionally unavailable or they aren't looking for a relationship and the last date I went on was two years ago and that was my first date and only it didn't lead to anything else further. 

Then at my age everyone and I mean everyone my siblings and my friends are getting starting their lives and having another shoulder to lean on while me I had two toxic friends ( i cut them out of my life ) and im still recovering from not having any type of reciprocated love in my life rather its friends or love which unfortunately I don't have in my life right now.

If your going to ask I do take really good care of myself mentally and physically I go to therapy and make sure my depression and anxiety are always in check, I've been told I dress really nice and am a very social butterfly. But I still suffer from the trauma of not only being bullied by guys all my life growing up, but still having a hard time with fighting that I don't know what I would look like in a relationship with someone and having someone else see me for their point of view and showing me things that I might not have known about myself like small things.

I do believe I know myself pretty well I just wish I had someone who was willing to get to know me and not completely write me off. 

I've been feeling pretty upset about my love life but it honestly comes in waves I have days where I'm fine where I'm at and days where I don't know why the heck I'm still single? 

I've been told I'm really pretty and I'm super easy to talk to and have a really loving personality but not enough to be someone's girlfriend?

I'm learning how to gain more self confident in myself which I do think I'm doing really good at especially through the help of therapy. Right now I don't have friends to hang out with because me and my best friend are on a break. 

I am getting a job very soon at the beginning of the new year I'm happy about it but I can't seem to show it. I do know my love language is physical touch which being cuddled, kissed and said I love you to"" is something I've always just craved really. 

It just can be hard sometimes because I've been told women have it ""easy"" yeah some women but not everybody I've also met really attractive people who are in the same boat as me. Then I start getting worried because I know I do want kids in the future ( not right now not fanatically stable yet and don't have a house yet lol and not married ) 

I just hope that soon I'll know what reciprocated love feels like be able to fall asleep next to my partner and have another support system have someone who adds on to my happiness ( not the only thing that makes me happy ) basically something outside my friends and family. 

But yes I'm a women who asks out men I've done it all my life some find it bold of me and confident ( because I'm just a women who knows what I want in a guy ) but for some reason I can't attract that person because of unfortunate circumstances for some reason.  I think at the end of the day it just comes down to luck... it's gonna suck when I get older ( hopefully things will be different and I'm not single I'm in a healthy relationship) I have to go to weddings and baby showers.. and go back home to a empty house/apartment ( which i couldn't live like by myself unless ya know I had a partner because I want to get my own house built one day ) 

But anyways this is my rant I've been having a crappy two months into the new year so it's just been super hard on me since right now I don't have a support system right now its just been me and me alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhaakp/im_a_women_who_asks_out_guys/

Disclaimer: nothing is always absolute, and there is alwys a few exceptions.

1. Good relationship with her father

How her father treated her is most likely how she will expect to be treated or what kind of an attitude she will have towards other men. Good father daughter relationship is a prime corner stone for a good relationship with the future SO.

2. Her parents are still together

Marriage doesn't last long these days. Half of marriages end up in divorce. If she grew up in a nice and healthy family enviornment, there is a high chance she will transfer that energy into your future household, and vice versa.

3. Her mother is a high quality woman

Mother is a sign of how you can expect your SO to look and act in the future. If the mother is a good, intelligent, well read and kind type of woman, which is still looking good in her old age, you can bet your money your SO will replicate these things as well.

4. Nice personality and kindness

She is honest, she doesnt gossip and talk behind peoples back. Has a high quality group of good friends, and behaves like an overall diecent human being.

5. Limited hookups

She had none, or very little casual sex adventures. Girls with high body counts of random hookups and casual sex, are more likely to cheat on you, and create issues further in life.

6. High quality friends. You are who you chill with. If her friends are low quality girls, drug addicts, promiscuous bunch etc, chsnces are, she identifies with them, hence they hang out.

Hope this post will help you bros in finding women adequate for a future together.

Not everyone is cut out for marriage. Do yourselves a favour, skip those, and find someone worth your time.

We spoke straight like rapid fire via texting for an hour and he was very flirty (nothing inappropriate though, all pg). However, he has not messaged at all since then. Given how direct he is, i would assume if he was still interested he'd continue talking. The last messages were him laughing at something i said. Should I not follow-up and bump the thread? I feel like if he wanted to get to know me, he'd continue talking semi-frequently before the time we'll meet and/or would have said looking forward to emeting you, have a lot of work to do, have a good week, rather than the convo go from rapid fire to 0 with no ending.

I would be really interested in getting to know this person but given how direct he was in asking for my number within 15 mins and how interested he'd seem, i wonder if I should not follow-up now that he hasn't messaged for four days. Is this something common?  
Also, he gave me a photo to use in case i wanted a contact photo for him. Was he mentioning that that bc he is probably adding lots of random girls and needs contact photos to remember whos who?

I think maybe i was too 'easy' in how i gave my number and agreed to meet. SO not sure if i should message again or what i could say?

TL;DR Why ask for my number, use it right then, but never follow up? did he ever intend to meet end of december?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhbvi3/he_asked_for_my_number_and_said_hed_love_to_meet/

It's hard to explain without coming across whiny and childish. But long and short, I'm tired. I'm tired of being beneath notice. Tired of being dismissed. Tired of being overlooked. Tired of an entire gender thinking I'm not good enough.

I workout to someday look better, only for women's standards to raise in accordance with my ""gainz"". 

A: am I justified in my frustration?

B: how do you approach women anymore when 90% of the time i am regarded at with a look of derision?

C: do women relish making men feel unwanted?

D: how does one truly reform from being a neckbearded niceguy? Or is it new age equivalent of the P burned into a pirate's hand?


E: how does one even get over social anxiety and a fear of failure? My brain talks me out of every idea or ""opportunity"" of romance. I understand that a woman merely existing IRL isn't an opportunity to find a partner,  but how else am I suppose to encounter a possible mate? I see women all around and society has dictated that its essentially never ok to approach a woman. Gym? Leave her alone. Work? The CAF just apologized for sexual harassment.  On the street? Stranger danger. Etc.

Lots of women consider this guy handsome, and he's jacked/ripped.

(I really don't want to see too much bias here, so let's just say he is funny and charming. He's ideal in many ways, the only thing is his speech).

He cuddled with me all night long and showed care ( whenever I'd get up he would ask me if all is good , during the night he would kiss my back or hung me tight.. etc) however at some point he mentions that he does not want anything serious. I say that's okay although it did sting a little. A week later he says we should just be friends. I Say where is this coming from and he says it's because if we keep doing this we will get attached and one of us will be hurt. I ask him if by one of us he means me and he says no I mean either one of us. And he says , if we keep doing this I too wil get used to it and I dont want that to happen, to which I reply "" I understand and respect your decision"". after this he stopped talking as much . I Did not talk either. He texts 2 days later to ask about me and I answer briefly and respectfully. Later that day we see eachother by chance because we go take language classes at the same language center. We briefly talk. Later that night at midnight he texts me "" goodnight+ name"" which felt a little intimate( maybe I just want to believe that because in case it's obvious yet I actually quite like the guy) then we dont talk for 2 more days and today I see him by chance again at the end of class ( we are not in the same class) I was standing with a group of friends and he with another group. I looked briefly in his direction and when he did not look back I just left and went home because it seemed ridiculous to wait for him to give me his attention. But then almost immediately after I left he texts me saying "" hey I wanted to come say hello but you already left "".. we exchange a couple of messages and then right now he texts me ""goodnight, it was very nice seeing you today even from afar"" .
Now guys, I already know I should just stop overanalyzing this and move on with my life but It drives me crazy because I'm like does this guy like me or is it all in my head. 
Btw this guy told me before that he has commitment issues because he went through the worst heartbreak when he was younger and that ever since he never could get into a serious relationship. 
Also, I know for a fact that he is veeery attracted to me physically. I Just sometimes want to believe that he liked me more than just physically but I'm afraid I might just be fooling myself.

67,rhdc8b,1639613125,How would you handle this kind of situation with a woman?," First of all, great advice on here and thanks to all!

I've been dating this girl for a few dates and so far we have not gone further than make-outs. The advice people have given here to increase sexual inuendo and sexual tension has worked great in general for me with women in the past, but not as effective with this woman. For example, we had an inside joke where we made a bet and the loser would have to do a dance or like a music video routine for the other person (really just a joke and not actually going to do it). But, she happened to choose a dance and sent it to me where one where a guy strips in the middle of the video so i joked to her that she only chose the video bc she wanted me to strip for her and then i teased her that ""why even pretend u want the dance if u just want a specific ""part"" of the video?"" and then i said no pun intended. She laughed but that was it. Then she said ""OMG I didn't see the full video so didn't know that part was in it so I will choose another one"" and then i continued along a little further with the joke but she just put all these emojis like embarrassed emoji and red face emoji and irritated emoji. Another time we were out and she said she liked the texture of something because its ""nice and hard"" and so I was being light hearted and said oh i bet you do like it nice and hard, don't you? And then i laughed and her face got a bit embarrassed and then she just laughed and that was it.

How to handle this and get beyond the make-outs? I feel like some will say just let her go and she's not worth it if she is not ready to have sex but I've had plenty of hookups so I am not necessarily just after that. I think its cool to have a girl with intelligence and personality too and she has a lot of intelligence and i like her personality overall (although not when it comes to the teasing parts like these examples). I think this girl would be good to date in general but I'd like to get things moving faster. I'm going to invite her to my place next weekend for dinner and wine so I will try again but it feels like I am having trouble getting past that make-out level. Is it possible that she just prefers to take it slow? Or maybe she is kind of asexual? Or maybe likes sex but conservative in the early going? How to break through? I do think her interest level in me is otherwise good as she was fully leaning in first for the make out we had and texted me a lot with pics she took from the night of me and how good i look in them. And she also usually tells me how great of a night she had with me after we go out. One other interesting note is that she mentioned she has been cheated on by a guy in her past.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhdc8b/how_would_you_handle_this_kind_of_situation_with/

I never dated is school because none of my crushes were mutual and I believe at least part of the reason for that is that I'm really short (Always been the shortest guy in class) and also generally unattractive looking.

Now, as an adult, it's really hard to actually get to know someone as interactions with colleagues in University and job are generally quite short. My friends have advised me to ask people on dates to get to know them, but in general people from University aren't even very friendly and only talk to me when they require something. And I don't get to interact with a lot of co-workers at work, the ones I do interact with are generally a lot elder to me and I don't vibe with them in that way.

I have tried going to clubs, bars &amp; parties but didn't get to interact with a lot of new people. The few interactions I did have resulted in girls often insultingly dismissing me.

I also tried dating apps but it's really hard to get matched with people, and when I do get some matches, I always get ghosted after a few days of conversations.

I like to think that I'm not that dumb, I love having discussions on a wide range of topics from philosophy, history, biology, technology and politics. I have an okay sense of humor but I'm not very funny, so maybe that also hinders me a bit.

80,rheb7n,1639615993,Im not sure of what to do,"(tldr+ important stuff at bottom)

There's a girl I like that stares at me a lot, but never texted back.

We're both 16, she's in two of my classes. I kinda thought I had a crush on her, so I was paying attention to her a little bit. It kinda seemed like she was glancing over more than usual, like there were times when I was working alone in the hall, she'd pass by and look over her shoulder, and she'd just glance towards me a lot in class. Eye contact would occasionally happen, she would usually look away quickly.

Luckily, a seating chart in one of the classes let me move and sit close to her, and I started talking to her. We have a lot in common, we both play soccer, similar classes, that sort of thing. She's normally kinda quiet, but I could make easy conversation with her and get her to laugh. After some time, I ask for her number.

She gives it to me, and I text her immediately so she has my number. I then text her that weekend, but no response. the issue is, now I don't sit at her table anymore, so I can't just talk to her about it. I mention it to a mutual friend, and that mutual friend texted her asking if she got my text, but the mutual friend got no response either. So now I just think I misread things, but she was glancing over more than usual that week.

I do manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I ask her why she didn't respond, and she apologized and said she was at a soccer game. She also said she didn't text the friend back because she was on a plane. That doesn't really make sense why she couldn't text back later, so I was still confused. In the following week, she is staring more than ever. I didn't think she wanted to talk to me so I avoided eye contact, but I could clearly see her repeatedly glance over towards me, even if I was behind her.  So, I text her gently asking if she didn't respond because she doesn't want me to text her. Again, no response.

But since then, she's been staring excessively. She would fix her hair several times each class, something she used to not do, but we have a mask mandate still so I couldn't tell if she was smiling or anything. By excessive staring, I mean every single class, every single day. If im behind her, she'll repeatedly glance over her shoulder. If i'm to her side, she'll repeatedly glance at me, even if the teacher is on the other side of the classroom. If i'm in front of her, she'll glance over the most, sometimes she just stares for several seconds. Even if she's blocked by something, she'll lean around it to look. I did try to avoid eye contact again, I didn't want to be weird and seem obsessed, as I had already texted multiple times. But pretty much any time I looked directly at her we made eye contact, and she was the one looking first.

With all the staring, I kinda would've expected her to come talk to me, but she hasn't. I was the one to go sit at her table and ask for her number too, so I stupidly felt I shouldn't be making more moves at this point. She did seem to want to be around me though, before thanksgiving break, she stopped to leave class with a group of people I got stuck with with instead of going around, and was staring at me when we left even though she knew other people in that group. But, she went home early so I idiotically didn't talk to her then. She would start talking to me whenever I was nearby without me initiating conversation though.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr, girl I like stares at me, I text her, no response she stares more frequently. I text her again trying to figure out why she didn't respond, and she now stares A LOT more, repeatedly every class, regardless of where I am or if something is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

 Normally, I just would've thought she was kinda weird and moved on, but she's insanely pretty, and is in the top 1% of kids academically and athletically, and she's one of the nicest people ive ever met. If I still have a chance, I very much want to at least try.

Does anyone have a clue why she is doing this? I know what I have to do, I just have to talk to her, but I don't see that being likely to happen anytime soon, finals are going on in school right now. I really only see a two options,

1. she's interested but can't text back for some reason, and is too shy make a move, possibly because I avoid eye contact
2. she's not interested and just likes the attention, even though I try not to stare at her and haven't talked to her in a couple of weeks

neither make sense.

There are a couple of things I could do,

1. I could text her again, saying something like ""I like you,  I was going to ask you out, and it seems you were looking over frequently the past few weeks, so I thought you might want to talk to me. It also kinda seems like you can't text back for some reason, so i'll be in the library before school tomorrow if you do actually want to talk to me. Otherwise, I'll just leave you alone and not bother you""
2. Or, I could text her again asking her to meet somewhere at school tomorrow, saying it seems like she was looking over a lot and I don't know if that was because she wanted to talk to me, and that way I could ask her why she didn't text back in person, and ask her out in person if it goes well.
3. I could call her, but I'm not confident she'll pick up
4. I could follow her on instagram and try dm'ing her, but I hardly use instagram so that would be kinda weird.

I don't like any of those options, but I don't have classes with her tomorrow and we get off of school starting friday, so I won't be able to talk to her. It was a huge mistake to wait so long, but I was just really confused and kinda nervous, this is my first time doing this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rheb7n/im_not_sure_of_what_to_do/

85,rhel0w,1639616802,I have feelings for my fwb and I don't know what to do,"I met this guy a few months ago on Tinder. We got along great and had a second date within a few days. Early on, he told me he only wanted something casual and although I was looking for a relationship, we continued hanging out. It became something of a fwb situation but honestly, I think if either of us start dating other people, we'll still remain friends. We meet twice a week usually and some days we're sincerely hanging out and don't have sex. He feels more like a friend at this point. 

The problem is I've had feelings since the beginning. I'm not great with dating ""casually"" because I catch feelings easily. I was able to date for a bit and thought I was over him but as soon as we went to a singles meetup together, I felt horrible watching him talk to other women. I obviously wasn't over my feelings. 

Part of me is still holding out hope that he'll want a relationship with me if I admit my feelings. And I know how unlikely that is because he's already said he doesn't want that. I'm worried if I do tell him, he's going to distance himself because he doesn't want my feelings to grow. I really do value him as a friend and don't want that. But at the same time, it makes me sick to think of him with someone else. I don't know what to do.

Should I tell him or just get over my feelings alone?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhel0w/i_have_feelings_for_my_fwb_and_i_dont_know_what/

The first night I met them, I got really drunk. This guy (18M at the time) I had seen him flirting with a girl a few days prior. I learned later on that he wanted to sleep with her. I got really drunk, and sat on the couch. Everyone else was still standing around a small table, but he sat on the couch next to me. I was falling in and out of sleep, and he his hand around my waist. Later, when I was sleeping, he put my head on his chest.

I found out later on that one of the other guys saw what was happening and stopped him.

My question is, did he realize he was going to take advantage of me? Sometimes people just aren't taught that when you're drunk, you can't give consent. Maybe that was the case? Did he realize that I couldn't give him consent? Is he ignorant? Did his desire to get laid override his ability to think logically? Keep in mind, he hadn't been drinking at all that night.

Masturbation- I pleasure myself before bed and watch porn and hentai. I use my index and middle finger and rub my kitty area in circles near my clit.
