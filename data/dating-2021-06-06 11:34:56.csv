0,ntpxj6,1622997965,Feeling kinda hopeless about dating (teenager),"I (17f bi) have been following the advice of many people here and elsewhere and have been working on myself for quite awhile now. Personally I’m confident in my appearance and personality. I also put myself out there and try to not be scared to ask other people out while also not coming off as desperate. However, literally nothing has worked for me. Even though I personally am happy with myself and my progress, it seems virtually zero people feel the same way. I know this is partially due to my “unconventional” face and somewhat nerdy interests, but I’ve seen many girls that fit the beauty standard even less than I do with even weirder interests that still manage to at least land a date.

I guess my question is: what am I doing wrong? Does it ACTUALLY get better during college? Can I realistically expect a guy to be into someone like me? If anyone has experienced something similar please help me out here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntpxj6/feeling_kinda_hopeless_about_dating_teenager/

2,ntq3a9,1622998398,i feel like im incapable of love,"My first relationship ended a year and a half ago quite terribly, since then I’ve closed myself off to any emotional connections and attachments. Both out of being afraid of getting into a relationship again and knowing I’m not over my ex. I’ve had a bunch of emotionless hookups which I always end up feeling empty from. Any guy I noticed myself get too close to I would distance myself and it would end. I met a really sweet guy recently and we’ve been dating and he’s great, he’s sweet, genuine, we have great conversation and laughs. I noticed when I was with him last time I would get irritable with every small thing, I’d zone out thinking about how I’m not sure if I can get into something serious again. Maybe I was tired but I felt myself emotionally kind of distancing myself if that makes sense. And i’m so angry with myself for it, I like him a lot I don’t understand why I get like that, he doesn’t deserve it in the slightest. I also fell into a very bad depression for the last year, been on and off antidepressants, recently off again because I hate how numb I am on them. I’m thinking that could be it too?

I don’t know, I guess I just want insight or people who have gone through something similar. I’m tired of feeling like this.

When we first started dating he was working out constantly. So when we started sleeping together I didn’t think anything about his Wing-Wong ever being “bigger”, just thought that was his size (which was fine for me). Later on he ended up getting sick and couldn’t work out for a while, which is when I noticed. When he started to feel better and we would have s3x his Wing-Wong felt significantly bigger. I didn’t say anything at first I just let it be, but when he had clearance to work out again it would feel smaller. Again he ended up getting seriously injured and can’t work out (for a couple months now), and the Wing-Wong even looks bigger!

6,ntqfnc,1622999342,Does anyone else experience this?,"Hey everyone, first time posting here. 

I’ve been struggling with this a lot lately, and I’m wondering if anyone else can relate/provide some insight. 

Bit of background: I (26F) have dated a lot, but have never been in a committed relationship. It’s not that I don’t want one, in fact that is exactly what I want, but I always get involved with unavailable people (I know, I know - I’ve been working on it, I’m in therapy, etc etc).  I get into “situationships” constantly. For those of you who are familiar with attachment theory, my attachment style is FA, leaning anxious. I always end up going for avoidant types. 

Well, surprise surprise, I’m in a situationship right now. The person I’m currently seeing isn’t in the same city as me, so he has that lovely unavailable flair that I can’t seem to get away from. He has been quite kind to me, he shows up for me in ways that I have never been shown up for. He sends me gifts (I never ask) which he loves to do - and it’s really sweet. 

He’s also just a genuine good person, a bit older than me, and I’m quite fond of him. 
The issue is that it still isn’t really what I want. I always find myself wanting more, which really is the bare minimum (an available partner). I know, I got myself into this situation to begin with - my issue is that I always end up getting involved with people I can’t truly “have”, and spend all my time trying to make it happen, when I could just find someone available that I don’t have to work for. 

But that’s not why we’re here. 

I’ve been thinking of cutting things off with him, because I actually feel more lonely with an unavailable person than I do just being on my own. The issue is that I feel so guilty. 

I feel guilty because he’s been kinder to me than anyone I’ve dated, and yet I’m still thinking of ending things. I feel selfish and ungrateful. I feel like I may never find someone who is as sweet with me as he has been. I know rationally that doesn’t make sense, of course there are plenty of great men out there. But how I feel is ungrateful, selfish, and terribly guilty. 

Does anyone else experience this? I may sound naive, but please know that I have a long history of abusive, toxic relationships, and it can be hard for me to see clearly sometimes. 

Please let me know if you can relate, and/or have any insight.

She distanced herself after that, said we should just be friends. I agreed, don't feel too bad about it. Sure, not the most glorious entrance into dating, but at least I've kissed someone now.

We texted every day constantly as well as had phone calls, snap chatted, and insta dm'd multiple times a day. We also had planned to meet each others friends. So how can someone go from that to a split and then to go on a date and make out with someone else in the span of less than 5 days? Like I am still pretty hurt about the split and can't even fathom dating someone else while he is already back out in the dating scene without even a month passing by.

tldr: started dating my friend when they turned 16 when i was 18, i turned 19 a few months later, we have a 2 year 7 month age gap. it was legal, the family loved me, all of our friends supported us fully. they were a junior and i had just graduated HS, also we’re no longer together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntr01a/is_16_dating_19_started_dating_at_1618_2_year_age/

17,ntr3a3,1623001224,"He told me he likes me a lot, but I was unsure. Then I slowly caught feelings and now he's saying it was never serious (22F &amp; 22M)","I know the title is confusing but here is what happened. My close friend of 2 years (22M) confessed to me about two months ago over message that he likes me a lot. It was part of a conversation about the future and then he just confessed but I did not take him seriously at all to begin. He's a funny guy and he always compliments me so I thought this was just something he was saying. This happened a couple of times during text conversations, he would always bring up us becoming an item until I asked him if he meant it for sure. His response at the time was ""Well yeah, I'm down if you are"".

Now I didn't go in to this blindly so I wanted to take my time and get to know him even better than i already do. I needed time to see him as more than a friend too so I started to get a bit worried when he would text me things like ""You're my girl"" and ""Lets get a place to move in together"". I should also mention that during this entire period, we met up once and he was clearly feeling it because he was a lot closer physically and his body language was a giveaway. I would never really reciprocate these texts to the extent he did and I would usually laugh it off. He was definitely more 'in love' than me. Because of this, for 2-3 days I slowly cut back on how much we messaged because it was getting a little much, although I did at one point tell him I need time. We ended up messaging regularly again and he tried saying the same stuff again but (without realising) I was shutting it down. So for example if he said to me ""I need you as my other half"" I would jokingly say ""I don't want to be"" but looking back it sounded like a straight rejection from me. I think I was scared to let my guard down with him because every time in the past I've let it be known that I like someone, it's backfired on me. He knew about this too.

A couple weeks pass and we enter finals in college, so of course we're both stressed but we message everyday still, mainly about finals. I notice that I've started getting more attached to him as more than a friend, but whenever I try dropping big hints that I do like him back, he changes topics. He would always say ""We can speak about it after finals"". We called a few times and he was really flirty but whenever I would reciprocate he wouldnt know how to respond. It was really bugging me how as soon as finals ended, we stopped speaking. So I called him and straight up asked him if he was serious this whole time because his behaviour just switched. Looking back, I should have started with saying I like him. He didn't know what to say and he started getting all mumbley and saying it wasn't serious and he ""speaks like this with everyone"" (lies). The closest I got to telling him I liked him is ""Its not a no from me though so why are you saying this now?"". He was like ""sorry, I didn't mean any of it"". But I've known him for 2 years so I can tell when he's lying. In short, I still have not directly said ""I LIKE YOU"".

I think he's backtracking because it seemed like I rejected him this whole time and now I do actually like him, I might have lost him. What do I do now? I won't see him until autumn now.

TLDR; he liked me, I was unsure. He was being too direct but I wouldn't reciprocate much so it looked like I was rejecting him. I actually started liking him but now he's saying none of it was real. I waited so long to tell him I liked him because it's backfired on me in the past when people have known I liked someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntr3a3/he_told_me_he_likes_me_a_lot_but_i_was_unsure/

I have been seeing this lady since last month. We must have gone out about 7 times or so. We have not invited each other to our homes and intimacy is pretty much limited to pecks on the cheek and holding hands so we are not intimate like that yet. 

Yesterday I texted her asking if she wanted to meet up. I had a restaurant in mind but it was booked so she said she would prefer going to this seafood place near her home that I had never heard of. 

After the slightly over $250 bill (with tip and tax) came out with 3 drinks she ordered she never even offered to pay a portion of it since I had always paid 100 percent of all out of times out together in the past. It’s not like I can’t afford the place but I did feel a bit like I was taken to a place and indirectly forced to pay without even being asked first. 

Is this something I should be concerned about or am I over reacting?

I had a falling out in my relationship and  I recognize that I didn’t communicate my thoughts, feelings or emotions maturely and I acted with sarcasm / passive aggression instead of assessing the situation and acting assertively to come to a place of understanding that would create synergy. Acting out passive aggressively is a result of resentment of unaddressed feelings from the dismissal and disregard of emotions during past differences.

I’m very embarrassed and ashamed that I’m still a virgin at this age and I’m doing my best to figure out what I’m doing that makes me repulsive to women.

I just want to say a few things I see here. If I ask for advice and I mention that I’m a 20 year old virgin I’ll get some advice that I question why I’m receiving it. Like I’ll inevitably get someone saying, “Shower and start taking care of your hygiene bro” like seriously? Thanks I haven’t showered in a year and I didn’t know that was off putting. Like I’m 20, not 7. Just because I’m a virgin doesn’t mean I’m some slob that doesn’t brush my teeth or take care of my skin, nails, and hands. 

This is basic things that only male virgins get told to do because people assume that were basement dwellers because we haven’t had sex yet. The same with being in shape: “Get in shape” is advice only given to guys (ladies never get told this, but that’s not what this is about) and I’m again like, I’m not some fat slob. I’ve been working out regularly for 2 years. I’m told I look in shape and I’m pretty strong. I’m not ripped (at least not yet lol) or anything but I’m not doughy and I’m kinda offended when people just think I’m some fat guy whining about no woman wanting to be with me.

There are more things but the most offensive one is, when people tell me that I’m a “nice guy” or accuse me of thinking that I’m entitled to a woman. This hurts as it’s a character attack that likely based off of a single post where I’m venting. But if I’m a frustrated virgin it apparently means I believe that I’m owed a woman. And I see so many other unsuccessful guys accused of this too. I know there are guys that feel like because they are nice to a girl they deserve something from them, but just being frustrated about how I’m not successful shouldn’t make me a nice guy or a woman hater.

Are there any other guys that can relate with me on this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nts04t/as_much_as_people_on_this_sub_try_to_say_that/

He made me choose the questions at first so naturally I avoid the NSFW questions but later on he started choosing the other questions.

We proceeded to chat but he would still bring that up, it came to the point that it felt like I was just repeating myself and rephrasing what I was telling him. He also kept asking for nudes which I don't do at all, he then proceeds to asking if we could meet up next week just so we could do 2nd base.

30,nts60c,1623004135,How can you date knowing you will be hurt?,"Title says it all. I'm 32M with a really bad relationship history where the blissful moments were short compared to the painful ones. Last time I committed to someone was last year in a LDR that, thanks to a certain RNA chain, fell through the drain because we were going to meet in the short term (we missed it for just a couple of weeks). 

And now I am afraid to commit again. I dream of being in a committed, healthy relationship. But the pains and hurdles that come with trying to achieve that is putting me off. And I don't really want to go through those painful moments again. I know that the next time I commit I will be hurt anyways, because it's unavoidable (otherwise the couple are just good friends and that's it). But it's either that or being alone. So I'm in a conundrum and I have a difficult time knowing what to do.

37,ntsjff,1623005140,"If there aren’t signals of interest, does that mean there’s no shot?","*TL:DR-* I’ve always operated on “If she’s interested you’ll know, if you don’t know she’s not interested,” but I came across advice recently that is contrary to that...do people in the “romantically pursued” category (particularly women being asked out by men) ever have interest in dating a person they’re not *showing* interest in dating?

*TL:BIWRA* I [36M] had always assumed that if a woman was interested, she would be sending various signals of interest...frequent glances, unconsciously playing with hair, lightening vocal tone, finding ways and reasons to be around me, things like that.  If she’s not giving these sorts of signals, then she’s being polite and friendly and isn’t interested in more.

I recently watched a video from a high-powered image consultant talking to guys who struggle with dating (*raises hand*).  One guy mentioned that he doesn’t ask women out because they don’t display signs of interest in him (*raises hand*).  

The coach’s response was “You’re looking for *selector* signals.  Women...whether they do it consciously or subconsciously...send these signals to men who are the best they have available to them...above-average or high value men that they *select* as being highly attractive to them.  You’re an average to below average man.  You’re not going to get signals like that, but that doesn’t mean women are completely uninterested in dating you, it means you’re going to have to do the work to improve yourself as much as you can, and it means you’re going to have to take risks and ask women out when they’re not acting romantically interested in you.”

After reading hordes of articles, threads, and comments along the lines of “I hate it when men think I’m interested in them when I’m just being polite and friendly” I’ve always operated on the “If she’s interested, she’ll show me, and if she’s not showing me, leave her alone”...which basically drops my prospects down to nothing, as women acting interested in me had happened *very* rarely in my life (twice, and in confusingly in one of those cases she turned out to not be interested).    What this guy said flies in the face of that.  Is it accurate?  Do women ever have an interest in dating guys even if they’re not acting attracted to them?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntsjff/if_there_arent_signals_of_interest_does_that_mean/
38,ntslfw,1623005296,I 25M can't stop thinking about this girl and its causing so much frustration," There's this girl I really like, she's awesome. We like similar activities, movies, etc and we've hung out one on one a few times doing those activities (it wasn't a date I'm pretty sure) and I can't stop thinking about here where it is hurting me because I can't focus on other stuff like work, etc.

I've been flirty and I'm pretty sure its been reciprocated however she dated my friend for a few weeks earlier this year. Last week she was on a hinge date and is texting me telling me how awful it is, etc and I was also on a date too and I was (at least I thought) extremely forward, I said something like ""yeah mine sucks too I'd rather have you here with me instead of (dates name)"" and she didn't reject it or anything she said ""yeah i wish i'd gone to (event i was at)""

Last night, we were at a concert, it was me, her, and my friend she dated (they remained friends but she isn't over him still which is annoying) anyways, I lost a bet so I owed her a beer and I forgot so we left around 9PM and I texted her reminding her that I still owe her and she was like ""hell yeah"" so I said ""You should come over to my \[part of town\] and you can tell me about \[some topic she mentioned\] over it"" She lives like 5 minutes away. She never responded and then today she messaged the 3 of us from last night asking if we wanted to go do something else today but my friend said no and I said its probably gonna rain. Then later she finally responded to me and was just like ""haha i don't ever wanna talk about \[that topic\] again. It wasn't like the topic of getting a beer, we were talking about what to talk about on bad dates and I was telling her to tell me about what she was talking about then.

Anyways, I just told her ""I guess I'll have to live without that knowledge"" and I haven't heard from her since.

I'm so unsure of whats going on, she seems flirty, its feels reciprocated and I was extremely forward and there was no rejection. I don't know if I should try asking her out again or maybe she just curved me and just wants to be friends.

41,ntsypr,1623006326,"25 (f) I tend to form online connections w men as opposed to in real life, and I’m not sure why. The former tends to not live up to my expectations","To begin: I am attractive. I am confident. I have a great personality. I go to the gym 3-5x a week (depending on my time and needs for the week), I practice yoga, I enjoy hiking, cycling, and just about anything that keeps me active. 

I don’t have a problem attracting men in real life, nor do I have a problem making friends, or forming connections or getting dates. Men tend to love my personality and throughout the years I have definitely made a few accidentally really like me bc of my personality. (They think we have a connection, but really, it’s just how I am).

I find myself not following up w men in real life, or not really interested in anything more than texting and eventually I just stop replying. Even if we do make it to a date or two, I usually just tell them that I’m not interested and I think it’s best if we no longer see each other. (I tell them this bc I’m not interested after out dates).

I find myself feeling incredibly lonely. Not in a way that it’s all I think about or feel, but like on a quiet evening where I’m not exhausted and in bed early, or when I haven’t made plans w a friend, I just realize I have no one to talk to and very few people check on me (first). 

I WILL admit that a lot of ppl (friends &amp; men) stopped checking on me bc I’m a horrible texter (def more of a phone call or in-person person). And they probably think I do not care. It’s not that I don’t care — I have always suffered w depression and anxiety and sometimes I just truly need time to myself. 

My depression isn’t really a factor anymore, though my anxiety is, but I think bc that’s how I grew up as a teenager, I need the time to fall off the face of the earth or to take time to respond to texts out of pure habit. 

Also, I am extremely busy person right now. I kind of always have been, but this is a pivotal point in my career and there are times where for 4-6 weeks everything that isn’t related to my career gets put on the back burner. 

Anywho. When I feel lonely I tend to lean toward finding quick solace online. Sometimes that’s a dating app, or Reddit, or chat rooms. I really look for normal convo &amp; someone to just enjoy banter w, but I do enjoy the occasionally sext or phone sex. 

However, since February, I have HEAVILY been doing this: getting lonely. Meeting someone online. Enjoying the banter. Building trust. Exchanging pics and just not be attracted to them at all. 

The reason I’m not attracted to the usually is bc they just aren’t the type of man I would go for as far as how they take care of themselves. (I.e.: not caring about how they dress, generally unkempt, not caring about their appearance). I don’t actually think they’re not handsome, but physical attraction for me tends to be about how a man carries himself. 

I know this is extremely shallow and I have tried to continue the convos to eventually meet up or pursue something but apparently those are dealbreakers for me. I have also come to conclusion that men who care about their appearance &amp; dress nice and have the suave I am attracted to are probably NOT going to be finding woman online.

A few weeks ago I stopped talking to the four men I was seeing in real life bc I really liked the connection I had w someone online. When we exchanged pictures, I had to politely tell him I just wasn’t attracted to him.

I need to stop this cycle bc I know it’s harsh and bc it clearly will not work out for me.

Take your time. Work on yourself, your goals. Your body. Your mind. Work on your close family ties and spend time with them. Occasionally text your friends. You don’t need to text them all the time, but try to maintain some contact. 

If you are all alone, then cherish yourself and you being alone. Go learn an instrument, learn a new language, learn coding, or go play that game that you’ve been wanting to play for so long. Go play some sports or hit the gym. 

As cliche as it is, a relationship with come at the right time when you are happy with yourself. It would be better that way. You wouldn’t want to date someone if you aren’t completely happy, and then completely break down when they leave because maybe at that point, you relied on *them for your happiness* 

If you’ve never dated before, then don’t worry. If you find someone great, they will understand you, and maybe teach you along the way. Teach you how to love and how to be loved.

 “Soooo ima just kinda start texting and see where it takes me lolol so I really like who u are at ur heart. Kind, unselfish, carring and thoughtful. Phenomenal qualities. From what I read ur personality vibes very well with mine, so much so that we are opposite letters across the board, opposites attract right? Haha that aside I know I've been teasing about it, but I'm really kinda waiting and WAnting to see the side of you that you show once ur totally comfortable with someone. From what I read and the little you have said, it's a pretty enjoyable side to be on. But I get that being who you are, your not like me and it may take a bit more for you to warm up and be 100% comfertsble with me. The fact that you wouldn't be opposed to more then a friendship in the the future is a great spot to start. So basically I feel like us hanging more with help, but is there anything else you would want from me that would help you feel more comfortable and get you to a point with me that would make you want to take it to the next level. And this is all fully dependent if this would be somthing ur truly wanting. I in no way want to force this on you. Full honesty is what I want and is what makes for the best friendships and relashinships. Communication is the keyyyy! What's ur thoughts on what I said, I know it's a lot lol”

So I replied 
“Awww that was all really sweet of you to say,
If I look around at the people I’m most comfortable with at work, it’s the ones who pretty much never leave me alone lol like they would just talk to me all the time and joke around and pretty much would just make me talk to them and it made me get over my shy side pretty fast, and I think your doing good at it, I can see how it can be frustrating but your being patient with me and I really appreciate that!  So just continue being you and don’t hold back, it will probably be awkward at first but it will help me get out of my shell a lot  faster!”

57,ntu5i0,1623009526,I Need Advice on Marketing Myself and Having More Confidence,"(24 M) I’m sure this is a topic that comes up constantly on this subreddit but I like to ask for myself so I can feel like the answers given apply directly to me. 

I just got out of a 5-year relationship that was pretty rocky, and I’m looking forward to being in a relationship that’s fresh and I can use what I’ve learned to do better for myself and my partner. My issue though is that in all the relationships I’ve had with women in my life, it was always them that came on to me first. I’ve never been the one to initiate a romantic connection with someone, mainly out of fear or rejection. I don’t really go out, so I have things like Tinder and Facebook dating set up to get it out there that I’m single and looking, but I get no responses, no likes, no matches, nothing. I know I’m not like a 10/10 in looks, but I’m not a gremlin either so I know it can’t be that. I took decent pictures I think, I’m smiling and nicely dressed and I’m with friends, I have to assume it’s that I don’t market myself well enough, people think I have nothing to offer maybe. People who know me, that work with me, all think I’m a nice and funny guy, but I can’t get people to WANT to get to know me, you know? And so in a public space I’m hesitant to approach someone I don’t know because in my mind they either will think I’m a crazy creep and want me to go away or they’ll know I’m trying to ask them out and want me to go away! 😅

I’m looking to either make my dating profiles more appealing or get an idea of how to meet strangers and successfully have conversations that lead to connections.

59,ntu7oh,1623009666,Those 1 date only hurt the most?,"This will be a fairly lengthy post so....

So... I met this girl off tinder. We matched and both pretty much said how we can't stand the texting phase before going on a date back and forth etc so just decided to meet up. I knew a bit about her from texting and was pretty excited to meet. 

A brief bit of background. I moved to a new place in September last year. Since being here I've been on 10 dates (with different people) and no one at all has really set it off for me. Either I'm just not attracted (mostly) or whatever. I think I'm really picky maybe.

So me and this girl meet. Start chatting straight away, she looks great too, just my type. We're laughing and joking and it's going really well. Gets to the end of the date we have a little kiss and I go home. She messages when I'm home saying she had a great time. and it's by far one of the best dates I had been on. 

We message throughout the week and she asks to meet again. We set a date for the following weekend. Through the week her dad has a little health scare. Gets to the weekend and she cancels to spend time with her dad which is fair (but posted up on insta her out with her mates - also fair enough). 

We keep messaging a little, she seems interested in what I'm up to just as before and I suggest meeting the following weekend. She replies and says shes not in the right mindset to be dating anyone right now.
I say I understand, still had a great time, hope she's well and if anything changes to hit me up. She thanks me for being so kind.....

About a week has passed and I can't stop thinking about it. Maybe because she was one of the only girls I've ever been on a date with that I'm actually attracted to. Maybe it's the unknown of what could it have been. The whole time we were messaging after initially meeting, as you do, I was thinking about future dates, playing out situations in my head as to what things could be like between us etc etc. I know it's nothing I did on the date because we'd arranged to meet again but I still really want to know, is it something I did, something I said lol... I've dated a lot, and never really been that bothered about anyone. I find it hard to be really bothered about a lot of things. Even people I've dated for a few months when it ends I'm usually just like whatever. This week I've been really down and if I'm honest with myself it's due to this girl that I barely know. That I've met once. I'm kind of tempted to leave it a month then reach out and say hey. But in previous experiences, once you call things off they're off, if someone was interested they'd be interested. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice or whatever but yeah, sucks. If you've got this far I really appreciate your time. Any comments welcome.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntu7oh/those_1_date_only_hurt_the_most/

62,ntum6y,1623010763,"Is ""Masculine Energy"" Necessary","Essentially what the title entails.

I (19M) have been using OLD for about a year and a half now with decent ""success"". A dozen of dates and about 2-3 matches a week. The issue I'm having is the ""talking phase"". I consider myself a ""nice"" guy I've never asked for nudes, hookups, etc. But, it seems like that is just not what women are looking for. This is polarizing because I've seen countless women on this subreddit and others who complain about such behavior and don't entertain it. Although, when I try just being myself it seems like the conversation fizzles out. 

Now, I definitely get the stigma behind nice guys only being nice until they get what they want but this has never been the case in a single relationship I've been in. So, the question is what do I do? I feel like changing myself and the way I converse towards a more ""Masculine Energy"" approach is a solution but not one I feel like I would want. But, it seems as if being genuine and true is just not attractive in this day and age.

Maybe, I just don't have a clear understanding of exactly what ""Masculine Energy"" is and if it's something that I would even pursue and if it's something women look for in a relationship. But, it seems like whatever I'm doing now is just not right.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntum6y/is_masculine_energy_necessary/

I've been with a fair amount of girls up to this point, but it was all very casual and typical college /teenage hookups. I'm at this stage now where I just want to meet women who I could see myself dating so bringing them back to my place the night we meet isn't a pressing item for me. Basically, I just want to have good conversations with girls that can lead to a number and a date and see where that goes. The past few weeks in particular I have gotten about 5 different numbers and none of them have responded to me, so obviously something isn't really working here. My mentality has been its all a numbers game and just keep approaching women and something will  work out eventually but 0 for 5 is telling me that I need to tweak my perspective on this. I feel confident when I speak to these girls and can always develop a solid conversation with them that leads to a phone number but I can't understand why I keep getting no responses?

64,ntv58q,1623012241,"It seems like we've been ghosted, but there are incongruities.","A few months ago the idea of my girlfriend (we'll call her Kate) and I looking for another woman to date as a couple was broached (I'm straight, she's pansexual). We were both receptive, and after a lot of discussion decided to give it a shot. Why not? We already had each other, anything else that came of it was just a bonus.

So the search began. We don't live in a large city (state capitol, university town, but still fairly small), so I don't think either of us really expected much to come of it. But about 3 weeks ago we got a match on Tinder that actually messaged back (we'll call her Sarah). We talked for a while, found that we all had a whole lot in common, so we decided to meet up for drinks later that week.

The day of the date comes around, and the first wrench gets thrown into the works. Sarah's boss asked her that afternoon to attend a work function that night. We were bummed, but shit happens. Then, not 5 minutes later, Sarah tells us that her boss decided not to go to the event because of the weather, and she wasn't going to go alone, so the date was back on.

It was about as wonderful a first date as we could have conceived. She was somehow even more attractive in person than in pictures, we realized quickly that we had even more in common than we thought, and the conversation flowed effortlessly all night. We spent nearly 6 hours talking before we realized that it was knocking on midnight and we all had to work in the morning. She made us a Snapchat group before we left that she named Fire Emoji Hearts Emoji (on desktop, so can't do the actual symbols). Tights hugs and kisses all around. The next day we made plans for Sunday night, because it was Memorial Day weekend and, as Sarah said ""we can not worry about time and just enjoy ourselves as long as we want"".

This is where things start to go wrong. No flags yet, but just wrong. We get a message in the early afternoon from Sarah telling us that she was having a violent allergic reaction to a wasp sting and had to go to the ER. Sucks the date's off, but we were just concerned at that point. We still talked throughout the evening as she recovered (got some cute pics of her cat cuddling her), and made plans for a few days later.

Day of the next attempt comes around. Sarah tells us that her ex found out that she's dating again, got upset, and was insisting that she come that evening to get the remainder of her things from their old apartment that he was moving out of. It was a weeknight, so no real time to meet up later. She posits Thursday for the next try.

Things got real interesting Wednesday night when my gf got drunk and decided to start sending suggestive pics to the Snap group. Things escalated quickly until both of them were sending very explicit pictures until bedtime. We woke up to a good morning Snap of in her underwear saying she was excited for that night. Our appetites were thoroughly whet.

We're still messaging each other frequently throughout the morning as Sarah was going to a nearby city for work, but was sure she'd be back in time to meet up. Then, about 90 minutes before we were supposed to get together she tells us that an employee at her office had just quit without notice right as they were supposed to drive to a neighboring state for work. Guess who that falls to now? Third date in 5 days cancelled.

She gave us the out there, saying ""Please feel free to tell me to fuck off if you don't want to try this anymore"". We assured her that we weren't doing that, because we'd been talking throughout the day for weeks now, and while we were obviously very attracted to her, even moreso we absolutely adored her as a person. Kate tells her that it's going to have to be her telling us to fuck off, to which Sarah fires back ""I will definitely NOT be doing that, I am so so interested in y'all!"" with hearts at the end. She messaged us the next morning to let us know she had gotten there safely, then again that afternoon when she was back in town. We settled on Sunday (tonight, at time of writing) to meet up.

And we haven't heard from her since. We've reached out a couple of times, but nothing. Not even left on read, straight up not read at all. After weeks of talking throughout every day, a right proper ghosting.

Now I'm a horrible overthinker as sure as OJ is guilty, but does this seem a bit...incongruous to anyone? Maybe we horribly misjudged Sarah, but this just doesn't jive with what we know about her as a person. We spend weeks talking like the best of friends, and then nothing all of a sudden? Even after we gave her an out on Thursday, which she vehemently denied. In our conversations throughout the weeks she'd always allude to us being in each others lives going forward. She was also the one offering up alternatives when our plans got messed up, which would be especially odd if she was planning on ghosting us.

Maybe I'm just trying to be ever the optimist, but something about it just seems strange to me.

What do we think? Ghosted, lost phone, or kidnapped by CHUDs?

TL;DR- After an amazing first date, weeks of talking all day, and multiple failed attempts at the second date, girl up and vanishes, which goes against everything that she's said to us or done.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntv58q/it_seems_like_weve_been_ghosted_but_there_are/

I’ve(22) had a plethora of negative experiences with women and how they reject me. I don’t think I’m being creepy. If I’m standing in line with a woman and she happens to be cute I strike up a conversation. I don’t say anything risqué or threatening I just try to talk to her like she’s a person. If I feel like there’s a connection or like she might like me, I ask for her number.

I’ve had nothing but failure in my dating life. About a quarter the time they’re just like I’m not interested which I appreciate. No worries I just go back to what I was doing. But usually they’re mean. Like unnecessarily mean. They don’t need to call me ugly, they don’t need to say “ew”, they don’t need to tell me they’re out of my league. It just feels like girls are so mean. And I know I’m beginning to sound like baby, but it feels like a lot of girls my age feel like guys don’t.

Yesterday was probably the most hurtful experience. Yesterday I was talking to some girl and I thought I really was doing good. I was making her laugh she looked comfortable and everything so I asked for her number and she gave it to me. This morning I texted her and off course she gave me some random guys number. I felt so hurt. Like why go through the effort of getting my hopes up just to reject me in such a fucked up way.

I’m talking long dates - hanging out at hers, staying over, making food together etc. She’s even booked this ridiculously expensive restaurant that you pay up front for for us on the 17th June. So, planning ahead, right? 

Anyway. We spent most of last weekend together and I told her I wasn’t seeing anyone else, that it was okay if she was but that I’d appreciate knowing. She said she wasn’t. We spoke about both wanting a relationship but that we didn’t want to rush as that hadn’t gone well for us in the past. She thanked me for initiating the conversation and said she liked me and wanted to see where things go with us. Fab. 

Anyway, the atmosphere changed after that. I don’t know if I was being hyper vigilant or it was because we were both on our periods and tired. She kissed me goodbye and said she’d see me on Friday (planned date). 

She didn’t text much / at all in the week, then on Wednesday said she had to cancel Friday because she had to work. No problem as we both work intense jobs. She text me on Thursday saying she was having to go to help her friend in another city as her alcoholic husband had gone missing. She messaged me to say he’d reappeared on Saturday. 

Today (Sunday) I text her to check in and said I hoped she was okay after such a stressful few days. I’ve had no reply, but she’s been online and watching my Instagram stories, despite not following me on there...so she’s making a conscious effort to search for my account each time?? 

We’ve gone from seeing each other every few days and texting throughout the day for three weeks to my getting one text or nothing.

It’s confusing because he was messaging me 24/7, he always wanted to speak to me and seemed like he genuinely cared about me.

He was working away (staying at a hotel throughout the week) and back on weekends so it wasn’t like he was around all the time to make plans with. We made loose plans for an actual date (all my idea/I arranged it) on the 5th week for which he then realised he already had plans with his friends so we rearranged for the next day.

The next day his dad went into hospital, it didn’t look good from the start and he eventually passed away a several days later.

Now I’m stuck in this weird situation where I was about to break things off because he wouldn’t make proper plans with me and I felt I deserved better but then this happened and I’ve found myself in a weird emotional support role. I can’t just leave now and I fully don’t expect him to make time for me given the circumstances and I don’t blame him.

We agreed to be exclusive just before his dad went into hospital as well so I can’t even date anyone else. 

I do quite like him but I didn’t sign up for this as horrible as it sounds, we’ve only been speaking for 6 weeks so I’m not even a big enough part of his life that I can go visit him/that he wants to spend time with me whilst he’s working through this.

He hasn’t really wanted to talk to me much today at all which of course I should understand but I’m still feeling pretty hurt from seeing him online all day ignoring my messages and clearly talking to other people.

85,ntx5zv,1623017827,"Long story with a question and likely, obvious answer.","Hope it’s okay i out this on a few subs. Just out of it today with my second shot and needing some advice:

This is long but here goes:​

I work with this girl (this isn’t a career type job so it won’t get awkward or anything) who seems to speak to pretty much no one at work. So I would make small talk with her thinking she’s way out of my league physically. She’s even a pinch taller than my 5’6 self.

​

One day she put her hair up in pigtails and I had no thought of pursuing her so I told her it looked really nice. She had this surprised, genuine reaction like I had just given her a million dollars.

​

Since then she has literally had her hair in that style every day she’s worked. So fast forward a few weeks, mid April and we were in the same Snapchat group for work. So I added her and began trying to make small talk. Her responses are always very to the point and dry.

​

She’ll answer a question but won’t ask one back sorta thing. Always a ton of emojis, but usually a short sentence reply. On occasion I’ll get a whole paragraph.

​

Sensing this wasn’t going anywhere, I began taking an extremely long time to open her replies. Two, days, then four, got up to even six. I noticed she would then mirror the time I took.

​

So even if I cut it back down to a few hours after not answering for several days, she would keep it at the last long length I took.

​

About two weeks ago I posted a Snapchat picture of me and my sister, as a tbt. She doesn’t watch many of my snaps but saw that one.

​

She then went 7 days without opening my message to her. The message was “hey we’re not very good snapchatters it seems, wanna text instead?”

​

So last Monday (snap had still not been opened) we were working in close proximity for a while and she’s always much more chatty in person than text but only ever at this one work station in the building. Aside from that spot, she’ll barely acknowledge people. The problem is, I don’t know if she’s chatty with a lot of people in this location or just me.

​

So anyway we’re making small talk, she’s showing me kittens her cat just had on her phone. And when we go to separate from that work station I’m like “hey, I’m not a good Snapchatter and was wondering if you’d want to exchange numbers?”

​

She’s like yeah, and claimed her friends are always irritated with her Snapchat response time too. So she’s like “I’ll send you my number on Snapchat later”.

​

Keeping in mind, at this point she hasn’t opened my last chat for a literal week. Later that night she opens it, responds to the boring conversation we were having in there and then leaves me her number.

​

At this point I’m thinking I’m good cause no one would reinitiate giving out the number hours later if they didn’t actually want me having the number.

​

So I wait an hour and text her. I send her a picture of my cat. 10 minutes later she sends a three word dry reply. I wait an hour and follow up on something we were talking about earlier that day at work. She waits 24 hours before responding. This time with an actual full sentence reply.

​

I read it, fall asleep and respond the next afternoon. And nothing from her since. I made sure in my last reply to not send a question as I wanted to see if she’d keep the conversation going if she wasn’t answering something (she has in the past). But nothing.

​

So at this point I’m annoyed. Next day I see her at work, I’m talking with a coworker and look up, we make the briefest of eye contact before she looks down real quick.

​

And since then we haven’t spoken at all. I’ve been irritated at her behavior and won’t even look at her now.

​

I suppose the ship has sailed on getting anywhere with this girl. But what I was wanting to ask is did I concoct this whole back-and-forth in my head, or was she giving certain signs of interest?

​

Our in-person conversations are usually pretty good. I have to start them but then she won’t shut up. I think one time I even had her blushing when she fell for a joke I told her. Nothing I do outside of work works.

​

Generally, when I pursue a girl that isn’t interested they’ll be pretty rude about it to the point where I don’t have any doubt. They’ll say they’ll send a number and then never reach out etc.

​

I guess she could have just been trying to be friendly at work, but to me, when you’re already talking with someone on Snapchat and the person (me) asks for your number, that’s a pretty good sign that they’re interested in you.

​

On the other hand, I’ve been hot and cold myself due to frustration with her behavior. Or trying to make her jealous etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what

I’m really down at the moment and I don’t know what to do

I moved to a new city in February this year and into a sociable houseshare. I loved it we were having a lot of fun even in lockdown and it lifted my mental health and gave me loads of confidence and made me feel so happy.

Then all of a sudden I started to feel really lonely, with working from home. My colleagues have never turned their cameras on so I don’t know what they look like. 

My best friend said I’ve become less bubbly recently but I’m still friendly. Just a bit quieter.

But all of a sudden the housemate I got on with is completely ignoring me. He makes comments when I come into the kitchen, tells me he doesn’t care whenever I try and start a conversation. And when I asked him why he told me ‘No one likes you, we want you to leave.’

I feel really anxious now and don’t want to go to the kitchen so I’m not eating much. I regret moving to a new city and my confidence has disappeared so I’m too scared to meet new people 

Noones really asking if I’m ok and I feel no one cares about me. All my flatmates are dating in lockdown but I feel too sad at the moment to date but I really want a boyfriend. I’ve never had a boyfriend and all of this is starting to worry that it’s all my fault I haven’t and I’m just an invisible, forgettable and undesirable woman. 

My housemates are boys and they sleep with a girl once a week. I can’t even lose my virginity as no one gives me any sexual attention and I’m told I’m pretty .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntxchq/dont_understand_why_no_guys_ever_approach_me_or/

Whenever I see guys vent here about how rough dating has been for them, I inevitably see someone telling him he’s throwing himself a pity party and that he needs to get over himself. 

Basically if a guy feels bad here he’s just told to man up. No one will just let the guy vent. But when a woman does this exact same things it’s flooded by people telling her that she never should settle and that the right man will come to her eventually.

90,ntxs3p,1623019616,I’m fed up of people always being attracted to my friends and never noticing me,"
I fully realise how childish, bitter and stupid this will sound. I’m 22 and I should be more mature than this. But it does get to me. I am probably the least conventionally attractive person in my group of friends by a large margin; I’m the only one who’s never had sex or been in a relationship out of us, which other people always tell me is a mystery to them. In reality I think it just comes down to a complete lack of self-esteem and no confidence with women. I mean I’m pretty friendly and easy to get along with, but as soon as it comes down to a woman I’m into I just don’t know how to go about things whatsoever. I dress well, have good hygiene, told I’m really funny all the time, I’m not overly awkward, etc., so it’s all a more internal problem I think.

But anyway, whatever the reasons are, watching my friends have success after success, almost effortless interest for all of them at least at some point, while I sit in the corner constantly just watching on and never having any of that is tough. It’s hard not to compare yourself or your romantic success to others when it’s constantly in your face.

There’s one friend, my best friend since childhood,  who’s pretty similar to me in a lot of ways; similar interests, similar sense of humour, same kind of awkwardness, etc. The difference is while he’s shy, he does have a lot of confidence deep down, and he’s just better looking and more conventionally attractive in all honesty. I feel like we have a similar taste in women too, and because of that I cannot count the number of times we’ve met someone new, where I kind of think I’d like to try get to know her, only to watch on as he flirts with her and tells me he’s actually really into her, and for him to later be making out with her or whatever within a couple of hours. This has literally never happened to me lmfao.

And I hate being jealous of my own friends. I should be happy for them when things like that happen. And hell, I still am! I would never guilt trip a friend over that and I’m always there to give him good advice and try help him out, and it usually works. But just one fucking time I wish we would meet someone who would just be interested in me, who wouldn’t instantly be attracted to one of my other friends and would instead notice me. I’m fed up of watching from the sidelines while everyone hooks up and falls in love all around me constantly. Whenever we meet new people they almost always have an attraction to one of my friends, and it’s never me. Hell, a lot of the time they ask me for advice with my friends lmfao. It’s like I don’t even register as an option; people instantly feel comfortable around me and are friendly with me, but there is never attraction there. I’m just the little dude who cracks jokes in the corner while others connect on a deeper level. I wish I could just be an attractive person and have someone notice me in that way, almost every guy I know has had SOMEONE have a thing for them at some point, I don’t get what makes me such a lost cause when everyone around me goes out their way to tell me I’m great all the time. It just makes me feel broken and like I’m just fundamentally unlovable lmfao",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ntxs3p/im_fed_up_of_people_always_being_attracted_to_my/

Last weekend I went on another date with a very attractive lady, not out of my league attractive, but alot of the features I like and actually more attractive in person than her OLD pictures would indicate and again, we had a great time and there will probably be a second date in the future if we can figure out a time where we both aren't super busy.  Now just yesterday I was on a charity motorcycle ride and had a young lady hitting on ME out of nowhere.  She actually rode with me on a couple of legs of the ride and was most definitely flirting.  It just seems so weird to me, all I ever hear about online dating for guys is that it doesn't work but I've meet 2 great women in 2 months and for whatever reason just seem to not be oblivious to women interested in me.
