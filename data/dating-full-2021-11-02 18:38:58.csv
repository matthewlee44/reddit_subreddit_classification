A bunch of people showed up who neither of us knew so we wound up talking all night. Before she left, she asked for my number and then texted me when she got home. I eventually asked her out for a drink, it went well, and the second or third time we got drinks she said that she wasn’t looking for anything serious because she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship 3 months prior and they were very co dependent. I said I understood but we continued to talk and got drinks a few more times. We were both living with our parents at the time so neither of us could really invite the other inside. After getting drinks like 5 or 6 times over 2 months, I moved to the city and immediately invited her to stay over, an offer which she enthusiastically accepted. She works like 20 minutes from my apartment so she came over right after work, so at around 4pm, and we spent the rest of the night and following morning together. This was the beginning of September. Fast forward to now, she has come over almost every Friday after work, with us either making dinner, ordering takeout, or going out to dinner. When we’re together, she’s clearly very into me and obviously I’m very into her. We started to text almost every day. A few weeks ago, we were at dinner and she briefly mentioned a trip we could take together. She followed that up by saying she was going to two concerts the following weekend “with her friend who recently broke up with his girlfriend, so we’ll see how he does.” Following that weekend, I’ve been seeing her less frequently and she’s been kind of distant over text. It’s not like I’m inundating her with texts, as I want to give her space, seeing as things picked up pretty quickly. Plus, she has a lot going on in her life right now. I try not to let her lack of responsiveness bother me, as she is a genuinely nice person, but it does and causes me to overthink every little thing I send. Last Friday, she said she wasn’t free because she had therapy and a family commitment that night. Saturday, she said she was “making dinner with a friend and watching some movies.” Sounded like a date to me, but whatever. Today, I asked if she’d be around anytime soon and she said she won’t be around this Friday because her therapist forgot to pencil her in for last Friday so they had to reschedule for this Friday so she’s not sure when she’ll be free. I mentioned last week that I wouldn’t be around this Friday so I replied by saying I was actually referring to Saturday or next weekend. She’s a very nice person and seems like the kind of person who’d be direct instead of just slowly fade away. Still, I can’t help but think that she is either losing interest or I’m doing too much.

We never discussed exclusivity so I’ve gone on some dates with other people but I find myself thinking about her a lot. So, any suggestions on how I should move forward? Has she simply lost interest?

There were personality differences for sure, but I think the biggest thing that made me leave was my partner’s (M22) underlying want of sex.


At the outset, I was very clear I am asexual and I‘m terrified of, and outright disturbed by, sex. I have nearly no libido, nor any desire to participate in any sexual acts with anyone. I have even had panic attacks over the thought of conducting sexual acts.


Despite being very clear about this, he said he would be fine with it. But it became clear to me it was something he needed as he kept pushing to be more intimate. Wanting to “passionately kiss” me for an extended period of time, or see me naked for example. I can’t read his mind, but I wonder if he thought I would change my mind given enough time.


It only lasted a couple months, but the relationship seriously messed with my self image. It made me wonder if I’m worth anything as a woman and if I should even try to find someone if I can’t provide something so fundamental and essential for so many people.


I have a loving family who will always be there for me, and friends who understand what I’m going through, so even if I don’t find someone, I know I’ll always have them instead.

I “dated” before, but usually I met someone in-person and we both wanted to pursue a relationship. 

Online dating is different! I am caught between being honest and not wanting to scare people off. Take this guy for example:

We’ve been talking for a month. Hooked up on the second date, hooking up every time since. Both confirmed we were looking for something casual, but said if the right thing came along, we would date. He has canceled hanging out day-of multiple times, but all with honest/reasonable reasons- grandma died, car broke down, mom called him with bad news. This could all just be bad luck or bad timing, but so many times? Sounds like he’s not interested to me. So I’d pull away. 

Then, he’d text me with a “Hope your day is going well ☺️” if I hadn’t replied to him. He’d say “you’re going to be seeing a lot more of me!” and joked that he would be my boyfriend in a few days at one point. Then, didn’t text me for a day and said he was busy but “hope you had a good day ☺️”. Then didn’t respond when I replied and a day later said “I hope you have a great Halloween weekend ☺️ 🎃”, which I just liked and since then we have not talked. 

I am sincerely confused. Is this what online dating is more or less like? If I started pulling away, I would message less frequently at first and then let them know that I was no longer interested once I realized I didn’t want to message or hang out as much. I definitely wouldn’t be sending “hope your day was good!” texts with emojis and stuff. Is this.. keeping options open? Just using “lines”? 

I’m tempted to just ask him what’s up, but my friend got in my head and said that online dating/dating in general in 2021 is different- that most people play “games” of some sort, not necessarily toxic ones… but just texting with a “hey! Just wanted to know if you’re still interested in hanging out.” would more or less push him away if he was unsure and that I should wait for him to reach out to me, since his last message was after not responding to me for a day and hasn’t texted since.

We usually go out with the same people almost every time several times per week, 3 girls and 4 guys, one of the girls got engaged 1 month ago with one of the guys in the group, the other is a lesbian, and the last one is single. 

This last girl either hugs me or not when the group meets (In southern europe this is just a normal thing, she also hugs the other guys from time to time), when we take a stroll she walks along with me many times but never says a word, gives me ocasional deep eye contacts or looks, asks me about my week or my cat, what I find like normal interest or even small talking, but in this case *I'm not sure if that also means I like her in a more serious way*. 

We don't have many interests in common apart from cats, and to be honest I'm far more average looking and a less charming personality than the other guys in the group with which she does have much more in common and even talks more. So my concern is why she would bother sending me signs of interest if she can have better guys for BF material? (yeah sounds stupid, believe me, it's not, I'm being realistic)

For several times when she asked in the common whatsapp group if someone wanted to go out for a walk I was the only one that answered offering to go and she didn't even bothered replying, but she did once to one of the other guys, there have been many times with a lack of interest in me or my propositions, and that's why I don't know if I'm reading the correct signs or I am just dealing with a girl that only wants to be nice to me and nothing else.

I'll try to be brief, as my question is pretty simple.
I am usually a pretty funny person. All my close friends have told me it more than once, and I recognize that when I'm comfortable, I have this """"magic"""" ability to take the current situation and make something funny out of it. A sentence, a joke, a facial expression - it just randomly pops up in my mind and I say it out loud, because it makes me laugh internally (and almost always everyone else too). I am not implying, however, that I am what could be defined as a ""clown"", or someone who can only say funny stuff - I have lots of interests and I always try to be a great listener. But also, I have a pretty sharp sense of humor, which I am kinda proud of.

However, it just feels like I stop working when I'm near someone [F] I'm interested in. I can still hold up a good conversation, but what is missing is my characteristic of being a funny person who can make her laugh. I just feel like it's a more serious situation and that the jokes would be inappropriate or make me look less ""cool"" - but most importantly, I actually completely lose the ability to even think about something funny to say. And this is something that really holds me back - because making someone laugh creates a good connection, which then can lead to a deeper conversation where both are genuinely interested and get to know each other better.

So, my question is actually pretty open - why does this happen? Am I alone? Is this normal? Is it because I don't have enough confidence? I am really lost.

Ive been seeing this girl for a few months now from bumble.. We havent had the talk, we are not officially boyfriend and girlfriend. We kind of act like it though, I spend about 3 or 4 nights a week sleeping over at her place. But I still have tinder and even went on a date during this time. I dont know if shes been on dates but I know she had a bumble match recently.

To start off I know she really likes me. I know I shouldnt have done this, when she was in the shower I went through her texts to see what she was saying about me. It was 100% positive. She talked to her friends, her family, about how amazing I am, there must have been dozens of texts mentioning me. I know, I shouldn't have, I was wrong for that.

Night before Halloween we go to a bar with my childhood best friend and his ex girlfriend. Lets just call him M. Other times when we all hung out she would touch M's shoulders and arms. I would get jealous but didnt know if I should take it as flirty or her being friendly and not understanding how it comes across. She is VERY friendly to everyone and touches men platonically often. Shes touchy with men I know shes not interested in because they're unattractive. The difference is M is attractive and almost every girl he meets ends up liking him. Hed also make sexual jokes to her, like she once said her throat was sore and he said ""how often do you say that"" and she laughed.

Night before Halloween at the bar it started off normal. Then we started getting drunk. My girl is again getting touchy with men I know she has no interest in, I didnt like it but didnt really care. She even asked a guy to dance right next to me but told me to come too. I didnt like how she asked him to dance but it wasnt sexually or anything as she asked me too.

My friend M was drunk and was doing obnoxious things like humping guys, another guy straight up grabbed his crotch. Hes not gay, it was 100% meant to be jokes. He later puts his fingers in his ex girlfriends mouth, he then puts his is fingers in my girls mouth, she didnt like it and bit them. She says she didnt like it, but she didnt seem that upset by it, it seemed like she was jokingly saying she didnt like it, she didnt seem like she felt assualted or anything.

She later made some weird face where she made her mouth super wide open and brought it near my friends face but didnt touch it. I went to the bathroom and when I came back their faces were really close to each other and laughing, It made me jealous and I was drunk so I shoved my friend and just left.

She texts me asking me whats wrong, apologizing, promising nothing was going on. She said after I left she spent the whole night crying because she made me upset. I texted my friend angry messages and he replied:

""Dude, I’m not sure what you thought was going on or what happened. I don’t really remember the finger thing and I don’t know about any faces. But okay, finger was in her mouth and that’s weird and I’m sorry. Is that why you left? (EX GIRLFRIEND) and I dropped her off and she cried for like 20 minutes about you. I thought something else was going on. But if it’s about that, I’m sorry. Nothing was going on between us."" 

I told him I cant forgive him and cant be friends with him anymore. Were 28 and have been friends since age 14. I already went to her place and got my stuff and left, she apologized for hurting me and promised nothing was going on.

Lots of reasons for that including being a late bloomer. Was picked on a lot as a kid for being different and didn’t even try. By the time I started becoming confident, I started attending law school in a different state (recently started my career back in my home state). 

More details: I’m 6’4”, member of a minority ethnic group, not in perfect shape but to the untrained eye I look athletic (I think the height helps lol). I’ve always been known to be a funny lighthearted guy during every social phase of my life. Not an introvert by any means, but just no luck with dating especially when things start progressing.

I’ve got some solid hobbies, but given the law career, work is the undisputed priority. I’m fortunate to have landed my dream job, but it demands 60-90 hours a week. The pay is very high, but free time is very low. 

I’ve gotten decent attention from women over the years, but usually fall short of securing something serious with the person that I like. 

I think the lack of experience has shaped my mindset in negative ways. I feel like I’ll disappoint any girl being this old and not having dating experience to back it up. I also am incredibly set in my ways and can’t imagine completely adjusting my lifestyle to accommodate for another person, even though I naturally wonder what it’d be like to have that connection with a special person…

The group of us got into some really deep conversations, and eventually I gave her a ride home. She invited me in, we talked for a few hours, had a few drinks, went outside for a few smokes.

Eventually we we’re back on her couch, talking about some very deep, personal things, and she pulled me in to start making out. After a few minutes I was kissing her neck when I noticed that she stopped moaning and her hands stopped moving. I looked at her and she was asleep. She was smiling so I thought it was a joke at first, but nope, she was out cold. I was first worried it was the alcohol even though she didn’t seem drunk at all. But I was able to wake her a little and when I was satisfied she was ok, I got her a blanket and left.

It was very uncomfortable for me and I texted her the next day to confirm she was alright, and she was. I could see she kept starting and stopping texting bc of the iMessage dots, and when I asked her what happened she said it was a lack of sleep all week, not the alcohol (or me).

She said she was still recovering from the weekend (I was out 3 days in a row so I was too) Last I said, I told her it was it was chill hanging and at least we got a funny story out of it. No response. 

The way we were talking that night she kinda indicated that she’d like to talk to me more continuously, but the weirdness of the situation has definitely thrown that off. My last response was kinda noncommittal because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do after that. I’ve decided that I should be wary but am interested in talking to her while we’re both completely sober to see if there’s any potential there. But I have 0 idea how I should approach it.

We hit it off and have a lot in common, he said we should go for a drink sometime (this was on the first day we started messaging) and I said I’d like that and told him I was free anytime as I didn’t start my new job for a couple weeks yet - he just replied saying something along the lines of ‘cool we’ll get something sorted’ and then we just continued with our conversation.

I was getting a bit impatient - I never brought up meeting for a drink again as I didn’t want to appear too keen. It’s just annoying having first date conversations over text in my opinion, I’d rather just meet up asap and see if we have good chemistry in person rather than waste time if the eventual date isn’t good! Sometimes texting can be a bit dead, and it’s not the same. Anyways, I decided to stick it out a bit longer - because he’s very much my type.

He seemed to be very interested in me, never let the conversation die off and asked me lots of questions about myself - he also never ever turned the conversation sexual/seedy which I massively rate in a guy! On Sunday night he eventually asked for my number as we had just been instagram messaging, and we had a lovely conversation. I started my new job yesterday so he wished me good luck and we said goodnight to each other. 

I will quickly interject - he started a week of night shifts on Sunday.

I texted him on Monday telling him I hoped his shift was alright and just a general comment about my first morning at work - I still haven’t had a response and he viewed my instagram story this evening. So let’s say even if he was busy and burnt out from night shifts, it’s possible to just send a quick text saying he’s not feeling like his normal self and we’ll catchup at the end of the week - but maybe that’s wishful thinking on my part.

I have BPD. These sort of situations usually trigger intense feelings of rejection and I usually end up having a massive identity crisis and start spiralling. I’m trying my best to be rational - but I can’t help feeling like it’s all my fault and I was too nice, and I shouldn’t have messaged him first. I don’t get ghosted very often at all, but when I do I just pick myself apart. He probably has just ghosted me!

I know I shouldn’t really be over analysing the situation, at the end of the day I haven’t even met him yet. And tbh I feel like I just need to rant about this to get it off my chest. I know there are loads of men that are interested in me, and he won’t be the first or last to ghost me either - I know dating is trail and error but I’m just so over it!

But honestly do you think me messaging him first and showing interest like that put him off? Because I usually always leave the ball in the guys court during the early stages of talking/dating but maybe I got a bit overly confident.

I have a line in my profile to the extent of: if you text first the first coffee is on me.

Similar things happened before and I can’t get rid of the feeling that their is something fishy going on. No matter what this girl wants on there, there is no reason she’d waste time with me when by how dating apps are she has tons of better, older guys as options. 

I have been told I am attractive by male and female friends, one person who I go to uni with who only knew me from my voice said ""behind my back"" to other friends that I’m hot. But I get confused being much older than I am on a regular basis which always gets me into situations either on dating apps where they straight up ask if I’m really 19 or irl where I talk to a girl at club when they wave me over or at church and they are clearly somewhat interested and I say I’m 19 and that look of disappointment runs over their face to an extent where I burst out laughing thinking about it.

I have had difficult times on dating sites because a few things can happen. There can be just weird guys on there, guys that I’m not compatible with, guys who are saying they want a relationship and just want sex. It is a tough thing to figure out if a guy just wants sex, and waiting too long to have sex with him presents the problem of not being able to figure out if he’s good in bed. 

I eventually end up sleeping with the guy, this time I didn’t make  a long process out of it, and he has a huge Dick. Which I was happy about. He seems really nice and wasn’t weird or rude. However we didn’t have sex for very long the first two times of having sex. I understand that some times it can take a long time for some men to have stamina if they haven’t had sex in a long time. It was over in like 2 mins. I believe in communicating in any relationship, and so I asked him if we could have sex for longer next time and I also told him that I liked having sex with him it just wasn’t that long. He didn’t say anything like “well it’s been a long time since I’ve had sex so just give me time”. Nah, he actually got mad at me and said I’m not helping him feel confident and I’m mean . I don’t think that it’s my job as a grown woman to try to make a grown man feel confident, and I didn’t say it rudely. I was communicating my needs, and I felt like he was acting childish about it. However to keep the peace I apologized and said maybe I am not great at wording things and it wasn’t my intention to make him feel bad . 

So then he gets this new job and I’m hearing from him a lot less. I text him but usually I wait for him to text me everyday and start talking from there because I don’t know what hours he’s working. I guess I’m also a little disinterested at this point because of the bad sex and the way he acted about it when I tried talking to him. About four days go by and I only received one text from him saying hi cutie or something like that and I just responded back and that was it. Finally on Monday he texts me and asks me if I’ve forgotten him , and I said nah I just thought you were busy with work. He asks me if I’m texting other guys. I was honest and told him that since I had not heard from him yes I have been chatting with other guys . He said something like “wow it’s only been four days”. I explained my reasoning , how I hadn’t heard from him much and how he got upset with me when I tried to communicate open and honestly which I thought most men would appreciate , and he said “no you were a Dick about it you even admitted it”. I said well I just admitted to being a Dick to keep the peace. I said “I should be able to say something in a tactful way without having to avoid saying things or coddle you”. He then said “so we aren’t fucking any more ?” . So then I was like sooo all you want is sex then ? He says “no I’m just treating you how you treat me cause all you want is sex”. I explained that sex is important to me in a relationship and that I don’t date someone solely because of it either. He then explains “well if you didn’t want to date me I would still fuck you is how I feel about it”. Then he offers to take me out to dinner this week . We haven’t been out to dinner yet, just gone on walks around town and stuff. I guess that was his way of saying he wanted to be serious . He then said he would appreciate it if I didn’t talk to other  guys lol, and would like to be in a relationship with me . I left it at telling him that I don’t appreciate having mind games played on me , if that was what he was trying to do (so we aren’t fucking anymore? Then he acts like he’s treating me like that on purpose) and I said I needed to get to know him more and see that we can be sexually compatible as well as we can get along without any mind games played .

She also has a service  dog although her dog is only with her occasionally. If i had to estimate about once every 3-4 classes.

There  is a local comic con event happening near where the area around our uni  and in the area where she told me she lives and I was planning to ask her if she  would like to go with me. I noticed she had a Thor background on her computer so I thought it would be a good idea. Since its a small class I  was thinking about asking her how things are going as class gets dismissed and then transitioning by  asking ""You're from X part of town right?""  and following up with ""have you heard of the Comic Con event happening  there on X date? I know you're from there and I was thinking about going and wanted to ask if you'd be interested in going with me? Maybe we could go out to eat afterwords?"".

I  told my friend about it and she raised some concerns that have me second guessing my plan. She first raised the point that she may not  actually be into marvel, superheroes, etc and just likes the actor and may subsequently have no interest in going to a comic con. She also said that even if she is interested, a very crowded event like that may not be suitable for bringing service dog. After my friend raised these  concerns I started to think that maybe I should rethink a place to ask her. One that she may actually be interested in going to and that's both more  neutral/ service animal friendly. My friend suggested I ask her to a  museum, bowling, or wait ask her to go ice skating when it gets cold  enough. My friend also said that it might be rude to suggest certain places that may not be the most accessible, but I personally think it might be a little rude to treat her differently on account of her service dog.

Im currently in my first year of university, and we live in the same flat with 6 others. We both admit to still love each other regardless of what happened. We ended on good terms and still are very good friends. Here is the reason i broke up with her….

Girlfriend and gay bestfriend

I [M18] have recently just moved to university with my girlfriend [F18]. We go to the same uni and stay in the same accommodation but in different rooms. We try and spend at-least once a week together since we see each other almost everyday. We have been together for just over 5 months now. She has told me about this guy she’s been seeing these last couple of weeks who’s gay. At first i had no problem at all and gave her all the space she needed.

Personally im quite an introvert,even though i did try and attend most freshers events. I thought experiencing freshers would broaden my mind which it has a little but i tend to stick to my goals in life and work hard towards them, thats what makes me happy. To see her not having the same is quite annoying when she tells me she doesn’t care about her future. I get that not everyone is the same and we all have differences but its not easy.

She claims the guy is having a rough time settling into uni. So she buys him gifts and goes round to his to try and cheer him up. Spending almost every night with him Nightclubs, bars, restaurants, flat drinks, drugs and alcohol. There will be times where we do see each other and even then she dreams about him and whispers his name down my ear while sleeping together.

Ive tried to speak to her and get a better understanding about their friendship but it tends to end in an argument. Ive also asked her if i could meet the guy and she claims that he is not my type of person.

I want some second opinions on this, she claims i have insecurity’s, jealousy and i overthink. I love her and she does what she wants. Maybe she’s right and im mistaken or maybe she is wrong and all the affection and gifts she is giving him should not be tolerated. 

Im finding it very hard to get over the situation and I feel like I’ve made a big mistake, its effecting me in my day to day life. Ive recently made an effort to come home for a week to try and get back to old habits but its getting worse.

What should i do ? Any ideas recommendations would be appreciated!

Me and my now ex-boyfriend (officially) dated for almost 7 months. It was quite healthy, as all of our 'arguments' stemmed from our dire need for trust, communication and affection. We had helped each other flourish quite a lot, as we overcame a plethora of problems together (such as my childhood sexual assault trauma, his lack of trust and security, ect.) This had caused us to grow extremely attached to each other, even though we were aware of the fact that we will most likely be forced to split apart due to our young age and incompatible families.

Yet, he broke up with me a week ago, without any prior warning whatsoever. I asked him to explain his reasoning behind it and he blamed his depleting mental health. A month prior to our breakup, I had noticed his change in mood and encouraged him to book a therapy session. He refused to do so and tried to convince me that he would be alright. During the same time period, we had almost broken up due to the fact that we were anxiously attached to each other. But, unsurprisingly, our opinions had changed an hour later and we decided to appreciate the time that we have left. 

For the first time in almost a year, we didn't talk for over a day. Though I attempted to understand his decision, it still shocked me dearly. Since I am quite mentally unstable myself (unsurprisingly), I regularly experienced anxiety attacks related to my concern that he might be planning to take his own life. I refused to consume any type of meal for a few days due to the painful nausea I was experiencing. I turned to benzodiazepines, but they didn't necessarily help. I simply could not bear the thought of him being in any sort of pain. Nevertheless, while intoxicated, I decided to message him and asked for a favor; for him to tell me how his day went on a regular basis, with the goal of sparing my sanity. He agreed to do so, but cut the conversation short due to the fact that I was not sober. 

It has been two days since this had happened and he has been consistent with his recaps so far. Yet, our conversations are too painful to withstand sometimes. Though I asked him to simply tell me about his day, his messages quickly escalate. He has told me that he physically shakes whenever he texts me or sees me in real life. He confessed that he regularly cries while complying with my favor and that I stress him out. I asked him if he didn't want to message me anymore, but he ignored what I said. He proceeded to tell me that he regularly tries to distract himself from me because he breaks down if he doesn't. Yet, when I try to end the conversation, he continues it, even though he says that he doesn't want to talk anymore. He has told me that he appreciates my care 'beyond my knowledge', as well as that he is concerned about my wellbeing as well. I am uncertain if he wishes me to leave his life entirely. 

My closest friends have advised me to never talk to him again (as they think that he is guilt-tripping me), but I do not know if I can do that due to my anxiety surrounding his wellbeing.

She knows I have anxiety and when she lied to me about being too busy to text me all day and she hasn’t been on her phone, I had seen her posts on social media throughout the day- so obviously she was lying, I had said to her it’s okay if you don’t message I just want to make sure you’re okay because this is the longest you hadn’t messaged me. When I bought this up to her she broke up with me stating the previous reason of us needing to grow. Since then she’s changed how she looks and is constantly posting on social media (where she follows all her new friends) her captions are a little flirtatious. She also said her friend was happier when she broke up with her boyfriend so she wanted to see how it’d affect her.

Bit successes and failures. Is it ok to post about *somebody else’s* relationship? About somebody else’s success? Because right now someone else’s relationship is making me very happy.

I’ve (27 f) been friends with Linda (26 f) for about five years. When we were both in college we waitressed together at a restaurant. We became friends really quickly. She’s really sweet, friendly and outgoing. She’s such a beautiful person in every way. 

One day not too long after we started working together we went out for drinks and celebrate my birthday. One of the people who joined us was my brother Tom (27 m). Tom is my fraternal twin so he and I are not only siblings he’s one of my best friends.

Almost as soon as Tom got there he and Linda seemed to only have eyes for each other. They spent a lot of the night chatting and seemed to really hit it off. The next day Tom called me and asked me what was up with the cute little Latina girl with the curly hair from my party. Now in all the years of our lives my brother never once asked me about any of my friends. But here he was asking about Linda.

Then the next time we worked together Linda said when I saw my brother I should  tell him she said hi. So I knew I had to get those two together. Which I did. I made sure to invite them both out one evening so we could all hang out. During the night I made sure to tell Tom he better get her number. 

And they ended up dating. They’ve been together now for four years. Over time Linda started to become more and more a part of our family. She became more than just a friend from work she became like another sister to me.

Then this weekend Tom proposed to her! I’m so happy right now! Linda called me right after she called her mom. We both cried on the phone. I am so excited that Linda is going to be my sister in law! I’m so happy that she found a guy like Tom. I’m so happy for Tom too. He deserves someone like Linda that makes him happy. I see the way they look at each other and how much they love each other and it makes me feel good that I helped to get the two of them together.

I wanted to share my experience in the last year or so of being a truly single male and what I have realized when it comes to meeting women on apps vs in real life.

36 year old Caucasian male living in a major US city. I would consider myself very good looking and confident. Picking up women for me overall is easy (came with age and experience)

**Meeting women in person is SUPERIOR to using dating apps!!** 

**REAL LIFE** \- I have noticed the women I meet in person seem to stay in my life. Even when it doesn't work out we always seem to remain on good terms and stay friends. I never get ghosted by women I meet in person and I seem to always get a date after getting her contact. Meeting women in person seems so easy. 

But for some reason I keep using:

**Dating apps** \- Easy to use. Tons of attention from girls. But that's it - 

The cons:

\- The only time I get ghosted is on dates from dating apps. I have even been ghosted after what I thought was a good date!

\- Women looking for free meals, dates, they are bored etc. I have gotten this vibe a few times.

\- Women don't look as good as their pics. 

\- The last one I am also guilty of - Talking to too many women at once. Ignoring what could be a winner because you want the hot foreign chick that's probably going to waste your time. So you stop answering someone and then go back 2 weeks later, that just isn't a good look - but we all do it.

In the end, dating apps seem to be the same old song and dance. I meet women I like but don't really like enough to be serious with (they can probably get the vibe). In person I seem to meet women that I like and vibe with.  Yet I still keep using dating apps - maybe it's just to pass time when lying in bed?

So, I'm a 29F and I've never had sex or kissed anyone. I've never imagine that I'd be a late bloomer but here I am. There were periods of my life that I wasn't interested in dating, others that I was just too shy to confess to the other person my feelings or just be closer to him (i've only liked a few people, but when I like someone is intense) or I was focusing in something else.

Last year (2020), I decided to join OLD but got no luck. Talked with many people but I was never interested in meeting any of them. Now on 2021, I've decided to join it again and I had 3 dates (with different people) and even though I wasn't really looking for a long term relationship, I just didn't want to straight hookup lol

Now 3 months after these meetings, I'm just not in a good state of mind for dating, so I'm not even thinking about short term relationships. I want to go physical and once here and there I get some ONS offers, but hookups make me uncomfortable because of my inexperience lol In a way I think I'm too old for not even knowing how to do basic stuff and I've never really met a guy that I felt it'd be okay if I wasn't good. All of them think I have some experience and even these who say that aren't willing for ONS expect me to be in a certain way and they'd be ok on going on dates but they'd also want to escalate to something more to see our compatibility. Like last time I was on a date, I was talking with this guy and he looked so nice and respectful online so I thought that I could be honest to him about my situation, but then he made some comments about somebody else and that's when I came to realize that it wouldn't be ok for him to be with someone inexperienced and even my friends say the same lol I had a friend who is just 21 and many girls mock her bc she never did anything, imagine me as a 29.

I know doing with someone that I like maybe would make things easier, but the thing is last time I've liked someone was 2 years ago. 3 years ago I was attracted to a guy that I knew in real life and he tried to hook up with me and at the time I panicked because I was afraid of not knowing what to do lol so I Feel like if I keep waiting for this ""good opportunity"" I'll waiting for a really long time

I'm not against going casual with strangers, but I just don't know how to relax and let things happen. I know if I never do this, I'll never get experience but still I get so self conscious that it's hard to let anyone approach me.
