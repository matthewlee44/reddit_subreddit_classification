We never really talked about expectations for the relationship until the second date so I'm not sure if I actually did anything wrong here but still want to be open and honest with him about the situation.

13,s916tn,1642736641,How to be more gentle?,"I (32M) have been described as a serial dater by my friends. I probably go on at least one date a week, which is only limited by my odd schedule as an airline pilot. On apps, or in person I am pretty honest, I am just looking to have really fun dates. I enjoy dinning at fine restaurants, going on outdoor adventures, drinking at high end bars, going sporting events, seeing shows, ballets, or concerts; not necessarily ‚Äúnormal‚Äù first date activities.

 I am extremely extroverted, I can carry a conversation and talk about nearly anything. My dates tend to open up quickly, as I am not judgmental, I am empathetic and a good listener. I also share an equal amount about myself.  I think a lot of it comes from my job, sitting next to a complete stranger on a trip, trapped in a flight deck; I get lots of practice talking. 

Typically the date ends with a friendly hug or maybe a kiss on the cheek. I very rarely hook up with the lady, if I do it is typically because she initiated it. From there, I usually just slowly let texting conversations die out. 

I know most of my dates want a relationship or something more than just one date. But I honestly don‚Äôt. I am pretty content with my lifestyle. I like being able to do exactly what I want to do, when I want to do it. I am gone 15-18 days a month. Sometimes I am beat after a trip and just want chill. I don‚Äôt feel like I am in a place where I would make a good partner; I don‚Äôt think it would be fair to them. However, I still feel guilty slowly killing each relationship. There is nothing apparently wrong with any of the ladies I have dated and I was very upfront in what I was looking for from the start. 

I am not going to stop dating, but is there a way I can be more gentle? I really don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone, but I am sure I have in the past. To add to the complexity, I might be open to a real relationship, but she would really have to wow me on all levels, and I haven‚Äôt met her yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s916tn/how_to_be_more_gentle/

15,s919gd,1642736861,How do I date after sexual trauma in my youth (29M),"29M, soon to be 30. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had experience moving past sexual trauma. I guess you can call my trauma serious. I won‚Äôt minimize it, but I only go into it during therapy. I‚Äôve heard some individuals become more promiscuous when they deal with their trauma. I was the opposite and became avoidant of any potential sexual encounter. As a result, I‚Äôm extremely inexperienced and it weighs heavily on me. I don't fear judgment from women, but the loss is what bothers me.

I coped throughout my 20s by building myself. It‚Äôs curious how the mind defends itself but I somehow decided this was a way forward for me because I was scared and had no clue how to handle what I was going through. I was also raised in a way that discouraged asking for help or having flaws. It has been worthwhile for my superficial qualities. I‚Äôve maxed my looks, body, career ( as I‚Äôm really up in the top of my field), and everything else I could have measured. I obsessively pursued it all to a high level, but deep within myself I knew there was something still wrong with me. I sought therapy because no amount of self-awareness was uncovering the core problem.

I often feel unusual and like I‚Äôm living a lie because it feels like I developed normally otherwise. I know I have no way of proving to strangers on the internet, but I was kind of the class clown. I‚Äôve always been witty and often told how funny I am. I seriously have never struggled socially, despite dealing with a normal level of shyness when I was a bit younger. However, when it comes to my sexuality I‚Äôm completely stunted. It‚Äôs distinctly that and since that is usually a private matter no one is aware of it. Supposedly because of my looks and that I never talk about it, people assume I fuck around. In actuality, my formative experiences were mired in suppressing my sexuality, not expressing it. I know why I did it, but it reached such a deep part of my inner self that it‚Äôs been a challenge to change it.

I‚Äôve known people close to me getting married and it feels like they‚Äôve lived a life I haven‚Äôt even started. Many of them have had several relationships before they reached that point. I know it would be a mistake to get married given where I am. I put no pressure on myself there, but it does signify how much time has passed. I‚Äôm also aware that I need to keep progressing with therapy because it is helping me. But I‚Äôm struggling with acceptance of losing my 20s to this. I‚Äôve forgiven myself in that this was out of my control. I didn‚Äôt ask for this, but I have this nagging feeling that when I can be expressive enough to have sex, it won‚Äôt ever remove this pain.

Does anyone have any experience overcoming this? How did you approach dating? Very gradually? This is partially me venting my thoughts, but I appreciate it nonetheless.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s919gd/how_do_i_date_after_sexual_trauma_in_my_youth_29m/

27,s933g1,1642742186,Why Confidence??,"confidence

""a feeling or belief that you can do something well or succeed at something"" - Merriam-Webster


I'm a very risk averse individual. I hate unknowns, uncertain outcomes and the prospect of failure. This applies to all areas of my life. I'm also a very anxious and sensitive person. My emotions usually win in the internal ""logic vs emotion"" decision making process.. 

Society seems to view self-confidence as an all-conquering essential ingredient to a prosperous life. It's importance is constantly pandered via film, TV and social media.
The acceptable line between confidence and arrogance is so murky, only continuing to further blend.

The more importance placed on self-confidence the more 'insecurity' gets ridiculed. ""Insecurities"" has become the end-all, final boss of negative justification for other people's problems...with seemingly no retort.

""Oh they have X problem, they are so insecure"" 
""They didn't agree with you on a personal subject, they must be insecure"" 
""They didn't feel comfortable doing something, probably insecure"" 

Yeah I'm insecure, SO FUCKING WHAT. 
Why does that matter?? When did we decide that the lack of self-confidence is such a terrible thing. Why?? I genuinely don't understand. 

At this point I'm insecure about being insecure lmao.

I hate disappointing people, especially once I've made any form of social or interactional commitment to them. I underpromises, overdeliver in everything. I don't want to seem arrogant or cocky.. 

I guess my point is, from all the data I have access to (personal experience, friends, media portrayals etc) 
People seem substantially less attracted to others who aren't super confident. Why?

Also, since I'm so new to the dating scene, I only fully realised a few days ago that people mostly don't go from close friends to a relationship (as I always saw it) but from strangers/acquaintances to dating to relationship. Yeah... I'm not the brightest individual at times LOL

Imho my college seems like it would be perfect to meet new people except there's new lockdown restrictions and I'm by far not the best at getting myself out there. I'm pretty introverted but that does depend, I do tend to be energetic/excitable especially around friends - and for reasons probably linked to my somewhat low self-esteem, I've fallen for mainly introverted girls (it somehow got into my head that I had less of a chance with extroverted girls) - however, it has taken me an embarassingly long amount of time to put the jigsaw together and realise that all the girls that were interested in me were at least somewhat extroverted (opposites might attract after all!)

Anyway, if you guys have any advice either on how to get myself out there or on just in general about dating that would be appreciated!

I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued spending time and effort  investing in him. I wasn't invested initially and was seeing multiple people. 

He did his best to convince me eventually that he wanted me exclusively and was meeting my needs post which we both decided we wanted to talk to each other exclusively.

We haven't met mind you because he's in the navy and is on a ship. I had my doubts and insecurities but since we were talking everyday over video calls and text I started to get close to him. 

Now that I start falling for him, he suddenly pulls away and becomes aloof. When I ask him what's up with his behavior, he says nothing changed. However I see a start difference in his actions and what he says. The effort has diminished. I noticed this a week before his contract with the navy ended and he has to come back home for the holidays. 

I am taking this as a cue for his disinterest and assuming that perhaps he saw me as a filler for the time he had when he was on ship. It is incredibly hurtful and disrespectful and I can't help but be mad at myself for not trusting my judgement with men like this. I knew he wasn't right yet I chose to pursue him or trust him.

I am trying to come to terms with his change of behavior and wondering what I can do to stop hurting over this faster. How can I avoid situations like this in dating?

Because for a longer chunk of the time we spent talking he was meeting my/needs emotionally and this behavior is only recent. How do I avoid investing in people who pretend and lie and then eventually show you their true colors?

56,s968th,1642754337,Who'd even date a poor guy?,"Struggling through life, I reached a point where I'm seriously taking into consideration not being able to start a long-term relationship because of money.

Let me explain: I had my past relationships during my teenage/college years and I can't say that money was an issue. We made it work either way, even a lil more than that, but they didn't last partly because I couldn't offer emotional stability. I was young, wanted to try different stuff, move countries, you get the idea. And luckily I did them all.

Now I'm settled emotionally, but with no financial security. In fairness, it doesn't bother me that much. I know I'll get past. I know I'll get better. I'm 28M, with a bachelor's degree, and I'm working hard to get somewhere. It just takes time. Unfortunately, a long time. And sometimes all I need at the end of the day is a warm hug before going to bed

There are different factors in creating a strong bonding with someone, working together and making sacrafices. And sure, I might compensate by being (and I can say with confidence) charming, intelligent, good looking and funny. Offering all the attention and support. Whenever needed, I can surprise her by making a diy gift. But in the long term, all these things might slowly fade away when I barely make it to the end of the month and inadvertently putting pressure on myself/us.

I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) are in a LDR relationship since last 4 years. He grew up in a very toxic environment where there was no communication between anyone, neither his parents, nor his siblings. This has deeply impacted his communication skills as he is very hesitant in sharing emotional stuff. Since a couple of months, i have been noticing that he keeps a lot of stuff hidden from me that he knows might make me mad. The stuff is really miniscule in nature like, i am a vegan but he loves non vegetarian food so he used to eat meat but he never told me because he knew that I'd be hurt and angry. Another instance was, there is this toxic guy I asked him not to talk to but I saw that he is in touch with him, not very regular but once a month. They are not even good friends. But i don't like that guy because he has caused a number of problems in our relationship. 

So when I confronted him about him  hiding these tiny things, he said that he lied because he didn't wanted to hurt me. 

I understand the emotion behind these lies but now my mind is racing about other things that he might have kept hidden. How do I handle these thoughts and how can I help him communicate better?

the men i date have a lifestyle that is very different from mine: they usually don't sleep at night, smoke, don't do much sports. they get very immersed in their creative activity where they seem to forget about the outside worlds for days or weeks at a time. they typically don't have a stable income or earn less than me.  


i have flexible working hours, i'm an early bird, like to start my day with yoga. i lift weights regularly, go to the sauna and cold dipping in a river. i try to eat well. on the weekends i like to go hiking and bouldering.  


of course this is wildly incompatible with the lifestyle of my lovers. even they will tell me i should date someone who is more like me and who has more resources to spend quality time with me.however, anytime i get asked out by someone who is similar to me, i will immediately turn down the offer. i have friendzoned software devs, guys who were into biomedicine, anyone fitness-oriented.  


how do it change it? is this a form of self-sabotage or a form of subconsciously avoiding a functioning relationship? is there any future for me with artists? do you think it's possible to be in a relationship with someone whose lifestyle and pastime activities are totally different from yours?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s970wu/is_dating_people_with_a_lifestyle_very_different/

69,s982ld,1642762065,"I(M22) can't tell if I'm too needy for my own good, or if I'm just dating cold/distant people. Should I be more reserved?","For a lot of my life when I was younger, I wasn't the most attractive person. I was very overweight so dating was kinda hard.

Now that I'm older though, and I really started taking care of myself, I get a lot more dates than I could ask for, and it's something that made me pretty happy. I enjoy getting to know people and hearing their stories. Gives me more perspective on life.

However keeping them after is something I keep failing at. I've been getting told that I'm needy or that they weren't looking for anything too serious and it's been making me paranoid that I'm suffocating dates with attention. 

Some of the things I do, that I'd need perspective on is...


1. Most of the time I'll offer other dates if I find something interesting for us to do,

""Hey this ---- movie came out and I remember you said you wanted to watch it, wanna go, on me?""

That kind of thing. Sometimes theirs lots to do, sometimes there's not a ton of opportunities. 


2. I like to text dates, probably like once every other day. Just to keep in touch. Check up on them, make sure they're okay. Often offer lunch if they haven't had any. Compliment them if we're more intimate. 

3. I often tag along or invite them when there's menial stuff to do. Like go grocery shopping.

I don't know why, I just find it peaceful being able to casual things with them. It's like taking a walk together to the park. Just spending time together without a big objective or preparation.

4. I really enjoy physical attention (Not specifically in the NSFW way.) I mean, like hand holding. Hugging. Kissing their foreheads when they get sleepy. Carrying them around like a princess. I love cuddling, except I usually try to be small spoon because sometimes my heart beats really fast because I'm excited to be with them.

5. I like to listen, offer advice, and try to fix problems of theirs if I can. I know sometimes it gets annoying when you're venting to someone and they keep trying to fix stuff instead of listening, but I can't help it.

When I see dates having a rough time over something I can help with, I try and try to fix it because I'd like to make them feel happier?

I'm not a perfectionist or anything, but when there's a simple problem like ""I left my stuff at home and I can't leave work so I'm starving""

I will 110% of the time be like, ""OH, no worries I'm coming to bring you food.""

Some appreciate it, some really don't. 




Do you guys think I'm being too needy/attentive to people?

Should I dial it back? Or just on some things more than others?

Am I doing alright as it is?

Please let me know.  Any advice is appreciated, I'm kind of clueless when it comes down to it.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s982ld/im22_cant_tell_if_im_too_needy_for_my_own_good_or/
70,s98g5t,1642763539,Is my constant relocating ruining my chances of getting into a relationship?,"Hello, people. So I don't know if I phrased my question correctly but I'm worried about relocating again to the point that it's contributing to my general anxiety. I'm from a small European country and have lived abroad during my childhood, moved back to my country (lets not say which one lol) and then studied animation abroad, kind of. I went to the UK but didn't like the program and being completely lost I ended back in my other country (I have double nationality) for two years. Eventually I moved to Spain, where I had been as a child because my country didn't offer many opportunities to further my studies after a certain point. Due to covid and other family reasons and not finding a permanent job I have moved back to my original country and started doing small freelance jobs. I have been here for a year already. I'm 24 and I haven't had a relationship, partly because of this and partly because I like women and you know how that is... 

I have never stayed in a city for more than 4 years in a row and my family was constantly moving, even when I was a child. My father's career put a strain on my mother even though he usually found jobs for her too because they were in the same field. I am afraid this has 'messed me up' in a sense because I don't seem to be able to commit to a place and constantly think of moving somewhere better. I think of moving somewhere and my instant thought is that I might want to leave after a year. I just can't make the decision of moving somewhere my whole life. I know that when working in the animation industry relocation is very common unless you live in California which is basically the hub of  the industry but very hard to get into for a foreigner, which means I probably can't make it any time soon. I have until now put my studies above a relationships even though I wanted one because I figured I was young and all but I will be 25 by August and it's getting a bit tiring, honestly. I see friends that have settled into a long term relationship and others that change partners before I can even realize it and I've been here this whole time, doing nothing. 

Of course the obvious answer is to just move somewhere and see how it goes but that's exactly what is causing me anxiety. Basically there is no solution other than going somewhere and looking for a relationship even if I'm not sure I'll stay and hope that the relationship is enough to take my thoughts off wanting to leave. Of course I'll be extremely picky and ruin my chances because I'll be thinking that I might have to stay there for that person. Only casual relationships would be compatible with my lifestyle but I really don't want that. Maybe I should just get over myself lol.

Anyway I'm aware that I need to find a solution myself but I was wondering if anyone else went through this what their experiences were!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s98g5t/is_my_constant_relocating_ruining_my_chances_of/

72,s98l23,1642764078,"Girl Wants to Go on a Second Date, but Insists on Going to the Exact Same Place as Before? What's Going on Here...","I matched with a girl on Tinder and we chatted and agreed to go on a date on Wednesday. I asked her out for a drink and she said she'd be more comfortable getting coffee. I thought, ""that's fine, first Tinder date you can never be too safe."" So I suggested a couple places and we decided on a Starbucks. 

Date went great and shortly after we parted ways I asked if she'd like to go out again. She said yes and then specified that she's not trying to rush things and doesn't want to have sex right away. I said that's fine and I asked her if she was free this weekend. Again she said yes, so I suggested going to fun bar in town. She said she still wasn't comfortable doing that...I asked her what part of it she was uncomfortable about, the unfamilar bar, the alcohol, or the evening, and she said all three. So now I'm starting to think maybe there's a problem. I suggest getting a pizza instead and she seems happy with that suggestion and agrees to get a pizza Friday (today). 

Late last night she writes me saying she'd be more comfortable going for a walk or for coffee again. I'm a bit annoyed, but I agree again. I say that it's too cold for a walk but suggest another coffee shop we could meet at. She says that finding parking is hard and asks if we can go to the same Starbucks we went to last time... 

This is weird because the two coffee shops are close to each other and I  don't want to go to the same Starbucks again for a second date.... (Also the Starbucks is loud, busy, has horrible lighting, has worse coffee, is more expensive, and is altogether not as nice as the place I suggested). I tell her that the coffee shop is less than a ten minutes walk from where she parked for Starbucks and it would be nice to walk together there, etc. The last thing she wrote is ""Is there any chance to convince you to go to Starbucks?"" with about twenty of the cringe emojis after it.

77,s99gml,1642767414,Trying to recover from a devastating loss,"So 4 days ago, my gf broke up with me because she lost all feelings for me. She had given it a few weeks for them to come back but they didn‚Äôt. She said it‚Äôs a mental illness and I‚Äôm too nice for her to emotionally abuse in case the feelings came back so it‚Äôs better if we broke up.
This literally destroyed me. I haven‚Äôt gotten out of bed in 4 days and took a 5th day off of work tomorrow because I‚Äôm so broken. I just drink all day and randomly burst into an ugly cry, mind you I haven‚Äôt shed a tear in over a decade. I just don‚Äôt want to exist or be alive.
During the relationship I immediately fell for her and hard. She told me not to suppress feelings and be open with myself so I literally let down my guard, and went all in emotionally. The highs I would feel when I was with her was unreal and I was obsessed and addicted to her. I only cared about making her happy, and would‚Äôve done anything for her, and made sure she knew it. 
I‚Äôm just an emotional wreck right now and don‚Äôt know how to get past this. Before this relationship, I had gotten out of a 7 year partnership and it ended when I found out she cheated on me. However this breakup feels a million times worse than that. This girl for some reason I thought was the one. I saw her red flags but thought they made her unique. I‚Äôm just so disappointed I couldn‚Äôt be the person she wanted but I‚Äôm not one to force love from someone who doesn‚Äôt want to give it. All I know is this pain is unreal and even drinking doesn‚Äôt get rid of it all the way. 
I can‚Äôt stop wishing that she just texts me back and says ‚ÄúI realized I have feelings for you‚Äù but I know that‚Äôll never happen. I just fantasized about having a house with her, a kid, getting married, growing old together. Everything just seemed like it would be too good to be true and it definitely was. 

My relationship history isn‚Äôt long but it‚Äôs definitely a tough track record:
My first actual girlfriend wasn‚Äôt until I was 21. We met online and I took her out to dinner. We went back to her place that same night and started drinking heavily. She literally dragged me upstairs to her bedroom and wanted me to have sex with her. I got scared because this isn‚Äôt how I wanted my first time to be so I‚Äôm pretty sure I fingered her but I don‚Äôt really remember.
My second girlfriend was someone I met online when I was 22, and I thought she was great but she was in an open relationship. She would invite me over to give her massages and would talk to me on the phone for hours but it didn‚Äôt feel right. I wanted to take her out and do nice things for her but it had to be so secretive. Since it was an open relationship I started looking around too. Eventually I found someone who wanted a serious relationship and broke this off. She was furious I broke up with her and wished me dead, which I kinda wish I was too at this point.
This ended up being my 7 year relationship. We were very close and moved in together right away. We became best friends. However after a few months when I started trying to be intimate with her and it was fine but I felt like I just wasn‚Äôt attracted to her. I literally friend zoned her and we had a great relationship but it wasn‚Äôt a partnership. She eventually cheated on me 7 years in and I decided to break things off. We started talking again recently because we realized we were good friends but we know we can never have an actual relationship. 
After the breakup I met someone 6 months later for a one night stand and didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. I realized I needed an emotional connection to enjoy it.
3 months later brings me to my most recent and most devastating loss. We started out what I thought was great. We talked all the time (1-5 hours a night), texted all day to each other, had an overall great relationship. During our relationship we had 0 fights. I would always make myself available for her, and she got intimate with me fairly quickly and for the first time in my life I actually enjoyed the intimacy. I felt like she was perfect and I really really wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. We looked at houses together and even talked about possibility of a kid. She had a lot of baggage and a lot of issues but I literally did not care because my emotions were so attached. She literally could‚Äôve asked me to do anything and I would have for her, and she knew that. But my whole relationship with her I was anxious because I got a sense that she didn‚Äôt love me. She would be happy and loving one minute and the cold the next. But I would stick around and do anything to see that happy side of her. I literally can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and keep hoping it was a bad dream, but she‚Äôs really gone and I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to move on. I invested everything I had emotionally and have nothing left. I don‚Äôt even want to date again because I don‚Äôt wanna ever feel this way. I know I probably sound like a whiner and immature, and I probably am.

We‚Äôre both on uni vacation right now and won‚Äôt see each other for a month. He was planning to ask me out when we meet in person. 

When I first ever saw him (around 7 months ago) I was really awe struck by his luscious hair. I‚Äôm not exaggerating here. His hair was gorgeous and long ahhh. And I‚Äôve told him this. 

He hasn‚Äôt cut his hair since then and so it started getting a bit too long. 

Last month he wanted to shave all his hair off and I was like ‚Äúwoah woah hold up!!‚Äù üò≥ü§ö 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong but his long hair makes quite a difference to his appearance. And I kind of said that even if I vibe well with someone, I wouldn‚Äôt date them if I don‚Äôt find them attractive but I am more than happy to be good friends with them. 

He was obviously quite upset by this and I asked him if I shaved my head if he‚Äôd still date me and he said no. Soo ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyway, this conversation came up again recently because he really wants to cut his hair since it‚Äôs getting super long (like past his shoulders). And over the month my feelings for him have grown and I no longer care about his hair as much as I did before but he‚Äôs still super self conscious about cutting his hair because he thinks that it would risk losing me. 

I tried to reassure him that I like him a lot and I‚Äôm not just going to lose feelings over hair but he says that his heart still feels heavy just to even think about it. He says that he doesn‚Äôt want to make the wrong move and lose me.

How can I reassure him that it‚Äôs going to be ok and that I love him no matter what. He just doesn‚Äôt believe me anymore :( I know it‚Äôs my fault for saying that I won‚Äôt date someone I wont find attractive but I‚Äôm so into him and I‚Äôve moved past that now",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s99ihd/my_crush_is_scared_to_cut_his_hair_because_he/

So, here's my problem ...

I met this girl (20) few months ago during the formation. She has been in the army for one year and change regiment recently. She had a lot of trouble with guys been interested by her and is very upset by that.

We didn't talk to each other that much at the beginning but at the last weeks we started getting very close. I had a crush for her and she seems to like me but I can really tell if it was just friendship or love. We talk a lot and eat together every time until the end of the formation. 

During the holidays we continued texting a lot. But I didn't manage to tell her my feelings because I'm to scared of her reaction and I feel like it would sound like all the guys she's been dealing in the army.

Back from holidays, we were dispatch in different company but we continued eating with each other. The problem is i can't get a date because many people are around and there's always a friend or someone we know next to us. So discussion are very ""boring"" and I can't figured out how to speak to her seriously or so. 

Everytime it started to get to something, one of us had contingency or something is happening and killing the vibe. On top of that she has a deployment soon, so there's not that much time left.

I don't know what to do and I'm very frustrated because it seem so close but impossible at the same time. I need advice",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9b6he/im_trying_to_date_a_girl_i_like_but_it_hard/

94,s9c5at,1642775825,Is it possible to never get over with a breakup?,"5 years ago or so I broke up with an ex who yo this day I consider one of the most important people I've met throughout my life.

After that breakup I've had kinda casual relationships but it was never the same. This ex gf marked a point in my dating life of ""before her and after her"" (Idk if I'm making sense with this, English is not my first language!).

Since this breakup, I've been attracted to women who were similar to her either physically or because of their personalities. And this is not something I can directly change because I don't choose who I am attracted to.

I've asked others for opinions and this is definitely not normal and they suggested to me therapy but at the moment I can't afford it.

I'm afraid if this is something that will stick with me to the very end, or if what's happening to me it's extremely detrimental for me or something.

Just as a note, she marked me because of how important she was for me, not because of bad reasons, although she had several mental disorders so obviously this wasn't all pretty.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9c5at/is_it_possible_to_never_get_over_with_a_breakup/

97,s9comi,1642777319,35 M Looking for my best friend," I am 6ft tall, i am white, i have some money, and a stable income. I care about you, nobody else. I dont sleep with other people, ever, period. Im looking for a best friend who will game with me, whos into life with me, who wants to share our experience together. Im sick though, i got some issues. I was a US Army Ranger for a decade and some strings came attached. That was 12 years ago and i have moved on but my body was injured. I love, I care deeply and if were together, youll be the ONLY thing that matters, my dogs and our life.  i hope we can spend long days gaming on our PCs, and then long days just walking up and down stores like spirits, or candle wax warehouse or even...ANY WHERE having a blast just window shoping. Im a stay at home mostly person and I dont just wanna have sex 5 times a day. Maybe a few times a week. not a really sexual person, but enough that it matters. If your drive in life is sex I am not the one for you. I am a person who needs YOU, not your body. I also enjoy most common television like ozark, peacekeeper, doom patrol, Stranger things, Euphoria, Dexter New Blood, Rick and Morty, etc. I love pop culture but my favorite thing is video games and I consider my self a gamer. Before my heart attack I was heavily into the Army and just gamed casually. I dont know mind, I love what I do and I am lucky to be alive. I am 35, no kids and I own my home. I have 2 dogs, theyre labs and theyre both from the same parents. They fiercely loyal to each other and one cannot survive without the other. I like my women thin, sorry I always have. Im think, or use to be,maybe this past few year since hitting 35 years ive packed on a lot of muscle. But it doesnt change the fact I can skip meals for the next 3 months and be skinny as a stick again. Truthfully....this isnt true either...I like my women more for personaility anyways. If you are big, but are just fun as hell to be around. Hit me up. Im just looking for someone who will be my bestie! Dont expect kids or marriage though. im still raw from my last marriage and just want to be friends for a while. Bless! Alone in Cali Please no hook ups either. Im not saying just platonic but no hit and quits either. Im not that kind of guy.  Love to everyone here, i know how hard this is and bless you all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9comi/35_m_looking_for_my_best_friend/
98,s9cqk6,1642777461,Spicy thought about a friend,"I have this friend and I never ever saw him as more than a friend (we are both single), we have different personalities which is fine for a friendship but I think for a relationship wouldn't work.
All of sudden I had this random thought of sleeping with him and It was sooo hot. It never crossed my mind before this and now I can't stop thinking about it.
Have you guys had this kind odd thought randomly? What did you do about it? Does it go away?
Ps: let's not go through ""ruining the friendship"" route, I know the risks if we end up sleeping together. Just curious if this happened to other people and what you decided to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9cqk6/spicy_thought_about_a_friend/
99,s9d0bc,1642778202,The guy whom I am dating lied that he lived in the same country as me,"First Reddit post for me - Because I really troubled and looking for some advice.

I was using Bumble, and the guy and I matched a month ago, and arranged to meet in a cafe. We really hit it off since the first meeting. There was an incredible amount of chemistry, and I felt an instant connection with him since the first coffee date - I have never felt that for many years. He is intelligent, eloquent, well-mannered, charismatic, gentleman. He mentioned that he had overseas experience and studied abroad in UK for close to ten years but returned to the country eight years back.

He asked for my phone number and asked me out the following day. Subsequently, we went for proper dates for a week - movie dates, dinner nights, long strolls etc. almost every day. He always asked me out again at the end of each date, and made plans/reservations and paid the dates, I offered to pay for some as well (because I felt bad). He was really very sweet and attentive during the dates, remembered my little details, and texted me regularly every day. I felt really happy around him and could be vulnerable with him.

There was once (on 6th/7th date), I asked him whether we were on the same page for relationship goals - if he is just looking for a casual date as he posted ""Not sure yet"" on his Bumble profile, because I am actually looking a long-term relationship. I made it very clear in my profile as well. He replied that he felt that we had a strong connection, which can potentially lead to something serious, which was an fair/honest answer in my opinion.

We started to make out at his place on the 8th or 9th date, which was the second week we met. I really appreciate that we waited long enough for sex when dating because I am a pretty conservative woman. And he actually brought me out for proper dates before heading to his place, so it was not just a pure make-out session.

Third week - I was busy with my master's assignment because it was due next Monday. So we met only two times early in the week, but we continued to keep in touch by texting. On Sunday, we planned to go out - he suggested having a celebration after I finish my assignment. He waited for me to have late dinner (9 pm), which touched me. We met and made out in his car that night.

The following day, I texted via WhatsApp in the morning but my message has only been sent with one tick. He replied in the late afternoon. It was unusual since he usually responds immediately, but I didn't ask him about his network connection. He asked me if I had submitted my assignment, and I said yes after the proofreading etc. He suddenly told me that he flew last night, and is in UK now, he didn't bear to tell me last night because I was preoccupied with my assignment, and he didn't want to affect my studies.

I was in total shock, he told me he just returned home for a one-month vacation in Dec/Jan, and he has been working in the UK since grad school. He told me he will stay in UK for 1-2 years, and should return home then. He apologized for lying to me from the start because he knew that I would not meet him again if he told me the truth. He told me that he likes me and cherish the limited time we had thus, he asked me out almost every day. And he would be like to see me again if I am willing to?

After I probed further, I realised he created a pseudo dating profile on Bumble, he revealed his real name. His age is actually 7 years older than what he posted in his profile. It's like one lie leads to another lie, to cover up the initial lie. He said he could not reveal his name to me; otherwise, I would find out that he is working in the UK. I was furious and rebuked him because he should not have lied and deprived me of the option to decide whether or not to meet again. I no longer know what the Real him. He told me it's still him. He only withheld information from me to keep me from finding out that he actually stays in the UK, but everything else, like his thinking etc, was exactly him.

I was so upset that I cried hours over it. I resented him for lying and being so sweet to me during the three weeks, making me fall for him, and also I missed having him around as well.

I really don't know what I should do now. I have developed feelings for him over the past three weeks. I have not blocked him on WhatsApp and he continues to text me - because I can't bring myself. He mentioned that he will try to return to the country during May to meet again. **Should I continue to communicate with him or I should cut communication and just move on?**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9d0bc/the_guy_whom_i_am_dating_lied_that_he_lived_in/
