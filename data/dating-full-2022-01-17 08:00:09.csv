I've tied my value to being entertaining and valuable to others and think that I am worthless if I can't do these things.

I'm constantly overanalyzing whether I did something wrong, if I could have flirted enough, if I could have texted less, if I could have been funnier, if I was trying to hard, if I was too boring. It's fucking exhausting.

And the worst part is that I feel like I am stuck. Like I have to keep going with these stupid platforms because if I don't then I will never meet anyone. But this isn't even true!

So, I [32F] am currently single after my relationship ended a year ago. I recently took my new car to a garage because there was a light on the dash. The incredibly handsome mechanic was super sweet when explaining that I just needed to put air in my tires! A real damsel in distress moment ffs. Anyway, he insisted on doing all four tires for me and wouldn’t accept any payment. 

I had my friend in the car with me and when we left, she asked why I didn’t talk to him longer because he was “definitely flirting with you”. I didn’t see but apparently he lingered on in the bay to give a little wave as we drove off. 

Now, I do actually have a reason to go back there. I genuinely need help with my car. Would I be inappropriate to ask if he’s single? How the hell would I even go about that? Also, there are about 9 guys working there so I can hardly go in and ask for the handsome one lol 

There’s always the likely chance he was just doing his job and I’ll make an idiot out of myself but, honestly, I’m generally quite the clumsy dork so I don’t embarrass too easily anymore.

I (26F) have been seeing this guy (25M) since the beginning of 2022. We’ve been dating back in 2020 for a couple of months as well, but I ended it. After breaking it off, he used to have this very annoying behavior of disappearing, even though we still managed to see each other every now and then because we are neighbors. He lives in a different city now, but he came back home every weekend since we spent NYE together and we would meet whenever he’s at home. 

He’s very sweet towards me and we get along pretty well. He apologized for being a douchebag back in 2020-21 and ghosting me; he also told me he acted like that because he’s  “insane” (I can kinda confirm that considering his rather tumultuous past and weird relationship with his parents) and told me he doesn’t wanna make me suffer because he really likes me and told me I don’t deserve that kinda sh*t. 

He’s not a texter, but lately he was the one who kept contacting me. One time he stopped replying all of a sudden (again, just like back in 2021) and I jokingly told him I’ll get upset if he just disappears from the convo, like… just say you can’t talk anymore and say goodbye. I’m not the clingy type, but I felt awkward. He apologized again and told me he’ll try to stop this toxic behavior. He’s all sweet and then boom he’s out. 

He kept telling me to visit him in the city he now lives because he doesn’t like coming home and staying with his parents, but I can’t travel right now because I’m busy with my two Masters programs. Last time we chatted on Saturday and I told him I might have a city break next weekend if I am to finish all my projects. He seemed happy about me visiting him after all this time and continued being very lovey dovey. I recently got a cold and he constantly asked me if I felt better, looking like he he actually cared. Told him I was taking a bath and he (you know all that cringey stuff) asked me when we’re taking a bath together, yadda yadda. So I told him I’m eager to have a spa day with him. He then disappeared again. He probably left me on seen (I deactivated my read recipients, but it’s common sense he saw what I said). 
I haven’t  texted him anymore, as I don’t usually double text, but I just feel stupid for thinking about him not even saying goodbye after he initiated contact every day until yesterday. Since I started seeing him again I feel like a teenager who doesn’t know how to act. 

Am I overreacting? It’s not like I expect him to text me all day, all the time, but just say hi and bye instead of ghosting. I’d also feel awkward to literally tell him this, as I don’t wanna sound pushy or clingy. He’s a rather difficult person, but we have this awesome chemistry when we meet and I’d like to have him around, even if it’s once a week or every two weeks. Still, I can’t meet him every other week and act like everything’s cool if we haven’t even texted when we’re apart. Also, it’s not like we’re having quality online convos, it’s more like chit chatting and talking about our daily lives. But I think these count, too. My opinion is that talking daily to someone is bonding, it’s not supposed to be 10 hours convos, even short texts that take a few minutes add up.

Ok...fine. I'm sure there's a good explanation.


The next morning, still no response. So I genuinely thought maybe an emergency came up, so I just texted ""heya. Hope all is ok. 😊"" He responded immediately, saying everything is great and how was I. Now I know there is sometimes controversy around this whole texting thing, but I'm sorry, if you're in the middle of an actual conversation, even via text, there is a way to politely end the conversation without just disappearing, especially if you've taken the time to listen to their voice notes. It's just common courtesy. I would have accepted anything as a reason to end convo. But I'm sorry, I just can't accept that level of rudeness when there's not even a reason. And at the very least, acknowledge that you just bailed on the conversation and offer an apology and/or explanation.


So I told him this morning that we may be looking for different things and that I prefer to spend time chatting with someone who values my time and energy enough to politely end a conversation instead of just randomly disappearing. Then I wished him well in the dating world. I'm sorry, but I have allowed too many things in the past that made me feel wrong and I have paid the price for that. I really don't think that expecting common courtesy is asking too much from anyone, even someone you've only just met. If they're not gonna be courteous in the getting to know you stage, I doubt they'll be courteous once they get into your works more. Anyway, he's texted back but I haven't even opened the text yet.

We both had been single for 5+ years and gave ourself time to work on ourself after we were both cheated on.

We’ve been together for a total of 10 months including a 3 week breakup back in September. She avoids any bit of confrontation and refuses to talk about things that are bothering her or anything that is controversial. This ultimately made us break up the first time. We both held in some things instead of talking about them and she broke it off. We talked periodically during the 3 week span. When we got back together we both said we needed to communicate better and bring things up / talk about things instead of holding them in. Things have been amazing since we got back together or so I thought.

Fast forward to this past Wednesday she told me she; is unhappy and has been for a while, has been fighting a gut feeling that we aren’t a good “fit”, doesn’t feel like she truly makes me happy, said the passion isn’t there, and is worried abound the future due to having to tell me multiple times to drop the conversation when trying to talk about things. She held the things that were bothering her inside instead of talking about them and has now blown up. I believe she is a Fearful Avoidant but shows tendencies of Anxious Preoccupied. 

I have told her I was just trying to talk about things and she said she doesn’t want to argue. We haven’t had an argument or even raised our voices at each other because she avoids talking about things. 

I knew about the gut feeling when we first broke up but she has never mentioned it since. She said she was happy for a while when we got back together but somewhere that changed and she doesn’t know when. She said she put on a mask to hide her true feelings, she’s always done that and even hides them from herself. We were just booking a vacation to Florida from Illinois for next month over Valentine’s Day, making plans for the future, and had an amazing holiday season. 

I enjoy writing poetry but normally keep it all to myself. Well I wrote her some when we first broke up and gave it to her. She loved it. I had since been writing more and wrote one to give her on Valentine’s Day as well as having another in the works to hopefully give her with it. I still want to give it to her but can’t.

I haven’t talked to her since Thursday afternoon and I’m going crazy with all the questions running through my head. Everything could have been resolved if we brought things up and talked about them like we said we would. Why didn’t she? 

We have both said we don’t want to be one of those couples that breaks up and gets back together all the time. She has also said once she makes up her mind it is set. I’m so confused and don’t know what to think or do. I want to talk to her and resolve the issues that all stem from not communicating but know I need to give her space because we didn’t do that before. I absolutely hate not resolving things that can be talked about. Not everything is an argument when you are both capable of having a civil conversation, we have done it before, we sat and talked in person for an hour and a half the first time we broke up. This time she called me. 

I have narcolepsy and struggle with sleep enough as it is and this has made it worse. I’ve gotten maybe a total of 10 hours of sleep in the past 6 days, I have been forcing myself to eat but even then I don’t eat much because it makes me sick, and I’m constantly crying.

I’m divorced got 4 years ago, been on and off the dating apps for almost as long and was not very successful. 
Last October 24 I was on a second date at a vintage car show with a man that I met on online. As an Army Civilian I love to say “Go Army Beat Navy” to perfect strangers which always gets a laugh.
So I’m walking around….checking out the cool old cars, saw a man in front of his ‘32 Deuce Coupe and went into my Go Army Beat Navy routine. He laughed….we started talking and talking and then he asked if I have a clone. I asked why he’d ask that and he replied that he figured I was with the guy I’d been walking around with and if I had a clone he’d ask for her phone number.I told him I wasn’t really feeling it and (pulled up my big girl panties) and asked him to take my number. To make this long story shorter, last night we got engaged!!! After only 3 months you ask? Yep….when you know, you know.

There are two morals to this story, as I see it. First….dreams do come true and karma. I live my life by doing Random Acts of Kindness to friends, strangers, and the soldiers I support at my job on a regular basis. I asked the universe to repay my kindness with a wonderful man and the universe responded.

On new year's eve we had a party where they went missing for a while and when I found them she said nothing happened, but now I know she lied. Because my friend told me they kissed. We also kissed that evening an a later moment.
I don't want my friendship ruined but i also still want to date this girl. But I really don't like that she lied to me. I think she is scared to tell me but I think of myself as really chill dude and so I don't really have a problem that she is making up her mind.

I even though his name because he introduced himself to me. That means it's okay, right?

The only thing that bothers me is, my past/present essentially. I'm almost 29 and have never have never had a boyfriend.

I want to believe that he could possibly be interested in me, but at the same time, why didn't he take it any farther if he was actually interested? I'm not standoffish or closed off.

This reminds me of another guy who also did the same sport as me. We became buddies, but only at the gym. Never outside of it. I didn't like him romantically but I did want to hang out with him outside of the gym as friends. So I asked him what he was doing that weekend and he told me he was going to an amusement park with his girlfriend lmfao. He it's just like the other guy. He was the one who initiated talking to me first. He always said hi to me and always talks to me but at the end of the day he had a girlfriend.

At first, I notice most of us seem to talk quite a bit before the first date. So I'm curious, how much do you all talk with your romantic interest after the first date? I have a second date lined up, she says I'm really sweet and adorable (I like it, I'm not a very mysterious or lumberjack kind of guy). We still talk, but it's not super easy to have conversations other than ""how's work"" or what happened today. I know she wants to check in with each other throughout the day, wants good night and good morning communication (which I like as well). Our general chatting has slowed some. I'm ok with it, I don't think there's a point to forcing conversation. I also think that less talking throughout the week lends to better conversation on the actual dates. I haven't dated in a long time. I just had my divorce finalized and my ex wasn't a very emotionally healthy person. I'm aware that what I think might be needed or normal isn't. For example, I got used to having to compliment my ex on everything. So telling a date everything I like or appreciate about her isn't normal. Thankfully, she's understanding of all that. I thought I'd turn to Reddit to get advice as I learn to navigate the waters of a healthy relationship.

One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother 

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him. Maybe I'm wrong and overreacting.. maybe the love comes back now that he is changed...

Last year my (M42) girlfriend (F34) complained about the flowers I picked up as a nice low-key present while shopping. Not high-end. I had to pay for entertainment all year and took on many fancy trips. Mind you, she's more than broke herself, with little progress for a year. When she didn't get what she wanted, she turned resentful. She's my ex now.

Yesterday I canceled a second date -- I had invited her (F26) over to my place, I was going to cook a nice dinner for us. She happily accepted, though you'd think she'd ask: Can I bring a bottle of wine? Or: Remember, I have a shellfish allergy! No, what she asked for was a car back to pick her up and drop her off after, from across town, because there was snow and she shouldn't have to take the train. No thanks. I stopped taking out women from dating apps for first dates at restaurants. Cocktails only.

Mind you, objectively, the cost shouldn't matter to me. I think this year's tax return will break 7 figures. I'm generous with friends. But this stings, big time. I feel used. The sugarbaby dynamic is an instant boner killer. I want to feel desired and appreciated for something else than my money.

Why can't people be more self-aware and see it before they spring such things on a date they carely know?

Last year my (M42) girlfriend (F34) complained about the flowers I picked up as a nice low-key present while shopping. Not high-end. I had to pay for entertainment all year and took on many fancy trips. Mind you, she's more than broke herself, with little progress for a year. When she didn't get what she wanted, she turned resentful. She's my ex now.

Yesterday I canceled a second date -- I had invited her (F26) over to my place, I was going to cook a nice dinner for us. She happily accepted, though you'd think she'd ask: Can I bring a bottle of wine? Or: Remember, I have a shellfish allergy! No, what she asked for was a car back to pick her up and drop her off after, from across town, because there was snow and she shouldn't have to take the train. No thanks. I stopped taking out women from dating apps for first dates at restaurants. Cocktails only. Yet, I don't want to limit myself to dating doctors (who have to work locally, and a lot) or finance people (whose interests I find .. uninteresting!)

Mind you, objectively, the cost shouldn't matter to me. I'm doing well. I'm generous with friends. But this stings, big time. I feel used. The sugarbaby dynamic is an instant boner killer. I want to feel desired and appreciated for something else than my money.

Scarcity breeds irrational behavior (see NPR on ""How the Scarcity Mindset can Make Problems Worse""), and, strangely, I think it even leads to a sense of entitlement.

Why can't people be more self-aware and see it before they spring such things on a date they barely know?

Do you feel the same? Do you get a kick out of being the ""caretaker"" and being able to bankroll your partner's desire for luxury? Or do you feel used when that happens?

I'm not the best at wording things but I'd really appreciate any and all advice:

My boyfriend (18M) of 7 months and I (18F) have now broken up. The reason being is that I violated his trust. The first time, we got into an argument about a political issue and I didn't want to fight so I ended the call and hung up on him without saying anything. I have a terrible habit of saying things I really don't mean when I'm angry with anybody and I've found it's best if I remove myself from the premises. He let me know how this worried him and how bad it affected him. The second time, we were at his house and things were escalating so I just left his house without any warning. Again, he was torn that I did this and actually cried in front of me for the first time. I realized what I did wrong and for months after that, we never had an issue.

Then yesterday, we got in a stupid argument about politics again since I was talking about it with a friend of mine that is on the opposite side of the political spectrum and just joking around. I then thought it would be funny if I sent a screenshot to him and I thought he wouldn't agree with what my friend was saying but he did. I'm so stupid for what I did next and if I could take it back, I really would: I threatened to break up with him. I did not mean it. I did not realize the implications of my actions. He asked me if I really meant it and he said yes. But about 20 minutes later, I realized how stupid this was and I called him right back apologizing but he had made it clear that he was done with me.

This is the third time I have violated his trust and he doesn't want to get back in a relationship with me because he doesn't want to be hurt again. I completely understand that and I realize how toxic my actions were and how much I hurt him. At the time, I had things I needed to talk to him about that were bothering me: he would often make condescending comments at my conversation skills and at times, it did feel like he thought he was academically superior to me (we're in different math classes and he usually better grades than I do) but he's told me that we're not competition. And i talked to him about the condescending comments he made, and he apologized for hurting me.

All I've asked him is for one chance for me to prove myself to him. In the past, I've tried to get better at all the things I did that bothered him: I'm getting better at not procrastinating on assignments, and working on my social skills, and trying to stop some bad habits of mine like chewing my nails, etc. He's noticed improvement on these issues. I've realized what I lost and how badly I affected him. I just want one chance to make this relationship still work. As of now, I can't stop crying and I can't stop contacting him (I had to block him because I couldn't stop messaging him) and I know he's had it with me now. Is there anything at alll I can do to make this better?

This is also my first relationship. He was my first kiss and this was the first time i've ever truly felt like I like someone. I've never felt so torn and hurt before and all I want to do is go to his house and make it better somehow.

Saturday morning I matched a cute girl on bumble and started to chat with all throughout the afternoon, we exchanged a couple a picture of ourselves over whatsapp and she asked me what were my plans for tonight, I said I was just planning to chill at my place because I was tired from the week I had and she asked of she could come along. I said yes set a time then went doing so shit I had to do with a friend.

She came and we started to talk about everything what we were doing in our life what we liked, I tell her some funny stories I had and we started to eat and drink together. She came closer and closer to me and at one point she just came on my chest to put her head. I cuddle her a bit then I proceeded to kiss her and we kissed for a good amount of time then went in my room.
Obviously we started to get naked and do the starter but at one point I just realize I didn't had condoms 😅.

For the little story I got dumped by my ex of 5 years and yeah obviously we weren't using condoms anymore and I didn't knew she was going to want to hook up with me on first date so I didn't even consider checking if I had some.

So I just told to her that I didn't have condoms so I couldn't have sex, I started to feel a bit cringy and I laught about it, she seems a bit frustrated but you know she didn't wanted to have sex without neither (which I totally understand). She also was a bit surprised that I didn't have but I wasn't just expecting to hook up on first date, my mistake I guess 🤷🏻 + I didn't need them because I was in a long term committed relationship 4months before lol. 
So I tried to find a place to buy real quick but didn't find obviously, we kissed a bit and cuddle in the bed but then we decided to stop it for tonight, so we go dressed up and I escorted her back to her car, she kissed me on the mouth and we said goodbye 😅.

I was quite cringing and I expected that she block me but she just texted me that she got back home and a little joke about her flu (she had flu and said that she hope I didn't catch it at least), I just said it was still worth it and that despite my stupid mistake I had a great time and that she was beautiful. She thank me for the evening and we said goodnight.

Ysterday I didn't texted her because I was busy with the sports training and today with my job, I would like to see her again (and this time don't make that mistake) but I don't know what I should say because I feel like I screwed it up and maybe I should just walk away.

A little bit background:

We had a history together, i first got to know her in 2018, and we could've been a couple but i rejected her back then. Later that year she got together with her now ex-boyfriend. In 2019 she texted me bc it was so good talking to me back in 2018, or at least that was the answear she gave me. I ended up in the friendzone i think bc i hit her when she had a boyfriend. I'm not proud of what i did. After that we haven't spoken since 2021 december and i texted her bc i saw that she's not with her boyfriend anymore. Her response was great, said that we should meet up and talk about things. We did just that everything went well, nothing serious happened on the first date, but on the second date we kissed, she was all over me after the kiss, and i hold her hands too. She said she can feel something for me.

Everything was so good until after the night of the first kiss. She became somewhat cold to me through text, wasn't picking up any of my flirting attempts. It was weird but i thought that she's testing me or just playing mind games. We went to our third meeting. She hugged me, i was waiting for a kiss in the beggining nothing like that happened. When i tried to hold her hands she pulled away hers, even though i was smooth. But she had her arm cross my, she hold upper arm like that. At the end of the day she wasn't looking at me in the same way she did before, behaved completely different. Colder. I said to her that she should hold my hand, and she said it's too much to her rn. So we parted ways without setting up a next date, or even kissing. She just hugged me with one arm. 

I started to love this girl, and it hurts me a bit bc i don't know what went wrong. I wasn't needy, i was confident, i flirted with her, physically escalated. We kissed.

I know its probalby over for good, and i'm quite sad because of that, i felt like she's just like me, often times we said the same things at once.

After the third meeting i was quite heartbroken i decided i'll try to move on, she texted me after this meetup and i was sad but didn't wanted to become needy and helpless for her, so i pulled back almost all of my attention from her texts. But she texted me again. 

I feel like that she said to me that holding my hands is too much for her, but the week before she was all over me after kissing, is kind of like a rejection.

But why does this guy have such a hold over me? I even went so far as to delete social media bc I realized I was just posting for him to see and only opening the app to get a glimpse of his life that apparently, I want so badly to be a part of. The worst part is, I barely know him. We had one conversation. I think my brain has just filled in the blanks as to who this guy really is and turned him into this dream man in my head.

I'm sorry but I feel the details are important. 

TL;DR -Have a 3rd date with a guy at his place. I have totally innocent intentions and I think he does too, but I feel I should text him beforehand and let him know my expectations for the date and that this will not end in us having sex.

I (late 20's F) met this (late 20's) guy on one of the apps. We've had 2 dates so far (first was a coffee date that lasted 2 hrs and 2nd was at a bar that lasted 3 hours, one date a week). I really like him, I think he's cute, we have stuff in common, we laugh, we flirt. We don't text very much (something else I find a little strange because I'd like to text more but I realize not everyone's a texter). He took the initiative and held my hand on the second date, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to kiss me at the end of that date, but I may have inadvertently blocked him by not reading the cues, which I didn't realize until the next day. I'm a little awkward because I don't have much dating experience. I've been on the app 2 yrs on and off, and this is the first guy that I can see myself progressing into something with. I'm looking for a serious relationship.
Anyway, I like to be honest and I don't like to be vague. I sent him the after date text after our second date and let him know I like him and that I'd like to see him again soon. He reciprocated and said we should hang out again and suggested this week. He and I have hobbies that we're interested in, but are awkward to do in public (I don't  want to be specific for the slim chance he sees this), so on the second date we said that I could come over to his place (I know where he lives, he doesn't know where I live) and do these things together. I saw no ""ill-intent"" in his words and I agreed that would be the best option for what we wanted to do. I took it as a completely innocent suggestion. So when he said to hang out, I asked what we should do (I threw out two suggestions, one being the hobbies) and he suggested we do our hobbies. I said ""at your place, I'm assuming"" and he responded that was fine. Now I'm worried that he might be expecting something else from this. I don't do hookups and this would only be the 3rd date, way too soon in my view to sleep together. I'm okay with kissing (honestly I want to and I'm kinda expecting it) but that's it. I've seen a lot of Reddit comments about how going over to someone's place suggests sex, which I don't agree with. I'm not going to be staying there for that long (I have a hard out by 10:00pm). I don't know if in my flirting I may have suggested I was DTF and I haven't noticed. 
So basically, the question is: should I text him and let him know my expectations for this meeting up?  That this is just a date and I'm NOT going to hook up with him? That I'm looking for something serious and for it to build slowly (we haven't talked about what we're looking for yet, but it's in my profile)? Or I go and see how it plays out, and see if he starts leading toward sex and then tell him what I want? Or should I just not go to his place at all, back track and suggest a different activity (and if I do that should I give him the reason for why I'm doing it)?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153215,public,self,Should I text this guy my expectations for our 3rd date?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s68y0m/should_i_text_this_guy_my_expectations_for_our/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Wanted to hear men’s experiences with dating in the DC area and/or Texas (specifically Houston or Dallas, but any part is fine). I’m [23M] from and have lived in the DMV area (DC-Maryland-Virginia) all my life, so I’ve got, while very limited (started going out to bars last year), some experience. From what I have experienced, women in the DC area can be pretty unapproachable and if I do muster up the nerve to approach them, they have a condescending attitude and/or can be cold. A lot of the women in the DC area are college educated and a good amount are pursuing post graduate degrees. However, it seems like because of this, they tend to turn their nose up to me until I reveal to them that I am a college graduate with a career in IT. Even then, despite having a seemingly good conversation (based o them breaking the physical touch barrier and other body language) the interaction never really goes past the bar and if I do manage to get the number, it rarely ever results in hanging out or the text exchange doesn’t last long enough (stop texting back) for me to get to the point where I can schedule a date. Ultimately, I think a lot of DMV (DC-Maryland-Virginia) women tend to have much higher standards than women in other areas of the US.

I (30F) am a sex-positive lady and I believe that you can have a solid relationship with someone even if you sext before meeting them, or if you hook up on the first date.

When we first met it was an odd interaction because she physically cannot speak due to a birth defect so she resorts to texting or TTS since I don’t know ASL.

She piqued my interest cause she is energetic, nerdy, plays games, and plays like 7 different instruments. She seems really cool and I wanna get to know her more so we had good conversations for about 2 days. Then it’s almost as if she forgot about me. It’s been a week and I get one word responses, as she has been with her friends.

I wanna find out if I really like her and get to know her.
