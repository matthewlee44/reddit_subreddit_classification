0,mhe2ie,1617219994,Not able to get over the guy I made out with a few times,"I (22F) had met a guy (24M) in November in campus and he turned out to be this man of my dreams. We spent a lot of time with each other as he was my neighbour. We would stay up till 4am on the terrace, under the stars and I fell head over heels. I confessed to him a month later and that night he was flustered and said he would take me out on a date. 
But the next day, he retreated and told me he had a breakup just 3 months back and that he needs to work on himself before entering the dating game. He shared a childhood trauma story with me and said ""I really like you but I need to work on myself"". I was okay and we remained good friends fast forward 5 days later when we were alone eating icecream, had amazing chemistry and kissed. We made out 7 hours straight, cuddled and I felt amazing. I thought this is it. We made out 2 times over a series of 10 days again but he was not on the same page and didn't want to date me. I was a complete mess as I was attached after we had made love though we hadn't had sex. 
Things were awkward though we would still spend a lot of time together everyday. 
Fast forward in February, he met his ex for the first time after breakup and I happened to mention to him that I still liked him. The next day, he decided to take me out on a date which was the most amazing date I had ever had. Before we kissed, I asked him multiple times if he was sure about it and that I wouldn't want to wake up to him feeling differently like in December again. He said he was sure. We kissed like a couple in love. I sat on his lap. We kissed like lovers. It was beautiful and I melted into a pool of beautiful mess. I was in love. 
He kept to his word and kissed me on my forehead the next morning and everythinggggg seemed perfect until his ex called him that night and broke down, begging him to get back together with her. He couldn't bear the idea of her being that sad, breaking down and pining for him while he was happy with me and told me that he cannot give me the way he gave her. I patiently listened to him and said, ""I don't mind being in this mess with you as long as you are sure about me"" for which he didn't answer. 
Over the next few days, we were still hanging on, I cared deeply about him, we would kiss, hug, he would kiss my forehead and one night, we made out all night, I slept with my head on his chest, we cuddled and slow danced to John Mayer's music. I had fallen so so hard for him that night. 

The next morning he sends me a message that he doesn't want to be a sinking ship that would drag me down and says he cannot get into this wholeheartedly as she was still calling him everyday, crying, breaking down, asking him to get back with her. 

I was left feeling heartbroken, confused and devastated. I had asked him several times if he was sure about it before getting physical with me. 

March was a dreadful month for me as he was right downstairs but I couldn't touch him, couldn't give him all the love I had for him. His birthday was on March 22nd and I did everything in my capacity to celebrate him which is a seperate reddit post I had written which I will share in comments. 

We are now back to our respective homes, away from each other but I am heartbroken and I'm unable to accept the idea that we won't be together. We have an amazing chemistry and I have gotten extremely vulnerable to him, told each other our childhood stories, trauma, happiness. I love him with all my heart and I don't understand how to move on from this episode.

I'd meet cool people and even if it didn't lead to anything more I'd make some friends at the very least. Now I haven't met anyone online in almost two years. The conversations fade quicker.

I can't even say hi without the guy instantly asking me to cuddle or complimenting me every sentence. I just wanna be treated like a human and get to know them but everyone is in a rush or they just got divorced or their partner broke up with them yesterday and they haven't healed and wanna bring that baggage into MY life.

My boyfriend 20M and I 18F were casually having a conversation a couple nights ago and as we spoke about something about relationships ...he said something along the lines of "" I'm a very experienced person and you are still learning"". So the context is that, I am his 5th partner and he is my very first boyfriend. What he meant was that he has seen this lovey dovey/honeymoon phase in all his previous relationship and is used to it....but to me it's still very new. We've been dating since almost 2 months now. 

What bothers me is that.. he's had 4 partners before me and sometimes I feel like he says the same things to me that he's said to his prior partners. I feel like he knows what to tell me in order to make me feel loved and that he doesn't really mean it. I mean imagine you say the same thing to 4 people and when it comes to the 5th one... You just say it for the sake of It... because eventually you get tired right? He is really goofy and cheesy with me...he'll say things like you're mine....you make me so happy etc etc. I don't know if he actually means them or this is just another relationship for him.  I don't know if I'm more attached to him than he is to me Now I don't know why I'm feeling what I'm feeling right now. 

I don't want to talk to him about this because then he'll feel like I'm doubting his intentions and I don't want him to feel like that because he really does strive to keep me happy. He's really amazing.  Honestly, I feel like I'm overthinking this...but I just need another opinion on this tbh. I did talk to him...I asked him if his exes had told him things that I tell him(I tell him things I genuinely mean. What I feel for him....this is my first relationship and I am really attached to him) he told me that they hadn't ever told him things like I did and that I'm special. He really tries hard to make me feel better about his past. It doesn't bother me a lot per se...but it's all small small things like these. 

I'd like to know if I've the only one who's felt like this.. is there anything I could do about it? Feel free to ask any questions. Thankyou

TLDR-; I feel like my boyfriend tells me the same things he used to tell his previous partners and it bothers me. He's a great guy and really keeps me happy though.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mher56/need_advice/

I have never had a close male friend, since I was a kid, that didn't try to get with me. I've had male acquaintances, male friends from my friend group that I sometimes hung out with, but never was there a guy I consistently hung out with one on one that it was simply a friendship. I feel like the only time a guy is genuinely nice, to me, beyond politeness, is if he wants to date me, and I have some trust issues over this now because usually guys I know are either dismissive or just straight up assholes, but if any of them ever wanna hang out a lot as friends they always end up revealing to me that they like me.

I‚Äôve been working on myself and went through some therapy etc. I‚Äôm at a good place in life but I have swung to the extreme side of independence as a trauma response to this relationship and I am aware if I live like this forever I will truly end up alone. 
All humans needs connection and I see friends etc in healthy relationships and although I have a full life - I think it would be nice to be in something like this at some point. I‚Äôm in no rush and I‚Äôm very cautious with dating. 
Tried online dating but I‚Äôve had a bit of a shock at the disrespect and hookup culture whereas I‚Äôm looking to take it slow. 
I tend to run away from commitment and have been working on this issue. Recently started talking to a guy online who I clicked with on a couple of dates and initially he seemed very interested and was the one instigating messaging. I slowly warmed up to the idea of possibility seeing where things went but I always get such anxiety at this point. 
Coincidentally I had to go out of town for work for a couple of weeks which in some ways is disappointing as it stalls the connection but I couldn‚Äôt help but have a sigh of relief that I‚Äôd get a couple of weeks just to take it in and deal with my emotions. 
I messaged to say what the situation was with work and mentioned I like to go slow and when I‚Äôm back if he wanted to do something together I can get in touch when back. He responded well and said yeah sure I‚Äôd like to do that. 
Alls well and good but a few days into my trip I messaged him to do a FaceTime to which he said he was too tired but I could tell he was a bit more dry in messaging than usual. Had a snoop on his social media and noticed that he is following and liking a new girls pics that I can only assume he met on the app during these covid times. 
I know he is a free agent and can date who he wants but I just feel really conflicted about the situation now and wondering if it‚Äôs worth even getting in contact at all when I‚Äôm back. 
I thought I‚Äôd dealt with a lot of trust issues etc but tbh I‚Äôve not been able to really test them as I‚Äôve stayed single and celibate by choice the last 2 years. 
I already feel so anxious about it all and just want to disappear into the night and forget about it. I find this is becoming a pattern where I give up straight away with any feelings of discomfort.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhfo6l/feeling_down_about_dating/

21,mhg559,1617225896,Dating office colleague,"Hi strangers,

So, I have this weird situation going on and I wanted to get some advice just to make sure I don't rush and do something bad!

I (28M) supervise a graduate (23F) that joined us 6 months ago or so. I just want to note that I don't do her appraisals or anything like that, I just review her work and allocate what tasks she is supposed to be doing. We worked from home all this time but during our WFH time, we discussed about our past relationship with our exes, about marriage and kids and stuff, all of that on MS teams. She knows I broke up recently with my girlfriend and she told me she broke a month ago with her boyfriend, as well. 

We went back to the office recently and the past few days we have been having lunch together, just the two of us sitting on a bench, without the rest of the team (the whole team usually goes together for lunch but her and I just go earlier than the rest). On our latest lunch, I felt that she was trying to get to know me better like asking me about my home country, family and stuff, and the conversation still went to the idea of how she wants to get married and have kids and stuff which I am all up for later down the line by the way (I told her that as well). 

So long story, short we have discussed dating lives, marriage, kids, family and some other stuff like hobbies and interests. Don't get me wrong, I am attracted to her but I just wanted to get some advice on this, since making a move given the current circumstances, comes with big risks.

I met a girl (27) online last June and we started dating not long after in July 2020. She's an INFJ (I - OP, 27M, am an ESTJ), sensitive, intellectual, empathetic and I thought we are a good match. Things are going well for a few months as in the UK COVID19 lockdown was eased during the summer and autumn. We spent sometime living together 3 months into our relationship, making a support bubble during the last lockdown (since October). At that point, so far things are quite good from my point of view, we're on the same intellectual level, she's interested in my culture and life stories, and we both have ambitious career plans. Since we're living together we figured out each other's life patterns and habits too and they're quite compatible. But I'm not originally from the UK so had to go back to where I'm from (12 hours away) in Dec 2020, after spending most days and nights together during lockdown. And that's when the problem starts.

Since we are 8 hours apart in time zone, it's difficult to keep up with daily communication and video calls. I was busy with family business and other plans as I only get to be 'home' once a year (1 month max). 2 weeks after I parted with GF she sent me messages about how sad she is that I am not physically with her and that she thought 'she deserved better'. I immediately rectified by calling her more often and playing mini games with her daily. We spent almost 30 mins-1 hour on phone/ playing games. Time proved that these were not enough as GF is a tactile person and enjoys physical affection (being able to hug and rest on my shoulder etc) more than just talking. She was sending me discouraging messages quite a lot towards to end of my stay away from the UK and I honest thought that might be it.

Luckily I got back to the UK in time to save the relationship - everything was fine again as I spent the last lockdown (Jan-Mar) living with her again. But now that things are opening up, I've been called for a residential duty at work and won't be able to see her for 4 weeks (UK hasn't completely eased lockdown yet in Mar 2021). She shut me down again (tbf she's on her period and just had her COVID jab, so not in a good mood/ is feeling ill from side effects) for a few hours, only to send me an email telling me to limit all our communication with her on email as she needs to rethink about the future. She said ""I had a really bad time when you were away in December and January and I don‚Äôt know if I can go through that again. ... I can‚Äôt stand and wait at the gate anymore, or for a phone call.""

She seems to have separation issues and very anxious about the future. I've been trying so hard these few months to keep this relationship going, by reassuring her that things will be fine - things are well when we're together but it worries me that it's not going to work when we're away from each other? There has been times that I've not paid enough attention to her during a day when we're not physically together (e.g. when I'm working) and she grieved that I was not there for her when she needs me (she had a bad day at work) ...

**My question is - how viable is our relationship?**

Sorry for the long post, willing to give more details if needed, I just want some advice on what I should do and maybe some encouragement to keep this going. Thanks in advance!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhgluk/how_whether_to_go_ahead_with_infj_gf_27_who_might/

Last week a co-worker who knows I've always been single and knows me really well gave me her daughter's number. Since then her daughter and I talk every day. On Saturday we went out for ice cream and mini golf and had a nice time together.

She's very quiet. I can be like that too. We're both a bit shy. She's very pretty and short, which is really cute. She's not big on sports and neither am I. That's good. I'm a hardcore nerd. Not sure about her. I just know that she hates her job and spends her free time watching TV. I like my job and spend my free time playing video games. So we're pretty similar. The only thing I hate is that she wants me to make every decision for us. I hope it's not because I'm a man. I'm not like that (aside from paying for dates).

After the call we texted about how we should meet up when he returns to the area (he went on vacation following the call) and he expressed a lot of interest in seeing me again. I texted telling him that I'd be open to having another video call within the next few days and he replied that he would be interested in that. After that, silence. He didn't reach out again and I figured he would if he was really interested, so neither did I. Does this happen to anybody else?

29,mhgqhn,1617227682,What's up with dating coaches married to ugly girls ?,"I started gaming two years back &amp; my lay count is 99 (from daygame, nightgame &amp; online game). After reading MM &amp; Attraction Forumula, I started applying those principles and was getting better with practice. I was simultaneously watching pua channels from time to time and applying new stuffs.

Recently I watched John Anthony's video on dating coaches with ugly girls and was shocked to find most of the PUA coaches are married or have  average looking gfs incl Brad Branson, Julien, Max &amp; Todd. Some of these chicks I wouldn't even consider banging even if I was drink.

Unlike these guys I don't do it full-time. I lift weights, do mma, lead a sales team of 11, learnt piano and copywriting skills last year, run a farming business traveled to India &amp; US, made my first million last year and I'm just 25. 

Most of my lays are 8s &amp; 9s which is because I'm in Russia. And I've 4 rotation chicks. But none of this is to brag! I only consider myself an intermediate.

I watched Julien's PIMP during my travel time last year which massively leveled up my game. Until then I didn't think daytime pulls, having sex in airport restrooms, shopping mall, pulling em back to your car or going back to her place were even possible. My game is also quite similar to him.

35,mhh6rf,1617229054,Am I Overthinking This Particular Situation or Is My Assumption Right?,"I honestly don't know how you meet anyone now and days, let alone during a pandemic, especially when my intentions is always to start off as friends first but still being interested.

Last week on a Monday, I met 2 guys in a cafe during my time staying in (since my city/state allows indoor dining now). One of them was the sole barista of the place. He seemed very nice and is very like Chatty Kathy (in which I like when guys talk a lot, as opposed to some not and suppressing their feelings). He even gave me a free drink (and cafe drinks are expensive). And the other guy was his friend, in which I really wasn't into but he was also a conversationalist (which again I appreciate when any guy takes the time to speak &amp; open up about certain things). 

I honestly don't know what happened or went wrong with this (if I said too much about myself about the COVID situation, said to the barista's friend that he had my father's name or b/c I didn't want to really disclose my current work situation or where I had to go suddenly that I unfortunately had to end our convo) but I asked for the guys' number. Well, I gave the barista my number via the paper you need to full out whenever you stay in and dine in case COVID was spread there but I did ask the other guy's number and texted him immediately, hoping we can be friends and so I wouldn't forget the guy in general as I had to go. 

So the barista's friend NEVER texts me back EVER. Even when I waited 3 days later, making sure it wasn't a mistake and said in the text this is so and so from cafe name. The barista himself did text me but he texted me after 10 PM and I was sleeping at the time. When I woke up, I texted him saying I was sleeping at the time he texted me. No answer from him after that until I decide to text him again 3 days later. He texted back &amp; wanted me to come to the other cafe location where he would be at that weekend but also said he would be busy. So I thought to myself, what would be the point in going, even if I was available but he wouldn't be? I don't like to use ppl for free drinks or whatever. 

I told the barista in text that I wouldn't make any promises and that I would try to come. Then I mentioned why his friend never texted me back and then dead silence from the barista soon after. I waited about 3-4 hours later and texted the barista, ""Did I say something wrong earlier?"". Barista texted back (my last text from him ever) saying, ""Not at all! But I am with another friend atm"". I figured it wasn't worth me ""chasing"" after this fellow honestly but bothers me that guys can be like this. 

So I told the Barista via text that I was going to bed now and that he can text me whenever. This week on the Monday we met, I do go to the cafe during the last 30 mins before closing to see how the barista would respond to me (because I did kind of confront him (nicely) and his friend for basically ghosting me when we had such a great conversation). Barista guy gave me a BS excuse that he was busy and I said really? He was also timid and distracted by me (when he fucked up MY drink, of course). And yeah, we haven't spoken further and when the barista was closing, he told me ""nice seeing you again"" and I haven't texted him nor has he texted me since, even when I told him again to text me whenever. 

Now, I know he is not interested, nor his friend in just being friends with me. But yeah, what do you think what happened? Is it truly my fault?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhh6rf/am_i_overthinking_this_particular_situation_or_is/

He had a really big crush on this girl he went to school with. He asked her out and she responded with a ""I'll think about it"". 

I'm not sure if any of you seen my previous posts on this subreddit that I deleted but I hate it when girls or women don't give a straightforward no. 

She didn't get back to him which is fine, I guess it was a no. He told his ""bestfriend"" about it and it was all cool. Not even a week later, the crush and his bestfriend starts dating. 

So, here's my perspective. I think its completely fucked up that the bestfriend started dating this girl. Who asked who out? I don't know. It doesn't matter because no matter what, it's still fucked up and I don't know why but every friend I still talk to, have been back stabbed in this exact same scenario and I wish it'll stop. For some reason, some people don't get this. You're not a bad person for doing this, you're just a bad friend.

It‚Äôs been hard, and I‚Äôm in therapy sorting through all this. But I have panic attacks and I freeze up and I was hospitalized twice for suicide attempts in 2018. 

I deleted all online dating apps because it was making me miserable and that was where 2 of my sexual assaults came from. 

Recently, I figured out I have a small crush on a guy I coach with who is 4.5 years older than me, which I know at my age isn‚Äôt a big difference. 

In the past when this has happened, I‚Äôve found every excuse in the book as to why I shouldn‚Äôt have feelings for a guy, or that I‚Äôm ‚Äúbad‚Äù for liking them. Or I jump on Tinder to find someone for casual hookups 

But now with this guy, my thoughts have turned into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bad for liking this guy. It‚Äôs okay that I feel this way.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve also tried to set a better example for my little sisters, and my thought process literally turned into ‚ÄúA good role model wouldn‚Äôt back away from this. A good role model would acknowledge their feelings and say even though there‚Äôs an age difference, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù 

These thoughts have just been naturally popping into my head with this guy. Not even one year ago was that the case.

60,mhjbyt,1617236047,"Met Cute Guy, Not Sure How to Proceed","Basically the title.  A month ago I met a really cute guy over a Google hangouts social for a work program I‚Äôm in, and we got to talk for a few minutes and I think we got along together really well.  I met with him again one on one yesterday on video chat because my boss suggested I reach out to him for feedback (work related minutia), but anyways I reached out and he agreed to video call yesterday and WOW. 

I enter the call and my heart just stops, he‚Äôs so much hotter than I remember lmfao.  So I‚Äôm blushing and stuff and we started talking about a plant I have in the background and then we finally got to professional stuff.  I mentioned I might be in his area next week visiting family (coincidentally near the office he is stationed in) and he got very quiet and asked a bit about my plans and said he would recommend me a few places near the office that he likes.  Then we ended the call because our 30 minutes were up. 

Basically, I haven‚Äôt enjoyed talking to someone this much in a long time and I haven‚Äôt had such a jaw dropping moment either.  What should I do?  Is there hope for this to go anywhere at all?  I‚Äôll likely be relocating to where he is over the summer, so would it be appropriate to shelf things and think back at that time?  It‚Äôs also important to note that though we are technically colleagues, the specifics of the profession wouldn‚Äôt prohibit anything going on between us, so that‚Äôs not the problem.  My problem is that he hasn‚Äôt indicated that he would like to talk further outside of work (the first time we talked he did say he wanted to learn more about me, but the second time he seemed rushed to end our meeting).  People would consider me to be a relatively attractive girl, particularly in my profession, but I still feel really insecure and just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs into me, but then we get along really well.

We would spend almost every night at each other‚Äôs place and were basically following through with all the motions of being in a relationship just without the title... 

I got fed up and gave him an ultimatum sometime later that year (ikik not the smartest thing to do) and finally we put a label on it... which only lasted so long. Three months later we broke up and for a multitude of reasons. We took time away from each other and decided that it was best if we just didn‚Äôt see each other for some time. However, when we returned to school that fall, it was inevitable that we were going to talk since all our friend groups were intertwined and soon we began to build our friendship again and come to the same question before: what were we? 

He tells me he loves me and that he can see a future with me and that he hopes were endgame, but he still can‚Äôt commit to a relationship.

I met this sweet girl on tinder, my age, into videogames, real shy. Talked to her every day, hung out each time she was on lunch. Im in the military and go out to sea every few months so time in port was nearly a vacation when the boat was gone with the other crew. 

Anyways fast forward 2 months and I go out to sea, email her frequently, call her when we stopped into port for maintenance. While I'm gone for about 4 months she gets a boyfriend, does not tell me this. When I get back, she's excited, bright eyed when I go to see her. We continue where we left off except more frequent, I see her every day after she gets off work for about an hour or 2. We start getting a little more intimate, so eventually I ask if we could be in a relationship, and she tells me she's not ready at this point in her life. I say ok, and we just keep being friends with generous benefits (I have not slept with her, but we've been intimate). 

Fast forward 2 months, and one day she has a terrible migraine at work. Being a good guy, I pick her up from work because she asked me and she took a nap on my shoulder in my bed. Next day I get an xbox message from the boyfriend, saying thankyou for taking her home. I'm stunned, and begin freaking out and telling him she's cheating on him. He's barely phased but says they're working it out and communication will see them through. 

Im fucking pissed. 

I try fighting for her, she tells me she loves me and everything about me, but the boyfriend keeps telling me all this stuff they do together (sex and stuff) and I'm getting furious every passing day. She won't make the decision between us, until today. The boyfriend has her block me and I'm told to never contact her again. The boyfriend sends a picture of my house to me, probably because he tracks her phone. He told me this. So now I'm back to being on unsuccessful dating apps, losing the girl of my dreams because she couldn't tell me the truth or stand up to him.

69,mhk104,1617238464,Getting old and don't know how to date. What resources can I use to learn?,"I am 26M and you've guessed it - I have never dated. I think I am okay in general, to some extent. I am confident about my looks, I take care of my hygiene, I work out. I am well educated, I have a good job. Nevertheless, I have one major problem: I have never dated and the lack of experience makes me feel very insecure. The older I get, the more insecure I feel. It's like a vicious cycle. Other 26 year old guys probably feel about dating like I do about eating breakfast. And women around my age probably have dated before and have some expectations from guys. With zero experience, I don't know what those expectations are. I don't know how to behave. And I choose the easiest way out: I stay away from dating, which leads to me having zero experience and restarting the cycle. The only problem is that there is one thing that does not reset: my age. I am getting older and abstaining from dating clearly works against me in the long run. Guys around my age have on average a lot of experience. Heck, even many 15 year olds have more experience than me!

So my question is, what can I do to improve? Of course the best way would be to go out there and date, but I cannot get myself to do that. I want some way to practice and evaluate myself before I put myself out there, at least so that I have some rational expectations. Think of it like taking an exam. I never passed an exam by taking it and failing until I got so experienced at taking it that I passed. I first learned the material, then I somehow evaluated myself, then only when I felt confident that I could pass, I took the real exam. That is how I see dating as well. I need some resources that will allow me to learn dating in theory before I go and try it out there. What can I do to learn? Youtube videos? Books? Online roleplaying?

I've been in in two relationships prior, lasting about a year each. I have high self confidence, though I'm not very confident with women (I have social anxiety on its own, and talking to women is harder than talking to guys).

Anyway, I met this girl through tinder about a month ago. She seemed really funny so I gave her my snap, and asked her on a date a few days later, she said yes, but had to cancel that week due to schoolwork. We got coffee the next weekend, and she was, in fact, funny.  And just as pretty as I thought. We stayed there and talked for 5 hours. I decided I wanted to keep pursuing, especially after she said she had a fun time, so I asked her out for the following weekend. 

That weekend, we just sat on the green on campus and talked for another 7 hours. After this, I really fell for her. Obviously I don't completely know her, but I think its more than fair to say I'm crushing on her hard. Being my awkward self, I hugged her for the first time once we parted ways that night. 

But to the main issue, I find that my mood is too dependent on the frequency of her snapchat responses. I get kind of sad when I don't get a snap from her in a while, and I definitely get too happy when I see that she sent me a snap. I'm just really into her and I want her to be into me, as well.

So I started talking to this girl in my uni. I've only known her about two weeks. I think I reached out to her for some music-related stuff at first, we actually met up for a coffee last week because I offered to lend my guitar to her. That day I just casually took her out to somewhere artsy and we had a lot of fun. 3 to 4 days later, we went to see a movie and walked around holding hands. Which made me so anxious to the point it made me feel nauseous haha. It was a good time though. That night I told her we should go out on an actual date maybe next weekend, which she agreed to.

Now, I must admit she's been on my mind until then so I want to ask her to spend some time with me THIS weekend just to get some coffee and chat. I'm not too sure if I'm taking her out too much though. 

So here are my main questions:

Is there ever a point where I have to restrain myself to spend time with her?  

I met this girl for only two weeks, but I find myself wanting to ask her to be my girlfriend some time soon. Is this really necessary? are my feelings rushed?

I always have this fear that it‚Äôs gonna end bc they‚Äôre bored of me, don‚Äôt like me anymore, lose interest etc. In my last relationship I sort of just stopped talking to her slowly and I thought she didn‚Äôt like me anymore and we sort of just stopped taking. We talked everyday for like 2-3 months and she just sort of lost interest or I honestly don‚Äôt know what exactly happened.

And with the girl I‚Äôm seeing right now I actually went on a date a year ago and then I thought she didn‚Äôt like me (that she didn‚Äôt want to go out again), so I just never asked her out again and started acting weird around her and idk what happened but we stopped talking.

She‚Äôs not a big texter and has said that before and she‚Äôs called me once before, but she said she wanted to call me today just to talk which was nice. Anyways, we talk until I get to work and I asked her when she wanted to hangout but she said she has strep throat so she might not be able to.

Idk why but my mind automatically goes to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs using strep throat as an excuse, she‚Äôs trying not to hangout with you,‚Äù and I just get insecure and I was a little bit frustrated in the moment. Even though she said that she‚Äôs still willing to hangout and make plans depending on how she feels, my mind was like dude she doesn‚Äôt like you, like why are you even talking to her anymore. And then I‚Äôm like what if she‚Äôs seeing somebody else, what if I‚Äôm not even her first option, what if I‚Äôm just being played and all that stuff.

89,mhmt9e,1617248454,Is it normal for someone to ghost? (Context provided below),"So I met a great guy a few weeks ago. We hit it off. He asked for my number through a friend and asked me out on a date. He text me every day (he text first!) and we chatted on the phone for hours on end. We went out on our date, had constant continuous conversation and had a wonderful time. He paid for the date, lunch, a concert we went to. Everything went perfectly. He even held my hand and called me pretty numerous times. But then, out of the blue, i went home after the date to see a text from him.  He said: he's not nearly ready for a relationship, we live too far away but i'm a 'beautiful person' with a 'heart of gold' but he's just not right for me. I text him back saying basically, fair enough thats ok, wish you well etc. But I sent another text to touch base a week later: ""Hey hope you're keeping well. Was just wondering if you liked the gift i gave you? Have you had a chance to open it? "" I gave him a gift during our date fyi. But no reply for two weeks now. Has he blocked me or is just ghosting me? I just want a friendship now but he probs doesn't?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Went on a seemingly perfect date, he text saying not into a relationship, he is now ghosting me. Is this normal?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhmt9e/is_it_normal_for_someone_to_ghost_context/
90,mhmtpa,1617248503,Is he too into me/obsessed or is it just me? Help,"So I 24(f) am not super experienced with dating or relationships and usually have bad luck with men. Slightly more than a week ago I matched with someone and we hit it off immediately, lots of talking, at first glance seemed too good to be true, hit all the check boxes. We met on Saturday, I thought it was good, but I'm also questioning whether that was the alcohol  talking (I also had to leave in emergency bc asthma issues and I didn't have my inhaler).

Idk he comes off too strong, it feels like he idolizes me and puts me on this pedestal, keeps telling me how amazing I am, that I'm the perfect woman and keeps asking if it's weird that he likes talking to me so much. I hint at needing some space but he's not so receptive to that.

I can appreciate that he's into me but we really don't know each other that well so it seems a bit weird that he's this infatuated or invested after one date, is already talking about us doing things in the future, etc. 

I don't want to use sound narcissistic and say he's obsessed but that's kind of the vibes I'm getting, I'm gonna let him know that I'm planning on moving to korea in August, but I'm also worried that he's gonna be like ""that's ok we can do long distance no problem"" or ""maybe I'll apply to teach there too"", at this stage it's way too much.

93,mhn1qh,1617249378,The Slow Fade,"Been on a couple dates with a girl I felt I really clicked with. First one in quite a while.

Last few days, I feel like she's still interested, but the Slow Fade has begun. She'll respond if I text and engage, but I can tell it's one-sided at this point and slowing.

What's your strategy for handling this when it pops up?

Several Options:

1. Slow yourself, and leave it up to them to re-engage or drop out.
2. Confront with a diplomatic message. ""Hey, noticed things have slowed a bit.... Lets chat.""
3. Continue driving interactions in hopes they come around, or to keep yourself in the running.
4. Mutual Ghosting...
5. Other?

I personally don't like feeling like a back-up plan... But also don't like to read-into things too much. I'm probably the type to give it some time, and then at some point have a conversation about it if the trend continues. I definitely want someone to be at least as engaged as I am.

94,mhn3kb,1617249582,Helping this friend,"I have this friend we will call her Cassie. She's been in this on again off again relationship with Greg. The thing is though they aren't in a relationship. They never have been but it's been on again and off again. They've been doing the tango then they stopped for a minute then again. She wants a relationship and he does but also doesn't. Meaning he wants to but doesn't think he's ready mentally. He had a rough past or something. I don't know the details of it except he had an abusive ex. He keeps pushing her away but then pulling her back then again. He'll tell her ""You can date other guys"" to which she doesn't want to. Now recently he told her that he just wants to be friend. So more physical stuff. No more kissing, no more tango etc. But will call her hun sweetie, etc. Her birthday is coming up on the 5th. So he bought her apparently $100 worth of presents. To which a ""friend"" doesn't do for another friend. That's something a boyfriend would do. I've asked her when is enough enough? How far will she go before she says no more of back and forth. She never gave me an answer by the way. She told me that when she talks to Greg that if they want to be friends and just be friends with no outcome of it being romantic then it's needs to be that. Though I suspect that Greg might be too much of pansy to actually tell her that he doesn't want to be her boyfriend ever. I mean considering for the last 3 months he's been saying he's going to quit his corporate warehouse job. Though he won't. Anyway my friend and I call her Bella are just over it at this point. Bella was over it around December and they started talking in November. Cassie told me that her and Greg have had a few bumps in the road. I told her they were pot holes and happened twice a month. She argued and said they were bumps and it wasn't twice a month. I told her didn't he just ignore you for a fking week just last week and we have another issue? You aren't in a relationship yet. You shouldn't be having this many issues to begin with. They basically aren't meant to be despite how in love she is but they are just too much. I'm 90% sure that all of Cassie's friends are done with her and Greg. I'm just the only sucker willing to listen but most of it is me going hmm yeah oh man. Uh huh. I also tested a theory if she would asked about me and this girl I've talking to. It's been almost 2 months and she has yet to ask. Love her but god woman...

Any advice to get her away from this guy? Things to say to her without losing her as a friend or seeming mean. Question to ask that make her really think about her relationship and maybe really break it off with Greg. Or should I just keep going yeah uh huh. Ok darn. Yep until she just crashes from this stupid drama. I'm at loss at this point and just want it to be over but it's like talking to a brick wall.

95,mhn93r,1617250127,Bf work drama,"Okay, here's the first part to make the second part easier to understand. I started dating this guy and we agreed he wouldn't add anymore provocative women. I got pissed when I saw he added a provocative co worker that ended up being a lot of drama. He told me he just considered her a friend and we fought about it for awhile cause he didn't think she was a problem (let's call her Margot) I ended up breaking up with him. He told her about our problems after we broke up and she used that info against him (he told her not to reach out to me) she ended up reaching out to me and telling me I'm fucked up and doesn't know how he could be into me.  He ended up deleting her after seeing she was a problem.

Fast forwarding about 3 months. He thought I should know about the recent drama at work. He told me Margot is now involved with some other male co worker, and he's married. Somehow his wife heard about what happened between my bf and Margot. She said she doesn't like my bf cause he cheated on me (he claims he never cheated) (shes never met my bf and he's never met this guy's wife) Idk why my bf is being involved in this when it's not his problem. It's his male co workers issue. And told me he doesn't like how there's gossip going around at work being called a cheater and is scared of losing me and thinks one of those people will reach out to me and tell me more of the gossip. 

But I'm confused and concerned why he's even involved in this gossip. I asked him if he's been talking to her again, he told me he's not and doesn't like Margot. And doesn't like the married male co worker. But he has him on his social media. Idk I'm confused about all this. Maybe it's all gossip. I kinda worry he was involved with her recently. But I guess all I can do is wait for things to unfold themselves.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhn93r/bf_work_drama/

97,mhna5f,1617250239,I am defeated,"Things I've done to turn my life around:

1. Focused on my studies more. Now I am doing a PhD, followed by medical school.
2. Volunteered more, especially in areas I have very little knowledge in so I can meet more people AND become more well rounded. 
3. Dress nicely. I spent quite a bit on revamping my wardrobe, especially for clothes that fit well and look great on my body type/skin tone.
4. Work out. I'm pretty luck as a dude to be 6 foot. However, I have transitioned from chubby to fit. Pretty proud of myself on that!
5. I took on lots of household responsibilities, such as owning a dog, having complex plants, and keeping a clean environment. Kinda shows that I am a responsible human being that can keep things alive. 
6. I've been joining more events on Zoom so I can start talking more smoothly and confidently.
7. IVE READ A LOT ON DIFFERENT TOPICS. so I guess, I'm trying to be well read. 
8. I think a lot of dudes miss this, but I'm more interested in getting to know someone rather than just a fling. 
9. Not the greatest looking dude, but I mean I'd say my personality is great though. 

I'm honestly just puzzled at how I can't rarely secure dates or just attract women in general. Honestly, I just feel so defeated as a 23 year old whose put so much effort to improve themselves. I'm not saying I am dependent on a partner to be happy, but it'd be nice addition to my life where I can enjoy hobbies and interests with someone I deeply care about. Also, it'd be nice for someone to be me support, and vice versa. After a terrible day, I can come home to an environment that'd instantly make me forget why I'm  down, and vice versa. 

Any suggestions on how I can work on myself more to be a ""potential partner"" to someone because at this rate I might just save all my money and become a sugar daddy at 50 :/ .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhna5f/i_am_defeated/
98,mhncpr,1617250509,Am I [26M] trying to move things too quickly?,"I \[26M\] met a beautiful girl \[23F\] at a party in late February. I asked her for her number and we went on our first date that week. Since then things have been going really well. We‚Äôve now been on 6 dates, each of which have been fun and easy.  The only issue I could possibly have is that she, and me to a lesser extent, aren‚Äôt big texters and only text to set up our next date. While normally this wouldnt be an issue, at the beginning of dating texting is nice way to keep the momentum of the previous date going, even if its through a couple texts a day. 

However, by all accounts, things are progressing nicely. We continue to open up to each other, we make time to see each other and our dates all last 4+ hours because they‚Äôre that easy and fun.  We have also hooked up after/during our last three dates, and while she‚Äôs definitely taken things slow in the bedroom, I‚Äôve got no complaints. I‚Äôm not a huge ‚Äúdater‚Äù and have some insecurities that make it hard for me to find someone to commit to. For that reason, I have always kept things casual with ex flings and tend run away or get bored once things begin to get serious. For the first time in years though, this isn‚Äôt the case.  

I haven‚Äôt felt this way in years and finally have found myself in a position where I am ready to progress to more. For me this means a couple things. First, I would like to talk more for no other reason than I want to hear about her day and be in her life. Even if its just a text or two a day, I would like to talk more than once a week to set up her date. Next, I think hanging out once a week is good while getting to know someone, but after a month and 6 dates, I want to see her more. I know I want something more with her, maybe not at this second, and call me crazy but I want to spend more time with the person I like and love being with. That doesn‚Äôt mean everyday, but 2 - 3 days a week would be nice. Lastly, and this is big for me, I want our lives outside of each other to start to cross. I want to meet her friends and want her to meet mine. I want to go out with her and have fun on weekends rather than just seeing her one on one once during the week at dinner or whatever we‚Äôre doing. She has definitely shown some shy tendencies and has mentioned she wants to take things slow. The only tine we‚Äôve discussed us was on our third date where we told each other how we feel about one another and talked about how we both are open to a relationship.  Since it‚Äôs been weeks since we had a relationship talk, I would like to open up with her more on our next date and see where we‚Äôre both at. 

Now for my questions:

She has communicated that she wants to take things slow and based on her actions and words, she seems happy with the minimal texting, hanging out every 5 -7 and keeping our lives separate. I‚Äôm ready for more and to start picking up the pace.  I dont want to keep going like this and waste my time. *Are these appropriate things to communicate at this point? If so, how? Do I just directly say everything I mentioned above? Do I tell her where I‚Äôm at and ask what she wants?* I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her or scare her away, but after a month and 6 dates I feel like its a fair time to ask if she‚Äôs happy with where we‚Äôre at and where we‚Äôre going?

Secondary question:

Is it adnormal to want to see her more than once a week at this point? We live 5 minutes from each other and have super flexible schedules so its not a timing issue, it‚Äôs a willingness thing. In addition, is texting as little how we do as abnormal as I think it is? Are there any better alternatives or work arounds?

&amp;#x200B;

Also worth noting, I am very confident that she is not seeing or dating other people.  That is coming from a source that would be in the know and would be honest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhncpr/am_i_26m_trying_to_move_things_too_quickly/
