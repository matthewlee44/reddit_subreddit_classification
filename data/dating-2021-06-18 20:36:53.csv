But me and him really hit it off and from the first message he sent to me I knew he was different. He’s been texting me everyday since for a month and a half now, some days we talks more than other but it’s still conversation nonetheless. It’s fun, it’s flirty, it’s easy. Easy being kind of hard to find for me. He mostly texts me first starting convos with a joke then asking me what i’m doing, how’s my day, what my plans are. 

I guess i’ve just never had this before (i’m 18F) so i guess i’m just asking to the guys if this was you why would you be doing it? Could he have bad intentions? Do you guys think he actually likes me and is just trying to get to know me better before we meet ? 

btw i know that this isn’t a relationship, to me in my side of it i like him and i feel like our personalities match  and i like spending time talking to him and getting to know him so that the only thing left for us would be to meet and see if the in person is as good as the online.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o35hf5/men_or_boys_of_reddit_why_would_you_text_a_girl/

2,o35y18,1624068959,Dating in your twenties,"I see a lot of posts from people with dating issues/questions/stress’ and I myself who can resonate with a lot of these topics wanted to share my general thoughts. For context, I’ve never had a women accept my romantic advances which is quite unfortunate but I’m not going to tell myself lies that ""it just wasn’t meant to be or maybe god is saving me for something better"". Telling ourselves this, at least for me, was a way of providing emotional comfort when my ego took a blow from the countless rejections. The truth is, it could’ve been a wide variety of reasons why the opposite party doesn’t want your advances.. and your looks more likely than not would have a significant part of it. 

Sure a great personality, manners alongside with ambitions is all considered attractive in a human but displacing the importance of physical appearance when entering the dating scene is absolutely absurd. I would classify myself as slightly below average looking and throughout my experience I can confidently say my looks made a part of the dating game challenging. Idk if this is harsh or pointless to write but I hope youngsters like myself who come on Reddit everyday reading about others problems can take this at face value and make the necessary adjustments to get results.

I'm not trying to stack these dates all on the same day like some sort of asshole.

This time I went for the triple, because surely I'd get *one* person to commit to the easiest of dates.

It's just unreal on paper how many dates I've ""had"" vs. how many have actually happened. I'd ask for someone to confirm that it's just not me, but I really don't want to find out this may be common.

To me, actions speak louder than words. Why the sudden disappearance? Communication speaks volume, say how you feel. I’ve been wanting to talk to her about things but there hasn’t been chances. Should I just live the space until she wants to talk or not, should I send a text how I feel and leave it at that? 

I’ve been through a lot in my past and with this person it felt more “right” and never felt that before because everything felt natural. Now I feel like my soul is being ripped apart slowly again. She is 31, I’m 32 so I find it childish to act like this and not just wanting to talk about. Part of me wants to send a lengthy text and just let it be and the other half wants to just leave it  alone and maybe she’ll come back around?

15,o38gom,1624078218,Did I over think this?,"First, the irony is not lost on me by making a Reddit post about over thinking. 


Okay, so I work at a retail store that has a coffee “hut” in the parking lot. It’s mainly for drive through but there is a walk up to another window for pedestrians to order. I go there on break or when I arrive and have been for a long time now. I talk to the baristas enough to know some more intimate details of their lives like one is moving out of the country with her fiancé at the end of summer. I come from a VERY small town, (sub 1,000) to me these people have become my “friends” to some degree. And I don’t know if that feeling is just because in a small town everyone is your friend to some degree? I even went and played disc golf with one of the male baristas on a day we had off. 

One of the baristas I’ve always thought was pretty (from the mask up) but I kinda always thought she was taken or just uninterested because she never really wanted to chit-chat with me which is fine. But as of late she started being more inquisitive, randomly asking me where I went to high school, what my favorite type of music, basic stuff. But it was a noticeable change in our interactions.

I’m the type where, I won’t ask out a woman when she is on shift. She’s just working, she is doing her job, any and everything I notice about her behavior could be basically be chalked up to customer service. A couple of the barista’s and I follow eachother on Instagram and in a quick bit I found her. I decided just following her and seeing what happened would be a more appropriate way to see if she was interested.

She followed me back but when I messaged her “how was your first day at work without a mask?” I was left on seen. 

Idk it feels like I messed up? Or maybe she doesn’t think much of it. But I feel a little embarrassed. I just want to hear what someone else thinks of this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o38gom/did_i_over_think_this/

Dates with no chemistry (the girls never like me) so not much of a decent hug during all this time! 

I feel like with this experience i can say that eventually you feel NORMAL being alone, as sad as this may sound. 

You dont feel bad on Valentine's Day or on your birthday, you just live through. 

Its like if you loose your emotions. I cant even find a better way than that to describe it. 

I cant say for every single person and their needs, but you CAN survive living lonely and alone. Even if it makes you depressed. 

I know the disappointment of going back from a date where not only goes wrong, but the girl abandons you in the middle of the date cause you are not a tall muscular hot guy. 

People can be mean to you and they dont really give a f*ck about it. 

I dont expect nothing from Tinder anymore, its always the same thing. 

What i realize is the less you show interest on a girl that REALLY IS into you, the more she will like you. If she is just needy she will forget you in a few days and move on. 

You can survive lonely, not being happy tho, but most of you will handle. 

Many will go through dozens of date until something good come up. At least it PROBABLY wont be 5 years.

24,o3993e,1624081494,I'm confused !! Need Advice !!,"Hey !! I'm a 17yo guy. I am preparing for a pretty important college entrance exam (JEE in India). I am a pretty good student and mostly the school topper. I really didn't enjoy online classes in lockdown and about October of last year I got into a relationship with a girl (Let's call her X)... 

 Her last bf of 3 years dumped her as he had to focus on his college career and exams. Also, the situation at her place is not that great and she's very disconnected from the rest of her family too. All this caused her to have major mental health issues and she's in depression and has abandonment issues as well... 

I really love her but our conversations are like i'm more of her therapist than her boyfriend and I really try to solve her issues or guide her through it. This is taking a toll on my mental health as well as studies. I'm usually a really cheerful guy who gets along with all the cliques in school but nowadays I rarely speak to anyone plus my marks have dropped from around 96/100 to 65/100.

I really care about her so i'm conflicted about what to do and how to break it to her or not...

Option 1: I continue the relationship but take a break of 6 months or so which will be extremely difficult for her as she's really attached

Option 2: I break up with her and focus on my studies and prioritize my mental health. If anything, I can try to patch up again after my exams if both of us are still interested.

38,o3bcer,1624091097,Advice on using dating app with GPS...,"I like to here people's opinion on here about what they think about dating/chat apps that allow you to chat and find strangers within your proximity by scanning people nearby using GPS? What are the good, bad and your overall conclusion on using these apps to hookup or break the ice with a stranger to find love.

Most dating apps allow you to specify how many mile radius to find people nearby (I am not talking about these). I am talking about super nearby, like in front of your eyes, meaning going into a bar or grocery stores and see profiles of people that you can actually see, bump into or even approach. Maybe you can even see/meet someone at work that you don't normally interact with but like and didnt know was available. Is this good or a little scary to use? Appreciate your thoughts or feedback, whether you have experience using some of these apps or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3bcer/advice_on_using_dating_app_with_gps/
39,o3be5j,1624091303,Thinking for sure i will be single till 35 or later,Ive posted here many times and i have to say ive gotten some help from people on here and also some terrible things said to me just out of nowhere. Anyways I go to work and come home and go to bed at like 2 or 3 cause i get off at 11 i work 3 to 11 at a hotel during Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday and then Friday Saturday i work 11 to 7 overnight and then come home and sleep and wake up at 3 and do it again at 11. What im saying is idk how im ever gonna meet anyone and dating apps are the worst thing invented since they just go off of looks and they are a pay for nothing basically unless you look like a angel or a god basically. But yeah ive had all 3 tinder hinge and bumble ive had people edit the profile for me ive changed it myself ive done everything possible and i could probably say i gotten 5 spams and 5 real likes that just talked for less than a day or deleted me instantly cause it was an accidental like or something.  Also people have told me to find hobbies or go out to places but im in south dakota i hate bars i dont smoke drink or do any type of drugs i hate sports and im kinda scared talking to people i dont know alot of the time especially if they are a girl that i would like or something. My hobbies are gaming music movies cars and collectibles also hanging with my cousin and my one good friend. None of that is really something i could go to around here accept im going to slipknot concert in iowa in September which im pumped for. Anyway though i guess im just gonna be single till who knows when but im assuming either forever or way later like 35 or 40 or something when i have my own house and idk i guess im just stuck and have no clue how to go about dating and im 25 btw and ive never had a date never really hung out with a girl and still would consider myself a virgin and yeah just wish something would happen soon.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3be5j/thinking_for_sure_i_will_be_single_till_35_or/
40,o3bekg,1624091354,"Deleted social media awhile back, but going to college soon. Wondering if it's needed for dating","(M, 24) I'm from a very small town. Due to a stressful job and just not having a real dating pool to work with, I eventually deleted my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, everything but Reddit. All I would see on these apps was stuff about dating, which was irrelevant to my life in a small town with basically just a job and a gym to go to. Also deleted them because they're kind of bad in general, a lot of toxicity. 

But I'm going to a pretty big college in a big city in August. I'm attractive, and I work out (not saying that to brag, only for context). Idk if or when I might date. But the world, especially among teens and 20-somethings, largely uses social media for socializing and for being seen online by potential partners. I've heard that some people in my age range (I'm 24) consider someone without social media as strange or anti-social. When I had deleted my social media accounts, I still had Tinder for a while, and a girl I matched with seemed to want to know me better. She asked me to chat with her on Instagram. I told her I deleted it, that I got sick of social media. Then she unmatched me, as if to think I was a creepy scammer. So social media seems like a must-have. 

I really don't miss having social media, I feel happier without it. But it could be a seen negatively somehow by potential partners. Can you realistically date people today with just texting and phone calls? Would someone I meet in college react negatively if I say I don't do social media? I haven't been hanging out with people since early high school, so I'm kind of out of the loop on this.

I offered a compromise to do some cooking together on video call over the weekend, he picked the day and what we cooked and was introducing me to his housemates on video call. For the past few weeks he kept saying we can go out to restaurants, we can travel together, we can do hobbies together... really over the top and coming on strong tbh
This weekend he asked late on Friday to
meet on Sunday but to me it seemed a bit of an afterthought, Sunday is not a great day to do things as I have chores and errands to do and when he asked to meet Sunday he didn’t say when or where or what we would do and he didn’t ask me what I’d like to do so it was concrete plans. He said he’d drive close to my area but there isn’t anything to do so I suggested to meet in the city area for coffee in the morning as Sunday is a bit of busy day to get organised for the work week, basically I was the one making compromises and then I didn’t hear back for 5 hours today so I just deleted him from Instagram, bumble and told him it’s not gonna work because he didn’t really organise anything and last weekend he seemed keen to meet and then he never put in plans into action this weekend and I felt lied to and truth is I do and I feel manipulated because one minute it is we can do this together and we can do that together but there was no effort really, just a lot of talk and that gives me the message he wasn’t very interested, so maybe my reaction was for the best!

I'm also educated to masters level, have a good career, and can hold a proper conversation.

I often have no problem talking to and making friends with women who are already in relationships, but it feels like women who are single just shut down conversation with me before it can even start. When I do have a conversation with them they give closed answers and seem unsure, and or unwilling  to talk. Needless to say this makes it impossible to find a girlfriend. This usually applies to dating apps as well.

I'm not big-headed about my looks, but as I say, the consensus among people I know is that I'm very handsome. Could this be a put-off to single women? Player vibes? Too intimidating? I have no idea, it makes no sense. But all I know is that I can definitely hold my own in a social setting, so I'm pretty sure my social skills aren't the problem.

However, both yesterday and the day before, he messaged me once in the morning (so he initiated conversation) and then didn't answer both times. He still hasn't opened my message from yesterday morning. 

Surely if he wanted me to 'leave him alone' or wasn't interested, he wouldn't bother messaging in the first place?

I just think in an ideal healthy relationship you should find enough fulfillment and intimatacy with the two of you, that constantly having others around would weaken your bond.

No pressure if what’s next because “next” happened as it should without a dating script. If you hung out again, we were not counting it as dates and applying dating rules like sex on date 3.

79,o3hp2d,1624114112,Am I being too stubborn?,"S, I have a crush on this girl. Found out she has recently got a bf. It wasn't that huge, but I do think a lot about her. Then I was in a group project with another girl. And she developed a crush on me I think.

This girl is super sweet, but she isn't that ""fun"".  Of late, she has been trying too hard. Always trying to message me for very irrelevant tasks. When I don't view her stories, she gets upset and down. I do care a lot about her, but not in that way. 

So, I am in a bit of sticky situation. If I don't date her, I feel guilty about not giving someone chance who has tried so hard. On the other hand, if I do decide to date her, I feel like dating your second choice because your actual crush isn't available is wrong and disrespectful. For now, I have been maintaining my distance with her. What should I do? Am I being too stubborn? Tbh, I am. I need what I need and I just can't settle for less. I have zero feelings for her. And I am not sure it will change.  But, she is so sweet and kind and pure?(this sounds creepy I dont know why).

80,o3hvik,1624114622,I (F24) need some advice. And soon.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Apologies for the long post which I am typing on my phone. I (F24) been seeing this guy (M28) for about 8 months now. Let’s call him John. My last relationship ended rather badly when I realized that my then-boyfriend of nearly 2 years was cheating on me with his secretary. After that ended, I could not muster the courage to date again for over a year and a half. Then I met John at a mutual friend’s birthday party. We exchanged numbers and it just took off from there, I guess. John is my second serious boyfriend. I have had a couple of casual hookups apart from these two, and that’s it. 

The thing is, John is VERY attractive. Have you seen couples where you wondered ‘how did THIS guy land that gorgeous woman?!’. That’s kinda the story of my life, in reverse. Other women do not hesitate to make a move on him. In his own admission, he has been groped, touched, and kissed without consent multiple times. And when he recoils or pulls away, some women have followed him. He has been followed all the way home by women on at least two occasions. 

Once, I was 10 minutes late to a date due to traffic and when I reached, a couple of women were already flirting with him. One of them handed him her number AFTER she saw me. She actually accosted him in the mens’ room, handed her number over, and smirked at me before leaving the restaurant. 

I am no butterface, but this guy is WAYYY out of my league looks wise. I try to laugh it off when things like that happen, but it is getting to me. He swears he does not enable it, but I do not see him discouraging such women either. How difficult is it to say ‘no thanks, I have a girlfriend?!’. And he is way more sexually experienced. His partners have gone to extreme lengths to please him, and have done acts that frankly disgust me. 

Our sex life is great, but he has asked me to do things that I am not comfortable with. He asked me to rim him once, and when I refused, he just laughed and said ‘well, you will eventually’. And on another occasion, he opened what he calls his ‘panty drawer’ that had no less than 25 panties, thongs etc. in it. Yes, they were from the women he slept with previously. They are his ‘war trophies’, and he refuses to throw them out. I am so tempted to check his phone too, but nothing is out of place yet that suggests I should. Plus, the idea of invading his privacy like that is revolting to me. What should I do? Put my foot down and insist he push back on unwanted advances? Be the obsessed, insecure girlfriend and keep him on a tight leash? Or just play it cool? My older, married sister has met him and has said it is just a matter of time before he cheats.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3hvik/i_f24_need_some_advice_and_soon/
81,o3i02n,1624114961,Summer dating,"Greetings. I need advice on a guy I just started hanging out with. So we’ve been snapping for a few weeks after he joined my friends birthday outing a month ago. I have been single for a year now and am ready to get back out there for some fun. I’m not looking for a relationship per se, or even sex at the moment. But just someone to enjoy spending time with. We went to see the sunset on Thursday and I packed a picnic. It was lovely. And then last night we went to the mall and then drinks with same (mutual) friend. 
So where I’m a little confused. Beach Thursday we got touchy after about two hours and I enjoyed it. Yesterday wasn’t as touchy, but it was daylight and we were either in the car or out in public so I get it. When we went to the first place for drinks, I felt some distance once his friend arrived. He kissed me goodnight at the end of it all but the last hour just felt a little odd. How do I not overthink this and just enjoy each other without trying to overthink everything. I’m 23F btw and he is 25M. Do I ask him to hang out again? Also do “summer flings” just naturally become so or do you have to declare it? I’m not trying to have that convo but I also realize it’s already so early so maybe I’m just being too anxious.

85,o3j0n6,1624117800,Taking things slow for the 2nd time…am I just being strung along or does he seem interested?,"I met a guy off a dating app and it’s been about 5 months now. We took a mini break because he was overwhelmed with work and wanted to take a break where we could do whatever we wanted.

Well, the break lasted maybe a month or so before he came back saying he really needed someone like me in his life blah blah. We have decided to give it another chance. We went back to talking everyday.

We are long distance, but we managed to see each other every few weekends and via Skype. He said he’s not ready to be in a relationship yet because he can’t commit to the effort and time. 

Yesterday, I saw him active on the dating app because I went on to unsubscribe since I was getting charged out the ass. I confronted him about it and he told me he got a match from when he was on there while we were on a break so he went to look. I assumed he was lying so I told him that he’s a 30 yo grown ass man now and literally everything he does at this point is a choice.

I told him I don’t appreciate him going on the dating apps but he keeps claiming that he hasn’t swiped since we started talking again. He also threw in my face that we aren’t exclusive and until we are in a relationship, I’m allowed to do as I please. 

This completely threw me off guard because I thought we were already exclusive based off the way we interacted with each other. His family knows about me, I’ve met his friends, etc.

Within the 5 months we’ve known each other, we’ve only had sex once so I know he isn’t just interested in that. We’re also going to his friends house in another city next weekend to see him and his girlfriend. 

I’m pretty confused as to where I stand. He’s told me that he wants to be with me, he tells me things like he’s always going to try to keep me happy, etc., but I’m not sure why he threw in my face that we aren’t exclusive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3j0n6/taking_things_slow_for_the_2nd_timeam_i_just/

96,o3kgi0,1624121773,Did he like me or did I just overthink everything? 26 F 31 M,"We coached together in the spring season: 

-Before I even really knew him, he’d often ask me how things went when practice was done for the day. 

-The first time I ever needed his help, he walked with me to unlock instead of giving me his keys like he does everyone else and spent a few minutes talking to me. 

-I had a favorite hoodie I wore around probably 2x a week. He complimented me on it just about every single time he saw me in it. 

-I spent a good chunk of time hanging out in his office before practice. Every time he saw me, even if he had to go to class or was really busy, he’d always stop by and say “Hi (name)” and then get back to what he was doing. 

-One of those times I spent in there our students came running in insisting that he had to come see something. He looked at the student, looked at me and then said “It’s gonna be a little bit.” 

-Offered to help me with my former student. Got my student gear without having me to ask. 

-Asked if I could hug him as a thank you for helping me. Was going to explain that the students mom had contacted me saying she was grateful, he walked forward and wrapped me up into a hug before I could get to that part. 

-One time I was talking to his colleague I made a comment about how awesome I thought he was. He proceeded to go very red in the face a few minutes later. 

-I came in really upset one day and felt the need to talk to him because I trusted him. He kicked his students out, locked the door and listened to me vent. 

The biggest thing was I felt like we got along really well and could talk about pretty much anything. He’s a good dude. I don’t know him well enough to want a relationship, but he was definitely amazing.

He refuses to respond to me, I am aware that he has seen my messages as he has been actively watching my social media. The thing that bothers me is that he has even posted me on his highlights on Instagram and I messaged him saying why to post me if you won't respond to me and instead of saying anything to me he just deleted all of his posts and highlights. I don't understand why he is doing this and why he won't just let me pick up my quilt so we can be done with each other.
