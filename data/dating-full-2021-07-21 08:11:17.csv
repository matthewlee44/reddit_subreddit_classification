Initially, I was frustrated with no matches and no understanding of how Online Dating works. With a lot of trial and error things got better. I have had moderate success in dating apps. I have gone on more than 50 dates and I have gone through the whole gamut of experiences. I know that 50 is not as high as some of the other men but nevertheless, I thought I will share my experience here to help out other men.

OLD is a tough gig for men because the game is totally skewed towards the women by the sheer ratio of number of men and women on an app. The men outnumber the women in almost any location. So, as a man, you have one chance and 30 seconds to make that first impression. Once that gate is open, you'll still need an authentic personality to convert the match into a date.

Let us understand what women are looking for. It is not one thing. They may be on a dating app for a number of reasons. One woman may want a husband and another woman might just want a night's stand. It will not be apparent. But whatever they may want, the first thing they want to feel with a strange man is a sense of safety. So, don't be a misogynist or a stalker or a misogynistic stalker.

A little bit of self awareness goes a long way in OLD. Making a good profile is paramount to your success. Let's look at how we can construct a good one:

Pictures: Pick one where your face is clearly visible and there are as few filters as possible. Pick one more which is a full body one. If the weekend beer has given you a tummy, let that show in your pics else you'll get stood up in a bar which is far worse. Don't use a selfie as much as possible. If you don't have an option, then use a selfie. Smile. Smiling indicates warmth, congeniality and improves your face significantly. Don't use more than 3 pictures. 3 pics from different angles give a good idea. If you look best in shades then let that be just one of your pictures. Else, avoid shades. 

I've read enough bios of women to understand that as much as they appreciate you going to the gym, they prefer you with a shirt on to start off. Like a wise man once said, we think women are impressed with biceps and luxury cars. The only ones impressed with those things are other men.

Even if you aren't the most handsome looking guy, a bit of a personality is a deal clincher. The bio and any questions you answer on your profile is very important. 

Who should you swipe right on? What are your chances?

To summarise, I'd love to start chatting to/getting to know this girl I met briefly 10 months ago but feel like a random message without explanation would be strange and the conversation would likely die out so getting to a ""talking stage"" would be difficult. I also don't want to make it awkward or uncomfortable for her if she's not interested.

We matched and just vented about the weirdos we'd met so far on the app. I wasn't attracted to him sexually at first but I liked him and we became friends. Oh he lives in a different state than me, about an hour away. We officially started dating in October after weeks of texting. I was worried he'd lose interest when I told him about my online sex work, but he wasn't bothered. We would meet up when ever our schedules and (covid restrictions) allowed us.


Things were going fine until my birthday came around in early December and he forgot about it. I thought he'd planned a surprise or something but he didn't even send me a text. I checked in on him but he just ranted about some work stuff. I decided to give it a few days still got nothing. Yes, I told him about it the first day of the month and two days before the day. I also posted on my stories about it. About a week later I finally changed my profile picture to a picture I took from the day and that's when he asked where the picture was from I told him about my birthday and all he sent was a dancing birthday GIF. I was so mad I ended things there and just ghosted him. 


Few months passed and I got a call from him May this year. He said he was leaving the country soon and he wanted to make amends and asked if he had hurt me in anyway. I told him. He apologized and slowly we became friends again. He sent me money to buy something for myself by the way. We started dating again but I keep thinking about how things will work out when he leaves.

I want to share the story of how I lived with the abuser and what came of it.

Now I am in a foreign country where I do not have the right to work, and I have no idea how I can earn money in order to move to my homeland. I feel very much like almostharmless and my relatives would rather shoot me in the stomach than help.

I want to warn everyone who is faced with abuse and tell how it happens.

1. Abuser Presents yourself as a *good* one. At first, the abuser seems meek and tame, positive, friendly, but very shy or cautious. In fact, if you get along well with yourself, you will immediately feel that this is a bad person. But now few people feel harmony with themselves, and this feeling can be perceived as erroneous. But this is not a mistake. The first impression is always the right one.

In my case, I didn’t like the guy at all, I didn’t like the way he spoke, but I thought it was a difference in the language. I didn't like the person, but he started running after me, showing a lot of attention, calling for coffee, and he expressed his thoughts very well in writing. Just wonderful as a real novelist. Attention has been won, a positive image is almost built.

2. Identifying your weaknesses. This is a very important stage. The manipulator will know what you *need*. In my case, it was so that I was on the verge of suicide due to depression, which appeared after many very bad events. I was looking for a friend with whom you can talk about painful, who will understand me. Ideally, I needed a man to take care of me. The manipulator understood this well and built communication with me in such a way as to make it clear to me that he could be the one I needed.

3. Then he checked for my strength. As far as I can bend. In my case, I had to wait 2 times for 5 months while he was on a business trip. Although we did not discuss the status of our correspondence and relations in any way, my only trip to coffee with an acquaintance was regarded as a betrayal. Although I said in advance everything directly and honestly that I wanted to go with a friend to a cafe. He will immediately make you feel guilty. He is not to blame for leaving, and it is not known how much, but you. You are selfish. He will blame for this very seriously. The fact that you are completely alone, you need help and communication, he does not care at all. But you already believe in him and his story and do not notice how he weaves a web. You start blaming yourself for every attempt to get out of depression. You can't be happy.

4. This could be end. The spider've found its victim, shrouded it in lies, guilt, and then drinks its resource and enjoys that he managed to get a victim. He will scoff in different ways, but say that this is not happening, and you came up with everything yourself (gaslighting).

But I am very stubborn and really wanted me to have a family and I showed a strong desire for him to finally return from his 10-month business trip and we have already discussed our relationship. Who we are to each other. Because everything was absolutely incomprehensible - we correspond every day, share emotions (about this later addition), and it seems that the only problem that exists is the distance between us. And I decided to solve this problem, because he did not solve it (because it was very convenient for him to make his image of a ""savior"" from a distance). I did not understand, I am alone physically and in fact, but in my head it seems to me that I am not alone.

5. Then we moved in, and only I paid for 4 months of housing. It is very difficult for me financially, because all my depression is due to some work moments that I cannot change. In my country, it is not customary for a woman to pay for a man, but I did this throughout our relationship.

6. Then we had to live in another country, we moved to a very scary city where crime and drug addicts reign, at home as after the war and nothing in stores. I was blinded by my idea of ​​starting a family and was ready to do this, just to be close (to solve the problem with distance). And here the year of the nightmare began. Claims poured on me every day. I lost any rights except to help him pay for the apartment. I slept on a very uncomfortable sofa, it is on a comfortable bed. There was no sex for a year. He blamed me for this, because it was unpleasant for me how he touched me like a virgin. And I shouted that I wanted sex, passionate and sensual, but he did not decide anything. He had problems with sex before me.

We were not even close as a family, it was all just in my head. He just used me as a resource, emotional and financial, and to vent his anger. And a woman's time is the most valuable resource.

7. I won't bore you with details, but it was a year of hell. When I realized that a better future was not foreseen and he was lying to me that nothing would change, I calmly said that I could no longer live with him. In my opinion, we should have quietly dispersed at the end of the month without any problems. But instead of discussions and a serious conversation, he tricked me into taking my keys, got into a fight with me and kicked me out of the apartment. For which I paid !!!

After all this, I screamed and cursed, begged for my things back, demanded that he return me the money that I paid for the apartment in order to pay for my move, but he simply ignored. He simply returned to his country and banned me in all chats. Like I don't exist and never existed. I lost hope, a lot of money, several years of life and trust to people.

I have no one, and I don't even know what to do. There is no chance to work here, or there is illegal work for 12-14 hours which will give a maximum of $15-20 per day. To move I need about $ 1500-2000. I don't even know what the options might be. I can't stay here more than a few months.

What do you think about this situation? I agree that I was as stupid and naive as possible. But how often do you meet such toxic and irresponsible people? What would you do if you were me? It’s dangerous and scary here, and I don’t have money for doctors to help me emotionally (there are also physiological problems).

Ok we love it. It’s kinky af. Maybe it’s just that.

I don’t know if we’re going with what he said he wanted or with what I said I wanted.

He always texts me first and sends things like “listen to this song it makes me think of you xx” We can’t meet as it’s college summer holidays and we live really far away but we have plans to meet when term starts again and he is even making longer term plans to go to a concert etcetera. 

He is so kind and respectful to me, and I genuinely felt like he was into me. But I noticed that since our date he added more photos to his tinder profile. I noticed because I’m using tinder too but I’m not interested in anyone else because I like this guy, whereas him adding new photos suggests he’s actively seeking out new people, like trying to increase his chances of matching. Is him adding photos a big deal? Should I cut him off so I don’t get hurt? Or should I just go wit how he treats me, which is really well and wholesomely (tho I am super gullible)

I used dating apps as ego boosts, have a great social circle and got on with life happily. But entering the dating scene properly since april this year has hit me like a ton of bricks.

I met this girl in april at a bar through mutual friends. We end up hooking up, and the next morning I propose a date, rather unusually, perhaps bcos of social starvation from the pandemic. Anyway, we start dating, eventually becoming official, lasted about two months. Things were great, seemed like mutual interest in each other, she would talk about future things we should do together, and then planned and invited me on a short staycation together. On said staycation she said she loved me, I didn't say it back and explained it was a big thing for me. But I thought things were still good, we cooked each other dinner over two nights a few days later. Then a week after our staycation, she messages out of the blue midday saying she doesn't want a relationship and we should leave things there.

I was really sad for a few days, and annoyed at feeling led on. I started talking to a few girls on dating apps to fill the void, but wasn't gonna do anything since i didn't feel a connection. Then I matched with the second girl. I instantly felt a connection, we spoke for just over a week before our first date (would've been earlier, but both away at first). It was the best date I'd ever been on, talked for hours, and she then proposed a second date, said we were both looking for a relationship and kissed. We date for a month and she proposed exclusivity on third date. I thought things were amazing, dates were great and again, mutual interest in each other. Slight problem, she's going on holiday for just over a month before going back to uni, and she decides to break things off.

Again I was really sad, lasted much longer, and worse this time. I don't feel maliciously led on by the second girl, we talked it through and I understand her position, despite wishing for a different outcome. But the past few months have been an absolute rollercoaster, the highest of highs with the girls, and the absolute lowest of lows when things end and the way they do. The inability, despite talking about things, to truly understand a persons thoughts and mindset when breaking things off is gutwrenching. Despite my social circle staying intact, I feel more lonely and sad at the end of these situationship/relationships than I ever was when I was single/not dating. 

So while this is a vent about my experience/emotions, is there any advice from people on how not to be so emotionally drained from the whole dating experience?

He has a very very big circle of friends in his city. Summers are very busy for him, this summer especially. I last saw him 3 weeks ago for the 4th of July. The last 2 weekends, he’s been busy out of town for a wedding and the past weekend he had to go for his friends bachelor party. 

I know he’s not cheating because I’ve gotten pictures and snaps. This weekend, he told me he has to go to this event for a club that he’s a part of. He wanted me to join, but he had to make sure he’d be able to bring a +1. 

I told him I don’t really care about going to the event, I would just like to see him and spend time with him. I miss him a lot. He’s a great guy…just….VERY BUSY. 

I told him to let me know about this weekend and he texted me saying “so we aren't allowed plus ones bc they are renting a venue with a band and bc there are so many members they don't have room if everyone brings a plus one.”

I responded saying “of course, no worries. I can’t lie and say I’m not a little offended by a response like that, but I’ll get over it.” 

I am more offended because I know that if the roles were reversed, I would’ve made time to see him by just dropping by the event and then leaving. I’d rather see me boyfriend after 2 weeks of partying and traveling, not go to another event.

I opted out of going to my cousin’s gender reveal and told her I had a work trip come up last minute because I just assumed he’d be down to see me. I’m such a dumbass I know. 

Edit: re-reading this post, I feel like it may kind of make me look like I’m controlling or insecure or something. By no means am I either. I don’t even ask him who he’s hanging out with when he’s out with friends. I just really like this guy and I enjoy spending time with him. It’s tough being long distance as it is, and I just want to be a priority every now and then.

I met my most recent ex in my apartment complex about 8 months ago, and we dated for 7 months. She is originally from Spain and came to the states to do research for college credit. As I am a dental student, we naturally had a common interest in science and research. She had never been in a relationship before and grew up in a super conservative family. Her parents don't even sleep in the same room, and they discouraged her from dating her whole life. She never thought about being in a romantic relationship until meeting me, and even then, she told me she wasn't initially interested in me beyond friendship. 

I did a lot for her since I wanted to make her first relationship special: I would cook for her often, buy her small gifts on certain occasions, and always take time out of my hectic schedule with school and studying to hang with her. However, she often blew me off at least once a week if it was too late or she had an allergy flare-up (she was raised in a sterile environment and any allergen will cause her to get some dermatitis). I always offered to take care of her, buy her soup, etc., but she declined every time and pushed me away. She is way less sensitive and emotional than I am and often turns serious conversations into a joke; she was definitely hard to communicate with. Also, in terms of intimacy, we tried to make love, but she was unable to physiologically (she couldn't relax her muscles, no matter how hard she tried). Also, she said if I had gotten her pregnant were we to make love, she would abort my child, and that really hurt my feelings. I felt like she didn't do as much in return and didn't always appreciate the efforts I put into our relationship.

She decided to break it off out of the blue last week after her parents convinced her to distance herself from since she will be returning to Europe to complete college in a month. Her parents are super overbearing, and she chose them over listening to her heart and myself; that is, we should make the most of her last month in the states together. Despite breaking it off, she still was intimate with me and then just left. I was hurt and confused, so I decided to just block her on every outlet after not hearing from her for a day/seeing she deleted our relationship on Facebook. I realized after that I was no better than she was, just abruptly shutting down socially. 

I unblocked her number, and she reached out thanking me for all the memories I gave her. She said she still considers me a good friend. I told her about how I felt about our relationship being pretty one-sided, and this hurt her feelings. I was the one who sacrificed more time and money than she did (I would pay for all of her meals, and she always made empty gestures to cover some of the expenses).  I felt bad that I made her feel bad, though I really was just telling the truth, and I tried to reconcile in person with her. When we last met, she came onto me, cuddling next to me and kissing me. 

This girl just makes me feel horrible - she breaks it off yet is all over me physically. I know one would say just block her again/avoid her, but I need to be civil since she is going to be my first patient exam in a few weeks (none of my assigned patients were available), and she's giving out my business cards to her colleagues in the area, so I can have more patients. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm asking is how to handle being in this awkward ""friendship,"" and how can I move on? I have mixed emotions about her: I am attracted to her, but also find her annoying/toxic. I've been on dating apps, and I've had no luck. I also just feel alone...I'm used to coming home and spending time with her, but now I have no one. All my friends are busy usually, and hobbies can only keep me occupied for so long when I'm not studying.

There wasn’t really an option to stop talking to him, as every time a natural “exit” appeared, he would maneuver me to a new conversation.

It was a very nice house, and I think he wanted to date me because he kept telling me how much money he made as a lawyer, the property he owned, etc. I was not very comfortable or engaged with him, but he laughed at everything I said that was even moderately funny.

He brought me onto his balcony, where he told me all about how much he hated the homeless population in Seattle, and how much he was working to disband them, and it wasn’t the government’s job to find them a place to go. He talked about this for a full hour.

I left as soon as it started getting dark outside. I thought maybe he had had a bad time, because when I messaged him to say thank you, he tried to set up a date and also followed me on all social medias.

Met a guy I liked and he liked me too for like 3 months really into me. He has tons of girls around him (he's in india. I'm long distance) and is deemed attractive by them all. He talks to so many women. I'm usually the same way when I'm joking around but when I like someone all my focus is on them. 

Problem is we get along well but  hes Indian and I don't speak his language. he has some bad habits like joking around too and being really childish but I know that he's actually very observant and serious in real life. This is why i liked him in first place since we played video games together and he and I think the same way. We share similar past difficulties. I know his brother too since his brother is my best friend. So not only did I like this guy but he's also like family. 

Anyway he's been not talking to me for like 2 days now and when I ask him sometime ago where he's been and what he's doing he just talks about how his life is fucked up and his family is giving him a hard time and how he has body pain. It's like he purposely avoids admitting that he's flirting with other women. But I know he does because on some days I ask him do you talk to anyone and he has told me he talks to other girls but just for fun. Nothing serious. 

But I know for a fact he's talking to them just as he talks to me. Realistically I doubt he and I will ever be together...so i'm only holding onto him because we got along really well and he made me feel at some point that I'm different from everyone else. When he was super into me he would tell me how many girls want him but he ignores them all. Now he truthfully says that he is chatting with other girls but nothing deep.

We talk mainly on whatsapp since vastly diff countries. But he is VERY moody. He drinks alot has no job and is yet picky  as fuck about women. He comes off to me as a sleazy guy since he's on Facebook and Instagram ALL day ""getting messages from girls"". He had like 100 messages from multiple multiple women mainly Indian (why are they all over him he's not super attractive )

He would pale out in comparison to men who live in my area in terms of looks. But somehow this dude is the most arrogant and most stuck up guy I've met. He literally says that he's hot and the shit. I assume he's joking or teasing but he says it alot. 

I suspect some mental issues....but as an idiot that doesn't sway me. Because he said once to me "" I will treat my wife as a queen"" so here I am thinking maybe he's childish  and jokes too much but deep down he's actually a very mature guy but? And he says he's mature. But not responding to me because more than likely he's busy talking to another chick. And I doubt he's as mature as he thinks.

What would you do? I want to just hear what other women would do ..drop him or keep talking to him knowing that he could be talking to other girls anytime and being in different countries?

I know when people date sometimes guys girls talk to many people. But this guy is not serious about anyone and it's the mysterious factor about him that has me hooked. I keep imagining what woman will he marry and will he really be nicer to her? Because he doesn't take me seriously at all.

I'm 30 and he's 31
He lives with his family at home no degree or education or job other than the family business. Not trying to be rude but how can he be so arrogant and think he's the shit when there are plenty of men with much more and more serious behavior?

I am 22F and he is 30M. We met on hinge, he had an extensive profile that seemed to the point, although the pictures were not very clear. He asked to video call quite quickly, and we had a short chat and he seems super nice and reassuring. He then asked me to think over whether I want to meet and to call him in a couple of days. I liked that because he didn't put me on the spot... and so I texted him again and he arranged everything about the meet.

I met with this man twice so far. When we met I was frankly awestruck by his presence. Quite the looker (which is an odd feeling, because typically I am the one who gets oggled when I meet guys so it's nice to have the reverse for once), extremely relaxed and patient. Super confident and had a calm quality to him . For some context, totally unplanned, just as I met him I was stuck on the phone with my employer because of a sticky situation with a child we have (I work in a nursery school). He sat me down on a bench away from the noise, and we kept a lovely conversation going through the on-hold music until I sorted it out and he was reassuring the whole way through and didn't seem annoyed. This I later learnt screwed up with his bookings for the night but he managed to sort it out later.

We first had a couple of drinks, we got to know each other a bit more. I got hints that he's well established. We had a great connection, the chemistry was palpable, so many laughs and good conversations, I found myself talking way more than I usually do, although that's also because he doesn't talk much (I asked him why, and he said that's the way he is, and not to take it as a sign that he is not interested).

He then jokingly said that he liked our drinks and wanted to have dinner, so we went to an expensive steak house he chose and he paid for everything. It was the most expensive meal I've ever had. Again the conversations just flowed and I was starting to think that I should try real hard with this man. I asked him whether he is seeing other people and he said yes. He said he likes to take things slow, for things to develop naturally, that we don't owe each other anything, and that he only spends time with people who are into him.

What happened next is something I'm not very proud of, after dinner I was so into him and he asked whether I wanted to go home with him. I said only if we're doing this again, and he said of course, and not to do anything I wasn't comfortable with. I went home with him and we slept, twice. It was good, and he was kind enough to let me sleep the night and got me an uber the next morning. After meeting him I felt I was on cloud 9. It's rare to get that sort of feeling. From his place it's clear he's well off. His place overlooks a famous square in our city and is quite large.

After that meeting we didn't text much, a week later he invited me again. And this is where it started to go south. After meeting, we had something similar to what we had first, drinks and dinner. We went again to his place and when things started getting heated again I told him that I am on my period. He then he said he doesn't do PIV during periods (I said same for me). And before he said anything else I said I also don't go down on men without an STD test. He said that's ok although he later said ""he's careful and it's not like a test will prove anything, and he tests regularly anyway"". I also I thought I should start pushing back on this expectation of sex because I didn't want him to take it for granted.

We made out a bit more and then it kinda died down. We then had a good conversation about favourite movies and music, he let me stay over again and didn't seem to have any hard feelings, and I kinda wanted to start things again in the morning but he got up early and was preparing to go out, and he called me an uber and kissed me goodbye on the lips.

I reflected on this again and it's been a pattern that I do when I get too scared of liking someone, it's like I start stirring issues so I sabotage the relationship before it even starts. I recollected myself and sent him a long text opening up, thanking him for the night, and apologising for the disappointment at the end of it and told him it started to overwhelm me a little bit. He replied ""Sure, I want you to feel comfy and I don't want to meet you if you're not 100% into it. if you feel this is too much let's stop seeing each other for a while."" . I then agreed, and I said I wanted to meet again in 2 weeks time. He said ""ping me back in a week and we'll see"".

I sure want to ""ping"" him again. But I really don't want to screw this up. I feel like I moved too fast by sleeping with him so soon, and I want to reset that. At the same time, he a naturally dominating man and I get the feeling that he won't see me if we don't sleep or suggest that we don't sleep. I know he is likely sleeping with other people because he pretty much told me that.

I so want us to work properly but I'm too scared to be used. I want some honest feedback into this situation. I have dated and dated so many times and it's not very often I meet a guy like this.

Here's what's up:

I'm 33 years old, and I never been in a relationship before.  I created a Hinge and Bumble back in February because I definitely want to meet someone and date.  I am not happy being alone.  At least I'm definitely not happy with being alone for 33 years.  I'm not getting any younger.

[Here is my Hinge profile](https://imgur.com/a/EczYxXc)

I currently work as a substitute teacher, and I start the credential program in August.  It's two semesters, and I'm living at home with my parents while I complete it.  I have good credit, no debt and probably 6 months of savings built up.  The program itself is paid for via scholarship, yet because of it conflicting with my work schedule, it makes financial sense to live at home while I knock it out.

I have been on a total of seven dates.  Half of them rejected me after hearing about my job / living situation.  One woman left about one minute later after she learned I lived at home with my mom and dad (coffee date).

Half of them I just wasn't attracted to whatsoever.  Like I just couldn't force myself to be attracted to someone when I'm not, and it wouldn't be fair for me to waste their time.

I don't quite know what else to do.  I currently have a few matches on Hinge, but they're completely indifferent to chatting with me.  Two women I had dates scheduled for, flaked out the morning of (which is okay no worries).

Obviously I have to constant thought of: wtf is wrong with me?  Like why does the most natural part of life exclude me?  My cousin was telling me not to worry about it, but it's easy for him to say when he's had relationship experiences before.

Texted this morning to make sure we're still good for today. A bit later got a response that they didn't see us going anywhere and they didn't want to lead me on. I kind of had feeling this might be coming, since we had been communicating pretty regularly through most of our interactions. But the last 2/3 days, they had gone a bit radio silence on me. I chalked it up to me overthinking things. Still, it's why I texted to confirm.

Okay, first off all fair and dandy. They have their feelings and they're welcome to them. And I'm in no way saying they have to suck it up and go anyways when they aren't comfortable or whatever. But ya know it just would be nice to get a better heads up on that then the day of. Preferably before I make a reservation like that.

This question is geared more towards my end but affects most of my relationships in life. My girlfriend (27f) and I (27m) have been dating for a year and several months. I essentially have problems listening, soothing and being able to know how to navigate the emotional needs of others including my partner. This may be long so feel free to skip to the bottom.

I've noticed that ever since I was a kid I have trouble paying attention to certain details in life but I'm able to pick up on others. For example if someone is talking to me about a life story or they may be complaining and really stressed out about something in life, sometimes I might just sort of check out and pay attention to only some details. However, sometimes I'm able to pick up on other details that interest me about who they are that other people usually can't. Like I can draw conclusions of who they are, what they like, or where they have been by paying attention to their clothing choices or tattoos, or other visuals. Where when I'm with other people they'll note about how I may be hyper aware or note like wow oh I didn't even notice that about them but I do.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid but never really found that to be accurate. Medications I would take, different dosages, brands etc, never worked. It would either turn me into a zombie with a super slow heart rate or not work at all.

So, in romantic relationships I have trouble understanding the true nuanced tonal message of what they are trying to tell me. The actual truth, or key thing that a person needs to feel soothes when they're expressing their concerns, stresses or venting to me about things. My current partner has vented to me about things, or when she gets super stressed out sometimes I feel that it is impossible to soothe her. As a man, I've been trying really hard to not go into man mode and just try to fix her problems. But when I try to emotionally connect it is super hard. It's super easy to minimize the problem by not thinking it's hard, when the reality is that my partner is super stressed out even if the problem in really isn't that big of a deal. Sometimes my partner does stress out about super small things like spilling coffee on her pant leg will literally ruin her day and I feel that I cannot soothe her. This also makes it hard to keep track of what I can do to distract her and have fun when times are tough and it makes me feel stuck.

I've been recognizing this through therapy and talking to people as well as through school that maybe my mother has a lot to do with these problems. Growing up as a single mom with abusive parents this definitely affected how I was raised too. She also is very overwhelming as a person and growing up I hadn't really felt like I could express myself fully. This may manifest in handling all my problems myself and not asking for help when I need it. Being stubborn. Checking out when I'm listening to the concerns of others etc.

For anyone in astrology I am a Leo Rising Pisces Sun, Aquarius Moon with a fixed cross.

I had a break up from a serious 1.5 year relationship 4 months ago. I went on two dates via tinder recently

The first was a dud but nice conversation.

The second led to making out. She thought there was a connection but before we went a second date, I thought against it. There were enough ‘yellow’ flags that suggested it would not be a good fit personally, even though I though she might be fun to hang with and/or sex. 

I feel a bit stuck. I think it would be fun to date casually but I don’t feel like I know what to do. 

Historically I tend to get monogamous quickly and I want to slow that pattern down. I’m also focused on work so that’s we’re I really want to put my time.

Sometimes he texts all the time, random questions. We have long text chats for like 2 hours and he replies instantly.

He told me he wants to meet soon but asked if I’m okay waiting a little bit as he’s starting a new job tomorrow and doesn’t know his shift pattern. He’s seemed less positive this week

He also has stopped texting as much. And I have to initiate a bit more. Before he was texting loaaads but this week if I don’t text he won’t. But he still texts for a few hours if I talk.

We haven’t met yet but I hope I do",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,911323,public,self,If he doesn’t text every day does this mean he’s lot interest?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ooweqz/if_he_doesnt_text_every_day_does_this_mean_hes/,all_ads,6,,dating,,,
