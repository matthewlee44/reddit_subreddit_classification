Hello, [r/dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/)

Just to preface - I'm new to dating

I  need some advice on my predicament. Over the last few weeks I went on 3  dates with a woman and we had a swell time - we're both in our  early/mid 20s. During our most recent date I noticed some, what I  thought were, red flags:

1. Calling herself ugly - saying she looks gross (Who doesn't have self esteem issues - lord knows I do)
2. Asking  me 2 times if I had any red flags (Maybe there was a red flag she was  hiding - I'm going to attribute this to overthinking)
3. She  told me she liked me a few times and I was easy on the eyes (Red flag  at the time since I wasn't used to this - who would ""like"" my ass - I'm  overweight so its kinda weird to hear that)

So  I did the classic ""Go home and over think things into oblivion"". I then  decided to tell her I wasn't feeling a connection and we should stop.

Since  then I've been having second thoughts - Maybe I should have stuck it  out for a while longer. I felt as though my decision was a bit rash  (I've been trying to be a move decisive person recently so I just said  fuck it this is what I'm doing while still being a bit confused).  Thinking about it now she was pretty quiet at the beginning and began to  open up a bit more and probably would have continued to do so after.  She was pretty cool when talkative so its not like her personality was a  problem. There is also a bit of nervousness on my part so I think that  affected my decision making.

So for my questions

1. Would  it be appropriate to try and get back with her (I think there may be a  better word to use here, ""rekindle"" maybe?). We went on 3 dates and had a  4th planned. I'd rather do something and regret doing it then regret  not acting - like I see on [r/LifeProTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/) all the time.
2. If yes, then do I just be honest and tell her basically what I told all of you? Whats the game plan here?

Additionally  - If I'm being a moron here please tell me. I'm new to this so I'm  trying to process all of the view points and information here, although  it can be difficult.

Thanks for your help in advance.

My ex and I have agreed to this separation and both feel that it was better for us. We are only keeping it a separation due to financial situations at the moment that we are not able to handle at this time. We do support that if we do find ""other partners"" that we would like to marry, that then filing for divorce of course has to be done. But for ourselves we do not want to pursue a reconciliation. We were married for 14 years and have known one another for over 17 years so we just parted on friendly terms. We share our 12-year-old daughter, who lives with her mother in another city, 3 hours away, and I get to have her stay with me every other weekend or sometimes longer depending on our schedules. I am currently a full-time student that is completing a Bachelor’s in Mechatronics Engineering (1.5years left), but if I decide to pursue a Master’s would be 2.5 years. I am not the typical untraditional student. I do work to support my lifestyle and provide for my child, have a house, car, trucks, and motorcycle and such.

Been trying to get back in the dating scene after 17 years, and holy shit have times changed! Tried going to malls, Sam’s Club, or Costco, because I don’t drink or hang out at bars. I know like attracts like but it is hard to find women who are into my lifestyle Hunting, fishing, camping, shooting (lots of guns and a conceal carrier), mechanic, tattoo artist, candle and soap maker, mixed martial artist, and whatever else you can think of. I do not think I am better than anyone else, I just work hard to get what I need and have. If I need something done, I get it done. Anyways, I’ve been told by women they are always in a relationship, typical response! I then tried online dating since I met my ex on Match, but that’s even worse. Found one gal I am interested in, named Kris. She didn’t have a subscription but posted that she worked at a flower shop that I was familiar with.

One day, I built up the “courage” to stop in at this flower shop after a doctor appointment. She wasn’t there, because I just missed her going to lunch, but left my number with a gal there. Surprisingly, she texted me! I told her that I saw her profile on Match and that she mentioned she worked there, and thought I would stop in, but I missed her, which was a bummer. She said, “I’m here now! 😊 Till 5…”, I then added, “Awesome! Can I come visit you? Didn’t know if you were free, and didn’t want to intrude.”, she: “Sure! If we get busy, I have to work though…” Of course, I understood that. I lastly said, “No worries…I’ll stop by in about an hour.” I had a meeting. I went and met her and I thought we had a nice introduction where we began talking about how we hated online dating, then of course, a customer walks in trying to get flowers for a gal he liked. The guy was trying to figure out what to say in the card because he was trying to be a secret admirer…he was old by the way. I tried helping him out with his message and then finally after a long wait he was leaving thinking the flowers were going to be delivered. Kris came back out asking if he left and I said I believe so, she said crap I need to tell him that we are not able to deliver these. I asked if she would like me to go stop the guy real fast because I knew which vehicle he was in, she said yeah, so I ran stopped and she handled that issue. After she cam back in and said that she was sorry, but she had to get back to work because she had some orders to get done. I said that was cool, but also asked if she would like to go get some dinner after work. She said that she could because she had to get home to her kids. I then said if she had time this weekend, and she said that maybe I need to find a reliable babysitter because her teenage daughter is kind of flakey. I said that’s cool and I understand, because I too have a daughter that does that. I went home, waited an hour and texted her saying how nice it was to talk to her briefly and how she interacted with people. I now know I made the mistake of offering to take her to lunch some time if it is more convenient, after watching your video! Mentioned that I hope our schedules agree soon so we can speak again, and that if she wanted to text me that she can or call whenever. Told her, “Talk to you later.” Then on Sunday, I texted her, “Good morning! How was your week? Hopefully, it wasn’t too busy…” No response, which I figure she is probably either busy or ignoring, but I never assume. I was just going to let it ride out and probably stop in at the flower shop on Friday like I did after my doctor appointment just to get an honest vibe.

I was so happy about the last post I made most people were very kind to my question. 

I have a bit of an issue approaching women. The first problem is my schedule. I am a full time uni student and also working full time in order to pay for each semester so as not to have student loans. So far this is going great because I have no loans, the issue is I have no time in my day for social activities. For example my Monday consists of classes from 8-12 traveling to then work out at the gym, then heading to my job and working until 10pm. Once I get home it's time to shower and complete my assignments before heading off to bed to start again. The weekends would be a great time to approach but considering a lot of my interest aren't that popular with Americans in general let alone women it wouldn't really be much good. I live spending the weekend watching F1 and IndyCar for example but I don't like football or basketball. I am not a drinker and I don't like (nor can i) dance so partying isn't my thing either. 

Here is where the question comes in. I have a gym partner she is very kind and we workout together. The thing is I met her at the gym at 11pm on a weeknight and when we met we were the only two in the gym. Now I have read many times here that women HATE being approached at the gym unless they are not pressed for time and are finishing up their workouts. The things is since that is the only public place I go to on a daily basis and there are plenty of women that frequent the gym what do I do. Do I try to approach them knowing that it might be the only chance me and this young lady come to the gym at the same time? Or do I leave it be and just continue my lack of success on old. 

I feel that my hobbies would be well received in every country but the USA like my love for Dubstep and my love for F1 and WEC. But sadly I feel like I was born in the wrong country 😅

Also I should add if you haven't see my last post that I am a natural body builder and a black male at that so I find it quite shocking that the young lady I did meet in the gym didn't call the police on me. 

I also should say that I get super nervous when approaching women because I am a person that likes to make everyone around me happy and comfortable so that thought of having someone upset at me really keeps me from doing anything sometimes. 

So much more I could add but I hope everyone gets what my delima is. I also hope I have not offended anyone because that is not what I am trying to do.

Tldr: super busy schedule and hobbies that don't really lend to social setting in my country. The gym seems like a good place to meet ladies since many frequent the gym but most women here say that it is a big no no.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1042871,public,self,I need a little help with my approaching,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0vjgf/i_need_a_little_help_with_my_approaching/,all_ads,6,,,,

I honestly hope she didn’t think of any of our interactions as creepy. That wasn’t my attempt. 

Anyways, all my friends are getting engaged, getting married, having children, and leaving the area in all different directions and states, and I’m starting to realize how lonely adult life can be for single people most days.
The problem is that I seriously can’t envision myself with a girlfriend. It’s like envisioning me as suave, classy businessman who is confident in his personality, looks and abilities.  
I get self conscious about a dozen things when interacting with people I desire to impress, and this doesn’t even mean ladies, just people at work or in group activities. 

It’s so hard for me to actually imagine having a woman in my life who accepts me for who I am, my struggles with mental health, and my insecurities. I try to imagine a man who’s confident in his ability to kiss a girl or take her on dates, but I honestly don’t know that form of “me”, obviously because it doesn’t exist yet. 

I just would like advice because I can’t help but get depressed when I look on social media at all the happy friends of mine that have made their whole world their relationship and seem genuinely happy with that- and it makes me feel that I truly missed out something valuable or possibly even essential. 

I don’t want to come off creepy or cringy when flirting with girls nor do I want to burn bridges with women friends because I asked one of them out and she says “no” and now things are awkward between us…

My brother has been trying like crazy to find a girlfriend and continues to be rejected and honestly, that level of dedication only to be dropped over and over again makes me nervous about trying the whole online dating thing, but not sure how else to meet girls who are open to going on dates.

I get a majority of my messages from bots and any matches I do get disappear within the week. People are slow to respond but asking for a phone number because of these shitty apps is somehow ""too fast."" I literally don't understand that because we are talking on a dating app which is on your phone, I see your name and location, besides the fact we were already talking when I ask for the number. Little side rant there.

I don't feel like I take good pictures at all and don't know how to really update a good sense of fashion. I would like some advice if this is even my problem or whatever but idk.

I feel really weird going out to bars and stuff by myself. It's always like people stare me down like I'm the weirdest, creepiest person alive and I'm just out there nervous as fuck that people keep staring at me. Lol So I guess I should just get out more but I have been wanting friends to go out with for a little comfort. I have some good bar games I think would be fun to try if anybody would be interested from this post. I am living in Orlando FL where I just moved last month. :)

I really don't know what is going on though. I ask a woman on a date, she says yes, and I offer a day and place to go. Then they start to act like I'm a creep. Or they open my message asking for a date and then ghost me even after we have the ""what are you looking for"" conversation and we both want to date.

I actually just had somebody block me because they said being a fan of manga/anime is really important for them. I was explaining how I haven't had tv service for a long time but I have been wanting to watch shows for a long time. Another side rant, the anime/manga community is surprisingly quiet whenever I ask for a show recommendation which is a separate annoyance.

Ugh, I am just struggling a lot and I don't know why nobody wants to talk with me. I don't feel like I ever show frustration with people or that I'm too weird. Saying that I haven't been able to watch any type of shows in over a year because I have been working 2 jobs doesn't seem like something to block a person over but it happens to me at least twice a day. I really only get frustrated after the profile just disappears at the most random times so I don't think it's how I speak to people.

My chats are normally pretty good too I would think. I try to avoid one word answers and be open. As an introvert, this is really difficult and people that keep saying ""life of the party!!!"" love to respond with yes, no, idk or whatever so chats are sometimes really hard for no good reason. I can get not being interested in me, but why bother messaging me if you can't fake interest?

One girl was met off a dating app, went on a date, and had sex at the end of the night. I enjoyed her personality and a day or two later began texting her more. Her verbage got really slow and stale so I stopped texting her. The end.

Next girl I met out at a bar in town. Hit it off went to multiple bars. Kissed a lot exchanged numbers and went our seperate ways. She texted me and we had good conversation and had plans to go out on a date. Something came up a few days later that made it not possible for her to make it we suggested a week later would work better. Again, our conversations began to degrate and again, the end.

In the last few months I've been randomly out in public and just run into a girl working somewhere. Met a charming southern girl while traveling and talked to her for literally a moment. All she did was tell me they were closing at a certain time and that was it.

I had a feeling like I thought she a pretty, clean face, liked her personality being rural and country, and like she was educated. It wasn't any sort of lust, more like I would like to stop and talk to you more in a friendly way. But not to just be a friend or something, a little more.

A couple of times looking at videos a similar feeling happened. Just had another thing today where a girl with a pretty face and nice personality said hello to me where she was working. It was like she gave off a positive energy similar to above because she had a pretty face and a very warm southern personality. I notice a lot more intensely like personality, how nice their hair is arranged, eyes, pretty face.

What is this? I've never had experiences like this before and don't know what they mean. It's foreign to me.

The best way I can put it is it's like I'm drawn into their face and or personality without explanation even when it's a video when they're talking.

I get a majority of my messages from bots and any matches I do get disappear within the week. People are slow to respond but asking for a phone number because of these shitty apps is somehow ""too fast."" I literally don't understand that because we are talking on a dating app which is on your phone, I see your name and location, besides the fact we were already talking when I ask for the number. Little side rant there.

I don't feel like I take good pictures at all and don't know how to really update a good sense of fashion. I would like some advice if this is even my problem or whatever but idk.

I feel really weird going out to bars and stuff by myself. It's always like people stare me down like I'm the weirdest, creepiest person alive and I'm just out there nervous as fuck that people keep staring at me. Lol So I guess I should just get out more but I have been wanting friends to go out with for a little comfort. I have some good bar games I think would be fun to try if anybody would be interested from this post. I am living in Orlando FL where I just moved last month. :)

I really don't know what is going on though. I ask a woman on a date, she says yes, and I offer a day and place to go. Then they start to act like I'm a creep. Or they open my message asking for a date and then ghost me even after we have the ""what are you looking for"" conversation and we both want to date.

I actually just had somebody block me because they said being a fan of manga/anime is really important for them. I was explaining how I haven't had tv service for a long time but I have been wanting to watch shows for a long time. Another side rant, the anime/manga community is surprisingly quiet whenever I ask for a show recommendation which is a separate annoyance.

Ugh, I am just struggling a lot and I don't know why nobody wants to talk with me. I don't feel like I ever show frustration with people or that I'm too weird. Saying that I haven't been able to watch any type of shows in over a year because I have been working 2 jobs doesn't seem like something to block a person over but it happens to me at least twice a day. I really only get frustrated after the profile just disappears at the most random times so I don't think it's how I speak to people.

My chats are normally pretty good too I would think. I try to avoid one word answers and be open. As an introvert, this is really difficult and people that keep saying ""life of the party!!!"" love to respond with yes, no, idk or whatever so chats are sometimes really hard for no good reason. I can get not being interested in me, but why bother messaging me if you can't fake interest?

I made a post earlier this week if you want any background info. As I said in the other post I’m a guy who deals with women only directly for sex and no relationships so basically FWB and I tell all the girls I deal with this upfront and they are ok with it. 

I also tell them I will be talking to other girls too and they are fine with that. Up until this one girl everything was fine. So me and the girl I’m talking about hit things off pretty quick. 

After about two weeks of good times this girl asked me to cutt off any connections with other girls and claim her as my girlfriend. I told her no and that if what I was doing was problem then I should end it so no one ends up upset and that we were bound to leave each other anyway. 

So i ended things. But she went NUTS. After I stoped talking to her she blew up my phone, broke into my house while I was asleep. She also watched my house sitting in a car accross the street. She ran me down in a gym parking lot. She was hiding in my car and then a few days ago after I tried to talk to her in a public diner she threatened me with a knife.

However I have two major concerns may be distancing himself. After our last date yesterday night he said he’d need to check his calendar to see when we could meet again when previously it’s been very “whenever you have time I’ll make it work”. And I feel the texting has slowed down a bit. 

We still text every day and he occasionally initiates but it’s definitely less. In addition to him saying he’s interested, there are a few other points in his favor.

I even apologized to him that I am rambling because I'm nervous. Bless him, he was probably too nice to kick me out. We didn't exchange number. 

It's been 2 days and I still feel miserable about it. Huge part of it was cause I was being an idiot and kept him from leaving, that was so wrong of me, I feel so bad and really want to kick myself. It's obvious he's not interested cause we didn't exchange number in the end despite him saying he enjoyed tonight (white lies probably). I guess some part of my ego feels a little bruise hence why I'm feeling miserable. 

Told my friends to relay my apologies to him for keeping him after he sent me back, I'm not sure if they did, they just keep on saying don't be silly he thinks I'm nice.

I (M) was colleague with this girl until she quit at the start of the school year and it so happens we go at the same college. We share a class and usually spend our dinner breaks together (she often stays during my break for a long time even if she’s finished with school for the day) and we hang out! We always have a good laugh and a good time like we are good friends even though we’ve known each other for only a few months.

I feel like I like her and am wondering if I should ask her out! (Or how to do so but that is a different story).

Here’s the catch. I’m not good at picking up signals (have been told in the past) and can’t really grasp what a few things should mean.
First, she sometimes tell me how I’m not interested in going out with her or things of the sort ( I have never said anything of the like even though our relationship has started very platonically).       Is this a flatline sign that she is not interested?
Because on the other hand, there is times like it feels like she’s hitting on me?

Ex: we were talking about coffee sometimes (yes very random) and she said she dosent drink coffee but that I could offer her one (sounds like a date nah?)
Ex #2: Very playful and kinda touchy
Ex #3: Commenting on my style

Girl 2 I tried kissing after at the 4th date, but she was not ready for it.  She is warm and caring, and enjoys holding hands, so I'm confident of her interest level in me.  In the longer-term, this would just be a small blip on the radar if we ended up continuing to date.  

**BUT, I'm used to things moving much quicker physically.  I don't think it's unreasonable to be encouraged with her level of interest in me, AND at the same time be frustrated in the here and now.  After she refused the kiss, I told her I think of her as a good friend (which I think kind of flustered her; maybe in her mind she's already thinking of us as a couple, who knows).  Thoughts?**

As an aside, one of the Chinese girls I was originally just friends with wanted to date.  She was plenty attractive enough, but after she told me upfront that it may take her several months before she felt comfortable having sex (she's had a number of sexual partners in the past), I told her we should just continue to be friends, because I would become frustrated and anxious.

He also keeps saying how I’m complicating his life by encouraging him to move to the UK, and that his life was so simple before meeting me (yes – at 42 he’d never had a partner and his mum did his cooking, cleaning, ironing, etc., so it was definitely a simple life for him).

I’ve been working out the past 2 years, I’ve been trying to work on myself and just meeting people naturally instead of using online dating sites, but for the past 2 years every time I meet a girl that’s in my league. They reject me. Like 75% of the time they sayer or laugh or tell me I’m ugly or whatever. The craziest thing is that they’re in my league.

It’s like they’re going out of their way to hurt my feelings. I have on more than one occasion cried because when I go and talk to a girl at a party or if I match with her online, she just lays into my appearance. And I don’t mean my hygiene or the way dress (which I’m told is great), I mean the way my face is shaped. 

It’s just so unnecessary. I’m not being rude to them, sometimes they’re rude to me before I even finish the first sentence. Like this one time, I was at a party and saw this one girl who looked like she was fun to be around and in my league and I went up to try to start a conversation with her and before I introduced myself she interrupted and said and I quote, “Do you really think you have a chance with me? Really? You’re not cute so maybe go back to your little friends”.

Like I don’t think I’d be bothered by this if it was a rare occurrence but it happens literally so often. I don’t know what I’m doing to make people want to treat me like this.

Ok so I see a lot of “what should I say?” “What did I do wrong?” “What should I wear?” Etc etc. What if we help each other out by dating each other…ok hold up just listen…I was thinking we could compile a list of people in this group who are willing and able to participate in “pseudo dating” in hopes to go on a mock date and then swap feedback afterward. Obviously most of these would probably have to be done via zoom or something of the like, but I still think it could be helpful. We would make up a spreadsheet with identifying info to help ensure our mock dates are similar to someone we would want to date irl (and if someone ends up getting married from this idea you have to invite me to your wedding)

Had this for years. It's been like this for years and I'm at my wits end about how to deal with it. 
It's always the same cycle: I will meet a girl, either online or through some other means. We hit it off, and it's great. The conversation is flowing, natural, cheeky, and just super fun. We set up a date. The date goes great. Great chemistry, with my partner being super interested, super into it, and everything's great. then it ends and I get home. Realize I'm starting to care about the girl, about how things go, and I freeze up. Completely. 

The chemistry from before disappears because I'm overthinking everything. Conversation is stilted, unnatural, boring, and probably a bit creepy for them. The girl will then either disappear before the second date, or after because of how badly it goes. Because I've started to care about them and want to see them again, so I'm playing everything as safe as possible and desperately trying to recapture what was there before rather than just relaxing and being myself. When I start to get feelings for someone, I pretty much just become a nervous wreck, wasting everything. I'm fine once we're in a relationship, but the lead up to it cripples me. It's like I need constant reassurance from them that they're interested. I don't understand it.

This has happened more times than I can count. I have pushed more girls away like this than I even want to think about. There's only been two women in my life where for some reason I was able to at least keep it under control. The last being 3 years ago. I distinctly remember thinking ""I don't know why she likes me, I'm not doing anything. Oh well, enjoy it while it lasts"", but that's about it. 

The worst part: I do not have this issue with women I do not find particularly attractive or am not that interested in, as I don't particularly care whether they stay or go.
This means I have a string of relationships with women who have thrown themselves at at me, and I don't push them away because I don't care, so it lasts until I end it. Hurting them because I never should have got with them in the first place. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of hurting people and getting hurt. And it's happening again right now. I went on one of the best dates I've ever been on last week. It was fantastic. It felt like we'd known each other for years, we talked for hours, hugged and held hands on the way home. I care about how this goes. I miss her and want to see her again. But it's happening again and I can already feel her slipping away. The openness and lack of pressure and laughter is already gone. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know why I get this wierd performance anxiety and just stop being normal. Had anybody dealt with this? Is there anyway to get past this? I don't want to end up settling for someone I don't love because I can't keep my shit together.

1. Despite being incredibly witty and having great banter with everyone, me included, she can't take a genuine compliment. I once told her she looked like a female celebrity and all she could do was give an adorable smile and not even look me in the eye.

2. She's comfortable with and even smiles when I touch her or we're in close proximity. One night, we were watching a movie with a few friends and huddled up against each other with our shoulders touching. She didn't budge at all and seemed comfortable and relaxed.

3. She's an absolutely awful texter, but she keeps in pretty regular contact with me through texting despite telling me that she hates it.

4. Within days and at one point even BEFORE we became friends, she told me quite personal stuff about her life, like her relationship with her family, her home life and her past dating life. She even went on to tell me that she uses Tinder as a joke and what her past relationship was actually like. I'd consider her a fairly open person, but this seems a bit much for someone you've only become friends with recently.

5. She compliments me on my looks and personality - she's told me that she thinks I'm funny and that I have 'charm'. Another time, we were jokingly talking about what animals we would be and she said I'd be an otter because otters are 'cute'.

We had a small lunch date on Friday. Yesterday I took her for an official date. We met on bumble. 

I did my best to be a gentleman, opening doors and being polite.  I got her flowers, her mom flowers and her daughter a pumpkin. 

I took her to dinner at Ruth Chris, we had great conversation  the entire time. With in the date we setup another date for tomorrow, where she was going to make me a dessert, (she volunteered). After dinner we went to the grocery store to buy the ingredients for the dessert. She found out a week ago that she has celiac, she can’t eat gluten so we spent about an hour at the store looking for these items. 

I thought we were connecting great. She was laughing and flirting the entire time. (That was my perception anyway) 

We leave the store to go drop her off at her house. We were sitting in my car chatting for a minute. She gives me a look, I thought she was hinting for me to kiss her. She was about to get out of the car, I ask her for a kiss. I didn’t just go in, I asked her. She covers her face in embarrassment and says she is not ready for that. I made her feel extremely awkward and embarrassed. 

I help her unload the groceries I just bought for her. I wish her well, she gives me a hug and she kisses on the cheek. I drove home in shame and embarrassment.

Anyhow I feel embarrassed for misreading the whole situation, especially for making her feel uncomfortable. She is supposed to come over to my place this afternoon, I’m supposed to be cooking her a gluten free meal and she is supposed make dessert. I feel like the best course of action is to cancel the date, count my losses and move on.

Between these ages, I've spent a significant time travelling and had many short-term partners. The longest being about 3 or 4 months. Most of them have ended because I find myself not attracted to them anymore and stop putting in any effort, this then obviously causes frustration, arguments and eventually it will just fizzle away. Small things about partners seem to put me off when they shouldn't, like I'm expecting things to always be perfect. At first I'm really into it but after a few weeks I seem to build up reasons in my head why it's not right (travelling distance, appearance, different interests, etc). If this was a one-off then I probably wouldn't have thought much of it but considering this has repeated lots of times I cant help but think there's something wrong with my attitude to relationships as a whole.

I've been in 2 long-term relationships in my life.

The first ended with her cheating on me after a good few months of her clearly losing interest when I was deeply in love. I was about 17/18 and it was all quite traumatic, resulting in me spiraling into a good 12 months or so of depression. I now recognize that it was that typical young love/first love heartbreak situation and now look at it as a sort of learning experience.

My second long-term relationship ended quite badly with a lot of resentment. I was struggling to find time to focus on the relationship whilst also juggling work/studies and training for sports, it got to a point where we didn't spend a lot of time together and the time we did spend together I would be very tired. She would expect me to make sacrifices to my other commitments in order to create more time for her, this wasn't something I was prepared to do and this resulted in a series of arguments and a bad break up. A few months afterward, she then got with a friend of mine which obviously didn't go down very well. They are however still together, so I don't hold any grudges toward them as they are clearly a better match than me and her ever were.

Recently I've met someone new, like the title of the post says, on paper we should be a great match. She has a great personality, many similar interests, similar past, we both have decent jobs/careers, there's good chemistry and there's no real reason why I should lose interest.

But this time around the interested to not interested cycle has repeated in as short as 2 weeks or so. Pretty much immediately after we had sex for the first time. I now find myself not physically attracted to her whatsoever and have no desire to put in any effort to keep it going.

I've thought of lots of reasons why this is happening:

\- Them not being physically attractive enough

\- Them being too nice to me, like I need someone to keep me at arms length to keep me interested? When dating, the times they are clearly not interested I seem to want them more.

\- This ""when I've met the one, I wont lose interest"" idea

\- Maybe I'm gay? Although I pretty confident I'm not.

\- I'm that classic fuck-boy douchebag?

**TL;DR**

**M27 Cant hold down a relationship for any longer than a few months. Loses interest for various reasons. Newest partner on paper seems a good match but I have lost interest very quickly for no good reason, likely due to her being too nice/not attractive enough. Unsure whether I should approach it as an issue with my attitude to relationships or whether I'm just being honest to myself.**

We finally confessed and started dating 2 months ago. It's been 2 months and we still see each other only on weekends where we just sit and talk for 2 to 3 hrs. I would love to meet her atleast maybe twice or thrice a week but there has been no signs from her end. I never even gathered the courage to hold her hands till this date (yea ik go ahead make fun of me). I mean I feel like we have been really great friends for 5 years , so 2 months should've been enough to be official &amp; exclusive. Maybe I'm being too needy &amp; clingy or maybe she is losing interest idk. Please give me some perspective here guys. I can really use some advice at this point. I don't want to fuck up seriously.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1043879,public,self,Need help guys please,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q15l0e/need_help_guys_please/,all_ads,6,,,,
