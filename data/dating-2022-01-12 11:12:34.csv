I guess having a girl kinda made me lazy and I stopped talking to other girls in general, only a few old friends of course.

So I need tips, it can be your own ideas or websites, links, books (GOOD ONES, with examples and shi) about texting. These days I find kinda hard to text a new girl, I LITERALLY don't know what to say to crack her up and have a fun conversation. I'm basically only having boring convos. Especially after I get girl's number from instagram for instance, then the conversation gets boring real quick when we're texting for real. And when and how should I ask for the date?

I just need to find my rhythm again, you know? But at the same time I'm tired of these games of ignoring each other back and forth and compete to see who shows less emotions, but anyway since the world's like this now, I have no choice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2bhnh/broke_up_with_my_gf_got_lazy_and_now_i_have_no/
1,s2bi2q,1642007854,"I was 17 and I was 23 when we started dating, we've been together for 3 years now.","Hello, this is not something i used to think a lot about, specially when we  started dating but lately, maybe because i spend a lot of time on twitter, feel a bit worried i might be somehow something bad for my girlfriend.

I want to clarify that we were both inmigrants at the time (not in the US, we've never been there), we met online around 3 years and so ago, at that time i think i partially didn't think much of the age gap because we were both just inmigrants looking for a job, that was both of our stages at life.   


At the time she was really unhappy at the town where she was living on,she decided to runaway from her home and moved with me at the city (i was not living alone at the time, she essentially moved with my family), i took care of her for some months while she was looking for jobs and landed one where i worked at the time. Our relationship since then had its dark times but most of the time it has been really good, we've done a lot of things together and shared a lot of experiences. She has mentioned a lot i am her best relationship so far (i didn't really had any relationship experience prior being with her). I have brought this concern to her many times and she honestly seems to not care much, we agreed that moving together so soon was dumb but that's it.

  
As the years passed and our life feel more ""normal"" now i think more on the age gap and think it might have been too weird for me to date her then, i don't know if its even worth to care anymore since we're both on our 20's now. Every of our friends say it was ok, my best friend, who's around my age says it was weird but really its fine now. 

I guess, i am looking for opinnions from people who is not going to be nice to me just because i am their friend, i'd like to know if you guys think it was wrong or just, well, weird.

2,s2bnzn,1642008239,Not sure where to go from here.,"(sorry for late out, mobile user)
So to be more specific I'm not sure how to fix my dating life or how to change these outcomes. Most recently, constantly getting ghosted. Now for me it's easy to move on from a ghost because most of the time you can already kind of get a vibe that it's not going well, but this last one has me fucked up. 

Background, me and this guy will call Alec (not real name) started seeing each other beginning of November, and it was great. We went on one or two days a week, always lasting a couple hours had good conversations, the works. And then, the last time I saw him. After we went out to eat and we were sitting in a parking lot talking, HE decided to bring up the exclusive conversation.  And asked where we were heading if we were wanting to make this a more serious thing, to a try said yes my goal ultimately was to find a boyfriend. He seemed super happy about it, asked if we wanted to just start with being exclusive before putting a full label on it and I thought that was an appropriate step, not just jumping fully into being a couple but like step one. And then, ghost. 

We talked one or two times after this, both conversations started and ended by me and with just one or two word answers from him. Asked if he wasn't really interested in me anymore and if he wasn't I would leave him alone to which he said no he was definitely still interested, he's just ""bad at texting when hes busy"" now for context, he had been texting me all the time up until this point, and had been telling me up until this point that he was busy with work so for some reason now he's too busy to text me. (I strongly believe no one is too busy to send a single text, you know maybe for a single day when time just gets away from you but not for over a week) So I left them alone for a couple more days hit him up again, same thing just one or two word answers. And that was it, gone. 

Now again I can handle getting ghosted if it came after a couple dates and we'd never really had any serious conversations. But the part that's really screwing me up, why ask me if I want to be exclusive with you to ghost me 2 Days later? Why ask me if I'm considering you as a serious partner, if you're just going to ghost me? I feel like I'm at the point with dating where I have no strength left. This was the first guy in months that I could get to even show up to a date (last FOUR guys before him stood me up for every single day we planned) and I just feel hopeless. 

So I guess my question is , why do you think he would ask me to be exclusive just to ghost me days later with no explanation? Has this happened to anyone else with a person gave no hints beforehand that they weren't interested and did literally the opposite where they were driving these conversations of wanting to be serious wanting to keep seeing you and then just ghosting?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2bnzn/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/
3,s2bodr,1642008271,Mid-life self-reinvention. Should I even try to date?,"Hi all, I’m going through a confusing time in my life WHILE trying to date and I am looking for advice. 

So not only does covid make dating harder, but last year I went through several life changing things that are causing me to reinvent myself and I don’t think I’m presenting myself in a way that is beneficial.

Examples:
-I quit drinking after a decade of alcohol abuse 

-my dog that I was attached at the hip with passed away. She was the closest thing to family I’ve ever had. 

-I have changed careers from hospitality to what I spent a lifetime trying to get into; furniture making and carpentry

-I have moved back to my home town. All my friends have started their own families so networking has been hard.

Should I wait until I feel more comfortable with these changes before I put myself out there? 

I went on a date with someone and we seemed to click and had so many things in common but I got ghosted on the second date. I worry with all these changes I’m just not myself or not exuding enough confidence in my “new life”

Feeling very deflated because aside from my dog passing these are all changes that would theoretically make me MORE able to start a serious relationship yet something is happening with me and how I’m behaving that I just can’t put my finger on leading to what feels like a no doubter second date but getting ghosted instead.

8,s2c9ug,1642009760,Am I misinterpreting things?,"Obligatory English is not my first language! 

So before I start let me give you some backstory:

I (20F) met this guy (26M) at work. He’s totally my type, i get nervous around him, he’s chill. We don’t talk much, mainly because he’s not much of a talker and I’m shy, especially around him. Another coworker asks him at lunch if I’m his type while I’m there making the whole situation awkward. After work he texts me to apologize and tells me he thinks I’m cute. We’re both free on the same days next week so he invites me to come over and ‚netflix and chill‘. We talk the entire week about our interests and stuff. The day comes, I come over, we hang out, drink a bit, then hook up. Next day we see each other at work. He asks me if I want to come over again, I say yes. We both said that we’re not sure we’re ready for a relationship yet since we both just got out of our respective ones. I like him, he likes me too and tells me. We repeatedly hang out, hook up, but then both realize we’re not really fit for a relationship and want to stay friends. We talk about a lot of personal stuff. One of the things that made me not want anything serious with him was that he doesn’t put in any effort to get to know me and doesn’t open up so I don’t really know a lot about him. He opens up to me at 3 am about something traumatic that happened to him 6 years ago which explains why he doesn’t let people get too close to him. It all kinda makes sense now? After that I tell him some of my SA and childhood trauma because I feel I can trust him with this.

Now here comes the part that confuses me. We both said we just want to be friends, jokingly said we might hook up again if we’re both desperate. He invites me to watch Harry Potter (he just recently got into it because I said that everybody should’ve seen HP at least once in their life). We watch the movie, watch another two movies I think? Then fall asleep with a bit of distance between each other. During the night he puts his arm around me and we cuddle. The next morning we sleep with each other. 
Usually when I slept over at his place the atmosphere between us was weird the morning after but this time it wasn’t, everything was very relaxed, instead of being silent the whole time he talks to me about normal stuff, asks me about my plans for the day. He wanted me to stay for lunch but I had to leave since I had things to do. That day he hung out with a mutual friend and according to her she told him that we’re both very similar and in her eyes would make a good couple.
That same evening he asks if he can come over. That was the first time he’s stayed at my place. I was really nervous because I just moved there and everything’s still chaos. He comes over, we watch HP part 5, then go to bed and hook up. Twice. And it was better than before. He was so caring, gave me little kisses everywhere, and after we both finished we were cuddling. We fell asleep with our bodies literally intertwined. I haven’t slept that comfortable in a long time. We woke up, cuddled a bit, talked and kissed. And then he left for work and gave me a goodbye kiss, something he hasn’t done EVER. He then texted me and said it was a beautiful night and can’t wait to watch the other HP movies again.

He’s changed since we talked and he’s so much more open and loving and caring and I can’t help but wonder if maybe he wants more? I’m very confused right now but also don’t want to ask him about it because I don’t want to pressure him. Maybe we just need time? Should I talk to him about it now or should I wait? Am I getting my hopes up for nothing? I like him a lot and since he’s showed some effort maybe we could work out as a couple?

10,s2ccvb,1642009959,First date ended very badly,"We were having a great time, hugs, holding hands, kissed a few times. We smiled and laughed. Sure it was awkward sometimes but inwas expecting that for a first date.

Then we're sat at a table in a bar, I ask her if she was surprised when I gave her a kiss. A little bit, but she liked it. 

Then she told me quite out of the blue that she was concerned that I only liked her because I was lonely, she was the first person to give me attention in quite a long time and that I was just settling for her. In other words I was lonely, desperate and she was all I had. She said that she had options with her dating apps, whereas I mentioned that it was only her I was talking to on there.

It really soured the mood for me, and I didn't know how to react to this really. We sat in awkward silence for a while. I felt upset at her suggesting this to me in all honesty. 

We were planning on seeing a film afterwards but she decides to bail on me early, making up some excuse. Can't remember what but I'm not stupid, I know the mood went sour fast and she wanted to get away.

Am I being stupid for feeling upset when she said that to me? Because I actually really, really liked her genuinely, and for her to just question my motives like that because I don't have that many friends, it's been 6 years since my last relationship etc kind of hurt me. I am comfortable with who I am in all honesty.

Anyway not sure how to go forward with this. Normally a first date ends well with a hug, maybe a kiss and arranging the next one. But not this time, she said we need time apart after today. I take it as meaning she's not interested.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2ccvb/first_date_ended_very_badly/

15,s2cgi1,1642010224,did i do something wrong?,"So im gonna explain how i meet a guy who i been in a situationship for the past five months. (we both have just turned 19) so i started talking to this boy online, he was a highschool classmate and started talking every single day for three months after he asked me to go out. I asked him like three times beforehand but he would always say no. I thought it was time to let go but then he told me he had several problems he had to deal wirh based on past dating and that if i was patiencie he really would like to meet me. So we went on  a date, then another one, then the next one then one more and everything was perfect. he asked to go slowly but we didnt really, we  hooked up in the fourth date it just happened. the thing is we would never talk about a serious relationship even though we would chat all day, and know pretty much about each other. he didnt show me his family but so neither did i, i felt it was too much. The thing is one month afte rthe honymoon phase he went out to a party and met a girl, he never told me this but seems he really liked her. I felt he was acting weird but didnt point it out cause i thought i was being paranoic but then we didnt see each other for three weeks even though we would talk all day. After one week more he asked me to go out cause i didnt, i said yes but when i told him the plans for the date just canceled and i got angry. he noticed this and started texting more frequently, i wasnt very responsive and he panicked. after five days i asked him out again cause i wanted to talk about what to do. he agreed and we went on a normal date as if time hasnt passed, the thing is when i asked him what we were or where we were going he said ""for me is nothing serious yet but i would really like to be in a relationship with you if we know each other more, just not right now. maybe i should put more effort so this works."" 
I then asked if he was seeing other persons and he told me he had gone to two dates with another girl but they didnt talk anymore. he actually seemed pretty upset as he told me as he felt like he betrayed me. i said it was okay because we didnt have labels even though  i didnt like the idea of him with someone else i cant complain. afte rthat i asked him what he wanted to do and he said just like we are right now im comfortable, so i decided that if he wanted nothing serious then we shouldnt text every day and we could talk to other people. at first he didnt want me to talk to other guys cause hes a jealous person but nontheless said it was okay because we are not a couple.
And he wasnt really into the -stop texting  everyday- because probably it would lead to not talking anymore but said yes anyways.
after that we continued the date and everything was fine but then one week later i noticed he actually lied to me and was still talking to this girl. i decided i would not reach to him and if he wanted to talk to me he would, he did iniatite a conversation once or twice but he noticed i wouldnt iniate anything i just answered, so i guess he kind of give up. 
And so one week later i decided to take him off of closefriends in instagram, i didnt delete him from social media cause it was too much. 
he told one of my friends ""she ghosted me and i feel like she hates me i just dont know why"". 
the thing is not even a month passed and he was already going out with this girl(the one who he had two dates before) and seems so in love with her, commenting all her posts and such (things he never did with me) i know this cause i stalked him the other day out of curiosity and i just felt so bad. like why you do it with her so effortesly while i had to wait months to go out with you? why are you so invested to her but you didnt want to stop talking to me? why you didnt break things first if you liked someone else? it feels as if he wanted to go out with the other girl but didnt want to loose me.
but the thing that drives me crazy is , if he is so into her then why he still has me in his closefriends in instagram? sometimes he would delete me for a day then put me back on the list the next day. 

im not into this guy anymore, i decided to let him go but i still wonder time to time why he does this. like whats the point if u already have this girl(who seems like a pretty  cool person, i kind of feel bad for her too as if i know something she doesnt)
i wasnt enough? i was a plan b or she was a plan b? he confused me so much and i feel hurt but know hes not worth it. just wanted to know your insight in this situation guys and if u can give me an advice.

I posted here a few days ago but I’m back with more questions, lol.

I’m (22M) very new to dating, never dated anyone, never been on a date., never had a girlfriend, I know that sounds bad but this is what I’m working with. 

I matched with a great girl on an app (21F) and our chemistry via messaging seems to be great. She mentioned hanging out sometime so I proceeded to ask her out (coffee). She said yes, but the problem is it’s over a week away due to her schedule and partly due to mine. We haven’t been messaging as much since we planned it and I’m trying to come off as attention starved or anything, but I’m just trying really hard not to screw this up. 

So my questions:

How often should I be messaging her from now on until the date? Should I ask for her number if things go well?

What does it mean if she says she wants to be friends first? Im totally okay with that but I don’t know if that means she thinks I’m unattractive or something. She asked me after we planned it what I was looking for in a relationship so I don’t know if that helps (said I was looking for a long term relationship).

Sorry again for posting here, but you guys are super helpful and I’m more or less flying by the seat of my pants here, so any help or general advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2f46d/worried_shes_not_interested/

55,s2fs3c,1642018632,Girl I’ve been “mutually exclusive” with might still be talking to/seeing her ex. Am I getting played or am I just overthinking?,"I’ve been on about 7-8 dates with a girl I met on Bumble since mid December.  She has expressed that she is really into me, isn’t seeing other guys (we are mutually exclusive but not official), wants me to be her date to upcoming events, and has talked about me leaving personal items at her place (E.g., toothbrush, etc.). 

Recently I’ve started to worry that she is still communicating with/seeing her most recent ex.  At times she goes incognito for maybe an evening or doesn’t give me a lot of details about what she is doing (I.e., “I’m meeting up with a friend.”).  Sometimes she might drop that the “friend” was a guy on that night (e.g., using he, etc.). Recently she tagged who I believe is her most recent ex in an IG story thanking him for a recipe.   When I was at her place last looking for something in her kitchen, I saw a notification on her for that she got a text from this same guy (I wasn’t looking through her phone, I just happened to see the notification as I was looking for a cup nearby). A few weeks back we brought up the topic of talking to exes, and we both agreed that it often causes more harm than good and there are usually alternative motives. 

I know it is looking bad for me, but how can I go about asking her in a non-confrontation way about all of this? There is a chance that this person might not be her ex, but I think he likely is (e.g., has a picture with this person from a couple of months ago on social media). My only other explanation is maybe it really is a friend but idk.  Based off my lurking she broke up with her ex about 2ish months before we met, which makes me think maybe I’m just a rebound/back up plan/being used to make her ex jealous. 

I can’t tell if I’m overthinking this or if I am getting played. I appreciate any replies.

I take care of my parents/help financially because my dad has cancer and is in treatment so they need as much help as they can get. She has a son(8) and he is amazing. The real father isn’t in the picture but one of her exs still comes around and is a role model for him. She also has an STD. 

Furthermore, we have a lot in common from future plans to interest and hobbies to our perspectives on life itself. I do not know if she has started feeling the same way about me but every time I see her now I get a monkey wrench in my gut because I feel like I’m not being completely honest with her. 

The plan so far: Now I know I don’t want to talk to her about it over the phone or in a large group so it’s more intimate but the only other time i see her is when we hangout with our other coworker and it’s usually to gossip about work.  
I was thinking of just asking her if she wanted to get coffee sometime just the two of us after our next shift and try to talk to her about my feelings for her and ask her what she is thinking. 

Regardless I’d hate to lose her from my life because she is a wonderful person so I’m hoping that being truthful and communicating openly about it will let us either move forward into a more intimate relationship or stay as friends and keep being as close as we are. 

But I know things could go south so that’s why I’m posting here first to try and see what I havnt thought of or considered before I actually go for it! Thank you for any and all help you can offer",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2gpxf/how_should_i/

The conversation went on, a little flirty but nothing definite, and I eventually said we should have a catch up over drinks at some point.

74,s2i1wq,1642024397,"Beautiful Date in Mexico, would love some perspective!","I don't catch feelings very often. It's a once in a blue moon thing for me. And here I am, feelings caught haha.

I'm 6'4 and would consider myself decently attractive (probably a 7, but I don't infrequently hear women say that I'm ""super hot"" or ""so fucking hot"" so who knows, who cares really). I dress well, work out, have a good job, and enough charisma to do fine with women. My only trouble seems to rear its ugly head on those rare occasions when my heart actually gets excited about a girl (3 times in my adult life). I think this is a common enough issue for men and women. I had no issues landing relationships in the past because in each situation, the girl was far more excited about it than I was and took the initiative (you can imagine that these relationships eventually didn't pan out). But when my heart actually does open up and catch feelings, I have a tendency to turn into an absolute clown, and most any of the personal assets I possess which help me in the romantic world tend to become highly irrelevant haha.

I was on vacation in Mexico just now, and met one of the locals who was working on my resort. She's 23 (I'm 32), drop dead gorgeous and an absolute geek, which is adorable to me. We hit it off immediately and went dancing the first night I was there. I don't think she had any inkling of an idea that by the fourth evening out with her and her friends, I was smitten. It took me until the end of the vacation to work up the courage to actually just come out and tell her. I was anticipating that my blunt honesty would be received with a polite and well meaning rejection. What is there really to say to a foreigner who admits to having a crush the day before he's scheduled to leave the country?

To my surprise, she reciprocated my feelings, asked honestly why I hadn't told her weeks prior, and asked me out on a date on my last day.

We met and walked around the city and the beach, we talked for hours at a beautiful restaurant overlooking the ocean. She had this sexy way of leaning into my chest as she talked about her life. The romantic and sexual tension was so palpable. At the end of the day, she pulled a camera out of her purse and had a local girl take a picture of us. I got one print, she took the other. I asked if we could kiss and on the steps of the city, we kissed. Hotly, passionately......god damn that was a kiss I wasn't expecting. I was wading through stars.

She whispered to me, ""I want you to come back. But don't tell me when you do. Just walk up to me on the day you return and surprise me.""

She has no idea that my work is actually taking me right the fuck back there next week LOL. 

So here I am, in la la land, staring at my own fantastic capacity to thwart the things I really want. How do you guys do it? How do you dating pros curb your own tendencies towards over-enthusiasm and transmute them into something far more relaxed, chill, charming, and happy?

I'm walking into a land mine here. She has a male best friend who adores her and is swooping in hard; I know there is some context there that I have to be ok with. She has every guy in the city after her every day. She's younger, and to be honest to myself and you guys: I think I'm way more excited about what happened that day than she is.

TELL ME HOW TO BE. I don't want to screw myself over when I get back there. I don't want to be overbearing. I'm staring at something and someone that has brought me joy, and for the first time in my life, I want to succeed where in the past I have failed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2i1wq/beautiful_date_in_mexico_would_love_some/
75,s2i3cy,1642024511,I don’t know how to explain to a girl that I’m not ready to date.,"I have filed for divorce. The only thing is it isn’t finalized. I filed it by myself so it’s just a matter of putting together  the final decree and getting an attorney to present it with me in court. My ex and I are on good terms. 

However my marriage left me in fear of intimacy. I do not want another traditional monogamous relationship and I was hoping to never be married again. 

Then my pen pal Adriana turned into more. Adriana lives in Argentina and I live in the US. We became friends while I was still married and talk every day. Well as luck would have it Adriana had a business trip to the US last year and I decided I wanted to finally meet her. Less than 24 hours into this trip we were naked in bed together. 

Then Adriana came down for Christmas. It was at this point our fun started to become serious. Now Adriana wants to date me. She has told me that she has polyamorous ideals like me and understands that if we weee to date long term, polyamory could keep our relationship strong. 

But here’s the thing. Im not ready to be official. I just am not. It’s too much pressure. I’ve tried explaining this to her and she gets mad. So I’m not in a date now or lose my best friend of 5 years and I hate this pressure. 

She’s given me an ultimatum and I’m sitting in my office trying not to cry. I don’t want to have a person move to the states for me just so it fails like my last marriage. While my wife was wonderful, our marriage took a toll on me. Adriana gets mad saying “I’m not her” and I get it.

And to be clear I would date her but idk if I could handle long distance. She wouldn’t move here right away and we both just started new jobs.

76,s2i6dp,1642024745,Should I dump my gf,"Just a background. I am 26 she is 30. I feel this is one sides it’s been five months of dating 

1. It’s always me reaching out, almost never her. I told her that I like hearing from
her, but she doesn’t respond.

2. I got her a $30 dollar indigo gift card for Xmas along with some books I no longer read. Her reaction was: thanks. Not on text, but a week later when I see her In person. I got nothing back for Xmas 

3. Texts go uawnsered for hours. I get people are busy, but she just forgets to respond at times. I told her I’m worried when I don’t get a response back In three days and to try and respond. Her reaction was ok… and it continues. I’ve told her a second time, and she says sometimes she just doesn’t know how to respond. I am a Chinese born in America, she’s a recent landed immigrant on a student visa. Another example is this past Sunday. She said she will shoot me a text when she gets back from work if we can do something or if she needs any help moving. Nothing. So I texted her at 8am, and followed up with a phone call at 12. No response both times, so I called again at 1. Only then did say she’s fine and doesn’t need help moving with no reaction to meeting up or doing a call. I normally text her every 2-4 days. I’m not overbearing am I ? 

In person, we get along well. She laughs and we hug and cuddle. She said she’s looking for something long term, but the texting/communication is a huge issue….

So I decided I wanted to buy a house this year, probably end of summer is when I’ll get the pre approval letter, etc. I mentioned this to my boyfriend and he was of course being logical; “It’s a lot of money” “Your student loans” “Utilities etc etc” You know, logical man stuff and things I’ve already thought of. I’m almost 26, I was married for 5 years previously (no kids), and we rented at the time, so I know I lot about the cost. 

So anyways, he also casually mentioned his dads retirement later this year and that his parents would move down south, prime house location, how’s he’d get it since his older two siblings own homes, etc. I felt like this was him hinting at how maybe I should hold off and see what happens with this. 

We’ve been dating a little over a year but our moms have been friends for 20+ so my question is, is a year long enough before living together?

85,s2ix9y,1642026672,Reconnecting with an ex that moved away - worth trying?,"Hey everybody! I (26f) met a guy (27m) over Hinge at the end of September and ended up dating for three months. We had spent most weekends together in that period, either staying over at his or mine and doing all sorts of different activities. Before him I'd been single for two years (although dating) but he was the first person I felt I really clicked with and I just had that gut feeling deep down we would end up together. 

Anyway, he got a promotion at work at the end of December which relocated him two hours away. He did mention he had applied for this promotion, which got me a bit nervous just because I knew he was very good at his job so he would likely get it. The same day he found out he had the job he also tested positive for Covid, and this all happened right before Christmas. We had plans to see each other that week which obviously went to pot, but he was due to move (and since has). 

I initiated the ""what are we going to do?"" conversation - stating I'd be up for trying but if he knew it wouldn't work then I'd rather have a clean break. He was very apologetic and said that he genuinely liked me, but he didn't see himself coming back to our city that often and when he did, it would be to see his family etc, so he couldn't see how he could fit me in. (I also travel to his new city at least once a month for work, but at the time this was looking unlikely due to Covid).

We went for the ""clean break"" and that message exchange was the end of it. I thought Christmas and NY would distract me but instead I just felt sad. I couldn't help but think I was a bit hasty by forcing the ultimatum conversation (foolishly, I only realised it came across like that after the fact). I miss him and I felt like we had a real connection, and he said he felt the same way.

Recently he has started trying to get back in touch, replying to my instagram stories and messaging me stuff like ""Hope you're doing good ❤"". We've exchanged a few messages back and forth since. If he didn't reach out despite our clean break I would probably not be considering this, but I'm starting to think I made a mistake and am wondering if I should ask to meet up.

I'd like to have a proper chat about things (as all we had was a abrupt break-up chat over messages), but also to generally catch up, I miss his company. Ultimately though, I think deep down what I want is to see if he's open for trying things after all. I really feel like I've been too hasty forcing a choice so quickly without even trying long distance and I am starting to wonder whether he felt the same, now he's sorted actually moving out. I figure if he says no then at least I have my answer and can stop being hung up on him.

What do you think? Should I reach out or am I making a mistake? Do you think him re-initiating contact means anything? 

Thanks so much for your time and help!

TL:DR; Guy I was seeing for three months, who I had a great connection with had to move two hours away from work, I said I'd rather have a clean break than risk getting hurt/postponing the inevitable and he said he didn't see how it could make it work, so we ended it despite liking each other. It has been a month and despite agreeing not to interact any more he has tried to get back in touch multiple times. I still have feelings and have changed my mind about trying and risking being hurt. Should I reach out to him and see if he has changed his mind too, or is this doomed to fail?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2ix9y/reconnecting_with_an_ex_that_moved_away_worth/

87,s2jc7c,1642027761,My boyfriend lied to me about his hpv,"So, we got together May 2020. About a month into our relationship he told me that some bumps popped up down there, which as the title explains, ended up being genital warts. So he did the right thing and disclosed to me. We’ve been together since. I have routinely gotten checked. And he’s always insisted that it just popped up around that time. Regardless of my negative tests. I always thought that was weird but never thought he would have a reason to lie to me. To keep the story so much short, I did at one point have to log into his Gmail account in later found out he had been lying about some other random things, which made me look to see if he had been on an Any dating site since we have been together. I went to his history and searched for “dating sites” and the first thing that came up was in October 2019 him searching for dating sites specifically for people with STDs or HPV. I was a bit brokenhearted about this and confronted him. He claimed that him and his friends have been logging on there as a joke. He immediately kicked me out of his Gmail account and I’ve been suspicious since. I was able to log back onto it today. And instead of searching for dating sites I searched both HPV and genital warts. I then saw for months and months for the year before we were together he was googling how to get rid of HPV and shopping for HPV wart remover creams. I’m not really sure what to think right now. As I already said, I did catch him in another separate lie which broke our trust. That’s why I snoop to begin with. I’m not one to invade privacy but I’m also not one to be lied to either. I’m devastated and not sure what to do. I obviously don’t mind taking the risk of having HPV as I thought he was this genuine and honest person that I could be with forever but it’s just another lie to top it off. When I confronted him about this he claimed that at that point he was just suspicious and heard a rumor that one of the girls he slept with had HPV, which makes it even worse. Even know that I’m confronting him I still feel like he is lying to me. I don’t understand why someone would start shopping for creams to remove warts if they were simply looking into information about HPV. What would you do here? He did disclose but he wasn’t honest and it feels manipulative that he disclosed a month into dating (more like four months into sleeping together) . 

**And before you comment, please just know not to bother if you’re going to scold or tell me that I’m wrong for looking through his history, because that’s not right to say. And I quite frankly don’t care. I openly told him I looked. I feel like I’m not the person who’s gonna walk around the keys my friends of stealing my car keys but if it looks like my keys are hanging out of your pocket you can damn well expect me to look. Not to mention the fact that our integrity of our relationship was already broke in the moment he lied.

92,s2jolp,1642028656,I can’t fake laugh for the life of me,"Hi guys, 22F here. Been going on a few dates and I can’t laugh at people’s jokes. This isn’t just the “dating world” but also just the world in general. I can smile at jokes and stuff like that, but I can’t laugh and it just makes the whole situation so awkward.

I WANT TO LAUGH. It helps diffuse awkwardness and makes the other person more comfortable but I can’t. It is a fatal flaw. 

I have tried practicing laughing in the mirror and it sounds SO fake that it’s better just not to laugh.

It’s like my development into adulthood missed the memo of giggling.

Any insight?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2jolp/i_cant_fake_laugh_for_the_life_of_me/

Is that true? My Grandmothers name means “Daisy”.  Should I just call our kid Daisy since it means the same ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2kct6/how_would_an_american_pronounce_this_name/

96,s2ksai,1642031616,I (31/f) got into fight with bf because he (39/m) stares at attractive girls. Is this normal?,"
i caught him looking at my friend multiples times and he insists its innocent and he intebtionally isnt looking and that there is absolutely nothing there and he doesnt find her attractive( but what else was he going to say, right?I just worry that now anywhere ingo that there is a attractive girl he will look at her


TL:DR I feel ans notice that bf looks at friend and other girls because theyre attractive. Why should he feel the need to look at someone or pay attention to someone multiple times of he is supposedly in love with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2ksai/i_31f_got_into_fight_with_bf_because_he_39m/
97,s2kv6x,1642031847,Opinion on this text?,"Just wanted some opinions on this. I met a guy recently and we're planning on our second date - he wants to go for a hike in the morning, and has been consistent and sweet. 

Last night we were texting along these lines:

Me: 'You make me laugh my socks off!'
Him: 'We should plan sockless activities 😏'

He's very silly, joke-y so I understand, but I'm afraid that he just wants something sexual. 

Am I reading too into this? Thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2kv6x/opinion_on_this_text/

99,s2kygz,1642032071,Girl from vlog,Theres this girl i have a crush on i follow her on ig. She does vlogs on YouTube and i regularly comment on them something funny or something referring to the video. She responds to my comments well. With laughing emojis and lots of detail. More than what she replies to other people's comments. Is this kinda a sign thats she likes me or has some interest in me. Would like to dm her and get her number to ask her out for coffee some time,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2kygz/girl_from_vlog/
