4,qyfsd4,1637445318,Should I text again after a month being ignored?,"Hey there, I apologize for the long text ahead and for my english, it's not my mother language :)

The situation is that I met that cute guy and we've been texting for about 4 months, the thing is that he is VERY shy and introvert, a lot really, and I don't think that's bad, in fact I'm also very shy, so I thought that would be really nice to be around someone so similar. But anyways, he never really answered me too fast, It usually took some hours, sometimes a day, and I was okay with it I know he was busy, in my point of view it was way better than someone uncontrollably texting, because once it gets boring, things usually end. I think I have a pretty boring life and don't think I have many interesting things to say, and this guy somehow seems to be way more boring than I thought I was lol so I felt kinda safe and trusted where it could go somehow...

He's single and also never really dated someone, that's something I could not understand because he is really handsome! I mean it. Where he goes there were people glancing at him. I don't think he's gay, before we started talking he checked me out a lot, until I had the guts to give him my number. Anyways, we never got out together, only bumped into each other sometimes and said hi. I tried once to talk to him in person when I saw it but he was so shy it could not happen lol so I backed out, it was kinda funny seeing me. He got all embarrassed and red, it was cute. And finally, a month ago he didn't answer my last message, before that happened he already ignored me some days ago to only says he apologizes that he was very busy and ended up forgetting to text, I just made a joke about it and said it was fine, but really, saying he forgot it was kinda sad, but did not mention that, then we kept talking about college works and easy stuff like that and then he stopped texting again and did not answered since.

Now I don't know what to think, usually I would forget about it too and move on, but something about the way he is makes me wonder if he really ignored me because he doesn't have more interest on me, or because he don't know what to do about it (us) or his feelings? I regret not asking him out, because I was kinda scared to screw it up, never asked anyone out it has always been the opposite, besides I gave him my number, I hoped he could also show some interest lol.

Even in 4 whole months, we didn't got to know each other very well... That's the problem when 2 introverts try to work it out I guess lol. But now if I text again I don't know how it would be like or what to talk about, since he ignored me for this long, or I could be ignored again if I tried, and that would suck. I like him and he is very different from everyone I've met, but I also can't pretend everything was okay like this.

What you guys think I should do? Text him after being ignored? Or is it too humiliating or just too complex thing to do? If I do what should I text without bugging him about having ignored me for so long? It's kinda sad to think I might've had a wrong idea about him and he was just like anybody else, empty and ran away.

I know it's a kinda silly story and nothing really happened compared to others stories published, but it still got me and I would appreciate some advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyfsd4/should_i_text_again_after_a_month_being_ignored/

We were talking almost daily and going on dates/hanging out regularly. I was very into him. He started acting distant, and I asked him about it. Didn't hear back for several days. A couple days later he reached out saying it wasn't about me and that he'd be happy to talk about it. That was 5 days ago now and I have not heard anything from him since. I have reached out twice since then, letting him know I would appreciate talking about it. 

Long story short, I have been having a difficult time. I know if he wanted to keep things going he would've reached out, and that makes me very sad because I feel differently about him. Everything I read about being ghosted is that it is best to not say anything more and let go. However, I am feeling very compelled to reach out to him. I would really like him to know that I do care about him, that this experience has hurt, but that I do truly hope he is doing well. Because I really do. I would really appreciate input as to whether this is a bad idea and why. I know he doesn't necessarily deserve more of my energy, but I feel like being genuine and honest about how I feel about this whole situation would help me feel some closure about it.

There's this cute girl [18f] in my class that I've talked to a bit throughout the semester and I got her number as a friend. We text occasionally. Anyways, a week ago I went to class and she was hella chatty to me. She's usually pretty quiet with most everyone in that class.

I noticed throughout class that she kept glancing at me, like straight up turning her head 100 degrees and quickly looking away when I looked. I sit behind her in class. She looked at me probably 20 times. She also said ""bye, ill see you later"" to only me when class was over. Since then, we've texted on and off more or less out of the blue.

We now speak quite a bit. She laughs at literally everything I say and is always smiling with me. Additionally, she agrees with me like... way too much.

I asked her to coffee and she said she'd love to. Several days ago, we met up and we spoke a bunch and she was her usual self. I ended up playing piano for her and it was all around nice. I only wonder if that was a date- or did she see it as a friend thing?

When she left, she said she had a good time and enjoyed hearing me play piano. I said we should do this again sometime and she said totally. 

I ended up asking her to dinner, and she said she is totally down and it sounds like fun. We went to dinner yesterday. It was very nice and we chatted about a variety of things. She ended up ordering exactly what I ordered for some reason. We chatted and laughed etc throughout the dinner. In fact, we barely ate anything as we were talking so much.

Eventually, the dinner came to an end and I walked her to her car. I thanked her for joining me and said it was a lot of fun, which she agreed to. I then said that we should do it again sometime and asked her if she does hugs. She said ""uh, sure!"" And we hugged goodbye, and I told her to text me when she got home.

I'm unsure if this was a date or not. More importantly, I am really unsure if she is into me or sees this as a couple of bros hanging out. Can anyone help me out here? 

What is my next move? I texted her that I enjoyed talking with her and she hasn't responded yet, but that isn't out of the ordinary for her as I am pretty sure she's just a terrible texter.

So I’ve (21 F) been dating on and off for over a year. I live in NYC (I feel like I should mention that?). I’ve gone on a lot of dates, talked to a lot of people, and many people say that I’m such a catch, but nothing has ever come from it. When I first meet someone / start talking to them, I always ask what they’re looking for b/c I personally would like a relationship. I understand a lot of people want something more casual like a hookup or fwb, which is totally valid but I really can’t do it myself. I’ve tried but it’s truly not for me. I always tell people that I understand relationships take time to develop, so I don’t expect it to happen right away, but that is something I would like. 

I’ve been told by people that I’m conventionally attractive. Petite, pretty feminine, I have knowledge about a very broad range of topics and I love to learn about everything! I am a very curious person and genuinely try to be open minded. I am a bit nerdy and introverted, but I do believe I am good at holding conversations with people and most think that I’m funny, sweet, and smart.

The thing is, I go on dates with people and one of the following scenarios happen: we mutually don’t feel a connection, I don’t feel attracted to them (even when I tell myself to give everyone a chance and keep an open mind), they turn out to be scary /creepy and threaten me (has happened a few times), they don’t feel that attraction towards me, or they just ghost me. 

I get extremely frustrated with myself when someone likes me but I don’t feel the same, even when I try to convince myself that I can force myself to reciprocate. 

I’ve definitely taken time off to deal with other issues within life and did not put any attention towards dating. Now I am much more stable - both physically and emotionally - yet, I just feel like I need to give up and hope that someday I’ll be in a relationship. It’s really starting to eat away at me and makes me feel very very sad. Sometimes I even cry about it. During times where I wasn’t dating, I did a lot of self reflection and work on myself so I do feel like I am ready to be in a relationship and willing to put the effort into one to make it work…it just seems like it will never happen.

He’s a couple years younger than me, and we had been friends prior to dating. 
He started a rigorous athletic schedule (2 practices a day, lift once a day, study hall, and his classes). Granted, I also have an insanely busy life in grad school and being a manager of my building.

However, I felt like he was starting to ghost me little by little, and I missed how things used to be in the beginning. He pursued me first, admitting he’s liked me for 5+ years. We used to hang out and go on dates every single day over the summer. He assured me everything would be back to normal once we were together in-person again, and that he was “just busy” and not ghosting me.

I held off breaking up with him, because of these words of assurance, but he kept not answering me, but still viewed my snapchat story and would update his own… which I called him out for, and I received no clear explanation for this. My breaking point was, one day, I texted him “good morning,” and he wouldn’t respond and kept updating his story about fixing his beloved cars. When I questioned this, he disrespected me over text saying, “you knew i was fucking working on my cars today..”

I’m embarrassed to admit this, but then I broke things off over text, and removed him from everything except text/call. I did assure him he could always call/text if he really needed me, to which I haven’t heard from him. Lately, I’ve been missing him a lot and going through a tough time, and I miss our friendship, and I want to know how he’s doing and if he’s okay, because I know he was going through a lot adjusting to his new life at school. Is it toxic of me if I called/texted him, and said I wanted to be friends again? I know I broke things off, but I felt it was the only way at the time.

Other people are now getting into relationships. Even my younger brothers already have girlfriend. I always thought at least my friends are still single so maybe there isn’t a problem. However they also get girlfriends know and I feel like an odd duck. I have to admit I often get jealous on my friends and little brothers for them to be successful in dating and girlfriend while I hopelessly failed each time I tried so the point that I am about to just give up. I tried so much from approaching women, joining clubs to socialise with them or people in general to make my social circle bigger and creating accounts on dating sites, but I couldn’t even get one date. I got some friendships out of that but no romantic relationships! And It makes me feel ugly and unwanted! Of course friendships are great, but that’s not really what I am looking for. And not at all when this girl comes over to a party with her boyfriend! My friends don’t even think I am ugly or unattractive, but why can’t I get a girlfriend then?

47,qyj3nn,1637455566,I realized cheating makes no sense because of rejection.,"I never understood cheating or disrespecting from a Wholesome perspective, and i learned it all from rejection. At least how I see it, rejection should be seen as a good thing.

What I learned is that you got someone willingly to date you instead of rejection. So there shouldn't be any need to look elsewhere for affection when the person you asked out is willingly giving you affection. You love the person with all your heart, and they'll return the favor. Don't have the person begging affection when they willingly like you back.

Also don't violate boundaries &amp; consent too. Sure you are able to do more stuff romantically than friends, but that doesn't give you the right to violate consent or overstep boundaries because their your partner. Rejection taught me alot about consent and respecting boundaries, it should still be the same when dating.

TL;DR- I think rejection taught cheating makes no sense, and it also taught you still don't violate consent/boundaries even after dating. 🤗",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyj3nn/i_realized_cheating_makes_no_sense_because_of/

56,qyjp3i,1637457535,Dating as a trans woman is an absolute nightmare,"I am a 25 years old trans woman (male to female) and i ""pass"", a term which is often used to refer trans women that can not be spotted to be trans at simple view. 
Finding hookups as a ""passing"" trans woman is not difficult at all, i went from being a virgin before transition to have the opportunity to meet a new man per day thanks to dating apps, and some really good looking men, but the thing is... Men only want that, a hookup, and then ghost you. 
The thing is that i am a very affection starved person because of a heavily traumathising past. 

Finding a boyfriend feels, after 2 years actively looking for one, categorically impossible. Here's why:

Scenario 1. I meet a guy, friend of a friend, or in a party, we get to know each other, i feel he wants to get to know me and invites me to a date, we have a nice first date, everything looks amazing. I tell him i'm trans. He ghosts me. This happenned to me like a dozen of times and it absolutely breaks your heart, seeing that a person that is interested loses interest in you inmediately and ghosts you forever really hurts your self steem. 

Scenario 2. I use a dating app, i say i am trans on my profile, despite what many can think, i get a lot of matches on tinder saying im trans, i currently got +900 in a 4 months account. But everytime i meet a guy nothing goes further than a second date, they just want sex, no matter if they say they don't, they will find the minum excuse to cut you off when they got what they wanted, and if you dont have sex with them, theres no second date. Also i skip all the extremely disrespectful comments i get on the dating app like ""you got a d*ck or a pus*y"" etc. 

I got to have one boyfriend i met on Grindr when i started my transition, but he was an atrocious boyfriend, he convinced me it was normal for him to hide me from his friends and family, cheated on me several times, abused my emotional dependence of him to forgive his cheating, to then cheat again dating two girls simultanously, verbally abused me and currently after breaking up with me and him having a girlfriend, he talked to me recently on a dating app asking for nudes. 

My experience with men is basically, meeting dozens of guys per year to just ending up getting used for sex and then ghosted and disrespected several times. 
Also some dates were simply awful, with me feeling like an object they use for an experiment and throw to a trash can. 

Example of nightmare date:
One time a tinder guy (he knew i was trans) insisted me A LOT to have a date with me, i talked to him, he was super sweet and i went to his hotel entrance (he was a tourist) to go grab some drinks in the beach and chat, then spend the night together (he said he had a room for himself). When i arrive the hotel he says he has to charge his phone, we go to his room and he puts the phone to charge. Then one of his friends call him and he speaks with him for a bit, i asked if something happenned and he told me we had to leave the room because his friend just met a girl and he had no place to go to have sex with her so my date wanted to borrow him the room to have sex with her while we were out. I said NO, that if he did that i was gonna leave, then my date basically said he couldnt say no ""to his bro"" that he was gonna ""disappoint him"". I was freaking out, finally convinced him to tell his friend to find other place and his friend said ""okay"". My date starts to act like he is not really happy. Then tells me he has to sh*t, yes sh*t and that his bathroom door is broken so i should wait on the balconee to not hear and smell all. I went to the balconee and i was freaking out, i didny went back to my place because i was 30km from my place in a touristic island where a taxi is like 40 euros that distance (50 dollars) and he promised me a dream date. He finished to evacuate and then told me we couldnt go out for a drink bc everything is closed due to corona restrictions (we took a lot arguing to convince him to not let his friend bring the girl).  We started to kiss and it went a bit further, i noticed he was really hard (sorry for being graphic). Then i gave him a back massage and he took off most of his clothes, so i asked him if he could shower. The island i live in is a very hot tropical place, and he was out all day so he was probably all sweated around his body. But like a little kid he started to say he showered already at morning and that he didnt need to shower again... This guy was 22, not a little kid, i was freaking out again, but finally convinced him to shower. He did, came to bed and we made out again, then he stopped me and said... I dont find you attractive anymore, that part of your body really turns me off... I started to cry in front of him, he was so cold and straight forward... And after all the shit that happenned before, i couldn't contain myself more. I gave him my back in the bed so he wouldnt see me cry (he knew perfectly i was trans and that i didnt have a vagina since before meeting). When he saw me giving him my back to cry he said ""stop crying you are making me feel bad""... I was furious and sad, he had NO RESPECT for me at all, and his only priority was him. I went to the balconee to cry alone and i saw him from the balconee pull put his phone and start to chat with other girls on snapchat... I felt like trash, and crying while i still was in front of him was so humilliating. He said ""why do you care if im not into you? Im just another guy"" Like if i had no feelings. 

And i got many more stories like that, i just want a boyfriend, but 99% of guys don't want the social implications of dating a trans woman, for them it's just not worth it, even if they are truly attracted to you, dating a non trans girl is easier for them.

59,qyjtez,1637457949,I need some help and advice for this triangle,"Hi guys, me (29M) and my crush (25M) are from the same lab and we also shared the same office too. He is my junior and is a newcomer to this lab. He is a shy guy, quite reserved but can be funny at times. 

Anyway, I've been going my way to approach him so that I can get to know him more, such as talking to him (he really enjoys talking to me) and making cookies together. Since he's very well-reserved, none of his friends and classmates know if he likes guys or girls. Just recently, I noticed that he was in a bad mood and he didn't really want to speak out on the subject. Yesterday, after making cookies together, we had a long chat, and for some reason we brought up the talk about his bad mood. Surprisingly, he told me that he likes guys and he had a crush on one of my labmates, but his crush was not reciprocating. The bad mood was actually caused by his inability to approach his crush and also jealousy on his crush. I was surprised that he's being so honest about the subject, as he seemed reluctant to talk about it before. 

We tend to have very meaningful and deep conversation with each other that doesn't really happen for other labmates. I do wonder if he really just gonna treat me like a friend, that's why he talks a lot more with me and get friend-zoned by him. I'm that kind of guy who only want to date someone I really know well. Right now my plan is kinda waiting him to get over his feeling on his crush, while also spending more time with him hanging out and doing some pastry together in the weekend. After some time, I wanna ask him out for a dinner on Christmas. I really don't know if I really stand a chance. At least now I don't have to worry that he likes girls, which would be a very deadend for me. 

Anyway, I really don't know what to do. Please give me some advice and kindly share your thoughts.

64,qykct3,1637459770,Slow fade. Ghosted.,"Went on one date with a girl last month met online. It was okay not the best or worst first date I've ever been on. My feelings towards her could be described as ""interested"", no more no less. Good enough for a 2nd date.

I asked her out for a 2nd date a couple days after the first, and she agreed. We decided to go to an event that required tickets that we had been talking about since before we even met. I explained to her that tickets had to be bought in advance, and gave her the time and day. She agreed every step of the way.

Texting continued as normal. She was responsive, enthusiastic , sending flirty texts, selfies, initiating, high effort responses, etc.

Day of the date comes and she tells me she has been ""puking all night"". I give her the benefit of the doubt and we agree to reschedule. 

We continuee texting as usual. She works all week and is off weekends, continued texting me during weekend evening hours so I dont even think she was seeing someone else.

Texting slows, then eventually stops entirely. I dont hear from her for a week, and I try checking in one last time, no response.


So basically this person agreed to me buying tickets while showing no indication they would back out, then called out ""sick"", slow faded saying we would reschedule, then ghosted me entirely, leaving me stuck with the bill for the tickets and a month of back and forth thinking there would be another date. All on someone I was merely ""interested"" in.

Have to say my ego is a little bruised. I can no longer say I've never succeeded in la dong a 2nd date any longer. Its hurt my trust in the OLD process even more than ever. 

I set up a date with a different girl and we went to lunch today. She immediately texted .e afterward saying she would lile to do it again. Now that bad experience is still so fresh it's in the back of my mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qykct3/slow_fade_ghosted/
65,qykh3i,1637460160,How to continue to date after the last person you loved raised your dating expectations too high?,"I've dated many people over the years. All of them had their differences. Men were men. Women were women. The vibes in the relationships felt basically the same though...Then I met her. The first time I met her something clicked. Her emotions were so bright and irradiating. The way she looked at me was like no has ever looked at me. Her hugs were so genuine. She wanted to be around me. She enjoyed my company. Or I felt that way.

No one is perfect. But damn, I have never met a single person who's like her. She is literally the person I've always dreamt of dating. And I'm not going to see her again... She's moving away. And the way she's talking to me, she sounds like she's not going to be seeing me again after she leaves. It breaks my heart...I really don't care if we didn't officially date. The way that she made me feel...I don't want to lose that.

But that's not what this post is about. This is about me finding someone after her. How the fuck am I going to do that... There's not a single person who I've met who's like her. Not a single one. I can't go back to dating someone who is below my expectations when she not only fit them but elevated them to newer heights. She showed me what it's like to love the person I only thought existed in my head. 

Some part of me wishes I never met her. She's just too damn good...She just came into my life then left it for me to find someone less than her? Fuck no. I hate settling. I used to and it only ends in someone's heart getting broken. And most of the time, it's not mines. I want her. Or someone like her. But I severely doubt I'm ever going to find anyone else in this world who made me feel the way she did so...I don't know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qykh3i/how_to_continue_to_date_after_the_last_person_you/

I'm early 30s guy who gets somewhere between 2 to 3 matches a week, not great but not terrible.

Dating at this age is the absolute worst. Yes nice guys (as in actually good guys) tend to get more desirable as we age however you're still getting screwed. Consider this, everyone around this age will have had been through a few failures/terrible relationships and thus have walls as high as mount Everest. 

You will literally be paying for all the damage caused by the men who used women in their early 20s, hell you'll even be paying for mistakes of good relationships that just didn't work out. Almost everyone I meet seem to have some kind PTSD from some abusive asshole in the past (yes yes it takes 2 to tango but that's not my point).

Before I went into that relationship I had no luck on dating apps, and now I’m a little overwhelmed by how many girls are having conversations with me. 

At first it was just nice to speak to matches and they’d usually fizzle out. I’d been speaking to a few people we’d discussed meeting, but then today I went on a spontaneous date with a girl I messaged last night and my god she is beautiful, lovely and just all in perfect. We had so much fun, but it was only the first date, which she then extended and asked for us to go get food somewhere. I actually really like her.

But then I got home and saw another really beautiful girl messaged me on an app. Part of me doesn’t want to message her back because I genuinely felt a connection with this girl and we arranged to meet next weekend as we both have busy weeks, but if the text chat fizzles, then I could miss out on this other girl. 

My dilemma is:
A) is it worth ignoring all other matches until next week and hope this goes as well as today? 
B) why does it always seem like you get more matches you like after you’ve met someone you like? (I know this is just chance, but it feels like a test from the universe) 

The obvious thing that I think is I shouldn’t speak to any other girl because I don’t want to betray her trust or lie to her if she asks, but I also don’t want to miss an opportunity if this girl changes her mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qykydb/when_to_come_off_a_dating_app_when_to_stop/

\- After two weeks of not talking, I called her, she suggested we be FWB. I said after we eventually stop this, we'll go our separate ways and **NOT** stay friends / or in contact.

**Here's the weird part** \- after sex, she'd try extra hard to try to drive the idea of friendship into my head. **Examples**:

\- ""Have you gone any dates / talking to anyone?""

\- ""I really care about you as a friend. You know how much I care about my friends""

\- ""As friends we could go do x, y, z activities""

I stayed quiet and didn't give a fuck about any of that. FWB lasted for 1 week (lol) because she felt guilty and wanted us to actually be friends in the future instead of nothing. The last time we spoke, she revealed that she's interested in a guy on the West Coast, that she hasn't met in-person yet (we live on the East Coast). **WTF?** That's fine with me since our relationship had ended but still jarring...

\- She suggested we take some time apart from communication so we can try to be friends. I walked away from that confused but I said sure. I left it up to her to put a 100% effort into that. As of now it's been about more than a month since we ended dating, and about 2-3 weeks since we stopped FWB.

\- I've regained my confidence and realized that I liked her too much while we dated, I was afraid of losing her. I had lost sight of who I was when we had initially started dating. I feel incredible now, and have started going on dates with other girls.

\- But I want her to come back at some point (many reasons why). I want to show that I've improved myself significantly. I'm going to continue NC, meet other people, and let her reach out in the future.

**Questions -** Anyone ever had success getting back with a girl that they had dated for a short amount of time, or an ex? Have they ever truly meant it, when they suggest friendship? Or is this her way of walking away forever on ""nice terms?""

82,qylnlw,1637464108,Should I ask her out? (15m),"So I´m conflicted wither or not I should ask out my crush, thats is my Brother´s girlfriends Sister. Like I honestly realy do like her but if it doesn't go well its probably going to be awkward soo yeah. Im also bad at reading signs, and I have no idea if she saw it the same way I did but ill get into it later

Background: So I first met B (14f) early July for the first time at the boardwalk of a beach. I Was instantly attracted to her, although I was kinda shy and didn't talk to her. I didn't really talk to her in any compasity until around august. My brother (17m) gave her my snap, we ended up talking for a bit and I thought we vibed pretty well.

We saw each other here and there but nothing much happened until in early october, at my brothers homecoming, when she asked my brother if I could come to the pre-hocoming event , witch I did. (Our homecoming wasn’t until a few weeks out). We ended up being the only 2 people left behind when they went to take pictures for like a hour. It was a house that had a pool, so we played games around pool and had a good time.

Then there was a period of nothing much happening until 2 weeks ago where we ended up going to the girlfriends house (16f) for the weekend sense my parents went away, and we all went to Hershey park. We had some 1-1 time waiting in lines when we split away to go on some other rides then the other 2. We do get along good, and the more time i spent with her the more conferrable I get, and the more I talk sense I'm regularly shy and introverted.

And then last week I Was invited the night before with her to go to the same beach and boardwalk we first met, along with my bro and his girl, plus another couple. The 6 of us did some shopping and then some lunch before we split up and the 2 of us went to play minigolf, and went around the shop. I really did have a good time with her, and it lasted for like 2 and a half hours before went back to the others. Then we split up again from the others to go to different shops before we went home. Like I said I really did have a good time, and I think she did too.

I'm just not sure how to go forward from here. I don't know if my brother knows I like her, though some events make believe that it’s a possibility. i do eventually want to talk to them about and and see what they think about it cuz there opinions really do matter to me and I do trust them. I also want to know if there okay with it in the first place.

One thing though is that we don't really talk in the periods where we dont see eachother irl. I atleast know some of the time she wants to see me so isnt forced interactions. I still do have her snap and we snap facepics sometimes, but no texting but besides that we don’t really talk outside of it. And she does snap a lot of other people too, she has like a 285k snapscore and it usually goes up like 500-1k a day and Ik she snaps a lot of guys. (She posted a ss with her best friends list showing it as all guys with the caption “this gotta go” a few months ago)

Another thing is if I do decide to do it, is to try to get the motivation to do it. When I think about it it really does scare the crap outta me. I always think it’s a gamble but I really don’t want to make things awkward Incase she doesn’t see me in that way. Like I said I’m not the best at picking up signs, but idk if she tried to give any anyways.

So yeah thats where im at. Any advice?

87,qylzpj,1637465273,I finally did it.,"After years of having no courage, no confidence, and crippling social anxiety; I finally asked someone out. 

I’ve been separated for two years. I was married for seven. Dated my ex for a few years before that. I moved across the continent, where I know no one, and I’ve effectively been completely alone. 

Since my separation, I’ve had absolutely no confidence in myself to make friends, let alone date or even try to date. But for whatever reason, today, I changed on a bit of a whim. 

I went into a dealership, and needed to get a refund for a purchase. Chatted with the receptionist. Very cute, kind, and seemingly interested in me. After about 20 minutes, I got my refund, and was on my way. 

During my drive home, I thought about it more and more, and finally said “screw it”. So I called the dealership once I got home, and when she answered the phone, I told her my name, and she remembered me. I said “I know this is weird, but would you like to get coffee sometime?”

Unfortunately, she informed me she’s in a relationship. So I said “No worries. You never know until you ask, right?” We both said have a good day, and that’s the end of it. 

But honestly, I’m still shocked at myself. I haven’t asked anyone out in nearly a decade. I had though I seemingly had no idea how to talk to someone anymore, and surely haven’t had the courage to do so. I shot my shot. Bummer, but at the same time, it’s growth for me. I’ve all but given up, and I feel like I can finally start to do this more.

97,qymj1t,1637467090,28m in need of venting my emotions,"So I just got hit with a wave of loneliness (I know it'll pass) and I just need to vent a little bit.

The thing is that I normally feel secure and confident about myself yet I don't feel like I ever really connect with girls I meet, or get any matches or attention on dating apps. 

I understand the deal with dating apps, but even when I get matches I don't get a reply ever. I have tried everything from hey and what's up to whatever pickup line or icebreaker I could find that I feel suits my kind of humor. I used to think it was because I wasn't good at advertising myself on these apps, but once I got a boost I got a lot of matches compared to the usual (still no replies though... Sigh). I don't know if I'm just ugly to women or its the almighty algorithm that don't like me. With that said I digress. 

What really irks me is what I mentioned earlier, I just never feel like I connected with girls I'm attracted to. Maybe my standards are to high compared to my looks, I don't know. My two best friends pull girls like it's nothing but I don't feel like they do anything special, it just feels like they have it and I don't. 

Its not that I can't talk with girls or have problems with rejection or any of that, I just prefer to feel things out and take it slower. I guess that friendzones me because I often get compliments about how kind I seem... I don't know, i don't mind being everyone's friend but once in a while it would be nice to feel wanted back in a romantic sense I guess is what I'm trying to say. 

I've also watched and read a ton of stuff about how to be more successful with dating and relationships, it most of it just feels so fake to me... Like I want to met someone I'm physically attracted to but also connected with personality wise and I don't see how I can follow those advices and stay true to the person I am when I can't give two shits about all that peacocking and putting on a show to impress someone I don't even know I'm compatible with.

98,qyml2s,1637467271,Asked out my crush and got rejected. Is there an asterisk because of alcohol and other mixed signals?,"Been hanging out with a classmate over the past month and we actually became pretty good friends. Things have been going great, but it was hard to see if there was any interest in something more from her end. I made a commitment to myself to sack up and ask her out next time I saw her in person. There was a big school party we met at and then we transitioned to a club. Towards the end of the night, we started dancing/grinding with each other before I sort of pulled her to the side so I could ask her out. We sat on a couch together very closely, she kind of threw her legs up on mine, and I essentially told her that I really enjoyed spending time with her and asked if I could take her on a date. She said not on a date. After some unimportant back and forth, we ended up making out - tongue and all - before continuing things and eventually leaving. The only meaningful exchange in there was when she said was really drunk so I just said I'll ask her again when we're sober and her response really stung: ""Don't ask me when we're sober.""

We live close to each other and I ended up walking her home arm in arm nearly the entire way. We ended up talking about our relationship/friendship with each other nearly the entire way back. I told her she didn't owe me any explanation why she didn't want to go out with me, but she was insistent in explaining her circumstances (which imo was pretty much a drawn out ""it's not you, it's me"" type thing) and that she values stronger, long-term friendships above all else. I assured her I wasn't going to pressure her into anything she wanted to do and asked why she made out with me if there was nothing there, to which she replied something about it being ""animal instinct"" (she's ESL) and apologized for leading me on. She had expressed a certain determination to wingman for me in the future as if that would make up for the rejection. By the time we got to her place, we got into the personal topics one would only talk about when drunk and I can't help but feel like I overshared, but I only gave answers to questions she asked. One I distinctly recall was when I started developing feelings, to which I answered a couple weeks ago and she replied it being not long at all but I had to remind her we've only been talking for about a month. I also said that it was my belief that the best relationships are built upon strong friendships, to which she agreed. We ended up closing out with a reaffirmation of friendship and pretty lengthy, intimate hug with her face buried into my chest, and home safe texts/confirmations.

Next day, she texts me about how she feels like shit (hangover), didn't start feeling better until mid-afternoon, has never been that drunk before, etc. Pretty much as if it was business as usual, nothing ever happened. I don't know how much she actually remembers, and I'm afraid to ask. I think I handled the rejection well in the moment, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a façade.

So, I'm conflicted: on one hand, I feel like there's an asterisk attached to the rejection and it can only be removed if we communicate - and I owe it myself to do things while we're *sober*. On the other hand, drunk words speak sober thoughts, and while asking her out was a sobering moment for me, I can't speak for her state of mind apart from her own admission to being the most drunk she's ever been and a hangover lasting well into the PM.  What it comes down to is I can only get clarity from communication, but if there's any truth to drunk words, it'd behoove me to let sleeping dogs lie.

At this point, I'm rambling. Thank you for coming to my ted talk and I welcome your thoughts, comments, advice, what have you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyml2s/asked_out_my_crush_and_got_rejected_is_there_an/
