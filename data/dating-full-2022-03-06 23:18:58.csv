He's extremely handsome, blue eyes and nice hair and teeth, he has the best body shape ever, he's also tall. Anyways, I saw him a lot in the gym (and I liked him since then) but we started talking two weeks ago, and he initiated it. 

He began by placing his phone and jacket next to the machine I work out on, without saying a word. Then slowly by days, he on purpose starting working out next to me and tell me (I will work out on this too so we can do it together) with a big smile. And then we say Hi and bye without anything further. 

Last week, he started to interfere more in my work out, he started asking me what will I work out today and how's my diet and these stuff, briefly, he started making conversations.

Next thing I know, he started teasing me in a playful way, he once saw me by chance after me not going for the gym for 5 days because I was busy and he literally smiled from ear to ear and asked me (with excitement) where have you been? You didn't come for 5 days, are you calling this a work out? I laughed, and then again we kept on talking, and he kept asking me personal stuff about my life, like where did I graduate from and what do I do in my life and bla bla bla, and I told him sometimes I don't come because I take german course, he was very impressed, and when we finished, I knew his name and he knew mine. And we promised each other to come on time every 3 days so we could meet and work out together. 

Today, something very strange happened. First of all, the very first thing he told me was how are you in german, and he introduced himself in german, and then he grabbed his phone telling me ""I am still studying and I will beat you off""... I kept on laughing, it was so cute.. and when we talk, he directly looks to me in the eye. The strange thing was, when I was about to finish my workout, he told me, you know what.... you remind me alot of my friend, I haven't seen ""him"" in 7 years. I told him I remind you of your ""guy"" friend? He laughed and said, ""believe me i don't mean it in that way, but the way you talk and laugh and your jokes and even the way you look"" (???) I was really turned off and I told him ""wow okay"" with a semi smile and I walked away, I haven't say goodbye to him this time and I went home.

They went on a roadtrip together. I realized what happend and got hurt. Then I felt the withdrawal symptoms. Behaved weerd during last year. Then did no contact the last 3 months and on New years I apologize for all my immature behaviours and explained everything I felt and what was inside my head and my fears.

I never thought it would come down to be asking for advice on Reddit but I’ve recently been put into a really awkward and unfortunate position and all my options suck. I was hoping to maybe come collect some advice from others or gain some new insights on the situation. 

I (M21) met this girl off Hinge (F19) last month. We talked a lot through text. We clarified what we were looking for and we seemed to be on the same page, or so I thought. The consensus was something that started casual but turns into something serious.  A couple days ago, we had our first date at a coffee shop in the afternoon-early evening. I hadn’t ever been on any kind of date in over 2 years so I was pretty rusty about the whole process. Regardless, it felt like the date went over pretty well, we had fun talking, and we even had already started discussing going on another one close to the end of it. No kiss took place so I don’t know if that’s a bad thing but in all fairness, there was no good opportunity for it to happen on that particular date. She said she found me “pretty cute” and said she was interested in learning more about me through text later that night. I asked what she thought about doing a picnic date in some park at around daybreak, which she sounded pretty interested in and even added onto it. 

Today we were having one of our casual texting convos and I opened up about how I have been in a cuddling mood. (I’ve certainly felt touch starved since I haven’t gotten intimacy from anyone in over 2 years). Though to my dismay, she told me that despite touch being her “love language”, she hasn’t wanted anyone “near” her and she said she doesn’t know why she feels that way but also said that she still enjoys the company of others. I know I’m not supposed to take that personally, but it still hurt a little. 

So yeah, I’m about as confused as I’ll get out. She seemed interested in me but doesn’t seem to be into the idea of any kind of intimacy. But I AM seeking intimacy. I like her a lot but it also feels like I should just leave her alone. It seems like a lose-lose scenario. My options (as I see it) are:

 1) Take a position of neutrality, wait, and see what happens (we still don’t know each other THAT well so maybe she’ll open up later or something, or maybe I’ll just lose my sanity and regret not proceeding with option 2 sooner) or…

2) Just cut my potential losses and start from the drawing board with a different person. Option 2 would not be easy because as I said, I DO in fact like her a lot, but I’m certainly losing hope.

What are your thoughts? I am very aware that I’m inexperienced, rusty, and simply just not good at this stuff so please go easy on me and keep it constructive. I’m sure there were a lot of things I probably did wrong as I’m still learning how this all works. I’m also autistic so that definitely adds to the complexity of dating for me.

I'm a awkward nerdy guy who barely knows how to initiate a conversation and maintain it but I had a few times flirting where I maintained contact for a decent time. I did keep flirting with this married woman at my last job just to practice talking to someone. She is an immigrant from Ethiopia and was still learning english I kept flirting with her to build my confidence. It didn't pan out with her for obvious reasons 

I started class recently and began flirting with this 19 year old in class who said her ex was older than me. So hearing this I begin flirting with her whenever I can muster up a conversation but its gotten dry. She is balancing school on her end with her job she only replies to me once or twice a day depending on the class workload. All throughout the once a week class she sits next to me and we keep having little conversations about this and that with lots of eye contact initially and the occasional physical touch to her back which made her poke me back. Recently this other guy started cockblocking me by sitting in between us before class starts and flirting with her. She made it a point to tell him not to sit inbetween us because that computer he sat at always works and she wanted to sit next to me. This guy is going out of his way to talk to her and cockblock me when ever I think of something to say to her.

Recently I've been left on read since Wednesday and she hasn't responded to my text of asking her if she likes me sent on Friday. 

Currently venting because my last rejection was around 3 years ago so this one hurts a little bit.


I don't care if I lose her to him or another guy I just need tips to improve myself so I can keep a girl interested and get over rejection faster

We're not close friends, but when I see her she's very talkative, hugs me, stands next to me in groups, and she texts me occasionally. She came up to me from the beginning, I never really reached out to her to become friends. Most of our interactions are in person but when we have texted she was sometimes very slow with responses and sometimes very quick, but always continuing the convo. I noticed her staring at me all the time, and she would position herself near me on our way out and we would always end up walking together. One day she sat next to me and I noticed her and her friend looking at each other and smiling. I sat next to her another day and the same friend turned around to look probably 20 times.  There was a party amongst classmates I was invited to. I asked her if she was going and she wasnt sure, but said she would go when I said i was. She has these 2 close guy friends who she introduced to me in front of them as her best friends, so I figured theres no romance there, and one of them has a gf. She asked them what time they were going, and then texted me later to ask what time I was going (seemed like she didnt want to ask in front of them cause she looked right at me after she asked them). I asked her if she wanted to meet up outside beforehand but she said she was doing an assignment or something like that. When she arrived she came with her 2 close guy friends and another girl and I overheard they were pre-gaming (she had told me she was doing homework lol). We were talking for a bit and she offered me a sip of her drink, and then she said she was leaving. She later texted me to apologize for leaving early (like 2am).

At this point I was pretty certain she was into me too and I asked her out but had to do it over text unfortunately and I think that kind of messed it up, and it turned into a group event with other classmates. She had been hugging me goodbye when we walked alone, but i noticed at this event she didnt give me a hug goodbye. One of the male friends was there at the time, and another dude from class, when she didn't hug me so I figured she was shy in front of them or something. I followed up and asked if she'd want to go out again, and after a day she told me it was a super busy weekend and she was sick. I assumed she wasn't interested and decided to back off a bit. 

The next class period, I expected her to avoid me.  she greeted me and was even more friendly than normal, and I also caught her staring at me almost the whole time. Even from awkward angles when I moved around the room. There was another event after class and she invited me to it, then texted me to update me that it was cancelled but she was gonna organize another one. Now I figured ok, if she didn't like me, she definitely would not be inviting me to stuff, continuing to stare, etc. The next day I left ahead of her and said bye to people (I wanted her to know I wasnt following her out all the time and wanted to see if I was reading into her always walking with me) and I turned back as I was leaving and she was staring at me and ended up catching up with me on the way out but she forgot something. I offered to go back with her but she declined (I didnt push it as she was weird about the 2 attempts to hang out) but then texted me that she found the item, which was interesting. The next time we were walking home together my hands were full when we split and I could see her looking at my body thinking about a hug, so I said hey can I give you a hug goodbye and she smiled real wide and said yeah. 

This week I've seen her 4 or 5 times but always in a group setting and her male close friend is there with her. We walked back together with him and some others and I noticed she was walking next to me the whole time even when the arrangement of the group would flip around, and she was also walking like way in my personal space at some points. The others besides her male friend broke off and us 3 continued to walk. When i split i again saw her look down at my body again like thinking about a hug but then she didnt. At a prior class, we were leaving and the same male friend asked her to wait up. She kept walking and I said I don't mind waiting so I didn't seem rude, but she said no whatever and we kept walking. At that point I realized there's for sure nothing going on between them. We went to a party and she mentioned an event at her house. I asked her about it later and she said she'd send me the info. Later on after never getting the info, I wished her good luck with the event in front of her male friend. She asked me if I was going (she never sent me info or officially invited me) so I asked if she was inviting me with kind of a laugh. She looked at her male friend and then said ""um well yeah I think a lot of people are going"". I felt the vibe was weird so I said I could bring friends and she seemed bummed about that, so I said I probably can't rally up anyone cause my friends live kinda far but I'll go, and she lit up and said again she would send it. The next day i never heard anything from her about the info so I texted her in the evening. She had told me she was going to family stuff all day so I didn't think she was blowing me off but I just wanted to plan out my day a bit. I never heard from her by 11pm and was gonna ignore it, but I didn't want her to view ME as the flaky one so I said hey whats up? Is this still happening? A few mins later she sent many apology texts in a row saying she didn't mean to ignore me and was with family all night, didn't end up going to the event. I just made a joke and said no problem but she apologized again and she did actually seem to feel bad. But regardless there were still many opportunities to at least send me the info or say hey im not going, so it's kind of inconsiderate. Anyways, I found out she actually didn't end up going, but in pics I saw her male friend was there. She looked at him before she extended her partial invite as well, and she seems to not want to hug me in front of him or her other male friends but will initiate hugs alone. Am I reading it correctly that she's into me but is really shy about it in front of others, especially this one dude? I feel like these are some of the most mixed signals I've ever dealt with. I REALLY REALLY like this girl and we are similar in many ways but now I'm about to give up because I don't want to pursue someone who doesnt reciprocate any interest. I constantly make eye contact with her still and she'll start smiling, and she's super friendly and continues to ""invite?"" me to things. I am planning to ask her on a date, using the word date, when I see her. Is this a good idea or am I just too thick to get the soft rejection? I feel like I've already been rejected but she's so damn friendly in person and the eye contact thing is really confusing. I'm really not concerned that she's got a thing with this guy, cause she's ditched him for me a few times now, but there's something weird about her when she's talking to me in front of him.

Last Friday my bf and I went out. I had thought about ending things because emotionally we weren’t connecting well. We still have both strong feelings for each other and very attracted to each other. This month will be 6 months which is big progression but unfortunately the end of our puppy stage. He’s just been so busy with work and school. He has 2 years of college left and he’s been “neglectful” (his words not mine). This is his first real relationship since his first love sadly passed. 

And this is my first relationship and connection ever. I never thought much of our age difference but it seems more apparent. I’m 21 and he’ll be 25 during late spring. He’s always financially conscious and concerned about parents and life, whereas I’ll extremely hyper and can be carefree yet paranoid and cautious. He teaches me to be more mature and I kinda allow him to loosen up and be more vulnerable.

Anyways we haven’t talked. Not even constant texts. I sometimes hope for a good morning text or goodnight text from him, IF THAT. Usually I would have to initiate it but never get a response. I thought about breaking up with him and eventually coming back together if time allows it, after 2 years, since he’ll be done with school. When I met him I almost cried. It was a month since our last date and he changed. He lost weight, he didn’t have time to shave, which is fine but this is the thickest I’ve seen his facial hair. He seemed so unorganized which was unlike him. 

Again I never met him during his first 2 years of college so I don’t know if it’s because of that. We talked and our feelings for each other are still there. He doesn’t want to break up with me and I don’t either. We both feel like it’ll be different coming back after 2 years. We talked a bit and had dinner. The chemistry, romantic and sexual, is still so strong it never faded. But my heart is so torn. I know I love him, maybe it’s because he’s my first everything and my first love. Maybe I’ll do things for him I won’t consider because I’m so romantically involved. But he never told me he loves me, and I get that because his first love was his fiancé and she died so tragically. I feel like he doesn’t want to betray her, which I vaguely remember him saying way in the beginning, before our very first date.I’m just confused and torn. 

My mom says he on drugs, (which I disagree since his personality is still the same and he not snappy. He’s naturally skinny but hasn’t been able to go to the gym and bulk up like normally), and my sister assume he’s cheating or using me for sex. Which could be it, we never had PIV sex because I’m not ready(child abuse), but he’s so patient and compassionate, I don’t think he’ll be like that he was with his fiancé through it all. 

My family gives me advice but their relationships are all toxic, codependent and abusive. I don’t want to be anything like that. And I feel like we have something so real and pure. I don’t know if it’s because I’m young but I really want to work this out with him. 

He has plans with us towards the future like moving in together, traveling and hopefully marriage. But years down the line.I know college is important to him because it’s a good career and instant job. He wants to take care of his family especially his parents. They up in age and he wants them to be alright. He’s feels pulled in every direction possible and it’s hard for me to tell him how I’m feeling. 

How close I am to the edge and it just brings me to tears. I want to work everything out so bad, I ask him if he needs help. But he automatically shuts down and takes on a ultra masculine role and tells me he can handle it. He can power through. I just need to focus on myself and everything will be fine.

I’m just so confused. I want us to be together I see us with a future. But I don’t know if I can keep up with not knowing anything about him, and him not keeping up with my life. I know it sounds codependent that’s why I’m trying. He’s says he’ll do better and even though it’s been a couple days, I can’t help but still contemplate even if he is trying 100% better. 

Every thing is perfect when we are together, I just don’t want to wait another month before we can meet up in person again. It feels like we are worlds apart but we are not even 15 miles away from each other.

So I have a crush on a former coworker. He was one of the engineers and I worked in the production. Besides that I have always been physically attracted to him - but I think a lot of my attraction is also from the fact that he always seemed.. shy/reserved/elusive? I have never seen him be all close to females, like a lot of the guys at a factory. He always keeps to himself. 

I have gone out of my way a couple of times try talk to him and he always seemed in a hurry - but he has always been polite. I guess you can say I was trying to show interest and told him at one point that he should smile more often because of looks good on him. Of course he smiled after I said that, and smiled the days thereafter. Still always tried to avoid my way maybe so there’s no pressure of having to be in an uncomfortable position. 

Fast forward - I left that place and worked somewhere else. I dreamt of him a few times and I realized I Haven’t seen him around in awhile. I see him at the gym sometimes too as well as at the park when he goes for a run. We live in the same town. Anyway, so I got curious and wanted to see a picture of him since he didn’t have Facebook. I googled his name and I don’t know what got to me - I texted the number that Google has of him. I googled my own name and it didn’t even reflect my own phone number. I didn’t think he would engage in a conversation with a “stranger”. Of course I enjoyed it although I had no plan on ever revealing myself to him or stalking him more than I believe I did - which really wasn’t the intention. 

Fast forward, he got curious who I was and would ask questions to try deduce to where I might know him from until from his text, it seemed like he already knew who I was. He engages in texts even if it’s just once or twice a day. So he was joking with me one day and told me he hasn’t filed for a restraining order against me yet to which I replied a week later and told him, well no cop contacted me to stay away from you so Hi again! He sent me a picture of a cartoon character with mustache and I told him, bad drawing. It’s not chinky (I’m Asian 😅) so it ain’t me and that I would have liked to receive a picture of himself instead. Then he said, now I’m sure who you are. I thought all along he already had me figured out so of course I was embarrassed. He said he was 85% sure all along. Anyway, I didn’t expect him to send me a picture of himself later that night. I was just teasing about it and now that he knew exactly who I was I figured he would stop engaging in text. 

The next day he asked me how I acquired his number to which I answered honestly so all the more I thought he’d be creeped out. So I apologized lol. He said it was okay but I still felt embarrassed and I wouldn’t have mind leaving him alone although i was enjoying more the fact that he knew who I was and he was still engaging in texting with me. Then sent me another picture of him smiling big (without me asking for it this time) telling me not to be embarrassed about it and that when he calls me a stalker, he is just being funny about it. So men, would you have been creeped out? Any chance he is interested? I am no Victoria’s Secret Angel and may be a little out of shape compared to him who is clearly into fitness, but I do not think I’m ugly.

Literally had 0 experience, so I tried tinder and approaching girls in situations that felt okay. After some self improvements ranging from basic things such as skin care, hair style, clothing style, and other things like anxiety (saw a therapist for 2 years), I slowly started getting more dates.

Here is some advice that I have noticed:
You attract what you are.

What I mean by this is that if you're a cool, laid back person, with a certain style, certain personality, you still have a greater chance of scoring dates with girls (or guys) with the same characteristics. I can approach a girl I don't even know, but if we have the same clothing style, then we already have something in common. I noticed that in order to attract someone of ""your type"", you have to consider that they also have a ""type"", and maybe you're just aiming for the wrong demographic. If you carry yourself the way you like, and in the way that is common to people that you like, you have a higher chance to attract them.

Anyways, back to the good news! The first girl (22f) popped up on my Instagram people to follow list. We had a mutual friend, and she was super cute and seemed like my type. I followed her, she followed back. After some time, I DMd her and we had a good conversation. I ended up asking her on a date, and she agreed! She lives 50 mins away, so planning the date was rough, so she said she'd let me know when she's free. Weeks pass by, and I thought that I got rejected softly, but literally out of now where she DMd me about the date and told me she's still really interested. What's crazy about this is that this all happened on Instagram. But after some talking we noticed that we have the same humor, same taste in music, same personality, and same clothing style. 

The next girl I actually noticed her in a track meet. I compete for my school, and I noticed this girl when I was warming up. She seemed like my type and I really wanted to approach her, but decided not to. A week ish after, I got on tinder and noticed that she was on there as well. I swiped right, and just yesterday we matched on tinder. I told her how I wanted to approach her, and she said I should have because she thinks I'm really cute too. We found out we like the same music, same style, and like a lot of the same things. She also lives an hour away, but told me she ""definitely still interested me and would love to go on a with me"". 

It genuinely feels like you attract whatever you are. If you're an introvert, have a certain style, kind, caring, or anything else, then it's likely you will attract people with the same characteristics.

I texted him this past Friday out the blue and he was super happy I contacted him and wanted to hang out that night but it was last minute so we didn't. Saturday I guess his family member got in a car accident so he was at the hospital all day so we didn't hang out. Today this morning he asked me if I wanted to hang and I said sure, but I guess he was still trying to figure out family things because of the car accident so we didn't again. I mean I really hope he wouldn't lie about something like that but then again I don't even really know this guy. I kind of feel like he was almost using it as an excuse to bail today. So he texts me and asks ""what's the dynamic of us hanging out?"" Like I thought we already agreed friends since we want different things. And I basically told him we can hang out as friends since we want different things (as in I'm not having sex with you unless we're committed). He seemed kind of sad with my response and just liked it instead of the heart like usual.

Now I feel like I just friend-zoned him, but only 2 weeks ago he was sure he didn't want anything so I was going based off of that.

Women that are at least relatively attractive, considering I’m assuming I’m in that category based on compliments I’ve gotten. I have a hard time meeting people so I feel like the apps are the only way. I don’t know how people make dating look so easy, they go from one relationship to another. I feel like I’m capable of finding a decent looking guy but I just have no luck finding someone I like.  I learned to not settle, would rather be alone. It’s known that women have it easier but hasn’t been my experience. Just a generalization or is it typically easy but I’m unlucky?

The main reason is that we really enjoy spending time together and I start my job tomorrow so I’ve had some free time. 

He calls me his queen and calls me his baby. We text each other and call each other baby. He told me he is not sleeping with anyone else or seeing anyone else. He is telling me that he is only interested in me and only wants me. He also asked me to meet his mom when she comes to town next month. 

I deleted my hinge account not because we discussed it but because I just wanted to be off the app. However I am still talking to a couple of guys. I have slept with one of them but haven’t slept with him in 2 weeks. I am thinking about sleeping with the other guy again and seeing the other guy because we’re not exclusive.

I texted her and asked if she wanted to go out again and she replied after a day that she went out of town that weekend and she was sick now too. I took it as a rejection and moved on.

Then when I saw her again she was even more friendly than normal and stared at me a ton, sometimes looking away immediately if we made eye contact but sometimes maintaining it for like 30 seconds til I would smile and she smiled. She came up to me and talked a lot too and we still walked home with each other. She has a close male friend who she clarified a million times without me asking is her ""best friend"" and ive noticed she won't hug me in front of him. One time he asked her to wait up when we were walking, but she just kept on with me instead even though I said I'd wait. 

The other day she told me she'd send me some info for a party but she never did. She brought it up and i didn't even ask to be invited, so no reason she had to send me info. I figured that was kind of an invite.  I saw her later with her guy friend at a school event and while we were talking I said have fun at the party. She asked if I was going but she never sent me anything so I laughed and asked if that was an invite. She looked down at her male friend and then sort of invited me by saying ""yeah, I think a lot of people in class are going"" and said she'd send me the info again. The day of the party I still didn't have the info so I texted to ask for it and never heard from her. Late in the evening I asked her again what's up, and she was super apologetic and said she didnt end up going. I said it was fine cause I didn't want to be dramatic or anything. She apologized again and said she felt terrible. I later saw pics from the event and she wasnt there but her guy friend was and he was in the main group of people putting it on, so maybe that's why I never got the info. She seems very awkward around me when he's around, but she'll still stand next to me like super duper close, and move toward me again if the group changes around. What's the deal with this?

I broke up with my bf of over 4 years in November 2021. The relationship wasn't going where we both wanted and it was a mutual decision to break up.  I felt like I needed to work on myself after this, there wasn't anything bad or wrong in our relationship, it was healthy, but I felt like I needed to find myself after 4 years of being with someone. I had gotten a friend request on Facebook winter of 2020 from someone who went to the same gym my ex and I used to go to, but to respect our relationship I didn't accept it. Newly single, I decided it was a good time to make new friends so I accepted the friend request not hoping for anything. 

He messaged me right away and that's where we started talking. He told me how he used to see me at the gym and thought I was cute so he found me on Facebook (we have mutual friends in common because my ex and him are from the same town). We talked a lot, every single day since then. A week into us talking, he confessed he had a girlfriend of 4 years and he respected me enough to let me know this. We were making plans to meet before this. He had told me he had cheated on his gf multiple times, and every gf he's ever had but never told the girls he cheated on them with. And that he felt I was different because he could confide in me and he understood if I didn't want to talk anymore. I told him I couldn't talk to him anymore and he deleted me off of Facebook and Snapchat. 

He then re-added me on Snapchat a week later to beg me to talk to him again, that he was lonely and I made him feel whole and he liked talking to me. He reassured me things with his gf weren't going well and he would consider breaking up with her. Stupidly, I agreed and we kept on talking. Since then, we talked on Facetime every day and texted a lot. I would go over to his house about once a week and we would have sex. We talked on the phone for 5-6 hours a day. We played video games together every night. I started to grow more attached and my feelings became stronger, so I would bring up our relationship status every now and then, and he would get frustrated because he never wanted to talk about it.

We confided in each other a lot, family problems, things we wanted in the future, things I have never confided in anyone. He made me feel safe and like I could tell him anything. We never really talked about his gf because I didn't want to and it would bother me. He didn't like when I got angry or frustrated because it would ""ruin the mood, and he wanted to be stress-free with me."" On his birthday, he told me his girlfriend really stressed him out and all he could think was that he would rather me be there than her. One night when I slept over, he decided to play video games. It bothered me because we only saw each other once a week so I brought it up. He got really angry and said that it shouldn't bother me and it wasn't a big deal and that's what his gf always tells him. A couple days later he confessed his feelings changed about our situtation because of this.

I wanted him to be upfront about where he wanted this to go so I kept pushing it as he never gave me a real answer. I could tell this bothered him so I tried not to, but it was always on the back of my head and cause me anxiety and frustration. Two days ago, I drank too much and went out with my friends. I don't remember getting home. I had called him several times on Discord asking him to play while he was already playing with his friends. He got really angry and the next day said I was starting to give him weird vibes. I totally understood because I would feel the same way if someone did that to me. I apologized but I could tell there was no going back. The next day I decided to end things since things were already going south. I asked to meet with him, but ended up texting him that we shouldn't see each other. He agreed and said he thought I was crazy because of these incidents, and me bringing things up all the time.

I honestly feel like I pushed him away and I feel so horrible and heartbroken. I regert what I did, although I know I can't go back. I feel like I'll never find someone I connected with and could confide in like him, although I know there were a lot of red flags surrounding him. Even after we decided to end things, he continued to text me asking me questions about the situtation. I tried once more to repair things in a desperate attempt after feeling like shit, telling him I would follow any boundaries he put up as long as we could stay together. Stupid, I know. He said he already caught glimpes of craziness from me and he thought it would be smarter to end it here. 

If you made it to the end, thank you, I just wanted to rant. There's more to this story, and how he gaslighted me sometimes, wanted us to be stress-free but he would be the only one who could do or say things and didn't like when I did, we only saw and spoke to each other on his terms... etc. I feel like I gave him so much emotionally and I feel drained. 

I spent so much time with him, so now how do I move on?

Conversation got off the app after he asked for my number so we texted for a while before he asked me out for the first time. We went out for dinner and tbh it was so awkward (I'm naturally shy and don't know how to initiate conversations) and he didn't really ask a lot of questions I thought I was gonna get ghosted after the dinner for sure. To my surprise, he started talking about next time so I wanted to give it a shot because I'm really attracted to his smile. Conversations were a lot better on the 2nd date and we both talked and laughed. However his texts response were getting dryer and his replies went from 2-5hours per response to 20-30hours. Now I know people can be very busy at work but it seems to me he is losing interest. We recently went out for the 3rd time, did some activities and had a meal together and I'm starting to get kinda emotionally attached. He has left me on read once and I double texted to check up on him. He still initiated some convo after that but takes a really long time to respond. Is he just leading me on?

My(16M) friend who I’ll call Ann(16F) have only been friends for a couple months, just over half a year probably, but I’d say we have grown pretty close over that time.

We sit together at lunch with some mutual friends, text often enough, hang out and such in our shared class. I’ve had feelings for her for awhile that developed after we spent a lot of time just the two of us during one of are schools theater productions in which we where crew. but after I was out of school for a some Covid related stuff, my feelings grew a lot, she was the only person who reached out during my 5 week absence from school, and we texted a lot during that time.

We talked about our futures, beliefs, worries, insecurities, etc. as well as just sharing memes and talking about whatever random stuff came to our minds. I haven’t really felt this way about a person before and am honestly sorta a mess. I think we have good chemistry, we have similar interests, and find the same things funny. It’s worth mentioning I don’t have many people I could call friends, and the friends I do have are all sorta mutuals acquaintances of Ann. Together we’re sorta this little group and I really don’t want to be the idiot who messes it all up.

Really my main worry is that if I confess my feelings I could lose someone who I deeply value, as well as a lot of my other friends. But I feel bad for not telling her how I feel because it feels like I’m being disingenuous and dishonest with her. I just want to know if there’s anyway I could somehow figure out whether or not she feels the same, without having to downright tell her.

So if I understand well, men are being insulted for taking their ""revenge"" ?
Well so you are a boy. You grew up as 90% of the male population, unnoticed by girls. You were not handsome, not popular, not amazing.  At this time, you were just the normal kid with its hobbies. And you grew up seeing these girls. You eventually take your courage and you ask them out, they make fun of you. They rejected you and we all experiment that in College, highschool or in university.  And several years later, you are now working, you make money, you have your life together, you are focused on your purpose. And these same girls who made fun of you, start to like your pic on Facebook, on Twitter on Instagram. These same girls who didn't acknowledge your existence, start to interact with you on these social media under your posts. They send you private messages. And they start to be more upfront about what they want ""We should meet each other someday""  ""Are you free this week-end ?"" 
And you play the game. You meet them, you have fun, one thing leading to another, you end up having sex with them. And after that dump them and move on. 
Because you didn't provide any ""relationship"" after this situation, you are the bad guy of the story? 
As a society we are really blaming someone for ""taking its revenge"" ?
I mean seriously? 

So I can already some people say:"" You still keep grudge from High school/University ?"", ""Get over it"", "" You didn't heal/grow from this ?"". The truth is it is the right of a man to hold resentment against a woman if she didn't accept him back in the day. That's completely fair to me. And no there is no reason to get over it. You can get over it and if you do, kudos to you but if someone  doesn't,  there is no reason to shame him for that/or paint him as the villain of a story.  

""So we don't have the right to reject/refuse now ?""
Yes you have, but just be ready to deal with what will happen next. There is nothing wrong in rejecting a boy, the same way there is nothing wrong holding grudge against this girl who rejects you.  For me thing is when I see women pushing the narrative that these men are bad, I find it hilarious. It is completely fair to me. 
Women themselves once they glow up do the same thing. They start to be mean to men who approach them. They use the one they want for whatever reason and move on. And that's fair to me. They deserve this one. If you didn't want someone when she was ugly, be ready to pay the price when she start to glow up. 
But strangely society find it acceptable for women but not men. Once men do this, it is a problem.

Anyways I did say yes and the first two days of dating her were great but then after that it was as if she couldn’t make the time to talk. Obviously if we can’t talk on the phone we can’t make plans to see each other out of school either. So school is the only time we see each other. However even at school it’s weird. Me and her hug and joke around but we don’t hold hands and we haven’t kissed. I know I shouldn’t rush the relationship but I’m a horny 15 year old boy that can’t get a kiss from his girlfriend.

I was aware that she stares at me and when we talk she keeps up this gaze as if she wants me dead lmao but I thought it's pretty normal to maintain eye contact while talking to a person so I didn't give it much thought. A few weeks go by and I started noticing that she looks at me from afar and when I catch her looking she maintains eye contact. This one time she just decided to come to my isle, stare and maintain eye contact for like 5 seconds and just leave. We have to wear masks at all times so it's very hard to figure out any facial expressions. To point out another thing, she also kinda lurks around to where I would normally be. This one time when I was about to enter my workplace, I kinda bumped into her since I didn't see her walking towards me and we both startled each other. We briefly said hi and all and she checked me out looking top to bottom and just walked away. Getting very mixed vibes from her. We haven't got to know each other that well, just a few convo here and there, basic stuff. I decided to ask her out one day and she kinda shrugged and said she has a bf(her voice spiked and she was a bit louder than usual) and that we could go out as friends.
