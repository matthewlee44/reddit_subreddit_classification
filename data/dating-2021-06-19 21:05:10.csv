2,o3vrm4,1624156841,Feeling depressed after disappointing third date,"I went out with someone on a first date about a week and a half ago. We went to the dog park and had a really great time. She texted me after and we joked about stuff.


This past week we went to the dog park again and then got tacos and went back to my place to watch a movie. We made out a bit and got a little more handsy but things never progressed to anything further. She isn't a big texter and doesn't seem to be on her phone much even when we are together so when she is quiet with texting me back during the week to check in I assume its just cuz she isn't always on her phone.


Today we went on another date. We were going to go on a small hike but because of the weather we made a 90 minute road trip to a bigger city and hit up IKEA (always a fun date) and got ice cream. I was extremely nervous and full of anxiety before the date and I think it kind of affected my ability to be myself but also it just felt like the same vibes and connection wasn't there. She said some things that I didn't love but I also am trying to not expect someone to be perfect.  The other day when we talked about our third date plans I asked if she liked a specific meal because I was planning to cook for her when we got back from the road trip. On the way back she said she didnt realize I was planning like an all day thing but said she would come over because I already prepped the food. We hung out and chatted while I was cooking and as soon as we were done eating, I tried making out but she just wasn't really feeling it.


I am feeling really depressed. I had such high expectations for her because of how great the first two dates were. I dont know if this third date was just bad or if my anxiety got in the way. But I dont know if I will hear from her again. I feel so bad about myself and am just laying here. I will see her again to see if my vibes about her changed and if it wasn't just a one time thing--if she even wants to see me again. 


Anyone else ever had a complete change in feelings or just feel really off on a date and get another one after? I just worry she didnt have fun at all and that made my anxiety go higher throughout the date",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3vrm4/feeling_depressed_after_disappointing_third_date/

4,o3w23h,1624157943,"Mid-20s [M], Never Dated, Advice Appreciated","I'm a male in my mid-20s, and I have never dated before. Part of the problem is I was sheltered/homeschooled when I was younger, so I never was around girls much. Being sheltered caused me to develop insufficient social skills and become very introverted. I did not go to college straight out of high school; I eventually did go but took online classes due to working full time. So was never around girls in college much, either.

I recently 'broke out of my shell' and have become fairly outgoing and confident the last several years. But that has not translated into any luck dating. Granted, part of the issue is I've only asked out two girls in person because I'm not so desperate that I'm going to ask out just any female I run into. And my options are limited because I'm only around other people outside of work so often. But both times ended pretty poorly.

The first time was about two years ago, this girl was slightly older than me. Fairly attractive, and she was really giving what I thought were strong hints that she wanted me to ask her out. Kept hanging around with me 1-on-1 after group events and invited me to have a few drinks with her once. So I eventually asked her, she said yes. We went out for drinks, then watched a movie. Then, however, she tells me she doesn't want a relationship with anyone, she just wants someone to 'hang out' with. She was not interested in being anything more than friends. I wasn't too upset because it became apparent on the first ""date"" that we were not compatible anyway once I learned more about her (I put ""date"" in quotations because I don't really consider that to have been a date, I know she certainly did not). However, I was still a little annoyed about being led on, but whatever, I got over it. I also do not believe this was a rejection of me *per se,* because we still talk from time to time and I know she has not been in a relationship with anyone since and never talks about any desire to be in one. So I guess she just likes hanging out without the commitment. 

More recently, I asked another girl out. She's shy, but amicable. Very attractive. She said yes and we already had something planned, but then she texted me soon afterwards saying she wasn't ready to be in a relationship with anyone, thus the date never happened. I'm admittedly not great at reading body language when it comes to interest, but she didn't seem uncomfortable when I asked and she said yes, so I was a little surprised. I was disappointed and felt it was a little tacky on her part to say yes in person and then back out over text, but I chose to take the high road and just said I understood and wished her well (and to be fair, I know it's always sort of 'putting someone on the spot' when you ask them out and sometimes they don't want to hurt your feelings if they aren't interested). She did not respond or acknowledge my reply. Haven't spoken since. This one particularly hurt because our families knew one another, so I felt I had a chance. Perhaps that's why she didn't want to go out, though, because maybe she thought that would be weird. I might never know. They don't talk or see each other much so I didn't see how it would be that weird, but maybe I'm just naive. In hindsight, asking her out was probably a bad idea for that reason, but what's done is done. I guess I felt like I was just making excuses if I didn't go for it, and of course at my age, I'm a little tired of being single. 

I've tried online dating as well, but have had even less luck. No girl I've messaged has ever replied (though I think some of the profiles on those sites are probably inactive anyway), and only one girl ever messaged me, but she was thousands of miles away so that obviously did not end up working.

I'm definitely not bad looking and am about 6 feet tall, but I'm no stud either. I'm skinny and have a minor underbite. I used to go to the gym for a while a couple years ago, but got discouraged when I wasn't seeing much result and quit going. I planned to start again last year but of course covid hit and kind of ruined that. I've recently started going again frequently, and am more motivated than ever to put some muscle on. The underbite is a long story, but I'm doing what I can to correct that now that I have some money saved up.

Other than that, however, I think I have a lot going for me. Good job, no debt, likable personality with decent amount of friends, self confident, well accomplished for someone my age, etc. Just no luck on the dating scene. Any advice on what I should do differently? I'd really like to at least go on some dates before I start approaching 30. And is this kind of stuff (being led on, etc.) fairly common?

7,o3wpvf,1624160289,Why didn’t kiss her??,"This is not directly related to dating but similar situation…

The other day I was on a graduation party with all my year group, everybody was 15/16/17. There was alcohol (Spain), weed, and more shit I knew I wasn’t trying for sure.  Everybody at the party drank, some a little, some more, I personally had more than most people but I’m capable of much more than them (although this was the second time I tried drinking lol) so I was in an okey state. 60/70% were boys and the rest were girls, I knew nearly everybody apart from some people who where not from our school. 

I wasn’t dating anyone and I never kissed a girl, but I was never worried about it too much. My best friend did kiss someone a long time ago, so he had more experience than me. 

During the party he made out with a girl 3 times during night, just because he shot his shot… Not like me, who even with help of alcohol was still scared/acting like the girl should make the move… 

I was speaking to this girl, I knew her for a long time but I just wasn’t a close friend, just classmates. What I know is that some time ago she liked me, and I didn’t like her but just found her cool. During the party, while we were talking she didn’t stop making comments like “oh I used to like u so much before” or “I remember I found u so pretty before” but all in past tense, I knew it was an indirect way of saying she still likes me…

During the party she was looking very good and I found her attractive at that moment, also , after school ended she said she is leaving  the town, and me too, which meant that we wasn’t going to see each other ever again probably. 

At one time, we were both alone outside and she mentioned again how she used to like me and the same sentence over again, I knew this was my moment to kiss her but I don’t know why, i really dont know why I thought she , a girl, was going to make the move… so I just said oh that’s cool or something dumb to change topic. 

Apart from that moment the same situation repeated at least once during the night, but I acted in the same exact way, which I think made her think im dumb or just not in to her.

After the party my friend asked  me why I didn’t kiss her ? As he heard how she was flirting with me sometimes and saw how I didn’t use my opportunity.

So I really don’t know why, although this was probably our last and only chance to kiss/have some fun/confess love, I acted so dumb and didn’t took my only opportunity??

I don’t want this to happen to me again… so I would appreciate some tips or some explanation from someone who already experienced something similar. 

I’m now quite angry at myself as I know I won’t see her ever again probably…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3wpvf/why_didnt_kiss_her/

9,o3wt8n,1624160599,How do I come to terms with my boyfriend hanging out with his ex-girlfriend?,"My boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) have a complicated relationship. He started hooking up December of 2020 and he broke things off with me February 2021. I was really upset when he did because it’s the first healthy relationship I had been in in a couple years. We started hanging out again in late April and he asked me to get back together. He admitted he made a mistake because he felt insecure around me. We’ve been officially dating since then.

However, he recently started hanging out with his ex-girlfriend again (24F) and it’s making me feel really insecure. For context, they dated for 6 months and he broke up with her about a month before he met me. I’ve been cheated on 4 times. I’ve told him multiple times I feel uncomfortable given my history, but we agreed that it’s unreasonable for me to ask him to stop hanging out with her completely cause she’s one of his best friends.

I’ve never met her before so I don’t know how I can trust her. I really want to trust him but I don’t know how. What do I do? How can I be okay with this when I just worry so much? Part of me wants to be a psycho and go through their texts to prove something- anything- but I dont want to be THAT girl. But I’m also just so worried that I will be cheated on again.

16,o3xnoj,1624163731,"3 years of online dating, what am I doing wrong?","Hi, I’m a 26F and online dating is just straight up absolutely not working for me. I have no idea what to do and I’m feeling extremely discouraged. 

I’ve been online dating pretty consistently for three years. I have never been on a first date where I wanted to go on a second date. I have dated a handful of guys for 3-4 dates and even tried getting a little physical with some just to see if my feelings improved, but it’s never worked. I always have a fun time, there’s good convo, but just don’t have romantic or physical feelings for the guys at ALL. Even cute guys. I’m not being “picky”, there are no specific characteristics I’m waiting for, I’m very open minded. I just don’t feel anything and I cant fix that. 

This leads to me having to nicely and honestly tell a lot of guys that I’m not interested, which is such a hard convo because they usually think that since the date was fun, that it went well. 

I know I’m straight because I’m not attracted to women. I know I’m not asexual because I’ve been very sexually into my exes (but we broke up for a reason, so, no future there). 

It’s just the format of online dating. I met my exes as mutual friends and got to know them in a friendly casual environment for a while before we ever talked and hooked up. But with online dating, it seems like if you’re not immediately into them, there’s no way to casually get to know them. You are both clearly on a 1:1 date to get to know if you like each other. The opposite of casually getting to know someone by just being around them a lot. 

I haven’t met anyone at my work or hobby groups of which I have several. None of my friends have any set-ups for me, mostly because I already know all of their mutual friends.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I have no idea how to make it work for me. If you have any ideas at all, I would really appreciate it.

Later she came up to me talked for a good 10-15 min then got me to dance with her then gave me a hug and we went our separate ways. Today I stuck around until about closing. I saw her come in and she gave me a hug then went to door duty. I stuck around a little longer than normal and she came over and gave me a hug after her shift ended. I told her “it was busy tonight""
She said ""yeah it was""
I said ""you have fun?""
She said no *smile*
I said ""it's work so I guess not haha*

31,o3z1vk,1624169522,Got a Tinder date w/ a girl who is obviously way above my league and now I'm getting anxious.,"I matched with this girl on Tinder who is absolutely gorgeous and after a short convo set up a date for tomorrow night. 

I'm also pretty insecure about my looks, and I've become extremely anxious about my date tomorrow because when it comes to looks she is way above my league.  

Although looks aren't everything when it comes to dating, on a platform like Tinder it ends up being a large part of why people meet just because we're limited to a couple pics and a short bio. 

I'm worried that she might get disappointment the moment we meet because of my looks and right now am honestly considering just canceling the date because of it. 

I know it's unfair and probably wrong to assume the girl is that shallow but whether it'd be my anxiety or insecurity I can't help but be worried.

32,o3z1z0,1624169533,I’ve had two girls lose interest in me in just 2 weeks and I have a feeling it’s about to be a third...,"First girl - Didn’t notice she had interest in me until I noticed she would stare at me when I wasn’t looking. She dozed off in my eyes and would make it noticeable that she was. Anytime it wasn’t her ringing me up, she would find a way to walk over to my location and make eye contact. I was too nervous to ask for her number and now she doesn’t do neither. It’s almost like my presence doesn’t matter to her anymore. This one kind of stung I won’t lie. Most likely thought I didn’t have interest, that sucks.

Second girl - I see her whenever I pick my mom up from work. She sees me and makes noticeable gestures that she’s looking my way. She makes an attempt to walk past my car multiple times in hopes to catch my attention. She does catch my attention because lord she’s fine but I always think about how embarrassing it is for me to hop out my car and walk up to her to get her number just to find out the reason she’s smiling at me like that is because she thinks i’m funny looking :/ now she walks past and barely even looks my way and goes on about her day.

Third girl - This one is in process. I didn’t notice she had interest until a female friend i was with pointed out to me how flirtatious she was being. She has these really cute ‘puss in boots’ eyes and the more we make eye contact, the more I feel seduced. I ended up back there a couple weeks later and the tension was even more harsh, she remember my last meal and that was only my first time there and the eye contact was more tense. She asked me “anything else?” while glaring at me and I thought this was her making it easy for me to say “yes and your number” but I said no and she almost looked annoyed and fed up with me.

All of the colleagues are incredibly nice and welcoming. But one stands out. Shes basically the second in command at the store and my superior but just a year older. We started out just playing Overcooked online with another co-worker but then we slowly got a lot closer.

We started talking daily, about emotional things, the problems we are fighting with and generally much more than just small talk. There has suddenly been physical contact too, from small touches to long and warm hugs. She's also very flirty but I think that's just how she is. I'm also terrible at seeing the signs lol

She is currently going through a break up, maybe she just needs some support. But even then it's kind of weird to me that she's been so open with me despite only knowing me for 2 months. 

On top of that there's so many horror stories of dating co-workers. Maybe I am also just over thinking this way too much and she just sees me as a good friend. I personally feel like there are definitely some sparks. At times we just look each other in the eyes for a long time without saying anything. Time moves differently when we are together and argh I just don't know what to make of this. She gets more beautiful the more time I spend with her and man... the hugs are just absolutely wonderful.

36,o3znvc,1624172389,Ghosted out of thin air,"Whelp, here I am [21M]. Since I didn’t get any closure from this girl, I’m hoping redditors might enlighten me on what could’ve happened.

In a nutshell, my mother and I visited family friends. This girl there became interested in me, though she had little info on me to begin with since I lack social media presence. However she still contacted me via text and a date was set up. 

We’ve met a total of four times, I genuinely felt a connection. Had a light kiss, shared laughs, and made plans to visit a nearby amusement park. All in all, I had great hopes for everything since she seemed very invested in me. I also told her about my future career in aviation (which I’m working towards). She said she’d love to spend time watching shows with me, or hanging out and go on runs or take my dogs to the park with me. She even expressed happiness she experienced in these small dates with the family friends (whom she’s closer with).

I messaged her one day, and on that same day she replied and then began to ignore the last few messages that followed. After everything seemed well before, she simply stopped communicating with me all together right here.

There was never any conflict between us and we were supposed to visit that amusement park but it never happened. It just lingers in my mind because I never received an answer from her, like I didn’t mean anything. I really couldn’t fathom how someone changes night and day like this and doesn’t at least give an answer.

The only thing I could think of is she found interest in someone else (recently) but there hasn’t been any evidence of this according to the family friends. She kind of withdrew herself from communicating with them (and me) and I saw her post a selfie nonchalantly on an Instagram story, meaning she is alive and well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3znvc/ghosted_out_of_thin_air/

39,o3zxkf,1624173602,2nd attempt or it's pointless?,"So here is my story 2 months back a long time crush of mine showed interest in me by massaging me first so I started texting and showing her I am also very interested. Next day we had a short date and everything seemed fine after that she left for another city coz of her exams we texted for about 2 days and she still seemed having fun and liking me but I was always sending first so I stopped for about 5 days and she never messaged me and I was wondering that maybe she wasn't much into me at the end.
Next day I conforted her and told her I had feelings about her but she rejected me saying she hadn't time for someone at the moment and that it was not about me specifically just she couldn't give importance to someone else at the given time and that she was honest about it. i tried to play it cool and that I was ok(I fking wasn't it hurted me like hell and still does).

Now I learned from a friend of hers that she is coming back next week and that she finished her exams. What eats me is that the close friends I told the situation are all telling me that I should try again and that's how women behave sometimes. I don't think that way I believed if someone is interested enough it wouldn't rejected you straightforward and I believe what they say the first time like they really mean it and not speculate and force things.

But I am really bad at reading women and dating stuff and don't really know even if she liked me at the first place,is it worth it trying to interact with her again and how should I do it or it's pointless and I will give her free validation like I am thinking?

I (22F) have never really been in anything serious so this is new territory. His last relationship was a few years and he emphasized that he’s emotionally available and looking for something more serious. We had a vulnerable conversation about my worries going into a relationship etc, and he expressed that he didn’t think we were ready to hookup even though he really wanted to. 

Overall, great and honest date. He told me to call him the next day and we talked for a little. We also talked on the phone for an hour yesterday. We’re both traveling for the next few weeks so we haven’t been able to figure out when to see each other again. 

Everything he said makes me feel like if this were to turn into something serious, he’d be bothered if I wasn’t exclusive now. But, I’m not positive if he would care and I also don’t know if he’s still hooking up with other people. It’s so early to bring up exclusivity but I also am really unsure and I don’t want to fuck things up for the future. I also don’t love the idea of him hookup up with other women while we see where things go. But, I feel like it’s to early to bring it up? I’m not sure what to do. 

tl;dr Went on a first date and it went really well. We can’t see each other for like 2 weeks because we are both traveling.

\- I took all these as little signs that he liked me, and I went over and talked to him. It turns out we both play the same game, he's super nice and now I like him. I then asked him out for dinner, and he said, ""once we're on break, we'll organize dinner"".

\- I asked him out for coffee when I saw him in the hall that next morning, and he said he had to go to class, but that we'd be seeing each other anyway, so I just left it at that.

\- He never pursued a conversation with me after then, even when we saw one another (but he didn't before I asked him anyway). We're now on break and we haven't called one another to organise dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

**My theories:**

1. All of the signs put together, I think he liked me. He's too nervous to make any moves. He's relying on me to call him and organize dinner.
2. He did like me at one point. He changed his mind after I asked him out, and he's no longer interested.

I didn't contact him again because I thought if he liked me he would, and because I didn't want to seem like I was weird and annoying him. But I am shy myself, so I know how awkward it can be to talk to someone, so I am giving him the benefit of the doubt...  What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Guy from different college course would come and talk to me about my class at random. He's super shy. His friend randomly told me that he was single, and all of his friends (who I had never met) all say hello to me and smile and laugh. I asked him out and he said lets organize dinner after break.

67,o46dri,1624197877,I’ve levelled up and didn’t expect this?,"Times have changed but now experiencing something different?

How times have changed but also what is this?

Just looking for some advice. I’m a late 20s woman and I’ve decided to stay single out of choice for the last 2 years. I was in an unhealthy and toxic relationship for 6 years and being honest I was a bit of a doormat for this person. I was cheated on , manipulated and over the years people in my life would comment on how much of an unequal relationship it was. I was chasing for commitment that never came. 

I’d finally had enough and decided I didn’t want to live life like that anymore and left said person. 
The last 2 years I’ve “levelled up” , been to therapy , worked on myself , gained confidence , travelled and excelled in my career. I’m happy with the person I have become and I’ve felt ready to dabble in dating. I’m not a casual sex dater and would prefer to get into a stable , healthy relationship. 
I approach dating as just getting to know someone usually without anything sexual until I’m ready but date multiple people as it’s really just meeting up for actual dates in public places.I like to feel like we are going in proper dates and old fashioned in the way I expect a man to court me first. I’ve struggled with dating apps as it doesn’t seem to suit my slower style. 
The thing is I’ve found a few guys now will make an assumption and small comments about how I come across as an independent woman and that I am sleeping with a few men. I’ve had a guy I went on two dates with say that I come across confident and he bets I have lots of guys. Another who I got to know slowly and had sex with as it felt right and afterwards he became distant  and made a comment about being an independent woman who enjoys sex?! (Are women not meant to enjoy sex?!) 

I find it baffling I’ve went from being an admitted doormat for a man and now I am a bit more confident in myself and much healthier emotionally , there is this assumption and some of the men I’ve met really don’t like that I’m slow to get to know them and actually dating to see what my best match is. This has meant some men I’ve met are just not for me and I’ve had various reactions to rejecting them. 
Just an example I met someone I went on a few dates with and they said they wanted to keep it casual as they weren’t in a place in life for anything else. At the time I wasn’t either so I agreed and we had a nice time and moved on mutually as life parted. A few months later I got a message from him basically asking if I wanted to be in a relationship. It was out of the blue and I was in a different country for work at the time so I said sorry not for me. I got a message back saying ah keeping your options open for other guys. 

I’m very much of the mind that commitment shouldn’t be forced and I don’t chase a man for it anymore. 

I just feel I am judged for actually enjoying being single and not in a rush which I wasn’t expecting.

72,o474vu,1624200020,I've developed a strange attraction. Women willing to split the bill on dates.,"I (male) don't know how this happened, I suspect it has to do with my general frustrations with dating. 

I often completely lose any attraction to women I date after a few dates, to the point I wouldn't even accept sex if she paid me for it. 

Unless she offers to split the bill. She doesn't even have to split the bill, but offer it. And if she does split, well my engine's going to get overclocked. 

Other small insignificant acts of kindness on their initiative also do the trick. 

Typically throughout a date (or the getting to know process), the color and vibrance of the lady just fades away, until I'm just waiting for an opportunity to go home, annoyed that I wasted my time and money, but then if she does any small act of kindness, to anyone, that color and initial attraction returns at full force, yet rarely does this happen.  

Being polite to the waiter, thanking me for the date, saying she was glad to meet me, a compliment of any kind, and of course, splitting the bill. These would be the perfect date. 

The feeling I often have is akin to starvation. Like I've been starved of these small acts by any romantic interest. I was raised to play the gentleman, to always pay in full, to be kind in all my actions towards a date, yet doing so without reciprocation drains the life out of me. I just can't. I've recently started straight-up refusing to pay the for the whole date if she didn't at least make a gesture or show some kind of appreciation. 

I've tried talking about this to a female friend of mine, and she sarcastically responded I was just frustrated that paying for a date doesn't immediately equal getting laid. My reaction was of pure disgust. The idea of having sex with any of these past failed romantic interests was physically revolting. The imagery when my mind darted to that was of having sex with a ghoul, unclean, rotten, though on a pure physical level my previous romantic interests were good-looking though I can't even picture them in my head without feeling some nausea, just writing (thus remembering) this caused a bad taste in my mouth.

Me and my ex have been on and off for about a year and 6 months not until last May 2021. We would talk but then argue so we get cold again until one of us gives up and talk to the other person and the cycle goes on. In the last week of may, he decided to cut things off for good. He hasn't contacted me up until now and i heard that he is seeing a girl that his friends suggested even when we were still together. However i am not sure about that because when i asked the girl she denied having any relationship with him but evidences of them interacting and being touchy and sweet makes me think otherwise, also even though he doesn't contact me he posts like ""sad break up quotes and songs"" on his ig and still views if i contacted him on telegram. So im still not sure if i should really move on now even though it's been like a month because i feel like we're just taking a real ""break"" right now and we'll get back together again. However my female intution tells me otherwise because every time that i get this feeling it is always right so theres also a part of me that just wants peace and stable mind. I wanna stop stalking him and stop loving him and just wish him the best because i feel like i'm the only one still holding on and it hurts seeing him live his life like nothing happened while im here still suffering everyday for a month waiting for him to comeback. 

I feel like i don't want to waste my time,effort and feelings anymore. I want a clear mind and clear feelings. I want to give this love to someone and i always want it to be him. However i don't feel like he even wants this affection and loving that i have right now so i don't know what to do. Should i give this new guy a chance? He is so different from him, This new guy is quiet and we are more like however even though my ex is extroverted i like the feeling of always being on edge when im with him, however when im with this new guy i feel so at peace i don't know why, we've been friends for 4 years now but he just confessed to me and have been courting me for 2 weeks now, i really admit that we are more alike but that i think what makes our relationship ""boring"" because we literally don't have anything to explore unlike me and my ex we are so polar opposite so like we introduce each other on different things,people, places etc. and thats what i like most about us. However giving this new guy a chance seems so comforting knowing that i don't have to explain everything to anything because we know that we really understand each other and communication is great. Should i wait more time and wait for my ex to comeback? or should i move along now?

Can we talk about this because it seems this is like literally a well-known fact no guy dares talk about at all because they'd just be labelled as 'ugly losers' or 'incels'.

For the sake of this discussion and scope of knowledge, I'll only be delving into straight sexuality here and to set things clear, I'm not hating on the opposite gender here as it's no one's fault but merely I just want to point out at how sometimes, treating both genders on the app as the same equally is not necessarily the same as bringing fairness.

Dating app being a simple tool of matching the opposite genders is hardly reality and couldn't be any damn further from the media's portrayal and popular misconception. And using the apps for so long... I've come to realise the apps goes kind of...in general, translate explicitly how dating is really like between genders.

Generally speaking, most girls are like queens on dating apps. They get on average far,far, far more likes than guys ever do in their lifetime. It's not uncommon for most girls, even the most average looking girls, to get 99+ likes within a week compared to an average guy almost never ever getting even half that amount for over a year on the app.

Some further research by Pew to show hard data on this is:

57% of men feel they do not receive enough messages vs only 24% of women

8% of men reported receiving too many messages vs a far higher 30% of women

I'm pretty sure the dating app companies themselves are well aware of this enormous discrepancy between genders and they do secretly take advantage of this and yet without actually acknowledging it publicly. For instance, Tinder was known for charging girls their Plus subscription at a much lower cost and CMB tends to give away free likes to women who just joined the app.

So how can anything be done about this? I wish I could do something myself but at the moment, I can only wish there'd be someone sensible enough to create a dating app that does NOT treat both genders the same. Because when you do so, all you get is an extremely loop-sided dating platform...

So basically, in order to have a thriving and successful relationship, you can’t express emotion, can’t tell her how you feel about her, and you just take everything as it comes.

Now that restrictions are easing and we can go out again, I have been going out a lot more with my friends. Whenever we are out, I find myself scanning the area to look for potential suitors.

93,o49se5,1624207804,Dealing with constant rejection [M26],"How am i supposed to deal with constant rejection? Rejection is never direct but i sense really fast when they are loosing interest. After that, i cut contact brutally even myself with them. I am not the chaser type, so for me, it s either black or white. Everytime it happens it shatters me to pieces at least 2 weeks. It doesn't matter if the girl is attractive or not to me (i'm dating whoever shows a slight interest in me). This stuff tends to happen a lot and it messes with my mood really bad. I have hobbies (i m into arts), a job, i m hitting the gym and i m not in my parents basement either. Those are the general things, the other part, is introversion. 

Also, i feel like i can t relate to any girl. Mostly i m driven by the need of sex (this a major one for me), even i would like to form a deep bond. Even by having the lowest standards, nothing solves the problem. There are aspects about myself like: no social life, no sex life (i m thinking to go to prostitutes if the problem persist), the lack of friends it s not a big deal for me, but the lack of a woman touch comes up with suicidal ideation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o49se5/dealing_with_constant_rejection_m26/
94,o49tyi,1624207935,I didn’t feel anything when he got handsy?,"We ended up going back to his place to hangout some more, and he ended up asking me if I wanted to spoon. It was my first time being so close to anyone or even letting anyone get handsy. Throughout the whole time, I didn’t feel anything. He wanted to kiss, but something was stopping me. Yet, I let him get so close to me. I left an hour later and felt empty. I didn’t feel uncomfortable, but it just felt like nothing to me for something that was the first time. 

Has anyone felt this way? Letting someone get handsy with you but not kiss you. Not sure how to describe the feeling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o49tyi/i_didnt_feel_anything_when_he_got_handsy/

I however am a bit self conscious about my body especially my stomach area… my last breakup also affected my self esteem quite a bit. So I guess my question is….

99,o4a6x5,1624208957,I don’t know what the answer is to improve my dating life,I was on Facebook and came across this guys profile that I know from high school. He’s not a good looking guy and has a shitty job at Target. I’m scratching my head here trying to figure out how he got a smoking hot girlfriend. I always thought that women were exclusively attracted to fit guys and I still believe that there is a lot of truth to that based on dating apps. I don’t know what the answer is to improve my dating life. I’m going to keep lifting and dieting hoping that a year from now that my dating life will drastically improve. Whether that’s the answer or not I don’t know.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4a6x5/i_dont_know_what_the_answer_is_to_improve_my/
