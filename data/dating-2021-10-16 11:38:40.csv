2,q9for2,1634402819,"I had an epiphany regarding people that say ""Guys on Tinder are stinky poopoo because their messages are lame"".","I just thought about this while taking a dump. I think the reason why a lot of girls get boring messages like ""Hey"" or ""What's up?"" is because they're always the ones making the first move. Imagine being a waiter/waitress and you're asked to greet and impress tens of customers daily. Are you going to have the same enthusiasm and positive energy every time? Are you going to greet them with something unique every time that will impress them? The answer for most people is likely not and this is how it feels for guys on Tinder. Some women make the first move and I respect that, good on ya! But it becomes mentally exhausting after some time not to mention that you are expected to be unique and keep the conversation going.

Going back to the waiter/waitress situation, are you going to have the will to keep a positive conversation with a customer that replies with cold, single-word responses? Likely not too. But what about Bumble? Women are required to make the first move there. From my and other guys' experiences, we got lots of ""Hey"" ""What's up?"" opening lines.

Now, are there guys on Tinder that are holding their sosig and can't be bothered to be creative so they just send whatever first comes to mind even if it's utterly boring or even disgusting at times? Absolutely, there are a lot of guys like that. But there's always a few bad apples in the basket.

6,q9fxlt,1634403602,I [22M] am afraid to be judged and mocked because I'm a virgin.,"I'm a 22-year-old male and, as you can read from the title, I'm a virgin. There are many reasons because of it, but the main cause is because I suffer from social anxiety, probably because I was bullied in middle school and in high school. as a result, I have a very low self-esteem and I rarely speak with other people because I'm afraid to say something inappropriate and to be made fun of. Now I'm a university student, and I'm attending the last year and yet, haven't made any friends there. there are some people I talk to, but I wouldn't consider them friends. sometimes I happen to say or do something stupid (or maybe only I think it's stupid), and then at home I'd think about how stupid that thing I said was and that I should've shut my mouth. before I go to bed, almost every night I think about things I said in the past, and how stupid they were.

As for my appearance, I'm pretty sure I'm somewhat good looking, even though sometimes I feel like I'm not attractive enough. Some girls even showed interest in me, but because my anxiety I didn't know what to do and I lost the chance. In my university there are lots of attractive girls, but the thing that holds me back, apart from my anxiety is that I'm afraid that she will find out about my virginity and reject me. The university I go to is small and we all know each other, so the thing I'm more afraid of is that she will tell other people about it and I don't want to be mocked. once I was talking with two female classmates and they were talking about a guy and how they discovered that he was a virgin. They started, laughing and I did the same, but deep inside I was dying.

This virginity situation of mine makes me feel very bad, the thing that makes me feel bad is not only the fact of not having sex, but also of not being able to have romantic relationships with girls, and not having the courage to ask out.

Do you think this fear of mine is reasonable? and what could I do to open up better to other people without fear of being judged or made fun of for what I say?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9fxlt/i_22m_am_afraid_to_be_judged_and_mocked_because/

11,q9gj9a,1634405439,Dating in the US is exhausting for men - more so than in other countries,"I read [yesterday's explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8ss0d/1_females_explanation_of_why_gentlemen_dont_hear/) and want to add a bit of my admittedly short experience in the US, paired with my very long experience with dating apps in Brazil. I'll start to say that the way apps work are not the only problem, and they reinforce some of the worst of US culture.

IMO, there are some things going on beyond the sheer number in the US app dating scene. Back in Brazil, I loved talking to other people (including my dates) about their app experience because I knew ours would be vastly different, I can confidently tell that women there also have the avalanche of likes, catfishes, raunchy, dick picks and everything. My last girlfriend showed me that I was the ""winner"" out of more than 300 matches in a few weeks and several dates.

But the very conservative culture in the US makes things so much worse. And this is pervasive, I relate to liberals here in the US and I'll tell you, this conservative way of seeing the world is very much internalized by even the most liberal women here. And this reinforces bad behavior in men and makes everything very exhausting to those who are willing to put the effort.

To give a two examples, one from the very beginning and other more advanced in the ""process"":

First, echoing the woman complaining about how exhausting the apps are for her, the sheer number reinforces bad behavior from men. I'm used to put a lot of effort in the messages. I read the profile, I send a first message trying to engage on what I found most interesting in her profile, I keep a nice, long profile, particularly on OkCupid.

This means I have to invest a lot at the first contact. And they mostly go ignored here. This is an incentive to not putting to much effort in each match or message and, of course, play with numbers. When I get some answer, than I start investing on that.

Of course, in a culture that womens are valued as ""prizes"" and men are ""conquerors"", this is the expected behavior from woman, and it is also the expected behavior from men. And the cycles go on.

To go out of the dating app scene let's talk about actual dating: from time to time I read some debate here or in other forums about kissing in the first date. And people who enjoyed the date but has a firm stance on not kissing on the first date. Or that they have to wait for the end of the date. I see people who are very liberal otherwise answering ""No"" to these things on OkCupid questions or writing about it on their profiles. And knowing how reddit (and particularly this subreddit) is liberal, seeing the comments to the posts also give me a sense that this is not some conservative or immature thing, it is just part of the culture here.

While I understand the insecurity of sharing intimacy and how in this different culture the meaning of kissing will be different, one most realize that this greatly shifts the full burden of keeping the dating dynamics to men. I have read the other person so much more, to understand if she is interested or not. I lack a firm confident way to understand that this person is not only enjoying my company, but is enjoying it as a date.

Even it the person is OK kissing on the first date, the culture around this meaning puts pressure on both people to make some pretty strong judgement calls too early. It's a kiss, to a couple this is as much part of the good time as laughing together, and people watching don't know if  you are in a first date.... and if they do, who cares?

When I arrived, I really hoped my extensive profile would signal I'm safe to talk to and at least give he a headstart in the conversation. Mind you, Brazilian culture is very conservative as well and woman there share much of the same problems as you do here, and I hoped a similar strategy would work here. Apparently not so much.

To put things in context, I'm male, between 35-40. Have had so far a very fulfilling emotional life, with long and short term relationships with some very different people, but all Brazilian like me. I'm very insecure, but not shy, so I usually rely on online date to get confidence that I'm not passing any boundaries.

17,q9h23y,1634407088,Coming to Terms with a Toxic Breakup and Looking for Closure,"It's been almost a week since my ""pseudo"" girlfriend broke things off and cut me out of her life. I felt I genuinely was falling in love with her but through a series of poorly worded texts I ended up losing her forever... well I'm not sure, I do have one avenue for a follow-up (an e-mail she gave me when we were still on good terms). Should I do it? I honestly don't know...

Some background.

I met this woman (we'll  call her ""J"") two and a half months ago on OkCupid. She lives up state around 3.5/4 hours away so I thought that might be tricky but I messaged her anyway and she replied back. After 6 days of messaging on this platform I suggested I might be open to calls or texts, she let me know a few days later that she was ready. We had our first call and it was amazing (4 hours). She filled me in about just about everything her life, her interests, her family. There was a history of trauma, abuse and toxic people in her life that she was no longer on good terms with. We continued with this for the next month; daily texting starting first thing in the morning, and sharing about both of our lives. Phone calls also continued though not every day unless she needed support during rough times in her life. We had one dust up where she almost cut things off but this was because I was afraid of disclosing my herpes diagnosis. She completely understood and while she couldn't proceed  due to health concerns she agreed to be friends. Eventually we planned a visit at J's place and we had a great time. She complimented me on my intelligence and found me fascinating. She mentioned she didn't sense any red flags about me at all. While there I also fixed her computer and she was extremely happy with this. But something changed during the visit, I found her to be utterly attractive physically. In the following weeks I found myself falling for her beauty, intelligence (she could speak at length on almost any subject) and personality. So when I got back home I thought that since she was such a good host, it would only be polite to return the favor and invited her down to see me. This required arrangements due to her not driving (she was going to take a Greyhound Bus down). We started planning this long weekend and the fun an exciting things we were going to do (thrifting, going to an anime convention and visiting a local zoo). This was two weeks out and as each day passed I could sense she was getting more an more excited. We planned things out in more detail. On my end, I had work to do to make my place ready (as I was still in flux from moving in a few months ago). This required time, money, and effort on my part. Then (as J always has the habit of doing) she politely got me to disclose my romantic feeling for her on one of our calls. J admitted that if it wasn't for the herpes we'd be dating as the attraction was mutual. It was at this point I drew upon some workarounds to this issue that I had been brainstorming. Basically how to have safe sex with one partner being positive (mainly strategies to eliminate skin-to-skin contact). And to my shock she seemed intrigued by this, and stated we might  be able to make things work. Not only that but she'd disclose her decision on your visit. Things kept going smoothly over text and calls. I was there for her 3 days in a row over the phone when she was going through a rough point in her life; listening and lending an ear. 

What started the descent was her asking me to pose more questions about herself. I was a little worried about this because I felt like I knew everything about her and didn't want to tread the same ground. But ask I did, and things went okay at first and I felt she appreciated it. Then last Saturday I asked a question regarding cleanliness/messiness. I was a little confused because of the state of her apartment which I thought was due to chaos from her recent move as well. I could tell by the state of her bathroom that she probably pretty clean, but in my pressure to ask I went ahead with it. At first it seemed like we were having a dialogue on the subject on good terms. She mentioned that it triggered being disorganized triggered her OCD. Thinking I had a chance to relate to my own OCD traits, I shared with her on my own experiences. It was at that point J flatly replied that she thought the comparison was offensive. She felt my experiences were more paranoid than anything. When  she says things like this I take it to be a big deal. J then states she is having a bad day and may not text back in a timely manner. So I ask why she is not doing okay, and it turns out the cleanliness question did indeed ruin her day and her mood, she didn't tell me at the time. Eventually we both apologized and accepted each of our as we were both having a bad day (I was in an off mood as well). When she stated we should stop texting for the day and resume in the morning, I had a really bad feeling about it. To me it felt like this may be the end.

Next morning, I wanted to check in on how she was feeling and express contrition for the day before. So I added a sentence about being ""shaken up"" about hurting her. When she eventually texted back I got a ""sorry"" (thinking all is well), but no... She then abruptly took the relationship off the table because she wasn't in a good place to be with someone romantically that gets bent out of shape over something so minor and has to walk on eggshells around (though to me based on what she said on Saturday it was a big deal to her). At that point I made a mistake and tried to hedge/bargain for the relationship which she took as me manipulating her and not respecting her boundaries. She then starts rapid fire texting, giving me no time to think about what I want to say or collect my thoughts. What I could get in edgewise  seemed to trigger her even more and make things worse. I stated we should maybe step away from the conversation to cool down, but she had none of it.  Its at this point she takes the trip off the table, and starts calling me terrible things (""human filth"" was the mildest). She categorically devalues me as a person; attacking my self worth and suggests I give up on dating. She challenged me to show the texts to my therapist ""who'll call you out for being a POS"". Finally, she slams the door shut and blocked my number, leaving me no chance to make a final statement.

Since I was in love with her this felt like a true breakup, and I was shaken for days. I had to take time off work, and see my therapist. Like J said I showed them to her and was told I essentially did/said nothing wrong. Likewise all the friends I shared them with said the same thing. I'd really like to  get some unbiased feedback from the community on this and get called out if I did anything wrong so I can better learn from this experience. I've been slowly recovering from the breakup, later this week was better and I was back at work, but I'm still not 100%. Now I've been consumed by this almost obsession to send a final e-mail to J addressing some of the points after her texts upon reflection. I know she's cut me off so I worry she'll think this is stalking/harassment. I've been told just writing it out would be enough for closure but I think the act of sending would bring me peace, no matter what the response.  Sadly I'm not yet at the point where I'm at acceptance and have this  glimmer of hope that either she'll resume communication, or sending the e-mail would coax her back. The approach of the one week anniversary is making me feel compelled to do it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9h23y/coming_to_terms_with_a_toxic_breakup_and_looking/

25,q9i5fq,1634410484,Think I might be catching feelings for friend who just broke up with her bf?,"So this is kind of a long story, but I have this female friend who I‚Äôve been friends with for two years. The entire time she‚Äôs been in a relationship with this guy and I always thought she was cute but I respected the relationship and we got along. She broke up with her bf bc she said she wants to live life and she just wasn‚Äôt happy anymore, and at first I was just kind of like why did you do that. What I didn‚Äôt get is how she could say that she was in love with her ex boyfriend but still wants to fuck around and just date around.

What also happened is that she was friends with this other guy while she was in a relationship and she was telling me how he was negging her, being touchy, and how she wasn‚Äôt into it at all and she had a bf at the time. Well she told me she ends up making out with this dude and I can‚Äôt believe that negging and just being persistent like that works. She has a lot of male friends for some reason but she‚Äôs not the type to sleep around and she‚Äôs only had sex with her one bf. 

Anyways, I told her all of this and she felt like I was judging her harshly (which maybe I was), so I apologized the next day. We were supposed to go out today as a group but I guess her ex came to see her and I texted her asking her if we were still on for today and she told me her ex came to see her and that all she said, so I replied that we didn‚Äôt have to go out today snd she didn‚Äôt reply to that for like an hour so I just went to chill with some other friends. She called me annoyed that I was doing something else and she ended up just staying home.

She‚Äôs been acting erratic, and like she said she wants new or more friends (little hurtful), she wants to do more things, but she‚Äôs the type of person who wants to be in charge and I‚Äôve introduced her to a lot of people and she doesn‚Äôt value that. She was on her phone last time we went out with a group of people and I told her to put it away, but she was setting up plans for after when she could‚Äôve just been in the moment. 

We went to a haunted house the other day and it was sort of weird. We interlocked arms and held hands while going through the rooms and I honestly liked it. I don‚Äôt really have a desire to have sex with her but I think I‚Äôm starting to care too much about her in a way. It‚Äôs all so weird and complicated and idk why her drama is affecting me, like I‚Äôm anxious rn bc I know she‚Äôs probably anxious and I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm like that. We‚Äôve been friend for two years and I always felt like she was a bro but now all this drama and like it‚Äôs just weird.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd like it if I saw her with another dude which is why I wanted her to get back with her original bf to keep things the same in a way. This is a pretty close friend, we hangout like every week, I‚Äôm not going to reveal my feelings, but I‚Äôm thinking of distancing myself just for my sake. I just feel like I can‚Äôt be around all that right now.

I've been wanting to be in a relationship again, but I really don't know how to go about it, so I decided to try dating apps.

(For context, I'm a guy.) Honestly this is exhausting. Going through all these profiles, I find myself swiping left 99% of the time, and it sucks. It feels dehumanising, I feel like I'm judging these people, while in reality I have no clue what they're like, but a few pics and a small bio just aren't enough to go off. I hate swiping people like they're merchandise. 

I've gotten a few likes and matches, not too many tbh, but I think that's normal for a guy on these apps. I just can't do this for longer, matching with someone I'd actually be interested in could take months, and in just these few days I've felt my energy being drained swiping through countless girls, trying desperately to find a hint of compatibility in their bio's.

I really do want to date, but I guess dating apps just really aren't for me, I honestly wonder how people do this haha.

32,q9irbg,1634412395,Dating Someone Who Gets Bored,"I (M24) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months now. It's her first relationship (not even a casual fling or anything before) while I've had both casual and serious relationships before 

When we started off, I was a bit worried that I'll come off as a manipulator with great power imbalance because of it being her first. 

Frankly she does have certain instances where she blurted out ""I love you"" way before us knowing each other or crying badly on the first minor argument (not even a fight). I realized and understood the difference in maturity and we spoke and decided to work together on it.

Recently, however I've noticed she constantly gets bored. She's an introvert and doesn't talk much. She doesn't like watching movies which is like the best time pass if we don't wanna leave home. She doesn't have any hobbies apart from working (as a graphic designer) and sleeping.

She's not been out of home much so I tried to create special activities for us (like going to bowling, going for long drives) but it's like not very effective. I asked her directly what she enjoys which doesn't make her feel bored. Her response:- ""Sleeping""

Another short but unrelated thing is that she's been in a pretty conservative household. She's never been allowed to go out of home (except now since she works). So a lot of her firsts (like first outing, first theatre without parents etc have been with me). Though she keeps telling me she wants to do all kinds of stuff which she never really got the freedom for.

While I'm happy for her personal growth, I'm conflicted in 2 ways. At one point, advice suggests that I'm older and it's her first relationship so if anything, she'll be extra obsessed like the high school love.

The other getting bored and exploring makes me worried, the moment she tries new experiences, somehow I'll be a burden which stops her from exploring things.

For now, we both love each other. Our sexual and emotional chemistry is fantastic. I've met her parents and she's made me become a big part of her life.

I don't think there is anything wrong with me for preferring a connection to meaningless sex. There isn't ""therapy"" I need to try to get over it. I am not anti-feminist or giving into the patriarchy because I want a traditional family, husband, committed love, lifelong companionship.

(26F),"Long story short i had been talking to a guy for a few weeks, and went on a first date a few weeks ago and at the end we both wanted to see each other again, however he said he was worried about the chance of long distance in the near future (i was unsure about wanting to move away to a different city) a lot of it was miscommunication and in that moment when he was talking I didn‚Äôt bother correcting him (stupid i know) to clear what was going on. On the date he kept on mentioning if i would consider moving to nearby cities instead of a few hours away, when he kept on bringing it up i didn‚Äôt understand why. So when we talked he said he didn‚Äôt want to be in a ldr which was understandable but i never cleared my side of the story, mostly because why would i tell a guy on a first date a complicated backstory. There‚Äôs a lot of layers to the moving story, but i still want to be close to where i live now, however on the date i spoke so passionately about a different city and he assumed thats where i plan to move to (its about 3 hours away)

So in general we both connected really well on many levels, i was super attracted to him and he said the same thing about me and he was so surprised at how alike we are. So the date wasn‚Äôt awkward at all and honestly he ticked so many of my boxes. I haven‚Äôt connected like this with anyone before. Since that night we haven‚Äôt spoken but we did say we are open to reconnecting again in the future. 

I am currently using dating apps and moving on but i still think about him. I do feel like we had such a good connection and related to each other in so many ways where we felt like we were the same person. I wish i cleared up my side of the story. 

I‚Äôve been trying to move on but a part of me wants to reach out. There‚Äôs a huge what if playing in my head. If he had said to me i don‚Äôt feel connected to you or i don‚Äôt feel a spark, then I would have easily moved on, but i keep thinking because i never opened up to him (about my situation) and he got half the story, we could have been on a few more dates by now

so I met this lady at an event. She was always booked by a multitude of hungry followers, so I was not really into lining up as well. I find such situations really pathetic.

It just so happened though, that somebody else I had to talk to was next to her - and as she acknowledged me, she fully turned to me and from then on just talked to me. We fooled around, asked questions, whatnot. Finally the event had died down and we were ready to be going. As I did not want to come off as a creep, I did not ask to bring her home at first. I made some joke about a supermarket cart that stood around and said, that I could drive her home in that. She laughingly declined. I offered the car instead - and to my surprise, she said yes, although she was not very far from her place.

There was also a third person present. We were having a good time, laughing a lot, getting to know each other until finally, we arrived at her place. She made me stop some distance from her building. Although I felt it was kind of weird, I later assumed, she just didn't want me to know, where she lived. 

She thanked me for the time and the ride and I asked her, when I could see her again. She lit up and said, that she would really like that, but remained vague about the time. So I said, that it would probably make things easier, if we had each others contacts. To my surprise she cockily said something along the line, that that would make her boyfriend very unhappy and took of.

I guess she did not like me at all - but I still try to understand.

Why would she spend around 3 hours chatting and fooling around with me, unnecessarily making her way home a lot more inconvenient, when she was not interested in me?

I don't really believe, that she had a boyfirend (she had said things like 'I'm not behaving as badly as I'm talking' and similar) and if she actually had, that she could not care that much about him. 

It could also not have been about the attention - she left plenty of if just to chat and hang out with me.

I'm a rather social person  and I pride myself in reading signals correctly - I am pretty sure, we did exactly, what she wanted to do. So if she had wanted an earnest conversation, I would have immediately changed the style.

48,q9koks,1634418590,What makes this online dating experience so especially hard and frustrating‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶ for most of us that are looking for a relationship: it‚Äôs always an either or situation. Every date is either hitting the jackpot or 100 % failure (in regarding to achieving the goal of finding a relationship partner, not having a good time etc.). 

Most of us are successful in our life on every other way. Let‚Äôs say in business, in sports, in our hobbies etc. We are used to setting our goals and achieving them. But online dating doesn‚Äôt work that way. There are milestones we can reach on our way to a relationship. We either have it or not.

Plus it‚Äôs toying with our self esteem a lot and I can tell that in the posts here a lot. Everything  that doesn‚Äôt work out, quite naturally, mostly comes with some form of disappointment. It always does, until it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not like learning to play the guitar where you will get continuously better. No, on online dating one might face a harsh rejection and feel like nothing is working the day before we find the person we are going to get married to.

52,q9l6rl,1634420280,WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FUCKED UP,"Writing this to vent, but feel free to add input. Keep reading it will get good lol.

I (26/F) have been on a dating site for about 2 weeks. One week in on Monday, I started chatting with a handsome guy (31/M) we exchanged numbers and planned a date for the weekend.  Since he lived over an hour away he agreed to meet me in the middle and offered to get me an Uber (I don't drive I live in NYC). We face timed right away to make sure each other were not catfishes. We texted and video chatted every day for the next 5 days. Some days when I took too long to reply he would double and triple text me. He seemed more into me than I was into him. Anywho, Friday comes and we confirmed the date. Didn't talk much because I went out with friends that evening. BOOM Saturday comes and he texts me first thing in the morning ""Good morning beautiful cant wait to see you tonight"" again, wanted to make sure we were still going to meet. He told me a time and I started to get ready. he then asked to facetime he wanted to see what I was wearing. (This is when I felt something wasn't right) I told him he would have to wait to meet me in person to see what I was wearing. I face timed him quick to tell/show him I was ready for him to call the uber. Mind you, he texted me many times that morning to make sure I was still coming, make sure I would be ready by 5 etc. He orders the uber and shares the ride with me. Made sure I was in the uber, we drove about 10 mins and he cancels the trip as we're on the highway. He texted me ""I just lost power Im sorry love, apologies for wasting your time."" Before I could reply he had me blocked on everything. Blocked number, blocked Instagram and dating profile. I have never felt physically ill from a situation but I instantly had a pit in my stomach. I was trying to breathe slow because I felt like I was going to throw up. I apologized to the uber driver and offered to give him cash to bring me back home.

I don't know what would drive someone to do all of this. Was it fear? Mysogyny? Antisocial personality disorder? I guess ill never know.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9l6rl/why_are_people_so_fucked_up/
53,q9lk5f,1634421586,"yes, another post about online dating...","So I (m23) have started getting into online dating again. It has never worked for me, but that's not what this is really about.

I find that women (maybe men too?) put little to no effort into it. The trend seems to be that I have to keep the conversation going, be entertaining and witty at almost all times, or they stop responding. I think I'm a funny person but if you don't contribute to the conversion, I just end up asking questions which doesn't seem fun to anyone. And no one ever wants to meet up, even just 10-15 for coffee, girls never agree to go on a date which is exactly why I'm on a dating app. I'm not sexual or anything, we just talk for a couple days, I ask, they say no, and a couple days later they just stop

I don't live in a major city like LA, or New York, but one of the more populated areas in my state. I don't use tinder because that is like 10/1 men. I am on bumble, hinge, POF, ok cupid, and they all generally seem the same.

I'm was already very awkward and bad at talking to anyone in public, let alone a woman I'm interested in, but the pandemic has just made it worse.

Well, if women are having the same problems, or anyone has found a solution to this, I'd love to know.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9lk5f/yes_another_post_about_online_dating/

61,q9m6cj,1634423660,Tinder date red flags?! 23F (philophobia) and 30M,"I re-downloaded tinder as I got bored. And I matched with this guy on tinder. I'm 23 and he's 30. I told him i didn't want anything, just looking for some new people to talk to. And he said he was on the same page and wanna grab a coffee with me.

I've never date or get intimate with anyone before. (I was hurt before from a tinder guy who I talked to for a year but he never make time to meet me). I'm still a virgin, but I know he is a lot more experienced than me. I was scared at first and wanted to take a rain check but I just went anyways. 

I didn't think it was a date. We met at a lunch place at 1pm. It was an opened place so I thought it was alright. I was going to sit opposite to him but he asked me to sit next to him. Soon, he started to wrap his arm around my shoulder and pulled me closer to him, I was a little shocked. He later touched my leg, pat my head etc. I could've said no, but I didn't wanna ruin it :( I didn't feel like him being so touchy in a place like that is good because I literally just came for a lunch and chit chat. Sometimes he was also quite disrespectful to me and make offensive jokes. I did find him attractive though but treated me like a baby... We only met for an hour and we part ways. 

He said next time let's meet at a bar, friday evening. I'm not sure if I should go. I do expect him to be more touchy. I do like it when it's just enough. But I do not want him to see me as an object/ touch inappropriately/ he just wants me for sex. I either want to make friends or get into relationships, but it seems that he was not on the same page and misinterpreted 'i'm not looking for anything' as I just wanted casual?

Anyways, I don't even know what I should do about this :( the fact I know that he's older and seems to know how to get a girl intimidated me especially when I have philophobia and scared of getting attached and getting hurt. I fall easily for a guy and only first meet? i can't stop thinking about him already. I know he followed lots of hot girls from tinder on his insta.. so it's not like he is only into me. I feel like if he just wants casual sex, any girl can give it to him. But I don't want to accidentally or being pushed into sex. I know I need to communicate this with him but What if he didn't even want sex and Im over think? I guess I do want to meet him but I can't let myself be in an alone place with him. Anyways it's hard to say no to him because he tends to make his way easily to me (he's experienced and I'm like 0% experienced)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9m6cj/tinder_date_red_flags_23f_philophobia_and_30m/

 A better concept to use is  a person's preferences. People only want date who they are attracted to. This does not mean you have to be handsome or beautiful to be attractive. You just need to be attractive to your partner.

Now with that been said a lot of what is attractive is universal. For example a person with a job has greater attraction than a person that is unemployed or a person that is beautiful has greater attraction than an ugly person. That is to say the more attractive you the more option you have and the more you have to filter through to get the one you are attracted to.

Even though attraction is universal, you still have a chance to find dates if you are not attractive. It just means you are going to wade through a lot rejection.

He also warned me he‚Äôs super needy and attaches quickly so I was like ok. 

We talked about everything, he texted me every morning and pretty much all day, he kept telling me how he thought I was so special and he had a really good feeling about us, we even talked about the upcoming holidays and when it would be ok for him to meet my daughter, basically plans for the future. It was intense but I was here for it. 

It became physical after our first date (which was two weeks into talking) and we both talked about it and agreed we were ready for it. Then the next week I left town for lwork, he barely texted, had a bad day at work, didn‚Äôt feel good, he didn‚Äôt charge his phone, etc, of course I felt him being off w me so as most girls, I started freaking out, he was so into me and now all of a sudden he‚Äôs barely texting me. He said it was bc he was dealing w life and work issues so I tried to be supportive and told him I could give him space or talk to him about it whichever he needed. He‚Äôs a bit lost w his career and I know he was struggling w that, I‚Äôm the opposite I‚Äôm thriving in mine and had a really good high-paying job which he swore would never been an issue for him. 

We were supposed to have a date on Friday (he was even supposed to pick me up at the airport, his idea) and neither of those things happened so of course my insecure self finally opened up and I asked him if he was still into me etc and how I thought maybe sex ruined things‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt respond so my neurotic self sent him like 5 more texts then finally he responded w the fact that ‚Äúmy freak out was turning him off‚Äù and how until I sent those messages he had every intention of dating me, so I didn‚Äôt text him anymore. 

Today I told him I felt hurt bc he made me feel like I could be myself (along w my anxiety and shitty love past which I told him al about) and now that I was being honest, it backfired on me. He apologized about making me feel bad but then went on to tell me that up until last night he did want to continue dating me but now he didn‚Äôt think he was ready to commit to someone like me. That he thought I was great, attractive, successful and another guy would be lucky to have me.

Of course I‚Äôm hurt, he‚Äôs the one that basically told me he thought I was the one for him and now suddenly he‚Äôs not ready for commitment or me. Did I fuck up bad? Will he come back if I give him space? Or am I better off.

Sorry if i have any typos, since english is not my main language and im currently using a phone.

There are some girls i like that live near me, but i never have balls to just go and talk with them or ask her out or whatever. I have never been in a relationship.
Last time i went out with a group of old classmates (4boys,2girls) was around 4 years ago. After injurying my leg, i decided not to go out with them for 1-2 months, so they kicked me from the groupchat we had (one of the boys kicked me).

Since then i have lack of confidence when talking with pretty much anyone, but especially girls, since im afraid they wouldnt like me or whatever.

You are probably going to say to go to the gym or go get some hobbies, but for personal reasons, i cannot lose weight until next year summer. And i honestly dont know any hobbies also that would interest me. Most of the time i play csgo or watch netflix, and thats pretty much it.

What do you suggest me to do? How can i get rid of my lack of confidence and how could i possibly meet new friends or maybe someone special? Im gonna say honestly, thinking about making a tinder account is a big no from me, because i keep thinking if some of my friends see me there and start making jokes or something

85,q9ooeo,1634432818,Did I Ruin My Chances With Him?,"My roommate who moved in a few months ago is really hot, charming, and just has a great personality.

I've cuddled with him in his room and he's taken me out for drinks a few times.

Unfortunately he lied to me and said he didn't have a GF but I found out HE DOES after checking out his social media. There are photos of them at the beach, wearing matching Halloween costumes, etc.

He still brings her over sometimes and takes her out to fancy places.

Anyway, last weekend she was in the hospital and the guy invited me into his room to watch a movie. I ran up like an excited puppy but as soon as I got in there, I felt guilty and awkward knowing he has a girlfriend. 

When he asked me to cuddle, I responded immediately ""NO!"" and then awkwardly sat next to him, pretty much being silent until eventually going back into my room at 2 AM.

I kind of regret not cuddling with him. I mean I don't even know his GF and they're not married...I OWE her nothing.. Now the guy (my roommate I have a crush on) is in his room watching TV alone and he hasn't talked to me this week. Did I ruin my chances with him?

We already planned another one for tomorrow where we order in some food and continue the anime we started watching but we‚Äôre kinda at a loss for what to do in the future.

For context, this guy has only known me as an adult and he is also my sister‚Äôs age. I‚Äôve also typically had older friends since starting to work, so it‚Äôs not really a big deal to me. I‚Äôm not the type to act like I‚Äôm such an adult just for being 19 years old, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a child anymore.

90,q9osym,1634433285,I just had the luckiest escape from OLD I've ever had in my life :D,"This is a long one, so sit tight.


TL:DR: girls who ghosted my tried to contact me to mess with my head to I use an alt account where she adds me and I annoy her and her mate so much to the point where I get the reason I was ghosted and make them both leave the group chat and block me. 

So, I was talking to this girls (let's call her, Bev) for around 5-6 months hat I had met on an app. It took me a while, but I was absolutely in LOVE with her, to the point where I was like ""yep, I really hope this is the one"".

So a few months go by and its going decently well (I didnt think much of her for the first 3 months or so), but by around June, I was practically mesmerised by her. 

Now, it's not like our chats were dead or anything, I thought they were going quite well (even if i did have to carry the convo sometimes). She even seemed to be decently interested! 

Now, fast forward to 1st of September 2021. I look at my phone. No reply. I just brush this off as her being busy or she wasn't awake yet. 

Now bare in mind that we had literally just met up for the first time in the 28th of August with her mate (who we will call Lucy), and I also personally think it went very well. We played mini golf and had sushi. It was just a very nice day! However, Bev and Lucy went to the toilet, and came back out with Lucy on the phone saying that she had to go back (I did notice this as a red flag at the time, but didn't want to believe it).

Anyway, back to September 1st. The day goes by and she hasn't messaged my for nearly a full day, so naturally I get quite worried. I then check the app that we were talking on originally (as we had moved to snapchat) to find that I had been supposedly blocked! 

Bow im not gonna lie here. This was the scariest moment of my life since my mom broke her back (first true panic attack I'd had in years). I ask my mate what to do as I'm literally shaking (opportunities like this don't come round often for me). He advises that I message her again, so I do, asking if she's OK.

A few more hours go by and she actuslly DOES reply! She basically says that, and I quote, ""im so sorry, im not in a very good place right now and I'm taking a break off social media which is why I deleted almost everything"" (but saying that doesn't excuse the blocking, though I let it slide).

A few more days pass and then I find she blocks me on snapchat too. Now obviously I'm here like what on earth is going on?

So, I message Lucy (the mate she brought with her) basically asking her whats up with Bev. Now this bit is what truely irked me was that her excuse was that Bev got hit by a tesco van and is in a coma... yeah no, im NOT believing that, so I bring her up on it. She basically carries on like ""I knew her for longer than you, how could you say I'm lying, etc, etc. I eventually just end up leaving it.

I do one last check on an alternate account to see if she's still alive and active, and ofc she is (but I already knew that).

A few more weeks go by and and im not gonna lie, I feel depressed as hell. I cant go a day without thinking about what happened and it feels like its getting worse.

But then at around mid-late August, I get a message from a lad on that app, who mustve added me by search, because I had female only swipes on (let's call him Jake). He pops up to me asking me if I was to go up the city centre to play mini golf (red flag), but naturally, I ignore it.

A few days later, Jake pops up again apologising for not introducing himself first (which is fair, so I just start speaking to him normally). However, as we were speaking, he kept on bringing things up in passing which were very similar to Bev's bio on the app (such as ""gimme fun facts"" or ""I'll rate your tesco meal deal""). Once again, huge red flag, but I play along.

But then, one day he asks for advice. He says to me that his friend had died after getting hit by a tesco van outside of school and that his mate has to prepare a speech and she needs Jack's help. Now, Jack also states that she is ginger... Lucy is also ginger, and her being ginger was almost like a little inside joke.

So naturally at this point I stop playing along and confront him about all this what he's saying, but he denies every claim and calls me a weird stalker... eventhough he messaged me first. I knew it was someone in close connection to Bev, but I didnt know if it was Bev herself. 

So another couple weeks go by and nothing really happens until today (or rather yesterday as I'm writing this is 1:47am). For a little bit more context, I made an alt account ages ago when I was trying to still get back into contact with Bev to get answers about why she ghosted me. It turns out that she added this account back today, and messaged me. She was joking around at first and I played along. But then all of a sudden, she messages me saying ""Fuck off (my name), I dont wanna talk to you anymore"".

This was a suprise to be sure, but expected to be honest, even though she messaged me first.

Ok, what im about to do next might be a little bit of a dick move, but hear me out. I knew this was the PERFECT opportunity to get answers about what happened, so I pretended to be one of my mates and called myself Connor.

*IMPORTANT: please note that everything i say to them from now on is not through my normal account, but the account where I pretend to be my mate*

So, now that Bev thinks I'm Connor, I basically explain to her how I feel right now, but in 3rd person as if I were actually my friend. I write a decently long paragraph explaining myself, and all she can reply with is ""k... isn't my fault, lol"".

All of a sudden, I get a friend request from a new person who I'll call Jessie. Jessie messages me and keeps telling me to go away and to stop harassing Bev (which in reality, it was the other way round). We argue back and forth about this.

Then I see that I've been added to a group chat, and who do I see in there too? None other than Jake and Lucy. So its basically a 1v4 at this point. But I dont look at it for 40 minutes.

Now I'm not proud of this next bit, but im happy about it.  I now realise that I'm not gonna get any answers out of Bev without forcing it out of her through anger. So u made it my mission to rub them the wrong way them as much as possible.

This process of just absolute trahstalking would make a halo 3 lobby proud. But eventually I ask Bev directly what was wrong with me, and after 1 and a half months, I get my answer... apparently I was creepy and smelled like piss(?) Well no, what actually happened was that it was almost 30¬∞C out and that i was extremely nervous... oh, and I also sweat easily (but its not like I didn't even shower, I put deodorant, after shave and antiperspirant on too, and I thought I smelled fine). 

In this chat, Be said ""you know whats pathetic? Him having Depression üò¢üíî‚õì"". I never said I HAD depression, just that I was in a depressive state because of the whole situation. 

Oh and theres that I apparently had dead texts, even though I was carrying the convo most of the time. 

Eventually it got to the point where I had made them so annoyed after ripping into them both (Bev and Jessie who were the main ones speaking at that time) to the point that they blocked me and left the group chat. Mission accomplished :).

_______________________________________________________

Now I dont necessarily condone revenge, but it does feel nice, I cant lie.

So I guess that the morale of the story is that OLD is just a trap for mental health issues and uhhhh dont do what I do and keep feelings for almost 2 months.

94,q9p3cr,1634434409,Dating after a breakup.... how?,"Of all the places, I never thought I'd end up here, on reddit, for dating advice, but here goes nothing. 

My GF of 3Y broke up w/ me about 5 weeks ago - Important to mention she was my first long term relationship (I'm 28) so needless to say, the breakup hit me hard, and still has me in shambles. A bit of background story to understand a bit better my situation, I'm not a guy that actively date, the way I got this girl was because we work the same job as me for the same company but in different buildings, and one day I had to go do a big project in her building and she was my ""partner"" for that week since we do the same job. We had talked before but nothing more. Organically, we started talking, she started texting me after work then during the evening, I didn't think any of it at first but one thing led to the other, we started getting into each other, we started asking deeper questions, we started meeting up and hanging out, and one day I made the move and kissed her. I never thought I would've ended up with her (F38) but it clicked, there was chemistry. I was fairly overweight then (even more now since covid) and was surprised a girl as fit and in shape as her was interested in me in the first place... not to add she knew I was a gamer and loved gaming... which really sounds like a loser and non attracting thing now that I'm able to reflect on it. Nonetheless it was seriously the best 3Y of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, so now you understand it all happened without me really actively looking or trying. I live in a fairly small town, I'm no guy to be on tinder and stuff like that, it's not my style. I'm not the kind of guy to go out in bars and such... I don't drink. I was a gamer, generally home, though now since the breakup I've been a workout fiend... I can't see how I'll ever find someone again, like it happened w/ my ex. It was so natural, it fit instantly and we both knew it...nothing was forced, to the point that I can even say the first time we had sex, me the person that's really shy about being naked in front of someone was more than comfortable with her the first time. Now that we're no longer together I know what I want and don't want from a girl, so not only is it going to be hard for me to even find someone since I don't really go out, but I have all those ""Criteria"" in my head now that I know I need in a relationship. I'm scared of comparing other girls to her. It feels like I'll never find someone again and it scares me. Like I said, right now I wouldn't be a good person to date, I'm still healing and working on myself, I'm undergoing a big weight loss journey that will probably take me around 8-9 months. I know by then my confidence level and self esteem will probably be through the roof. My weight has never been an issue, but now that I've had a girl of this ""caliber"" and got lucky imo to have her ""pick"" me, I'm getting in shape to be able to attract girl of that ""caliber"" per say.

Background info (not saying his name): this guy is workout and work-oriented, ex military, and very independent. His last relationship ended with his girlfriend cheating on him while he was still active duty, and he hasn't dated since.

I am a bubbly, tall, fun personality girl that is SUPER shy meeting people for the first time, but I am genuinely sweet and love being sarcastic and playful. The reason I give this information is so it helps piece the story together visually.

I moved to MN recently and we added each other on Snapchat (met him on Tinder or Bumble?). Anyways, we would snap each other at least every other day and talk here and there about what the other person was doing (simple stuff, like his workouts or him hunting or what I was doing that day). It got to a point that he would snap me first and I would not respond half the time cause I didn't think he would be interested in a girl like me (I'm not the skinniest but im also not the biggest. Imagine Amazonian level of tallness and curviness). But, regardless, he still messaged me almost everyday about what he was doing and even started asking me how my days were going. So after about 2 months of talking on Snapchat, he suggested we hangout at some point, to which I got shy and kindly rejected it due to my self confidence issue and just being shy. Also, I didn't want to meet up with him if it was just for a fling because I want something serious and didn't want to get hurt...Well, about a week ago, I ended up driving to his hotel room for our ""first visit"" while he was doing work outside of the state (don't judge me, this isn't how I wanted it to go üòÖ). Long story short, I spent the night and stayed with him till the afternoon of the next day when we both left to go back home. I thought it went great! I didn't see anything bad happen at all. He even walked me to my car, gave me a big hug, told me to drive safe, and drove along side me on the highway for a bit on the way home since we both had a 4 hour drive. That's freaking cute, right?? 

The next day, he starts acting weird. Snapchat was down and acting bad, so I gave him my number so we could do regular texting throughout the day, but he never did anything with it. It was confused at first, but brushed it off. We still talked for the next 2 days, but then on the 3rd day, he sends me a paragraph about how he ""believed"" we wouldn't work out. We share the same interests (he even said I meet his interests) and we both had a liking for each other until I met up with him. I even asked him if he's willing to do a 2nd chance and we do something more welcoming like go for a hike or check out a brewery. He said he's super picky and just didn't think my personality matched up with his, even though he knows I get super shy and nervous the first time I meet someone. Is this normal for a guy to be into a girl and then just tap out the first time he meets her? Is he not ready to commit? Too nervous? The only reason I ask is because THIS is where I get confused 

He still talks to me. Everyday. Or at least sends a snap of him doing something that day. Even as I'm typing this, he's sending me snaps of him hunting with his nephew. So obviously he still wants to be friends with me, but am I missing something? It's not my appearance that's making him say no, because he's mentioned how cute I look and how he wants a curvy girl, but how does 1 night change it all??

So what happens when you do that, it becomes part of your lifestyle and values, and then you can't date anyone similar since fit/slim women are almost impossible to date?","I've been working out now since I was a teenager which is decades now. I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" It makes me uncomfortable.

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is &gt;17% body fat for men and &gt;32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.
