This is my first time posting here - 40yo female, I‚Äôve been single for 5 years and haven‚Äôt been on a date since Nov 2019 (and barely dated before that).  I decided the time was right to join Match last weekend, and immediately fired up some good conversations.  One of the guys (33m) asked me to brunch today, and we‚Äôve been texting the last few days.  That brunch date is in 45 mins (noon) - I texted him around 9am this morning to confirm and I haven‚Äôt heard back.  In your opinion, what is first date confirmation etiquette?  Should I still assume he‚Äôs going even if I don‚Äôt receive a reply?  

Bonus: he asked me late last night when he was going to get a picture of me‚Ä¶after I was asleep.

Then I‚Äôm going back in. 

Last time around I paid for a month of Match and only lasted 2 weeks before I bailed. This time I am thinking about Bumble or Hinge. 

I‚Äôm a writer and tend to err on the side of wordiness when crafting a profile. What are your best strategies for ‚Äúselling yourself‚Äù successfully in a profile when OLD? Have you sought professional help or posted here for feedback?

My photos are usually decent enough to get more attention than I am seeking. But mostly guys seem to ignore the profile and just swipe right on pretty. I want love and romance and definitely not casual sex, but I feel like that is the underlying hope of most every guy I have met.

So how do I express that in my profile? And what are your opinions on ideal length of words and essential topics to cover? 

Any suggestions or opinions are appreciated!!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o92xhy/jumping_back_into_the_pool/
10,o93kqb,1624821292,He Had A Friend Visiting UPDATE,"UPDATE: We are both back in town and his communication with me dropped off during our trips. I met up with him this past Friday and he told me that he wants to be honest and only wants *Simple, Fun, and Enjoyable* so we are on the same page. His phone was getting constant Tinder notifications with that notorious Tinder *ding*. He said he sensed mistrust from me- that he trusts me and doesn‚Äôt care what I am doing on dating apps and in turn I should trust him and not get jealous over what he is doing. When I brought up our drop in communication he said that he doesn‚Äôt need constant communication and I was overthinking everything.



I came back here to read all of your advice again and it‚Äôs ok for me to not want to be *one* of his many. I don‚Äôt need to be the cool chick that goes with the flow to make him happy. There is no dating future in *Simple and Fun* and it‚Äôs ok to want to date a man who only wants to have sex with me. Not me and every other women he can get his hands on. It‚Äôs ok to ask for a situation where I feel safe and wanted. 



Thank you- Thank You my dear Fellow Redditors and Friends for your responses in the original post. Please know it made a difference for me to decide to move on from this connection that doesn‚Äôt make me feel good, disturbs my peace abs requires a good deal of self sacrifice.

I‚Äôm 46 and I‚Äôm just exploring online dating for the first time EVER. After reading a lot of posts here and doing some research, I settled with Hinge. Mind you, I live in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the US. 

- initially, I set up my age preferences 6 years up and down. Well, guys my age MIA, I guess they are surfing younger waters, taken, or abducted by aliens. I guess my best bet would be to go up 24 years, I‚Äôm sure 70 years old would find me appetizing. On a serious note, I increased age up by 10 years, the profiles I saw were really depressing. Horrific pictures, two words profiles, nipple action in picturesüòë

- Then just for the heck of it, I went 10 years down and to my dismay, the guys were sharp, incredible profiles, professional photos, I mean, is like the casting of The Bachelor on steroids! And those in their late 30s, with the facial hair, they look a little older and I was like, ‚Äúooooooooohhh ok, I‚Äôm not a cougar, I‚Äôm not a cougar, maybe just a little, noooo maybe not, stop it woman‚Ä¶never mind‚Äù back to original age settings üòÖüòÇ

Back in the day, I only found out about my husband‚Äôs political party association until the first election after we married. He did his thing, I did mine, who cares? Sometimes we had a 10 min argument, the rest of the time, we had better things to worry about. My dealbreaker is that you actually spent some energy typing that answer. 

- and I basically received just a handful of matches because my dealbreakers are no hard drugs, weed or young kids, and I‚Äôm agnostic but I‚Äôm open to at least 3 religious beliefs.

Already had a meet up/date scheduled with another guy, felt weird about doing 2 in one day, so didn‚Äôt end up getting to meet up with him until close to a week later.

He texts me during the date ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so fucking pretty‚Äù (my phone was in the car so I didn‚Äôt see it until after). He takes the coffee receipt, rubs it on his chest to get the cologne scent on it and gives it to me. He asks for a pen and writes ‚Äúmine‚Äù on my arm. Yes...all of this is over the top but he‚Äôs playful, silly, gorgeous. He texts me after the date to tell me how amazing I am, how proud he was to be seen with me, how I‚Äôm the most impressive woman he‚Äôs ever met, says to me, ‚Äúbest meet and greet ever.‚Äù  We set a dinner date for Friday. He texts me the next day, asking to meet for another coffee date because he has a gift for me. We meet on Wednesday. He gets out of his vehicle when we meet, dramatically drops to his knees, we embrace multiple times. Another lovely time together. He does mention to me that he‚Äôd like to eat Nerds out of my clavicles, but I digress. At the end of the date he hands me a White House Black Market bag filled with boxes wrapped in ribbons. Matching earrings, necklaces, bracelets. This was adorable because his opening line to me on match.com was that I looked like I belonged in a WHBM magazine. Throughout all of this week there‚Äôs been regular communication- texting, sending pics, a phone call. He expresses how he can‚Äôt wait to see my face, how I make him nervous, he‚Äôs worried about eating in front of me, etc. We meet for the date on Friday which is at a super fancy restaurant.

I text him good night xoxo. Nothing. I texted him once the next day. Nothing.

26,o9j2gq,1624882611,Marriage vs Living Together,"I (48F) have been dating my boyfriend (49M) for about 2.5 years.  Neither of us were really looking for a relationship and we dated casually for about 6 months before becoming exclusive.  It's a great relationship.  We just get along and have a great time together.  We generally spend 3-5 nights a week together (depending on our kids' schedules).  We plan to move in together in 2 years when his youngest goes off to college.  We expect to grow old together.

This weekend he brought up marriage (as in saying he wants to marry me).  I don't know how I feel about marriage.  After getting divorced, I never planned to remarry (but also never really expected to be in a LTR).  I am typically ""a glass half full"" kind of person and in choosing to get divorced, I wasn't looking for something better; I was just looking to get out.  My expectation was (based on observation, etc.) that it was unlikely I would ever be in a good serious relationship again.  Post divorce, I started dating without any expectation of a relationship (had just been looking to hook up).

I admit that I find a level of comfort in knowing he wants to marry me (at least in what it says about where he is).  However, although ""getting married"" may theoretically represent a level of commitment that living together may not, realistically after getting divorced, I realized that marriage is really no more permanent than living together.  Additionally, I feel that my marriage lasted far longer than it should have because of that legal document (and of course the kids).  

I'm an attorney, so I know all about the legal benefits, prenups, financial issues, etc.  What I am trying to understand is why the concept of marriage kind of scares me.  At some level I do find it to be an extremely romantic gesture but then I also have all of these negative emotions associated with it (which I know partly have to do with my first marriage but also I likely had before ever getting married the first time, for example I never wanted the big wedding or any of that).

I know everyone's perceptions on this differ but I just want to get your thoughts on marriage in middle age after divorce.  Why would you do it?  Why wouldn't you do it?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o9j2gq/marriage_vs_living_together/

He had a nice, uptown condo, no attachments, bilingual, adventurous, and probably would have murdered me without a second thought 8 years in.

* I asked if there was anything I had done that had her pulling away, had I been smothering her? She said that has never been the case with me. She feels I give her adequate space.
* She is not ready to be in a relationship where we are meeting kids/families. I relayed I am not at the point either, and frankly, I enjoy having each other to ourselves. I told her, if anything, I need to get to know her better. I pointed out, I didn't even know what her favorite color is yet!
* I told her just us going for a one hour walk when I have my short, kid-free evenings during the week would be great as a date, especially since we both want to work on our cardio.
* She explained in her previous two relationships, she found she had prioritized the needs of the two men, and not given enough to her 2 kids. I told her I would never expect her to do that to me, nor would I allow it. Case in point, I drove the 25 minutes to meet her so she'd be just a few minutes from her home, where her 13.y.o daughter was home alone. She relayed how grateful she is that I consider that.
* She is scared to go to the next level, because her daughter is doing so much better since they moved in February, and she and her brother are going to be starting in a new school system in the fall. To spare the details, both her daughter and my son have spent time at inpatient care facilities in the last 2 years for SI behavior, so I am sympathetic to her situation.
* I found it interesting, but she did say her kids have encouraged her to try and meet a man.
* As far as how she feels about me, she says I check so many boxes for her, and she really appreciates all of the little things I do for her, whether it's been a little gift like a plant for Mother's Day, to the effort I make in handling the reservations for our dates.
* I repeated something to her I've said before: I keep finding when I meet someone new, at some point in the date, I am comparing them to her. I basically admitted (though I probably shouldn't have) I'm crazy about her, and meeting her has been one the top best things that's happened to me since I separated and divorced my ex-wife; I have hard time with picturing her not being a presence in my life.
* At one point, while I was in this stream of consciousness where I was eluding to the fact that we may have to go separate ways, I saw tears welling up in her eyes, and saw her start wiping them away. Right there, I made the decision that perhaps I'm not seeing things through her lens properly. I leaned in, and whispered to her not to cry, and put my arm around her. I softly told her, I'm not looking to walk away.
* I brought up about how clumsy, rushed, and how selfish of a lover I thought I was the first (and only) time we had sex, how I wish I could go back in time to early last month. Like the last time I told her this, she laughed it off, and told me the situation wasn't ideal, we had a time constraint, but agreed we both wanted it, and I should stop beating myself up. I told her I am looking forward to the time we can ""do it right"".
* Our night ended with a passionate goodnight kiss in my car. This felt different, the way she was touching my face, and the way she was holding my hands.
* Before going to bed, I sent a goodnight text for the first time in a long time, and reminded her she can always talk to me, and she replied to me I can do the same.

Its been 2 days, we've been having regular exchanges via text, nothing heavy, even initiation. We have not made plans yet for when I am kid-free in 2 weeks, and since she is introverted, I doubt she'll be one to initiate plans. Who knows though, perhaps this talk lifted a weight. I do not think I will walk away just yet, but I do think it will be in my best interest to really begin to think about just what it is I want from her, and to also give ample enough notice for when I'd like to see her.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o9s6cm/update_what_next_why_is_it_so_hard_when_the/

I'm sort of seeing this lady, we've been on two dates and text daily.  There's a connection and we mutually agree on that.  I stopped with the apps after the first date, so I like her.  She slept over on the 2nd date.  

But we got into a conversation yesterday that has me wondering how to proceed.  

We share a lot of common values when it comes to politics, religion, attitudes about relationships and so forth.  But we diverge when it comes to vaccines, and we diverge strongly.  

I'm 100% for them and in most cases would not date an anti-vaxxer not just over that but because it often signals differences in other really important areas.  But like I said our values overlap for the most part.  

She however has never had a vaccine, nor have her kids (she lives in a small village and just tells the school ""I'll bring the certificates later.""  And she never does, and it works every year.  She lied to her co-workers about it and she works as a head chef and restaurant manager.  And she told me that she doesn't feel bad because she has the covid antibodies.  

I said, ""ok, I can live with that.  Did you get tested or something.""  She evaded the question twice and then admitted that no, she didn't get tested but that she ""knows her body and knows she has them.""  

This conversation was via texts and voice messages and in the last voice message I think she was almost crying, saying ""I respect other people's choices to get them and wish people would respect mine.""  

And now I feel kind of bad because while I wasn't rude or anything, my inquiries were very level-headed.  But I like her and feel bad that the conversation didn't end all that well.  

Putting the vax/anti-vax debate aside, please, anyone have any thoughts on this situation?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oa4wz2/otherwise_great_match_but_one_big_divergence_of/

Do these different intentions impact the outcome of dating?

For me, sex is important. I want pleasure at the center of a relationship, but that doesn't mean I dont want all the other good stuff that comes with a connection with someone. Yet, dating for a serious relationship seems to require putting sex lower down in priorities.

Its seems to require spending alot of time in activities that aren't sex related only to find that the relationship comes to an end once sex is introduced. Or it gets unnecessarily complicated and the games start.

61,oakclq,1625009556,I've just broke up with my gf yesterday (40M and 38F)," You are probably reading this and going like you piece of shit but it is what I am feeling. I went into the relationship thinking like she is the one for me, it was so clear in my mind because I was so mesmerised by her love and care for me. It was so good to live in this fantasy.

But a month ago, I had a realisation that I cannot go the distance with the lady and I need to end this because her goals and values just wasn't complementing mine. To put it context, I am 40 and she is 38.

I so desperately wanted to settle and so desperately wanted to get married and it seems that was a possibility. She is a happy go lucky girl and that in itself is not a problem but overtime it became a problem for me.

Her everyday life revolves around netflix and sleeping. She likes to spend money and spend more than she can earn. Her usual response to anything would be I don't know and then doesn't care to find out. She complains alot about her job and gets anxiety attack and then she would not do anything but sleep for the entire weekend.

When she was awake and well, she was the best gf and the most caring but that is shortlived. When I hear about all her problems, I listened carefully and give her genuine advice on how to solve it. When I suggest anything I will have to tread carefully because she doesn't appreciated unsolicited advice. When we go anywhere should would be on average 1.5 hour late and Im basically sitting around waiting for her. And another time when she cooked dinner I waited 2.5 hours from 6 to 8.30pm. The reason that it was so late is because she was watching netflix and only remembered I was coming later. Lastly, nothing gets done because she is always too tired, or I can't be bothered doing it and I'll do it later.

For the longest time, I ignored the red flags and kept saying to myself she is going to get better as long as I stay by her side and encourage her alot. I was making a lot of excuses but I was also thinking how is this going to play out.

Then a couple of weeks ago, she showed me some engagement ring pictures and at first I thought it was pretty cool but I started thinking about it seriously. Everything I've had issues with started to pile up in my head. I started to see that if we were married then there is no way that she will be a contributing partner in the marriage. Life is hardwork and the only reason she looks ok now is because her mom and dad do everything for her (she lives at home) and she can't even manage herself properly. I am thinking then one day I will be the one to do everything for her and all she brings to the table is love. Don't get me wrong, love is great but in reality that is not going to sustain everyday. You need to pay the bills, stuff needs to be cleaned, the usual upkeep of life needs to be regulated or else how is love going to work?

I felt stuck and in my mind I could not accept it and make the compromise. I also hadn't given her the opportunity to discuss my concerns. Because in the last 6 months, her actions speak louder than words, her happy go lucky persona is set in her ways and it would be cruel of me and unkind of me to place my expectations on her. I knew right then and there that she was incompatible with me although the love was great.

I had to walk away, I had to break her heart. OMG...my own heart is breaking. I rather break the relationship now then kept on living the fantasy and get married and have so much burden that we call for a divorce lawyer.

74,ob4kbl,1625081213,What would you do?,"Hi All - I have been lurking for a bit and thought I'd ask what you would do in the next 6 months to increase your chances of meeting someone. 

Some stats/facts:

43F been told I look younger. Keep myself in shape/dress well/grooming etc. Never married/single too long. I work on equivalent of Wall Street - you'd think great male-dominated field. Not met anyone I'm remotely attracted to. Just secured another job in another part of town but it's for a smaller company (25 employees and I'm now C-Suite Exec). I'm not averse to meeting someone through work but in my existing job I met 20+ different people PER MONTH and not met anyone I like in the 6 years I've been there. I am basically Frasier - I was watching reruns recently and he says ""my God, prisoners on death row can find someone to marry them and I can't find a single (wo)man!"" 

Other than working in a male-dominated field for most of my career, these are the things I've tried:

\- Gyms 

\- Tennis club

\- Private members' clubs (x3!) - the members club organised different events but not really 'singles events'. They did host a singles dating agency event once but when I followed up subsequently it turned out they had a tiny handful of men and no way to verify if they were also legit without paying $10,000+ to join the agency. 

\- OLD - minimal success but none of the questionable experiences some of you on this thread have reported either so am open to trying that again

\- Vacations (not tried singles only but travelled on my own a lot)

\- Hanging out in parks/coffee shops etc.

\- Asked friends to set me up 

I have another question: for the ladies or guys who are now in successful relationships with a woman - has anyone successfully frozen their eggs in their 40s and had healthy babies? I am fortunate in that financially I can do this but I'm also realistic it would be a surrogate who carries and even then chances of a full term successful health pregnancy might be minimal.  

How would you approach the next 6 months in the new job and focus on your dating life. Thank you to everyone who is kind enough to read/reply.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ob4kbl/what_would_you_do/

I'm looking to work towards a committed relationship, and am having a hard time figuring out how to be ""more organic"" and ""less forced"". I'm going to talk to him more about this, but until then I'd appreciate thoughts/experiences/etc. on what organic relationships mean. For reference, we have been dating about 3 months. 

Does this mean I have no control? What if there are things I want/need - if he is not already doing those things of his own volition, should I not ask, because that means I am forcing something? For instance, I feel sad when we go days without talking, and would appreciate even just a quick text. Do I just wait and hope he starts doing that one day? 

Do organic relationships have the relationship escalator? Like, how do you know when you are committed? Are there any milestones that come with organic relationships? 

If I'm honest, to me this feels like he has all the control. I don't believe there is anything he wants/needs from me so all of these things are coming from my end. If I'm just waiting and hoping that one day he will start doing these things organically, then that makes me a much more passive participant. He does tell me I can ask for whatever I want/need, but since he's so adamant about this being organic I fear that by asking I am forcing something on him.

91,obre7j,1625162441,"Pro Tip: To keep conversations going, ask questions","I can't believe I even need to say this, but trying to have a conversation with people is like pulling teeth sometimes.  For instance, I joined Bumble a couple weeks ago and I've been getting a decent number of matches finally.  So far, every single first message I have received have all been short sentences like ""Hi, how are you?""  And that's fine because nobody wants to spend a lot of time writing messages if they're not sure if they'll get a response.  

So instead of just saying I'm good, I try to strike up a conversation and ask about something on their profile, and I try to leave it open ended that doesn't require just a yes or a no.  But still, most of the time I receive another short response and nothing else.  So okay, I figure I'll try again and write a little bit more and ask another question or two to try to strike up more conversation.  Yet again, I just receive an short answer and nothing else.  That's about when I give up and unmatch, conversations take 2 people and a little effort.  

But seriously why is it so difficult?  Like what's the point of even going on the app and sending a message in the first place if you aren't even going to try to get to know the other person?  Should I just be sending them dick pics and ask if they are into anal instead?  Should I tell them I'm unmatching because they have made zero effort?

The next day I had a first date with someone else at lunchtime which went really well and she wanted to arrange a second date which I agreed to. 

Over the next 5 days I wasn‚Äôt in touch with the first woman due to work being busy and I had my child too.

We kept meeting up and then I asked if he wanted to actually try dating (instead of just coming over). He said he had to think about it because there was a woman he wanted to be open to still see.

A week later he wanted to have ~the talk~ with me. He laid out what he was apprehensive about due to the trauma of his ex, he was open to exploring something long term (maybe forever if it was right), and he said he‚Äôd be monogamous if that was a deal breaker for me (it is a deal breaker so he agreed to it).

Yesterday I went to sleep over and the excitement was gone. He pretty much got me into buying dinner because he said he was driving, and the sex was less exciting. We overheard the people in the apartment above having sex and I felt sad that their lives were so routine.

What can I do to make it still exciting and fun with this guy now that we‚Äôve agreed to monogamy and to actually explore commitment? If anything, I want it to get even more exciting and fun, it‚Äôs one of the ways a relationship can progress.

99,oc0p67,1625192187,Am I overthinking a FWB?,"Ok, so I‚Äôm a long-time lurker, but have never posted before. Please be gentle. Sorry for the novel. 

I (F43) have reconnected with an old flame. We met through OLD about 4years ago. Neither of us were in a place for a LTR, were both in a casual frame of mind, and we hit it off. Big time. The intellectual and physical chemistry was insane. We were comfortably FWB, communicated regularly and could talk for hours. 

Fast forward a few months and he went totally radio silent. I didn‚Äôt find out what happened until he reached out a couple months later. Life shit went south, as it‚Äôs known to do sometimes. I was sympathetic. We communicated intermittently for the next little while but didn‚Äôt see eachother. I met someone else, and started a relationship, which came to an end after two+ years (this past Jan). 

Cue reconnection about a month ago. He reaches out, we get to chatting.  It was friendly and flirty, and we‚Äôre both single. He came over for a visit a two weeks ago, and it was just like we both remembered. Fast friends. Easy conversation. Common interests.  Insane physical chemistry. We talked for hours, made out a little (yep, still hot), and then he went home; we both seemed eager to rekindle and both seemed to be on the same page re: not looking for LTR, but also not booty calls‚Ä¶ more like taking a lover (FWB). I even bought some new lingerie the next day because hells yes girl, of course I did. 

Communication following the visit was quick and easy that night, and a bit the next day. And then I didn‚Äôt hear from him for two days.  Which, fine. No biggie. I responded, and then another two days before I get a response. This pattern continued throughout the week.  Only ever getting a brief response, no back/forth conversation, but he often included a question for me to respond to, so there was a hint of engagement. Then no response for six days. I sent a follow up message on day 3; nothing. I recently sent a message asking for an explanation (but not expecting one). I intended on deleting his contact info, letting my past stay in the past, but felt compelled to ask anyway given our history. He responded within minutes with an apology, saying essentially he had meant to respond, and that he had been busy but definitely wants to see me again, and soon. 

Now, I‚Äôm not as invested at this point as I was last time. And yes, I came to understand the circumstances of that situation, but I had been devastated at the time.  I think I needed him to come out the gate strong in initiative here, given our past, and especially if I was going to share my bed with him. And this feels disrespectful. My spidey senses are on edge, telling me something is off, but I‚Äôm not certain if that‚Äôs the situation, or if it‚Äôs me over thinking it.  If he were a new connection, I‚Äôd have already sailed that ship. It‚Äôs our history, and missing his friendship+ and connection that‚Äôs giving me pause. 

Is this what a normal start to FWB looks like? I‚Äôm usually a ‚Äúthree days no response? No dice‚Äù kinda girl with OLD, but this one is throwing me for a loop. I don‚Äôt expect daily communication, but is it unreasonable to expect something a little more responsive than this?
