I was pretty much alone throughout high school and my first 2 years of college because lack social skills and panic when I‚Äôm around people, especially girls.

I‚Äôve tried to develop socially on my own, but I think I‚Äôm too awkward to not come off as a creepy loser. I also don‚Äôt have great self esteem and I‚Äôm terrified of being rejected which is a bad combination.

She mentioned a present she wanted and I was hesitant to get it as I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was too soon but I figured I wanted to and she deserved them, they weren‚Äôt mega expensive but a fair amount. I went round to give them to her yesterday. She was happy with them but when I left, I still felt uncomfortable and unsure in myself. She text back saying she was happy with them and so grateful. She didn‚Äôt get me anything, which is fine as I didn‚Äôt give the present to receive one and I‚Äôm not that bothered.

I opened up the dialogue of if it was too much, too soon &amp; she said the act wasn‚Äôt too much but paired with the trip away and it being Christmas makes a difference. She then said she told her friend and she said anything Christmas related gives off cozy and coupley vibes so the notion is quite intense, and she felt like that was a perfect description. She then added that it isn‚Äôt a dig at me and I haven‚Äôt turned her off.

I said that‚Äôs fine, we can cool it off over Christmas and she said it‚Äôs a busy time seeing family and she has to rearrange old plans with friends that were cancelled last week but we still have a date booked in for January.

Ultimately, I‚Äôm not really sure what to think of it, last I saw of her she was quite affectionate and touchy but now I feel like I‚Äôve read everything wrong and I‚Äôm not sure how to even go about it all anymore. 

Do I stop texting her? Do I just pretend it didn‚Äôt happen? I would like her to be upfront if she doesn‚Äôt have the same feelings and don‚Äôt want her to avoid doing it just because of a gift and her feeling obligated to continue talking to me (which I explained to her).

I‚Äôm a massive worrier and don‚Äôt want to spend the next few days sick to my core in uncertainty. Even some coping mechanisms would be great.

14,rnlhn5,1640349391,"Discovered the Risk of online dating the hard way, need advice","My first relationship lasted for 15 years and began in Highschool. It ended bad with infidelity, she cheated on me with at least 35 guys that I know of. I hit a deep depression and became extremely introverted. Afterwards i wouldn't even entertain the idea of anyone interested in dating me. Years go by, eventually I created a social media account to keep up with sports highlights. I was a SM virgin, I didn't partake in any social media before this in my life so I was unaware of the potential risk.

 Somehow I met this girl online, it started as just friendly conversation out of curiosity but eventually grew into something more. We began chatting all day and every day. After a year She eventually started speaking of starting a life together, I was sold on the dream. She was the sweetest girl I've ever met and went above and beyond to make me happy. I did the same for her. She Introduced me to her family and close friends. There was great distance between us(different countries), but that wasn't an issue because I was financially in a good position to visit whenever I wanted. The issue was the pandemic lockdown happened when we became a thing and lasted the entire duration of our interactions. 
Months go by,

I noticed her getting distant towards the end, I felt her slipping away but couldn't do anything to stop the bleeding. She broke things off with me and told me that she lost hope that things will work out, stating that it's been a couple years and we haven't met yet. She also admitted the doubts hit her after her ex bf from years ago randomly reached out. He was also long distance from her but he lives in her hometown. She decided to pursue his advances. Less than 2 weeks after she broke it off, the travel ban was lifted. I was devastated, meeting her irl had became my dream. She chose to visit him instead, completely crushed my heart and spirit. (Crying profusely rn just thinking about it resurfaces the pain I felt)

I had developed a deep emotional attachment to her which makes the pain noticeably worse than a physical one for me personally. All I'm left with now is broken thoughts and dreams of what could've been while she's back with her ex. I feel extremely foolish for thinking someone's love for me was as pure as mine and thinking that a girl across the world could love me when the one I was with physically for 15 years didn't. I wish I'd known about this subreddit sooner, I'd have realized that I was essentially fooling myself (playing the adult version of house - Random redditor). 

I gave her all of me and she abandoned me, won't allow me to meet her and now won't even return a friendly nonromantic message. 

*Not suicidal but have no will to live, I've given up on ever finding happiness in this world. I have no one in this world, not even loving parents.

*I've never cheated on anyone in my life, I can't bring myself to do it. Why can't I find someone that can match my loyalty.

He also lives in the city where I will move in 9 months but right now we are 500km apart. We planned to meet up in February. He suddenly just stopped texting me and I thought well here it is sexting and ghosting again. I asked him and he actually replied and told me that he has to deal with depression right now and doesn‚Äôt really do anything and that he is suffering from it since his childhood. He stopped texting me again and when I was really drunk I told him that I am not mad when he can‚Äôt text me and that when he feels better he can reach out if he wants to.  That was 3 weeks ago. I feel so stupid I know I should just move on and say thank u next or something like that. But I can‚Äôt. I think about him constantly. I‚Äôm used to having guys run after me and 90% of the time when I meet guys on dating apps i don‚Äôt feel any sort of connection. But not with him. I have never in my whole life been that interested In a man before it‚Äôs literally crazy (I get gehostet too don‚Äôt get me wrong, I normally just don‚Äôt care). I know maybe it‚Äôs just a sex thing and he doesn‚Äôt care about me. It probably is. 

I don‚Äôt know what I should do. Should I really move on and try to forget him? Or should I text him again(that would be the third message from me in a row because he didn‚Äôt answer) and ask if he‚Äôs ok or something like that?

He messaged back that he is overseas for a week to see his family but, and this is how he worded it, ""let's do maybe something when I am back"".

After he came back, he didn't get in contact, didn't ask me out and I didn't ask him out again either because I had already asked once and didn't want to be pushy. Weeks went by and I didn't hear from him. In the end, I messaged him to strike up a conversation, asked him how his trip was. I was hoping this would remind him of me and provide him an opportunity to ask me out. He wrote back and he said the trip was nice and asked me how I am, but he took 3 days to read my reply and after he finally did read it, he left it on read.

I ran into him a few weeks later somewhere and we had some pleasant chitchat, but it led nowhere.

At this point, I think I really have to cut my losses and move on, as he is clearly not interested. I'm just trying to understand why someone would say that we should do something once he is back if he clearly doesn't mean it. Did he say it to be ""polite""? Why did he even respond to my message if he was not interested?

20,rnm7vc,1640352032,I love who I am when I‚Äôm dating around,"A little backstory about me and how I came to truly love dating: In early 2020 I had my heart broken from a cheating ex, and after about a year and a half I finally feel like I‚Äôm totally over it, don‚Äôt miss him or think about him other than an abstract ‚Äúex‚Äù from my past who changed my dating trajectory.

Before we dated, I was a serial monogamist who liked to tell myself I was a dating butterfly, but compared to now, in hindsight I was just a single caterpillar looking for my next LTR cocoon. Like most of my relationships, my ex and I moved very fast with emotions. I felt like he was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for the whole relationship, so dating afterwards was a little tough to understand again. At first, dating became this chore of solving human-shaped Rubix cubes as quickly as possible and throwing them away if I didn‚Äôt feel like they could ‚Äúlive up‚Äù to how i felt for my ex. What was the point? Along the way I started noticing how happy I was in the during. I was taking care of myself, trying to look good for first dates, constantly going out and having new experiences, and learning so much about different perspectives and music and media. Instead of cutting off people I didn‚Äôt see long term potential with, I stopped looking for long term partners, and just enjoyed the ride. I started cutting off people who played games, or gave red flags, and keeping people who just weren‚Äôt my ‚Äúidea‚Äù of perfect, but I liked their company. 

I‚Äôve always been an enthusiastic conversationalist, and dating really has shown me how much I enjoy that tightrope walk of trying to win someone over when you‚Äôre getting to know them. I‚Äôve started being upfront with people that I‚Äôm not looking for a relationship, I enjoy dating around, and I want to stay being single as long as possible. Some people either don‚Äôt vibe with this or think I‚Äôm bluffing to not seem clingy, but aside from them, This has led me into some wonderfully fulfilling less-than-relationships. I‚Äôm not tied to one person, but I get enough intimacy that I don‚Äôt feel used, or like I‚Äôm using them. I don‚Äôt worry about people texting me back, I‚Äôm not hurt if someone isn‚Äôt as into me as I‚Äôd hoped. I have self confidence radiating, which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of attraction and validation. Dating happily is easy if you love yourself first, and I notice what I love about myself when I‚Äôm presenting my best me to someone else.

I honestly feel thankful for my heartbreak because it really forced me to rebuild myself, and now I value my singleness, my dating abilities, and myself more than I did before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnm7vc/i_love_who_i_am_when_im_dating_around/

I'm not pushing you away, I want to talk but not too fast"" and since then our conversations have been sporadic and kinda dead.

A week after that I get a message from a woman on instagram telling me he cheated on me that night. They went out for drinks and he stayed at her house when I thought he was at his mothers house. 

We broke up but continued to see each other until November we made things official again. 


I do not want to keep blaming our arguments on his cheating because if I made the decision to forgive him, I should try to move forward from this. I know he‚Äôs trying his best now but I still have my doubts that he‚Äôs loyal and the issues I have with him always make me think back at his disloyalty. It‚Äôs causing me to be insecure and suspicious which is disconnecting me from him. I am still angry that he started a fight about not trusting me nor my BFF and then did exactly what he feared I would do. I am angry that he has lied about major things on multiple occasions but wants me to treat him as if it didn‚Äôt happen.

34,rnoizl,1640359769,OLDers should come up with a system.,"Maybe worth pointing out I‚Äôm a 24 year old male

If you date online you should come up with a system that spares  your mental health whilst also allows you to pursue potential partners. 

I see a lot of people on this sub that seem to sacrifice their mental health, time and energy in the pursuit of love. 

I ask you to stop. Believe me you hold all the cards, you‚Äôre just not using them properly. 

Over my time OLD I have come up with a system that eliminates ghosts and unserious people. Here is the way. 

First off, just like who you want to like or talk to who you are interested in. Don‚Äôt go for the cast your net wide approach. 

Next have 1 conversation and get off the dating app. Ask for an Instagram or a number or whatever you want. I ask for insta because I think you can get a better look at what that person is actually like but this is personal preference.

All you need to do is when your first conversation comes to a natural end then ask for a social. If they are somewhat interested they will give it to you if they are not then they won‚Äôt. 

Next stage is talking off the app. Just have a convo simple. See what vibe they give. If you like it and if YOU want to then ask to go in a date at the next possible time. If they don‚Äôt want to date you this is where they ghost, become flakey or whatever. So far you have wasted about 2 days. Which is probably about 3-4 conversations? 

I‚Äôve been using apps for about 2 years now. You meet people on there that want to date, don‚Äôt want to date or are unsure. There is no way to know which one of these you are talking to so force their hand. Make them commit to a date. Don‚Äôt mean that in a forceful way of course I just mean give them that option because if they want to and the offer is there then they will. 

It saves you from the guessing game.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnoizl/olders_should_come_up_with_a_system/

What leads some people to believe this in the first place though? If you've already fallen out of love with someone and/or the relationship has turned completely toxic... What could make one think that bringing a third person into the mix, and the all the stress of being 100% responsible for that person all the time, is somehow going to improve that??

44,rnq0ki,1640364497,"Activities such as movies, concerts, and shows should be avoided on the first several dates","Although movies and live performances can evoke positive emotions that you want to feel on a date, these type of activities should be avoided while you are initially getting to know someone.

The primary reason is that your attention is diverted. You are not engaging directly with the other person. You are enjoying a fun activity together, but an emotional bond isn‚Äôt being established. If you are interested in someone romantically, it‚Äôs crucial that this type of dynamic is established early on. Otherwise, your dynamic will veer towards platonic friendship. 

Consistent eye contact is perhaps the biggest factor in establishing an emotional bond in the early stages of dating. Studies have shown how constant eye contact during personal interactions can promote feelings between participants. If both of you are looking elsewhere in a loud environment, there isn‚Äôt a chance to look at each other directly, talk, ask interesting questions, bond.

Movies and live performances in particular are amazing experiences to share, but wait a while before choosing these activities if you are getting to know someone.

I agree,"I've \[F22\] talking to a guy \[M25\] for a couple of weeks and overall it's been incredible. I feel like I've known him forever and he's been showering me in compliments and openly telling me he really likes me. We've already delved deep into subjects like long-term goals, what we do and don't like in a relationship, sex, lots of things. We reguarly have long phone calls and it's very comfortable; I've been pretty excited so far and fell for him a bit prior to the first date.

On the whole we seem really compatible, but there's one detail that makes me feel terrible for not liking. We matched on tinder and his photos were a bit 'bigger' than average. There was a bit of chunkyness, but his cute face still came through. My bodytype preference is average-to-skinny; I decided to give this a go as this is leaps and bounds better than my past dozen dating prospects in every other aspect.

We had our first date and it was great... But I felt he was larger than the photos of him I saw before. I was enjoying myself though and we went back to his, and he initiated fooling around but we didn't have any kind of sex (my preference). Great date overall, but my physical attraction for him has very much waned. Prior to this date he brought up his weight semi-frequently, joking that he's big. I didn't really know how to react. He sent me photos from a few years ago at a 'normal' weight and... **oh my god,** he was *EXACTLY* my type. Absolutely adorable face, incredible proportions, sexy arms, I was getting turned on just thinking about hugging him in that state. 

He at one point said he's happy with his weight right now, and might lose some in the future. I feel so conflicted. It would be horrible of me to say I was more attracted to his previous photos, and it would be awful for me to go into a relationship with him with the intent to try and change him. At the same time, the idea of breaking things off when everything else is close-to-ideal feels awful, and I would have zero idea how to articulate why I'd be breaking up with him truthfully, other than giving some bullshit excuse like 'there's no chemistry' which would give him zero closure when the real reason is incredibly simple.

Should I have done something differently?,"Backstory: Met a woman on a dating app. She works, but her vehicle is currently broke down. She went out for her daughter's bday, and invited me and I accepted. The bar is in downtown. 

When I got there, they were already drinking. After a while of getting to know each other, I offered to buy a round, which my date told me not to worry about it and that she got it. We eventually left, to go to another bar which is on the north side, but it totally sucked. I offered to buy her a beer there and she told me it was ok and that she couldn't drink anymore. So we agreed to get something to eat, and everyone agreed on IHOP, well the son told me to follow him, which I did and I noticed that we were heading back to downtown. When we got close, she told me that we were probably going to Denny's. 

The thing is that I hate Denny's. I think their corporate tasting pancakes are garbage lol. I was really hungry and tired and I just wanted to get home. So I told her that I had a great time and I would like to do it again sometime, but I was probably going to head home. She said ok, and gave me a kiss and got out and walked to her sons car. Then I noticed that while talking to him, she kept looking back at me, and I was thinking uh oh..that's not a great sign. I waited a min or two and then slowly pulled out and went home. 

When I got home, I realized that maybe she didn't have anymore money since she had spent so much money at the bar. I would have been ok to pay for her, but we didn't even talk about it. The next day, I got up and she had blocked me on fb and text. So should I have approached this differently? My sister said that I shouldn't have said that I didn't like Denny's and I should have sucked it up and just drank a glass of water, but I was hungry and tired and I just honestly feel like I shouldn't have to do that.

The reasoning some of the responses had was crazy. Some went as far as to say my ego was hurt about cancelling.

68,rnstma,1640373338,Rejected after three great dates. Hurt and confused,"I [33M] recently got rejected by a girl [29F] after three dates which by all indications went really well. Feeling really hurt and confused. 

A little about myself: I don‚Äôt want to sound cocky but I feel like I‚Äôm a legitimate catch. I‚Äôm tall, funny, fun, active, a good listener, I have a good job in engineering, I‚Äôm financially responsible, in good shape, and enough women have told me I‚Äôm handsome that by now I finally believe it. 

Honestly I think this is the first time I‚Äôve been rejected dating as an adult except for two girls who as I was breaking it off said they felt the same and that‚Äôs just a chemistry thing. This was also the first girl I‚Äôve been excited about like this. Usually I‚Äôm not excited about someone until we‚Äôve been hanging out for a lot longer, but with her I was mid third date and it just hit me what an insane catch she is. I feel like I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to come around who I just felt really lucky to be hanging out with. She was that. The top of the dating pool for me. 

Ok so the dates. They all went well. On the first date we had great conversation and chemistry. I walked her to her car after and kissed her. She literally said ‚Äúwow‚Äù and then went to get in her car and came back for more saying ‚Äúwow‚Äù again. Our second date we met at the rock climbing gym. It‚Äôs not the best setting for a date but it was fun and we were able to do some like physical flirting. I had to run but we said we would meet again. In between the dates we were texting alot and when I asked when I could see her again she said ‚Äúyou tell me‚Äù which made me feel like she was really into me and I was holding things up. We made plans to have dinner in her neighborhood which she later changed to cooking dinner at her place which I took as a great sign. Ok the third date she seemed excited to have me over and show me her place. We worked well together in the kitchen and had good conversation. While we cooked i took the opportunity to get a little physical. Massaging her neck, touching her back, etc. She ate it up. We talked for a long while after dinner and at some point I start to realize ‚Äúthis girl is amazing‚Äù smart, interesting, funny, good job, physically my ideal, same hobbies, confident, competent, driven, resourceful. Just everything. Im super into her but I also feel like I‚Äôm a match. Not insecure at all. Eventually I made a move and we started making out on the couch. Clothes start coming off and things continue to heat up from there. The physical chemistry is as good as it gets. Eventually we‚Äôre in the bedroom and we fool around until late at night. We don‚Äôt have sex because the ahem timing is bad but we do everything else. There‚Äôs no mistaking that she was very much enjoying herself. She was very generous with me as well. Eventually it gets to be really late and I say I should leave and she pulls me back in. The third time I say I should leave she tells me I should stay. The whole time I‚Äôm there we‚Äôre cuddling, kissing, touching. Just really indulgent physical contact. She eats it up. In the morning it‚Äôs more of the same but I say I should go eventually and she again pushes me to stay even though she has meetings. Eventually I actually leave. I drive away grinning like an idiot thinking I‚Äôve found someone amazing who‚Äôs super into me as well. 

We don‚Äôt make plans for a next date just yet because of holidays travel plans. Pretty quickly I feel a shift in the texting. She‚Äôs not texting back as fast and we‚Äôre not really flirting. I try to make some sexy flirts that she basically ignores. I‚Äôm getting confused but I think she‚Äôs just busy with work and visiting family. Maybe she feels like she needs to text more early when you‚Äôre still in that online dating phase but not so much when you‚Äôve established there‚Äôs a connection? I worry I‚Äôm just texting too much because I‚Äôm excited and coming off desperate. I decide to just leave her be and see what happens. She texts me late one night and I don‚Äôt reply. 13 hours later she texts me something like ‚Äúhey I hope you‚Äôre having a great day!‚Äù  And this makes me think ok she does want to chat. I make a date with her for the day after I get back. She enthusiastically agrees to let me cook her dinner. I say I can‚Äôt wait to return the favor of her cooking and as well as some others (just trying to be sexy playful flirty) but she doesn‚Äôt reply. 

The next day she basically says even though we have ‚Äúundeniable chemistry‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt feel right. I say ok no worries but what was it. Her feedback was that she felt defensive around me and I probably didn‚Äôt even notice but it doesn‚Äôt feel like how she normally is. Replaying everything in my head I can‚Äôt imagine when I would have made her feel that way. The best I can come up with is that my playful little flirty jokes that I make with everyone may have been the issue. Maybe she‚Äôs used to people just praising her. I think most women like this kind of playful teasing because it keeps them on their toes. That or she just thought I was ok but used me for physical stuff and then made that up because she couldn‚Äôt be honest. 

I‚Äôm super bummed but after a day of feeling really down on myself I feel pretty normal and I don‚Äôt have hard feelings per se. I feel a little used but I did something similar with a girl a couple of weeks back so who am I to judge. It just feels so weird that things felt so SO good on the third date (to me) and then she made it seem like she kinda could tell that it wasn‚Äôt going to work. Im normally so confident with women but it‚Äôs really shaken me up. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be super suspicious or insecure with future women. And I still keep thinking about her, mainly because she just really is as good as I could possibly find and she slipped away. I‚Äôve waited so long for someone like this and in the end I wasn‚Äôt worthy of the caliber of woman. It sucks. 

I‚Äôm so confused about what happened. I‚Äôm open to theories or advice on how to go forward and deal with the rejection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnstma/rejected_after_three_great_dates_hurt_and_confused/

We are not looking for a serious relationship, so both of us agreed to just be a fwb. It was absolute no strings attached sexes, and even though he showed a few symptoms of a lack of affection, it went well. The problem was last night. We jumped into the bed and had sex but while having it, he asked ""Do you love me?"". I hesitated ,because it seemed to crossing a line considering that this is just a fwb relationship. However I chose to reply ""Yes"" because you know, no one can say ""no"" in that situation. He used to say ""I love you"" during sex before, but I kinda ignored it because I know that people can say anything during sex out of enthusiasm. I know ""I love you"" is just a common sex talk but ""Do you love me?"" is a question requesting a reply. I don't want to go further with him but what if I'm just overreacting? What if he also didn't mean it and ""Do you love me?"" was just another his sex talk?

71,rnt6nn,1640374481,How to master tears and get back in the game in the New Year,"Alright, so this might be a weird problem, but I could use some advice.

I (31F) had a bad first relationship like a decade ago, and since then every time I try to seriously talk about dating, I start crying. 

Now, in my head, I know the one guy was just one guy, and as I've gotten older I've only gotten stronger with respect to basically every aspect of my life. I'm good with people, and I'm financially stable and close with my family and friends. It's like I have some kind of knee jerk physical reaction to the idea of dating, though. 

In spite of this, I HAVE gone on dates, but most of the time I have to pretend to not actually be dating the person, and it goes great all the way till the guy wants to do anything that couldn't be construed in my mind as strictly platonic. Then it's tears, even though I know intellectually that everything is fine and dandy, and I get increasingly anxious until I break things off, which is always much to my physical relief/mental chagrin. 

Settling down with someone seems like it could be great. I have a lot I could bring to a relationship, and I think it's possible that I could accomplish more in life together with someone than I can solo, so I'm trying to beat this.

72,rntosn,1640376094,Should I (M23) ask for a date soon or wait until she (F21) recovers from surgery?,"I (M23) matched with her (F21) mid-nov on bumble. Until now, we have met up 5 times, the last time being on the 23rd where she invited me to her birthday party at her house with her uni friends where we cuddled, held hands and kissed (not make out).

However, she had an ACL surgery on the 15th Dec, and basically she's been recovering since, on crutches/can't go anywhere far, and resting at home. Since surgery, our texting has been minimal, basically once per 2 days. She barely instigates text (whereas before surgery she often did), so I instigate every time just asking how shes holding up and her responses have been short so I always quickly end it to give her space to recover (Although, she said sorry for not texting me that much when we were cuddling on her bday).

After the party I messaged her that night, saying thanks for inviting me and she replied ""thanks for coming and for the birthday card xoxo"". I then asked ""you planning on resting at home for the coming weeks?"" she said ""yea I think its smart for me to rest"".

QUESTION: Should I wait until she recovers (mid-jan?) to then ask for a date then? Until then should I keep texting/calling at a minimal? (which is already the case now)

OR

say something like ""when are you free to meet up sometime soon?"" in the coming days. But since she's on crutches, we can't go far, so maybe her house? but She lives with her dad, and she told me shes never brought a guy back to her house, and it's probably too soon to interact with her dad at this stage.

SO

we probably can't meet up until she recovers, and I probably shouldn't text her or call her more to interact with her (every YouTube dating video warns about phone is for setting dates not getting to know someone/ overtexting = needy behaviour/will turn her off).

So what should I do now? Literally back off/minimal texting until mid jan to ask her to meet up? Surely if I stop initiative contact she will think im playing games?

She had her IG plugged into her account I noticed the pictures she had were from like 2017 or 2018 but thought nothing of it at the time.

I pointed out that she didn‚Äôt really resemble the woman in the pictures. She looked slightly offended and said she had put on some weight from college and then some more from the pandemic but truth be told I was pretty turned off and annoyed that she deceived me in a way.

80,rnuhn5,1640378657,33M: 1.5y later and I am still haunted by a strange 4 month relationship I had,"I had a I was engaged for 7 years to a wonderful girl but she was someone that had basically all the opposite love languages to me and struggled to show affection. It became too much, I left, and for a while I enjoy casual dating/sex.

Eventually I met this girl via Tinder. She was beautiful, to the point people would be taken aback, but in an unusual way. She was intense, passionate, affectionate, opinionated and smart but also somehow mysterious.

The first months together were like a Lana Del Rey video. She made me feel like the hero that had whisked her off her feet, and to me she was this beautiful and precious but brooding heroine with some kind of inner pain.

Eventually she told me that she had had extensive mental health problems throughout her life and was still seeing a psychiatrist. At the time I thought nothing of it as she was so functional and seemed so happy and well adjusted.

Over time I noticed that many of the hobbies she claimed to enjoy or interests we seemed to share, she actually had to knowledge of or interest in. Her compliments became subtly backhanded. She started to become paranoid about me cheating on her. I noticed her staring at me blankly when she thought I wasn't look, for long periods of time. Most of all I developed this intense feeling that wasn't feeling connected to her or tuned into her wavelength or something, I felt like the person I was seeing was a projection.

I struggled really badly with these feelings and it showed. I started to neglect her and withdraw from her instead of talking to her about it. I blamed myself for having commitment issues. Eventually I broke up with her. We got back together a few weeks later but she wasn't really interested in talking about why, she just told me not to do it again, that conversation led to the final breakup.

Since then I have been unable to form a romantic attachment to anyone. I can see they are great potential partners but I can't let go and just commit to them. I am chasing the feeling I had with my ex when we first got together. Everything else feels muted. All I can manage is brief flings or casual sex and then I drift away from people.

I have tried:

* Therapy
* Meeting new people
* New hobbies
* Taking breaks from dating
* Talking about this with friends and family
* Meditation
* Psychedelics
* I even moved country for 3-4 months just to try and turn the page on this chapter

It's not that I want to be with her, it seems clear to me that she had a personality disorder and that things would never have worked, but my time with her haunts me. It was like a dream of the relationship I had always wanted, only I became suddenly lucid, realised it wasn't real and suddenly woke up. I go back and forth in thought loops about whether it was all in my head or she really was as unusual as I remember.

We are no contact but I am sure she doesn't think about me at all, but here I am over a year and a half later and I must have discarded 10+ girls who wanted to continue seeing me because I just feel nothing for anyone since then.

85,rnusbv,1640379639,Confused by her behaviour,"So I was dating a girl a couple of months ago but things when quite and I just moved on. Recently though things seemed to change. In the past week she was liking posts, Interacting with my stories and starting conversations. She even said about spending the day together soon, so I took it as her gaining interest again. I have to admit though it took me by surprise and I‚Äôve been cautious about it.

Now for the reason for the post and granted I may be wrong, it seems as though she may already with be with someone else. I‚Äôve come to this conclusion from posts in the last day or so and comments such as ‚Äòwow, I don‚Äôt know how I got so lucky x‚Äô again I acknowledge I may be wrong, on a lot of things in this post.

I‚Äôm not going to lie, I did get a little boost thinking about things progressing but now I‚Äôm just thinking I‚Äôll leave her alone again and just forget about it. I don‚Äôt want to waste a lot of energy on it. I am curious though if anyone else has ever encountered anything like this? And please tell me if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong or reading into things?

86,rnuv0b,1640379886,Me (M24) am worried about how to go on after my first date since years (F27),"Hii guys, since quiet a while ive been active on tinder and other apps. I always state clearly that i would love to get in a relationship but im pretty carefull about going into one. My thoughts being that im pretty carefull about it since i get emotionally attached fast. 
Last weekend i had a date with a girl i matched with that monday. She was late since she got news that her uncle died pretty much out of nowhere which is how the date started. We went to a small bar for a few hours, had great conversations, laughed and decided to go to her place. We smoked a joint, had some drinks, ate sushi and after some hugging we kissed. It felt amazing, i thought that there was something real a connection i did not felt so far this fast before. 
It quickly escalated into sex. i felt like i was not performing well, since i get nervous really fast and i think i mastrubated too much beforehand. Therefore my weener got not as hard as usual. (Its also been a 5 years since i had my last gf and only one time sex in between) after a 30 min it kind of stopped. I felt the lust from her until penetration after that the touching and such became less. I dont know how to feel about this. Nobody came but we cuddled really nice after and she fell asleep on my chest while i was watching the Witcher season 2. 
After a while we said goodbye while kissing and off i went. I texted her: i want too see you again and she was thinking the same

We had great conversations before but she has a 40 hour work week and is pretty busy. I tried to keep the conversation alive by texting her about my day but she hardly writes back. 
I recieved a voice messege with her explaining why she usually doesnt reply (we havent really talked since 3 days). I feel like im loosing her and honestly if this continues im getting pretty done with the situation. Its bringing me too much insecurity. I want too wait since she is dealing with somebody that died but since its christmas vacation i want to see her soon since we both have time. 

Am i being paranoid? Im worried

87,rnuv9r,1640379910,Stood Up Last Night,"About 3 days ago, I made definite plans with some girl off of bumble. We both agreed to meet at x place at x time. Infact, we both made it very clearly and agreed upon the date and time. I showed up a few minutes late because I couldn't find parking, and messaged her saying that I had just arrived. I took a second to look around to find her. I didn't recognize her as anybody there. I saw a bunch of old townies, old faces that had probably been going to that same location for years. In fact the bar tender greeted an older gentlemen sitting next to me by his first name. I decided to sit down and order a beer. The bar she had recommended didn't have a drink menu. Off the top of my head I thought of a popular beer that I might somewhat enjoy, as the bar almost certainly didn't carry anything I liked if it did not have a drink menu. I ordered a heiniken, with regret. 

Fast forward 15 minutes, she still hasn't messaged me back. This is where I was giving her the benefit of the doubt. 15 minutes is not alot of time. But I was still sitting there twirling my thumbs. I had gotten worried that maybe something unexpected had happened to her? After 30 minutes I asked for the tab so I could leave. 30 Minutes with no contact is where I drew the line. This place didn't accept credit card so I ended up using the ATM to withdraw money and paid the extra fee. I walked down the street to order a few slices of pizza before I decided to head home and study. Before I left the bar I messaged her, ""Didn't hear from you so I decided to leave and go home and study."" To which she still has not replied. 

Looking back in hindsight I probably should have expected this. I think the reason is because she had decided to move the location closer to her house, when I offered a location to meet. Normally, this wouldn't be a red flag to me, but when she recommended that it be closer to her house, she didn't know any bars in the area. I had to research them, call them, ask what time they closed, and make the plans. Which struck me as odd, considering the bars were literally in her town, and I had to do all the heavy lifting. It was quite inconvenient for me, as I had to drive 20 minutes there. Overall, it wasn't a fun night and I have learned that I should schedule dates closer to me, and probably confirm whether my date will show up or not in case something like this happens again. She certainly will not be getting another chance from me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnuv9r/stood_up_last_night/

Alright buckle in this is a long one - 

So I (22f) began talking to this guy (23) a little over a month ago, our conversations were great and we texted everyday. I gave him my number the first day after we began talking it was such a good conversation. Well finally after 2 weeks he asked me out for 2 weeks in advance. We went to dinner had a really great time and he said we should do it again soon and he‚Äôd text me tomorrow well, he never did so I texted him. And our conversations continued going well so I asked him on a short notice second date, he said he was kinda busy but he‚Äôd make it work basically, the date started off rocky because the place we were going had too long of a line and then the place we headed instead closed by the time we go there so he invited me back to his place and basically we cuddle and had great conversations for several hours, I expected him to make a move but he never did or maybe I missed a signal, I‚Äôll never know, but then he said I‚Äôll text you tomorrow at the end of the date again, and he never did so I texted him and we had a short conversation because it was late and went to bed. But now I‚Äôm confused because he responded happily to my texts. And he has yet to text me today. Maybe he‚Äôs busy and forgets? Maybe he just doesn‚Äôt know what to say to turn me down? Or maybe it‚Äôs just the holidays? I‚Äôm just a bit stuck on how to proceed. Any advice? PS he also texted last last night, but we usually take turns beginning conversations.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnv3ox/not_sure_whats_happening_did_i_make_a_mistake_or/

95,rnvn9w,1640382500,Condescending | narcissistic | flighty attitude |,"WARNING: LONG ASS STORY

&amp;#x200B;

I met this girl sometime around 3 months ago, we are ""Dating."" I say it like that because well, she's in fucking Switzerland. Originally she said she was here in Georgia (US) and that was cool. Then a week later she says, ""Oh I'm currently in Switzerland because of my mother's death, dealing with the government"" she goes on to tell me that she and her mother didn't have that much of at all a relationship. She was adopted but still knew her mom still. She didn't have that good of a relationship. 

I ask her why she claims to be in GA vs Switzerland and then asks me why does that matter? SERIOUSLY? Well, I let it slide because she said she's coming back soon. In the meantime, I DID tell her if I find another girl that wants to date she has no right to get mad at me because she's not here. She's been there for almost a year. I asked when she's coming back, she finally said ""January 26."" OK, that's cool but why so far out? So this is the funny thing, she never explained this to me AT ALL. 

She explained finally it's because she gets paid once a month. She can work from ""home"" from her laptop which is good. We've gotten into at least 1 fight a week about something stupid. First, she wants to have normal sex, then kinky sex, then she wants one of her friends in but I can't fuck her friend but her friend can fuck her. Said I can do the same with a guy, I explained, I don't do that. I'm a 1 woman girl. I only fuck women. I was bi, I feel like it was a phase in my early 20s, now it's not.

Well, every time we talk, it feels like she's trying to lowkey one-up me. She doesn't realize it but she comes off as that person everyone knows, a know-it-all. Not on purpose. I finally told her what I thought. I said, ""I've noticed that people who go to college act superior compared to everyone else, especially those who study any type of science, art, or philosophy shit. I'm a high school dropout, I've never been to college and I hate it. I wish I could go back to school. Literally, be in a high school with my own age group but it's all a normal high school. 

Anyway, we talked last night for almost 2 hours, RIGHT after I watched the new Matrix (6/10) and JUST got CyberPunk 2077 for Xmas from my mom. She goes on about how I ask her almost weekly when she's coming home. She is so frustrated at this. I turn off my emotions and deal with her easily. She drained me so much that I stopped feeling anything. 

\*I blame a lot of this on the fact that I've become a misanthrope over the last few years, I don't hate her. 

I asked her again because I legit didn't understand her reasoning behind why she likes me so fucking much. Compared to her, I'm an idiot. She finally told me:  


""I really do love you that's why I'm working for it; I don't care about what your life is like,i love you regardless. I love talking to you because your the first guy who didn't give a fuck what i looked like,you did actually message me,and you were straight about what you wanted and you play videogames and you're not like everyone else and you are funny and you like me actually."" 

...And she's right. I don't. I don't care what she initially looked like, but let's be real people, that's full of shit. We all care to some degree what someone looks like, are you going to date Jabba The Hut? No, you're not. We've all seen people that look like that on dating apps and girls say, ""I'm just looking for a nice man who likes me for who I am! The only person who can judge me is god!"" OK there Jabba.

&amp;#x200B;

Is she a fantastic girl? Yes. Have we played a lot of games together? Yes. Well, to be fair, it's mostly just Animal Crossing, she got Fortnite on her switch to play with me. I've gotten to this point that I really don't care anymore. It's not that I don't like her, it's just this attitude she has. She doesn't hear it. I got to talk to her friends here in GA, that was a good confirmation to know if she was REALLY from GA. One of her friends attacked me almost ASAP calling me names and saying I'm not like her brother which they all knew him but he died and he was the only one for her and she wouldn't shut the fuck up about him. \[Her\] and I both asked her to stop, but she went on and on and on...

&amp;#x200B;

I finally admitted 1 thing I never thought I'd say to her, ""I'm talking to you because I'm desperate at this point""

""Nothing I say matters?""

""Well, originally it was like that, but then we got to know each other and I do care about you. I'm happy to know you. I would love to make this fully 100% work but you're in another country, you keep saying you're going to be back but... you get the point""

She tells me all the time that she can't wait to see me. I asked her why, if anything about this shit with the government she has to stay there and do this damn paperwork? She never gave me a real answer. I don't get it. Let the Swiss government deal with her dead ass. I would. She explains to me that none of her bio siblings will deal with it so she has to. She says she got nothing from her and I asked, ""OK so then why can't you just let them do it? Who cares...""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I feel nothing but ""Why"" in my head. She takes forever yo answer me, even if she is a 6h difference between us but she could message me whenever. My phone is next to me all the time. I message her throughout the day and I don't hear anything for almost 6+ hours as well. When I have called her, she sounds annoyed or tired.
