0,mf5tx8,1616953586,What should I do with her?,"Hi ! So I will explain this "" difficoult "" situation I'm facing , but I assume I should have been ghosted ! 
So I ve known this girl a month ago on Facebook , she is a co-worker of my father in Germany, but she is from Poland and I'm Italian ( the next week I have the travel to Germany due family affair , and have to work there too ) .
She is in Germany since the last August and talked with my father a lot and with her girlfriends too ( she is from Poland too and I know her , we are all in good relationship ) 
When she did know my father has a son ( me üòÖ ) she started wanting to chat with me , my father talked to me about her , but the final point was before March when she asked if I can speak at least English cause it could be the only language which with we may speak ! 
I take the first move writing her on FB , and the first day of chatting was really good ! I know where she works and recognize she has a lot to do cause of it , we were sharing our hobbies and futures projects and it was like we were in sintony ! She started speaking Italian too giving me the "" goodnight "" üòÖ , so all what I was thinking is that she was interested to know me and to see me when I will be arrived in Germany , a little particoular about , she wanted I teach her German too ! Cause she wants but had no time .
A few days later she never reply more except rarely on weekend and I started writing ( using Google translate ) in her mother language so she can have all the comfort chatting with me ! 
Anyway I started teaching a little bit of German to her advicing her some courses  but it's was like she wasn't really interested . 
A week ago I posted on FB a story , a selfie of mine in which I was well dressed in my own style ( I don't know how to explain it , but it was like a causal mixed dandy style with my rings that I loved , and maybe she for the first time notice I have long hair ) 
Anyway she reply directly to me with this emoji ""üòç"" , and I reply simply with another one . 
The following  weekend I have written to her , and she didn't even see the message , she did a few days later but didn't reply at all , and neither watch my stories anymore .
Another fact , once she off the cuff reply to me sending a photo of herself , when she was going out with her friends , she wear make up and she was smiling , and I really like this photo so I said to her to change the profile picture with the one she sended to me ! She did some days later and a lot of people appreciated it ‚ò∫Ô∏è , someone asked what was changed cause there are a lot of difference with the photos she already had and the one she sended to me , cause in the last one she simply make see all her beauty ! 

We chatted not a lot , but enough to understand that maybe we can help each other and perhaps starting something together , I had this thinking expecially causs once she said to me that she didn't feel good in Germany , and another person who support her can be better , and since there I started making her notice that I care of her feelings ! 

Anyway it seems like I've being ghosted , or just she has a lot do work , and have no time ( so as she said ) , I'm not really the kind of person who want to our pressure to another one especially into a relationship of friendship , and I said her too ! 
May happen that when I will be in Germany she wants to see me and know me better cause we can finally meet me phisically ! So I don't know meanwhile how to act !

If I get asked a question I try to answer the best possible to make it interesting and inject a lil humor if I can.  I figured the more interesting or funny what I say, the better chance the girl would respond favorably by either nodding (eg cool, I agree) or reacting (LOL) or sharing her own perspective on the matter.  Does it always have to end with a question to turn the table back to her or is that implicit? Moreover does it show neediness to ask the question back?

I am going to share some examples.

&gt;Chick: Hey :) what was the highlight of your day?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Other than its Friday!! Most dorkiest thing I'm fond of beagles and spotted two on the community path

I hate that question because its so broad.  I tried to be honest and make it about me.  She happens to be a dog owner so I thought she be curious to ask why because its such a weird thing.  Should I have asked the same question back or not hoped some organic conversation would result out of this?

Here is another example:

&gt;Chick: How do you take your coffee? And where is that spot on the cliff?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I like my coffee black and prefer darker roasts.  that picture was taken somewhere in WV

for starters it shows she took the time to read my profile.  She saw that I love coffee and inquired about one of the pics I posted.  I just answered.

So basically I never heard back from any of the girls and its going to force me to double text to keep the conversation going.  Is there a way to salvage this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf6kw2/not_getting_the_momentum_i_need_in_the/

So, after a couple of days when I was sure about going out with someone, I texted that guy. He asked to take me out for dinner. We did. It was his birthday celebration at his place at 12, so he had to leave. He asked me if i want to join. I didn't want to lose the chance as i was really tempted to sleep with him. We had great time together, great sex. I left next morning. And we decided to meet again. We fuck each other's brains out again. He wanted to lend me one of his books before I left. He wanted to see me again. We have similar interests. But last time (2nd date) when i left, i texted him ""It's not everyday that time spent with someone feels too less to me. :')"" To which I got no reply at all.

Next day I asked him if i went overboard with that text, to which he said ""Well, it was unexpected."" ""I had a great time as well, no doubt about that."" ""But maybe it was tad bit overboard"" Guys, I really can't think straight. Do i come off as someone obsessed? Or does it sound like he strictly only wants hookup.

I was always deployed or moving, so I never had the opportunity or desire to get in to a serious relationship. Since then, I have spent a lot of time figuring out who I am as an adult, and who I am looking for in a future partner. 

I starting using some of the apps out there. I have my age set for 25-40F. If I may humbly say I am pretty successful in getting matches. For context, I am 6‚Äô5‚Äù, fit, financially stable, an airline pilot, level headed, and I like to do pretty dope stuff in general. My mom tells me I am handsome. After attempting dating for a little while I find that the women younger than me are immature, have significant debt, and lack life experience. The women older than me have some form of baggage (I don‚Äôt hate kids or anything). I feel like they are trying to escape and using me as their ride. 

Again, I am very aware of who I am and what I am looking for. I don‚Äôt want to rush to failure. 

Should I lower my standards? Is there a way I can narrow my search? Am I just being a selfish ass who is not willing to invest in someone else? Something else?

I‚Äôm in my late 20s and him mid 30s. We both expressed how we were looking for a relationship. I also expressed that I‚Äôm ok with friendship that can lead into a relationship because it could be a bit more natural. Yesterday the conversation started well but I noticed that he tends to bring up sexual topics which I normally wouldn‚Äôt mind but not right off the bat or in our first conversation.

I did the same and he told me that an ex called him and tried to come over last night around 3am. Now I am a chill person but I‚Äôm not an idiot. This is the beginning stages of talking and tbh he can do whatever he wants and vice versa. But I don‚Äôt get why he brought that up. It seemed like he wanted to get a reaction out of me and I explained that. 

Now this is where things gave me bad flashbacks of my ex. He kept saying how I was assuming things and how he thought I was chill and easy going. I told him who in their right mind tells someone they‚Äôre trying to pursue that exes are still in contact with you and are trying to come over? My ex used to tell me how girls would be I to them or how they liked them just to get a reaction out of me. He also used to check women out and compliment them in inappropriate ways.

I‚Äôm currently with my boyfriend. High school sweethearts of 6 years. 


I don‚Äôt even wanna write the story because i feel workless. 

2015: graduated and moved in together 

2016: we‚Äôve been living together and got a cat! I worked at a daycare as an assistant teacher. I had a friend a best friend name y* , she has a 1year old daughter and would frequently visit our apartment. Her lease ended and I told her she can live with us for a month just so she can find a new place and mean while I would baby sit her daughter while she works. It all worked out well.... 
until... one day a mutual friend told me y* has been sleeping with my boyfriend while I was at work....
This tore me apart. 

* we broke up and got back together 

2019: We welcomed a beautiful healthy baby girl.ü§ç ( he refused to sign the certificate because he didn‚Äôt think he was the father- he said he would get a paternity test to confirm and here we are 2 years later. Lol no paternity test. Just like I knew he would.)

2020: were living in a pandemic. We‚Äôre struggling together as a family. I got a phone call from a random #, I answered. It was my boyfriends co worker husband calling me... to inform me my boyfriend has been sleeping with his wife... not only in his car but the first time he brought her to MY apartment and slept with her on MY bed where my daughter bed is and allllll of her toys. 

* we had a hard time moving through it but, I officially have. Of course I get sad from time to time because it‚Äôs another trauma I deal with. But, imagaine being a 1 at time mom and your child not even 1 1/2 and you find out your man, her dad has been cheating on the family.... it hurts to deep. 

2021: I know he doesn‚Äôt love me. 
We went to a bar last night and I was dancing with some girls and enjoying the night. When we got home , drunk, he asked me ‚Äú why can‚Äôt I don‚Äôt with females ?‚Äù And that made me want to just die inside. At that moment, I feel like my heart skipped..... what a red flag... another one.... I broke up with him last night not officially but I was VERY DRUNK. he‚Äôs going to take everything I said last night literally which is fine but, I just hate my life. 

A couple weeks ago he told me he‚Äôs NVER cried over me or about me when he was drunk. In over 6 years. That doesn‚Äôt make me feel secure , safe and loved as I should .... I don‚Äôt know why he told me that. 

* anyways point here is: 
When do you know enough is enough? I know he‚Äôs a dog. I‚Äôll never trust him again, he knew how important being a mom is to me. And how important family is. What should I do? * just a reminder 6 years and a baby later and he still doesn‚Äôt wanna propose.

My attempts to mitigate it are things like asking them seriously to stop (which they often find funny and infantilise my annoyance) or trying to come across as more crass and masculine than I am.

I was bullied a lot growing up, and online in more recent times (flooded with comments about how ‚Äúf*cking ugly‚Äù I am). 

I acknowledge (in pretty much any aspect, maybe, not just about sex and relationships) that my view of the world is likely seen through a very corrupted and damaged lens.

I see all these, 30 and 40, even 50 and 60 (you get the point) year old virgins online, and due to my existing history, I feel I‚Äôm at high risk of joining them.

I‚Äôve been told to focus on career/money. I‚Äôve been told to NOT make money too big of a focus. I‚Äôve been told to focus on myself. I‚Äôve been told to interact with others. I‚Äôve been told that a partner can‚Äôt save your life or give you meaning/purpose. I‚Äôve been told that they CAN save your life and give you meaning/purpose.

OK. Let‚Äôs say I really went into overdrive and got qualified for top jobs, like engineering, programming, etc...

If I became successful enough, I could actually AFFORD this technology. So that could be a reason to focus on money, right? Better than being lonely AND poor, right? 

Life doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.

I‚Äôve struggled with social difficulties my entire life.

While having a hyperrealistic companion could provide not only sexual but emotional needs, I‚Äôm not sure any AI can ever be a proper substitute for real human companions. 

It could be both comforting AND depressing, accepting that you couldn‚Äôt get a match with any real life partners (of your preferred sex/gender).

All these girls were saying that they want to find a husband who makes $300k/year, and I mentioned to them that honestly even just $100k/year would be incredible. I was the only guy of course, so I know how hard and few jobs are available to make 100k begin with.

One thing they said is that making $300k/year is what they expect, but is this is me, or do girls have this unrealistic expectation of how much people/men actually make? When I mentioned that getting a job that pays $100k is really incredible already, they come back and say that's not enough. What's ironic is that none of them are financially independent (they're around 25-30 years old) and they are all in the fine arts as well.

I don't know if girls don't realize how many people actually make more than $150k, because that's boiling it down to less than 5% of the population. They aren't exactly offering much either? Even if they did make that money, they probably would be much older, maybe mid 40's to 50's and having a leadership position.

My question is, is this a common thought that girls expect guys to make over $100k/year under the age of 30, and won't take you seriously if you make less than that?

43,mf96ge,1616963227,Venting a little bit over last relationship,"I'm a gay man (29y) and I met a guy on tinder (28y).
We went out on 4 dates last year, on a town a little far from mine (2h distance).

I wasn't yet in love but I was starting to like him and after the forth one, I asked via text if he could see something serious happenning and he said he needed to be honest: that he liked me but was not in love. I said I wasn't in love either but I wanted to know if a serious relationship was something that could flourish with time. He said I was going to fast.

I basically said for us to just let it go and stop talking then but he kept messaging me and eventually I gave in and decided we could be friends of benefits.

At that point I was really up for it only for sex and he wanted to hook up om November but I wasn't feeling and we ended up hooking up one and a half month ago.

After the hook up he still wanted to hangout but I wanted to go home, I noticed I didn't really want his company and didn't have feelings anymore but let it open for possible casual sex in the future.
Two weeks later he wanted to meet again but I said I couldn't. Some days later he texted me saying he wanted me to be with him, to hug and that he was scared of the pandemic. I felt a twinge of romantic desire at that but kept it at bay 'cause I knew it was just something momentaneous.

Last week on Instagram I noticed signs that he was seeing someone else. Today I asked him and he said he was in a serious relationship with that other guy. I'm not sure but it made me anxious, then angry (at that moment I unfollowed him and texted ""I'm unfollowing you cause since we're not gonna have sex anymore, we don't need to keep in touch"") and now a little sad.

I apologized for being rude but confronted him about what he said to me last year and how it was funny now that he apparently started a serious relationship with someone so fast. I said it made me feel undervalued and that was the issue and he said he understands, that I am valued and that things just naturally happened with the other guy.

I believe it but it still hurts because I've never had a serious boyfriend (possibly because I live in a very small town with almost no lgbtq people) and it feels that when I get in the position of a potential relationship, the other part never wants to get serious with me, uses the same ""not ready for a relationship"" excuse and then gets in a serious relationship with another guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mf96ge/venting_a_little_bit_over_last_relationship/

I'm a 28M who is working full-time in a highly professional job.

Unfortunately, I have not had any proper romantic relationships in my life.

I've been fortunate enough to go out on countless dates but the longest ""relationship"" lasted a few weeks at most. This was mostly due to me being late to the dating scene and being severely insecure about my looks.

I usually get asked about my previous relationships on dates.

Examples are:

\- when was your last serious long term relationship?

\- why didn't work out for you during your previous relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I should lie and make up a story or if I should just be honest. However, telling them that I was very insecure about my looks and thought nobody would love me just makes me sound like a loser.

Also just saying I don't want to talk about previous relationships makes me sound cold and bitter.

I've ""dated"" two guys in that time where we spent a lot of time together and had sex (which is monumental for me given how terrified I was of it at first), one only lasted for a few weeks, the last guy a few months. 

The last guy I dated we spent a lot of time together, whether it be watching movies, going on walks, getting coffee, etc. talked all the time also. He's a very busy guy, but he'd still try to make time to see me, and even if he couldn't for a while, I understood and we would just talk when we could.

We had a talk where I asked if he still wanted to spend time with me because I was unsure if he did and didn't want to be a burden. He told me I'm the person he wants to spend most of his time with, but he's been in a weird mental space where he feels like he has to constantly work on his projects for work/school/hobbies to be successful, and he knows he needs to relax and that he's sorry and will try to balance things, because he wants to still spend time with me. 

I could sense he was getting a little stressed a little bit before he ghosted me, he suddenly had a bigger workload he didn't expect. Texts became a little more sporadic and the last times we were together he seemed tired and somewhere else. Since I could sense that, I dialed it back to where he could tell me when he was free. I did offer to bring him food if he wanted just to say hi. 

Then he completely disappeared, no warning. I asked if he was okay, nothing. Then later I said he could be honest with me, if he couldn't do this anymore to let me know, I'm an adult and could handle it. Nothing. I know he's alive and well. I haven't said anything, maybe because of pride because I don't want him to know how much this affected me.

I just don't understand. He seemed to like me and everyone said this was so unexpected. I thought he'd be more mature than completely ghosting me, especially after months. It completely fucks with my self esteem because the few guys I've really liked and dated, they seem to be emotionally detached sometimes (and they admit that) and blindside me. And I don't ever get even a tiny answer so I don't know what I have done. I noticed he had changed his bumble bio (not sure if that was when he was with me, and we both said we weren't seeing anyone else at least in person), I know he's also used it for friends that are into his hobby (I've seen them, he wasn't secretive about it and showed me), but I mean....look how it ended up with us--I wasn't just a friend.

I don't get how someone can say they care about you and then do this. I don't know how to stop feeling worthless, and how to stop second guessing everything a guy does now because of all this. I have a hard time getting close to people and when I do it never progresses. I go through phases where I say it's nothing to do with me, to oh my god what's wrong with me.

53,mfah6y,1616967110,Someone please tell me that I'm not going to be alone and single forever.,"When I was 15, one of my parents joked about how my friend and I ""are definitely gonna be kissing girls a year from now"". On October 26, 2015, my mom bet me $100 that I'd have a girlfriend a year later.

Guess what? I'm now 26, have had only a few minor sexual foreplay interactions with women. Never had a girlfriend, never had actual sex.

Before someone tells me to ""wOrK oN yOuRseLf"", let me explain a few things. Although I don't make a lot of money or have a prestigious job, I am very confident about my looks, told I have ""no bad features"", am 6'2"", and have long, blond curly hair that many people, including women, always compliment. I have no criminal history, kids, or debt. I am athletic, no body fat, am a half-marathoner and have competed in several events. I play guitar and bass, and am attempting to build a YouTube channel where I make metal renditions of popular songs. I am a car enthusiast, I enjoy driving my manual Corolla and am saving up for one of those sporty V6 Honda Accord coupes. Every time I've heard people talk about me when they think I'm not listening, they always mention how kind of a person I am. (YES, I UNDERSTAND that I have to be more than just ""nice"". I'm just trying to be clear that I don't have a horrible personality.) My other interests would include meditation, drawing, and books/audiobooks.

I'm not trying to brag here, but I'm just trying to establish that I'm well-rounded.

I'm talking to this one woman that I've made out with/fooled around with before, but she's wishy-washy about meeting up and seems more interested in being fuckbuddies - she doesn't think we have enough in common to be bf/gf, unfortunately. I also signed up for a dating app called WooPlus (I'm into bigger women), and I've only had very minor successes so far.

I've actually had 1-2 dozen dates and six (!) opportunities in the past to have sex with women. 2 were the women I met up with, I was just in too bad of a headspace to go all the way. 2 I declined because of safety during the early months of COVID. One was a drop-dead GORGEOUS coworker I dated, who sent me mixed signals that I didn't pick up on. And another was a woman who'd cheated on my best friend, so obviously as no-go.

Maybe I was stupid for declining all of those people. I think the first four I listed were just excuses in my head. I'm too afraid to have sex. The woman I'm talking to asked me to meet up a week ago and it caused me to have a panic attack. I'm much better prepared against that happening now, and hopefully we can go on a date soon, but I'm a serial ghoster and she's a serial bailer.

**I've attempted to keep my head up, and it actually worked for quite a while. My mental health skyrocketed up once I quit school last October. I've tried looking to the positive and being hopeful.** But when my life is just the same drivel over and over again, working, grocery shopping, playing guitar, and occasionally seeing my friends, it becomes difficult to imagine that I'll ever find a stable woman whom I can move in with and build a life with.

When I was 16, I was afraid of being alone for my whole life forever, and I asked a question about it on Yahoo! Answers. People responded to me by trying to reassure me that I'm still super young, and that I still have time. Ten years later - two weeks ago, I was hanging out with some platonic friends \[25F\]\[50F\] at a bar. I told them about my struggles. They said the same thing. ""You're still young, you've got plenty of time"".

Are people going to say the same thing when I'm still single at 36? 56? 70? 80? That 80-year-old me is ""sTiLL yOuNg aNd STiLL hAs TiMe""?

If I could have some prophet or fortune-teller tell me that it would ***eventually*** happen, that would actually be quite a huge relief for me. But the only people who tell me that ""you'll find love eventually"" are random people whom I've never met.

61,mfawz5,1616968411,Was it too much to buy her some gifts for her birthday?,"So long story short have been seeing this girl for 2-3 months, we usually spend a whole day together once a week and have been on like 7+ dates. I‚Äôve met her roommates, she introduced me to all her hometown friends, and surprisingly she even kissed me goodbye in front of her friends which we haven‚Äôt done before. We already had sex only once so far since it‚Äôs kind of hard to find the right time bc she has roommates.

We also planned or like have talked about a road trip like 2-3 months from now so that sort of let me know she was serious. She‚Äôs met my dad and that‚Äôs about it from my end, but I don‚Äôt really intertwine my romantic relationships and social ones.

Anyways, i bought her a stuffed animal and some cozy slippers for her birthday, and in total only spent about 35 bucks. I just feel afraid of buying gifts bc it‚Äôs sort of like a vulnerable gesture, and she told me she was having a birthday party and I‚Äôm not sure if it was just with her friends or with a whole bunch of people, and I wasn‚Äôt invited.

It sort of feel like even things are going well it‚Äôs like I want to be at the point where we‚Äôre spending things like that together. And we‚Äôve been taking things somewhat slow in the sense that our conversations are starting to get more open and serious, but like it just feels like I‚Äôm just a small part of her life and meanwhile she is a good chunk of my life.

So now I‚Äôm like are the gifts too much too soon, I mean she‚Äôs had my dick in her mouth but like romantic gestures like gift giving are pretty sacred to me, so i just feel uneasy about it but I feel like it‚Äôs the right thing to do. She made time earlier in the weekend to hangout bc her birthday was this weekend and she was going to have 6 friends staying over at her house.

63,mfb5jh,1616969118,"If you suck at dating, i‚Äôll suggest you to get a handle of these things first...","
For some, these things will be very obvious. But i keep seeing the same post again and again... AND AGAIN about guys saying they have no experience and they don‚Äôt know why. Or they have no matches on tinder. Getting ghosted/rejected and feeling sad about it.

Listen here, you gotta work on yourself. I‚Äôll list the most normal ‚Äòflaws‚Äô these guys have:

- *apperance*: so those who post pictures of themself, asking why They don‚Äôt have dates, either look like heroin addict or haven‚Äôt spend a second outside mommas basement the last 20 years. 

What i will suggest is get in shape. Start in the gym, and get more outside. Also, most guys have the ugliest beards and imo, only a very few people i‚Äôve seen in my life, it looked good. Mostly guys with Black, very Well trimmed facial hair. Get a better taste of cloth, stop wearing those basketball shirts and shorts down to under the knees (yes, americans). 

- *Hobbies*: Something that will also help get outside that basement, is getting hobbies. I‚Äôm talking about joining a book club, sports or whatever. It doesn‚Äôt need to be social, but it have sure helped me a lot with getting many more friends, that i else wouldn‚Äôt have had. And it‚Äôs a great escape from everything.

- *social life*: having good, loyal friends is smart in many ways. If you‚Äôre fucked, they can help you out. They‚Äôll cheer you up when you‚Äôre feeling the lowest low. They‚Äôre there for you. And also if you‚Äôre bored, you can hit up the lads and have fun doing whatever.

- *financial*: whatever Education you got, you gotta be financially inderpendent. Be able to afford stuff. Some nice cloth, nice apartment, good looking car and that stuff. I‚Äôm not talking about flexing, just... have you shit together. 

- *confidence*: this is absolutely key! This is the only thing you need to have to date honestly. But ofc try have the other things too and you‚Äôll see the girls get better looking as Well lol. Confidence also mean say what you want, think out loud and joke around, do whst you feel like. Fuck about how you look and how tall you‚Äôre and what ever. If i wasn‚Äôt confident in myself, i would be where i am today that‚Äôs for sure. You gotta love yourself. If you look in the mirror, you shouldn‚Äôt think ‚Äúgod i‚Äôm ugly‚Äù but instead ‚Äúsheesh i‚Äôm a snack‚Äù. That‚Äôs how you get girls guys.

- *happy by yourself*: i wouldn‚Äôt mind the idea of being single from now on, and the rest of my life. Wait what that‚Äôs sad af? No it‚Äôs not. Cause i love being myself as Well. Being single is fun and i can do whatever i want. But dating is fun, relationships is wonderful as well. But if you can be happy without all that and be a complete person, that‚Äôs exactly when you‚Äôre ready for this dating bs. 

I think, that‚Äôs it? Stop posting those depressed af posts. Read this first. Can you do a ‚Äò‚úÖ‚Äô from all those criterias? Well if so, you‚Äôre ready boi. If not, that‚Äôs first thing first. English is obviously not my first language, so excuse the gramma mistakes.

I started seeing I was insecure or not as confident in the way I desired to be with someone. I think it is healthy to want to desire to be in relationship. However, I noticed myself always looking for opportunities to make this happen. I started questioning whether my social media was cool enough or not (I live in Orange County). I‚Äôve never cared about this stuff before but I all the sudden got to a place where I almost cared more about wanting to be in a relationship than just wanting to by myself and waiting for someone to come along who likes more for this. Keep your head up everyone. Don‚Äôt forget to stay true to yourself. If you feel pressure to change who you are in order for a person to like you then they aren‚Äôt for you!

So basically, we've been communicating for \~6 months at this point and we've grown decently close. Over the course of the months, we've gone out a few times and each has been a blast. The most recent date was our closest yet that featured some hitting of bases 1+2 and some glossing around 3/home...steamy lol. It was a natural progression and she seemed to be having a fun and was telling me so...things could have gone further if the cops didn't knock on my car's window XD Anyways, so after that more passionate night we were talking about meeting up again and it was going fine...until she straight up started ghosting me. Basically, she's said multiple times that she wants to go out again with me but for the past 2 weeks has just not responded to most of my texts...she responded to only one of them regarding what day we wanted to meet up with ""hey can we go out today. If not, next week?"" at like 3am. Obviously I couldn't change my schedule so fast and asked what day next week. But I never got a response and still haven't despite sending follow ups for the past week...it seems like it could be a ghost again but it's tough to know for sure given this isn't the first time both of us have ghosted each other...but that's a long story.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is that a decision was never made by either of us to end things. I could assume her not responding means that she's finished but it's hard to know for sure (Especially given our history) and I hate assuming these things. It's tough since she was my pandemic situationship and we were close, and still remain on positive terms (Apparently?) so I feel a simple goodbye would be in order considering how long we've known each other...and as I've gotten some news that I'm leaving my city in a week for a job in a month, I need to tie up my loose ends. So I'd like to send her a text ending things as I really hate unresolved ends...but I don't know what to say given how confusing her behavior has been. Like I wouldn't be opposed to meeting up again for a farewell dinner or something but I also don't want to assume she even still cares 2 cents about me anymore...it's just a weird situation and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice.

I picked up on these cues from her end as well, and we spent weeks flirting, excitedly discussing our date, etc. Leading up to the date, she would frequently text me out of the blue how eager she was to see me and spend time together. To put it lightly, I was delighted myself and I wanted the date to come with each passing day. Even as a friend, she makes me happy in a way not many people have. It's a good feeling.

The date itself went well I thought. But as we left, something felt weird and I couldn't shake it. I later asked if she'd be interested in seeing each other again, and she let me down easy. Basically, there wasn't the romantic connection I suppose she was expecting.

She's sincerely kind, and has let me know she does want to sustain the friendship‚Äîbut man, it really, really stings. Even with my past long-term relationships, I always feel like I settled when it comes to dating. This was the one time I *wasn't* settling. I genuinely felt excited, attracted, and happy when talking with her in a way I've legitimately never experienced before.

73,mfbp6c,1616970774,Want to tell coworker how I feel,"I was dating for someone for two years with two break ups throughout. It was a good, solid relationship, we just didn‚Äôt have the chemistry or shared vision for the future to make it a ‚Äúforever‚Äù thing, despite our efforts. We broke up beginning of 2021.

However, around September 2020, I started having a crush on a new coworker. We flirted at work but we never took it further than that. Never exchanged numbers, never hung out outside of work, never talked about being together, and he knew I was in a relationship. I felt bad about flirting and having a crush, but the attraction was strong enough that I saw it as the beginning of the inevitable end of my relationship. There were plenty of other reasons we broke up, but the crush just reminded me what I‚Äôd be missing out on if I kept dragging it out. 

So finally around the beginning of 2021, my boyfriend and I mutually decided to end things. The flirting with my coworker had faded as I think he rightfully wasn‚Äôt into the idea of entertaining me until I was finally single. He‚Äôs now been sleeping with someone for a few months and has made it clear it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot serious‚Äù, ‚Äúnot official‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt see a future with her or is even that into her. 

I want to tell my coworker I have strong feelings for him. It‚Äôs been months of feeling this way and it‚Äôs effecting how I approach things. I can‚Äôt really enjoy the thought of putting myself out there, because I see dating other people as a distraction of what could be with my coworker. I have only felt this way about a very few select people throughout my life and I think I would regret it so much more if I never said anything than if I told him and got rejected.

My problem is 1) I don‚Äôt want to home wreck, make him feel pressured to give me a response, or put him in any weird guilt/conflict with his current FWB. Even if it is causal according to him, I still worry I would be disrespecting whatever they‚Äôve got going on by telling him how I feel. And 2) I feel I‚Äôve already put myself in a bad light by flirting with him while I was in an unfulfilling relationship. Not that this is a huge obstacle for me, because if it is a deal breaker, it‚Äôs a very justifiable one that I got myself into.

I'm used to being hit on a lot and approached by men who are very verbal about their attraction, making moves, etc. Now I am faced with a situation where I may have to make a move and I have no clue how to go about it - or if I even should!





There is a man who drives one of the buses in my city (40'sM) who I want to ask out. Based on his appearance, I see that we have some unique common interests. For the last couple of years, I'd only see him once every 4 months. When I did see him, I could only seem to say hello in his language (nervous). I noticed he'd deliberately stare at me when he drove past and turn to look at me and keep looking until he couldn't see me anymore. I don't see other drivers do this so it was quite memorable to me.





Due to Covid, everyone boards at the back of the bus. Now I don't have an opportunity like I did years ago to try and talk to him more. So I started to thank him or wish him a good day whenever I got off his bus. Some days, he is not driving the buses I take but will drive past me on another route. Whenever that happens, the bus seems to slow down and I get the full on head turn long stares I mentioned earlier.






When I get off the bus, I have to wait for it to pass before I can cross the street. I noticed the same thing - how he'd look at me and hold that until we were no longer in each other's view. The last few times he would smile/smirk and nod his head down while keep eye contact. I smiled back and probably gave some flirty gazes (I don't have a good poker face).





Yesterday when we locked eyes again, I decided to be a bit more brave and wave.. I got the usual smile, smirk and nod with a wave back. I grinned the entire walk home.. haven't felt so giddy in over a decade.





Am I reading too much into things or is he giving signals that he may be interested or wants to be approached in some way?

79,mfbzms,1616971697,How does every woman expect to date a 6'+ handsome white guy (when that's like 10-15% of the population) unless they intend to share or take turns?,"Only 15% of men are even 6'. Depending on how multicultural your city is the percent of white men is probably 50-90%. Then according to OK Cupid, women consider eighty percent of men ""below average.""

So at most tall handsome white guys are 10-15% of the population. In some places 5-10%. 

Do women not realize this?

Can't you do the math?

If the majority of women will only consistently swipe right or want to date 5-15% of the male population, how is this going to work out?

The answer is obvious:

* Most guys get nothing - not even a date.
* A small minority of guys get hundreds to thousands of women lining up to date them.
* Those guys start to feel like gods and can treat women like dirt or use them as disposable sex toys.
* Women then complain ""no guy treats them right"" and ""men are all pigs"" and then drop out of the dating market altogether.

Is there any way this scenario could work out differently? How can the majority of women all share 5-15% of men while making them happy? Would formalized harems and polygamy work?

85,mfcbey,1616972747,Is 100% honesty always a good idea?,"When my girlfriend and I started dating it was magical, like we both felt something that neither of us had ever felt before. We knew it was special and it just moved quickly. We opened up our hearts to each other, shared our inner most fantasies, faults, desires, and just really trusted each other. It was about two months in that we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, and decided on exclusivity

We had talked about how as soon as our first date was over, we both knew that we had no desire for anyone else.  She knew that I had plans to fly to go spend the weekend with another girl that I canceled because I just ‚Äúknew‚Äù and she told me she felt the same way.  Skip ahead six months‚Ä¶

We are madly in love. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about the relationship. We are having one of our heart to heart conversations, pouring out our inner most feelings, and that‚Äôs when she decides to drop a bomb on me. I brought up again how awesome it was that even though we hadn‚Äôt officially agreed on exclusivity, it just organically happened because of what we both felt. I could see her feeling uncomfortable, and I asked her what she was thinking. She told me that she needed to come clean about some thing. The week after our first date she flew to another city to spend the weekend with a guy and had sex with him. He had bought her plane ticket and she felt obligated to go.   She said that after that trip it only reinforced the idea that she didn‚Äôt want to be with anyone else, that it didn‚Äôt feel right, and she regretted it.   

Technically we were not exclusive. I told her she was wrong to purposely deceive me into believing this fairytale that I had been so proud of, and celebrated so openly. At the same time, we were not exclusive and her trip wasn‚Äôt technically ‚ÄúWrong.‚Äù  At first she tried to tell me that she didn‚Äôt technically deceive me. She told me that after our first date she had no desire to be with anyone else, and she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdesire‚Äú to sleep with this guy, but she felt committed and obligated to. I told her that she was ‚Äúreaching‚Äú at best‚Ä¶ She left that out because she didn‚Äôt want me to know because she knew it would hurt my feelings.  But then she felt guilty and needed to come clean.

I told her that I was upset that she obviously lied to me, but I was also upset that she felt the need to come clean about that six months later and shatter my happy little bubble, just so she could relieve her conscience. I‚Äôve calmed down and I can appreciate the fact at at the end of the day she defaulted to open honesty, but I have some questions.   Should she have kept that to herself? Because she didn‚Äôt technically cheat on me, was it necessary for her to tell me that?  Was it selfish for her to say something hurtful like that just to relieve her guilty conscience? Or should I be grateful that at the end of the day she was honest?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfcbey/is_100_honesty_always_a_good_idea/

87,mfcd54,1616972911,Anxious girl asking the age-old question ‚Äî what does the text mean/how should I respond?,"I‚Äôve (25F) been texting someone (25M) for \~6 weeks (both expressed interest in a date early on, but wanted to be vaccinated first). We video chatted a couple of times throughout that, and maintained light/casual daily text comms.

We finally we went on a date on Friday! He travelled pretty far (2+ hrs) to meet me. We had drinks and a bite, then went back to my place and‚Ä¶had finally some fumbly fun. I think he was nervous! We weren‚Äôt able to have PIV sex, but we didn‚Äôt make a big deal of it and had fun in other ways. He had work the next morning, and didn‚Äôt stay the night.

He texted me later that night night with an article about something we‚Äôd talked about on the date, and he‚Äôd also checked in once on Saturday.

At this point, neither of us had talked about how the date went/brought up a second date. I didn‚Äôt want to continue texting forever in limbo, so this afternoon I finally said ‚ÄúFriday was fun, we should do that again.‚Äù

He took a bit longer than usual to respond, but finally just said ‚ÄúI do agree, I‚Äôm glad you had fun‚Äù 

And now I‚Äôm just kind of like‚Ä¶that was vague‚Ä¶does the ‚ÄúI do agree‚Äù refer to the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part, or the ‚Äúwe should do that again‚Äù part? I mean, if he DIDN‚ÄôT want to do that again, he would have said so (or ghosted me lol), right?

I‚Äôm feeling a bit self-conscious and definitely am overthinking this, but how would you respond to this vague text that the date was fun?

Also worth noting - I‚Äôm not looking to immediately schedule our next date - it‚Äôs a long commute, and he only has one day off/week - I‚Äôd just like to know that we‚Äôll‚Ä¶try again sometime in the not-terribly-far future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfcd54/anxious_girl_asking_the_ageold_question_what_does/

I hate dating. I hate wondering if I'm wasting my time. He's still planning stuff with me after I've said I have feelings and want more. So I guess I'm confused.

91,mfcmm0,1616973783,First date,"I went on a coffee date with a woman I had met on tinder yesterday.  We talked for a few days initially when we met then she gave me her number and we started texting to plan a meet up.  We had to reschedule a couple times due to the nature of her work and family obligations.  But she finally set the date and we met up.  We're both 33.

I'm not entirely sure if it went good or bad as it seems it definitely didn't go bad but she wasn't super easy to read and some of her questions were very personal.   We met up for coffee for an hour.  I paid for her coffee and we set outside and talked pretty much the whole time.

Some of the positives I noticed:

We were engaged almost the entire time no long awkward silence. She seemed like she was ok being her self through the whole conversation.

She was constantly playing with her hair when she was talking to me.

She would put her hands on the table and kind of play with her jewelry and point toward me.

She had good eye contact most of the time.  She'd kind of glance in other directions at times but there were distractions happening.

Negative:

She put her phone on the table when she sat down.  Responded to a few texts.  Apologized about it though because she said she was going on a trip with her friend this week and they needed to sort some things out.  She wasn't staring at her phone while we were talking or anything.  Given her profession I think having her phone out was necessary so she wasn't trying to be rude.

Other notes:

She asked how long I had been on online dating.  Told me she previously dated 2 guys from hinge.  1 moved the other she became friends with.  Essentially said I was the only person on tinder she really had an interest in and said she did not like the site.  Asked me about ex girlfriends and about having kids. Asked if my friends had been married or had kids now saying she was the last of her friends not married with no kids. 

 Then told me she was looking for someone who is a professional with a college degree which is exactly me and was told it was hard to find around here.  I walked her to her car after the date and told her I'd like to meet up again when she got back from her trip.  She said we could go visit some wineries then I suggested one to her and wished her a good trip.  She thanked me for the coffee and told me it was nice to meet me.  I texted her today just to let her know I enjoyed the date and conversation.  I will wait for her now to get back to me.  I'm still not entirely sure if the date went well or if I should consider moving on.  I know her job and life has been busy lately and she apologized several time for that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfcmm0/first_date/
92,mfco6x,1616973929,A successful second hangout! - but where to go from here?,"So me and her (both 20) decided to hang out tonight and because it was hella cold, we stayed at mine - ordered food and then drank wine!

We had some good make out seshes and it was so great being close to each other.

I was very confused on where we stood and so I just asked her. We had been texting for over 4 months and hanged out only twice because of busy uni work and COVID. Nevertheless, she wanted to take things slow because he haven't hanged out often enough.

However, she really does like me but I feel in order for us to become boyfriend/girlfriend, she wants the proper feelings to develop over time. Neither of us have been in a relationship and I really don't want to ruin it as I have a tendency to be a bit too... chatty. I can't describe the word.

I really like her and I feel ready to enter one but I cannot help myself rushing things or being too forward.

Nonetheless, I told her we are on the same page!

Fast forward She's back in town and I'm surprised by her confidence to be expecting me to approach her and spend some time with her since she's willing to explain what happened back then so here I am wondering what am I suppose to be doing from here on.

I'm not just confused but amazed by her approach and still not taking her step offensive or personal but she literally came back and have been spending months with her friends and now when shes about to leave she needs to clear the air between us.

98,mfdcyn,1616976301,I left my girlfriend‚Äôs house after she told me about her past even though I didn‚Äôt want to know. Did I go about it wrong?,"For starters, I love my girlfriend and I care for her but I feel like she‚Äôs lacking some empathy in this particular situation.  We started dating a year ago but before I didn‚Äôt have much luck in dating.  I never had a girlfriend before her and was a virgin at 24 until I met her.  I used to struggle with poor self-image and self-esteem until I started regularly going to therapy.  I used to be overweight also but go into better shape.  Back to topic, I paid a visit to her house as I haven‚Äôt seen her in about 2 weeks due to our conflicting work schedules.  To make a long story short, we were having a good time until she decided to tell me information that was better left unsaid.  She said she wanted to be more open and honest with me so she proceed to tell me about her past experiences and relationships.  She‚Äôs been with 10 guys and has had 3 ONS‚Äôs.  I admit that I still stuffer from self-esteem and confidence issues from time to time but I feel as if she could‚Äôve gone without telling me as I got a really weird and disturbing feeling while she was telling me this. l told her that while I think it‚Äôs great that she wants to be more open, I‚Äôm not really a big fan of gearing about all of her past experiences and adventures so to speak.  She went on to say that I‚Äôm overreacting and that I have nothing to worry about since it‚Äôs been a few years since she‚Äôs talked to any of those guys. I told her that the whole idea still bothers me a bit and feel as though she is not putting my feelings into consideration seeing as how I was a virgin before her and hearing about how she used to hook up with guys and the sex she had in the past threw me off a little.  She also said that I‚Äôm being a little immature and insecure and should be able to shallow my pride and ego and grow up.  After awhile of sitting and watching a movie on Netflix, I told her I had to leave because I just got a call from work and I had to be there today.

99,mfddfq,1616976344,Can you help me figure out if these texts from a guy I‚Äôm talking to are sweet or too needy?,"Context: I have social problems and have very little experience in dating. I often have trouble recognizing sincerity vs red flags in conversations. 

I met this guy (early 30‚Äôs) on a dating app a few days ago and we have since switched to texting, but haven‚Äôt met yet. He‚Äôs very nice, and we have a lot in common. 

The problem is he has started saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop thinking about you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop staring at your photos‚Äù or different variations of that multiple times a day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a sweet thing for him to keep saying or if I am right to feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs only been a couple of days and we haven‚Äôt met, or talked on the phone or anything. 

I already asked him to stop calling me cutesy names because they make me uncomfortable so soon but I honestly can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just being overly judgy due to my lack of experience and social problems, or if he‚Äôs really developing needy tendencies especially where it‚Äôs only been a couple of days.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfddfq/can_you_help_me_figure_out_if_these_texts_from_a/
