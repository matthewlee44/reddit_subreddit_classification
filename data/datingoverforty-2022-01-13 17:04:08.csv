0,s3e35x,1642119740,BBW bias SUCKS!!,"So who here hasn't tried a dating app only to find more drama &amp; judgment than they expected? Well as a BIG woman (350 lbs) the dating world is damn near impossible. Yes some men like a BIG lady, but with that comes such ugly or vulgar responses or comments.
My profile states my size &amp; if that's not ur thing please move on...
But I get nasty comments like how dare I think I'm beautiful, desired, or even put myself on a dating site.
Now keep in mind I'm not actually looking at dating or anything romantic &amp; state I'm just looking for friends or activity partner to go to dinner with, etc.
The other flaw is that I have to be ""damaged"" or grateful that a man will even consider me as potential date material, but my favorite is the men that contact me because I must be so desperate that I'd be willing to accept a man's fetishes or kinks. Ewww
What the heck is wrong with ppl? U can't say anything without offending someone in society today, but on the internet ppl have no problem trying to tear others apart with complete apathy.
And don't even get me started on the ghosting with dating apps, I pity anyone actually trying to find another to date...slim pickings!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s3e35x/bbw_bias_sucks/

I'll ask another way...
Older dating is VERY different than when ur younger, so I'm curious about how others go about it after 40...
Are dating sites even an option for ppl our age &amp; if not, what other options do we have?
With Covid &amp; this vaccine issue its damn near impossible to make friends, let alone a date.
Older ppl are looking for companions or activity partners, while younger are looking for the love of their lives.
Most of us older generation have already experienced that plus kids, so it's about more of a deeper connection than just sexual chemistry. 
So is it even realistic to search on a dating app?

Sunday was our 4th date, at dinner she reached out to grab my hand for the first time and the touching continued. At the end of the date, I kissed her once I dropped her off at her house, we hugged for a while and the next day, she FaceTimed me to tell she needed to end it. 

I’m sort of confused on what happened here, days prior she deleted her dating profiles and end talking to the other guys, we talked openly about her deceased husband and she acknowledged how she liked that I was t threatened or insecure about him, which I’m not.

I met someone I absolutely ADORE.  We have so much fun together, laugh so so so much, the sex is amazing, and I always find myself wanting to be with him. 

My issue???  
He’s a bartender and most of the time we work completely opposite schedules. 
I have a son.  I plan well in advance and I’m an early riser….I am ready for bed by 9/10. I manage my time well and always know what to expect or what’s ahead. 

He’s super spontaneous-never plans more than a day or so ahead-everything feels last minute….and he works late-so his best time is LATE night.  

Overall I think we’ve done a great job navigating all of it but I’m so frustrated with the circumstances.  Neither of us are seeing other people right now.  

Is this something most people would continue pursuing?    
Or am I better off just ending this? 
The thought of that, even just typing it, makes me feel awful and it’s not what I want to do….but is this sustainable long term??? 

I’m fresh out of an AWFUL marriage and I want to have FUN.  He is fun, but I don’t know that he’s everything I want!  At the same time-who is?!!!

30,s4qx9e,1642271871,When life interrupts,"Recently a gentleman contacted me on Hinge and we have texted back and forth a bit. For once, not sharing life stories and mega texts. We planned to talk on the phone a few weeks ago (3?) but I got sick with Covid and my voice was shot. 

It took me a few days to get back in touch to set up a new time and I was heading into work (Covid nurse). He asked if I could meet up after my shift (6a-8p) and I sent a lighthearted quick video to him to show him I’m a real person and explain that coming out of a shift covered in germs with n95 face bruises and sweat would not be the greatest idea but that I do still want to meet him. 

He texted me back asking about work and if I see an end in sight (fwiw we share same views on vaccines and safety). I have since had to spend the week working until today and have had time at night to reply but zero energy to engage. 

Since it has been a week and I admittedly was not a great human at responding even a tiny bit, which is not my norm, I would like to respond and I do want to meet him or at minimum talk to him on the phone. With the pandemic and my work situation (hiring 200 fema nurses we are so short) I do not have the energy or desire to get in a relationship until this settles down some. 

Any advice on what to say to him that:
-sorry I took a while to reply, work was unexpectedly demanding with the rise this week (we all even stayed at the hospital a few nights)
-I do want to continue to talk or meet him
-with that said I realize I am not in a place to have the time to invest in pursuing a relationship for the unforeseen future and understand he may have different goals. I’m still happy to meet up though.

Or do I just let it go? He is the first not man-boy that’s shown up on my radar and his work ethic and where he’s at in life are attractive to me.

I know I'm going to get some eye rolls with this comment, but I've noticed the women I've been with since her have always been...well....horny, particularly after I go down on them for the first time. One woman mentioned that she usually can't have an orgasm, particularly the first time she's with a guy. All have made some comment on how good it was for them, and my last girlfriend described me as a ""sex god"" and was always pressuring me for sex, to the point that it became off putting. 

To be clear, I don't think I do anything different than any other guy and certainly don't have the stamina I had at 25 and definitely don't consider myself a ""sex god"" so I just don't get it. Does this happen to other guys?

45,s5f7ih,1642350002,Question about Hinge (Profile Ranking?),"Does anyone know if Hinge ranks profiles (not numerically, but as in how often they show up) by engagement?

At exactly the one-week mark from joining, I went from 5-10 likes per day to .25 a day - as in, four days with none and one overnight. (ProTip: Of those likes, VERY few had comments and only 3 had anything beyond ""gorgeous"" or ""great pic"" or ""stunning."" If you don't make a reasonably engaging comment, folks really don't have much to go on.) It was literally to the day, and the drop-off was precipitous.

I'm assuming it's something to do with the algorythm, possibly due to my low engagement with the system-- I think I've ""liked/commented"" on two folks proactively and had one quick chat with someone who commented (key word: commented) on one of my prompts (immediately clear not a match, but we did have a fun conversation. He was 15 years younger than me, so it ended up turning into an advice session.)

Or, if I X someone, do they not see me (I've Xed a bunch of folks, some of whom were reasonably interesting, but I'm still kind of in ""wait and see what comes my way"" mode. It's possible I've Xed my way to extinction. If so, is there a way to skip to the next without Xing?

I have been a single mom for almost 3 years after my partner decided that ""in good times and in bad times"" only applied to HIS bad times. Kid and I moved away and decided we needed to ""rest and recover"". I was only focused on kid and work, no plan to date at all.  
I am close friends with a wonderful woman and her husband and kids, they are virtually my only social life, and my friend told me I should start dating again and volunteered to watch my kid if I have a date. We spent Boxing Day together, and a relative of hers, who I had met a couple of times, but hardly had talked to, was showing interest in me. I was a bit confused, but curious to see where this may go. We had a party for New Year's Eve, he was there again, and I ended up spending the night at his place. Officially, because too many people were staying over until the next day and there were not enough sofas, but we ended up having sex, and it was great. Didn't tell anybody, of course.  


The following week, I went to see my friend to discuss some problems, he showed up, we had a few drinks, kid fell asleep on the sofa, and we headed to his place again. This time, there was no excuse, and we both know my friend is suspecting something.  


My idea for dating again some day was always to take things slowly and keep kid out of it for as long as possible. That didn't work out as planned. He and I are getting to know each other little by little through chatting, because we both have hardly any free time, and we live 1 hour from each other, and I feel I want to have him in my future. But everything is sooo complicated. We both would like to not let anybody know what's happening until we have an idea where this may be going. But kid is not dumb and asking uncomfortable questions, my friend and family (his relatives) are trying to get us to confirm their suspicions. It's a mess.

Post divorce I have done a crap ton of work on myself and have embarked on my first relationship in ages, and it seems to be going well, with good communication, good sex, and affection, three things that have NEVER co-existed for me before. 
In the past, I felt I “fell in love” when I felt frustrated yearning or was mythologizing the distance that was between us; or I got caught up in my own headcanon of what the relationship was. They may have said they loved me but they never met me half way or reached out to me. No one has ever “been in love” with me. My parents and friends are bad examples, too.
I literally have no idea what healthy romantic love looks or feels like; I don’t trust my judgement of my own feelings since I’ve deluded myself so many times before. Can any of you help me parse out what’s fondness and what’s yearning and what’s love and what’s lust?

62,s67c04,1642435256,General help or advise,"About me: 40(m). Divorced 2.5 years. Married 7 so it’s over a decade now since I’ve been on a date. I’ve got 3 daughters ranging from 3 to 12 with 50% custody. Got out of a bad marriage to a narcissist who was emotionally and verbally subside to me and especially the kids. Not sure if that’s all important but want to be descriptive to who I am and all. And for the record a marriage counselor diagnosed the narcissism. Not me just thinking it. I really never thought about that on my own. 

I’m super introverted. Except with the kids where I make a fool of myself daily singing made up songs and playing games. I’m very awkward socially. I’m happy being alone but did recently try OLD in case I can meet somebody. It would be nice. I knew getting divorced I’d never be lonely with my kids and if it needs to be they’re enough for me. But anyway I don’t know how even to go about dating anymore. I think I’m middle of the road attractiveness. 5 lbs extra weight. Balding but hey, I’m 40. Not ugly but nothing special. I really have no idea though. Think I have a lower sense of myself than reality. 

I struggle talking to people I don’t know. So I make very few friends. And with texting a stranger it’s even harder. I think I come across as strange just because I just don’t know what to do.  To me the stress of sending a message is so high I can spend a few hours coming back to what I wrote and changing the wording I overthink it so much because if I can’t come across as normal at the start that’s pretty much it. I am fairly normal in real life. And I’m pretty funny and a great person once I’m comfortable. I’m generous and loyal. A great cook. I just don’t know what people do and how to start to get to know a stranger with short text messages. 
There’s also almost a catch 22 here for me. I know writing a message instead of just a like is better. But I can spend half an hour trying to come up with anything more than basic hi how are you. But out of 100 likes I give maybe 6-7 like me back. Out of those maybe 1-2 will respond to a message. Of them half the people respond to my lengthy messages with 3 words. After 2-3 tries I’m done if they’re not gonna try to engage. So I wait for a Match before I try to write something. It’s too much work otherwise and gets too discouraging. But get less matches because of that. 

Took 5 months and eventually got a date. She stood me up. So still actually no dates for over a decade. 

How long of messaging do people wait before a real life meetup anyway?  What else is there for a dad who knows nobody else in the state where I live to meet people?  I’m just lost and discouraged. I’m gonna redo my profile. Try something new. 

I know this is long winded and vague. But any experiences or advise you feel is relevant to me is appreciated.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s67c04/general_help_or_advise/

79,s705bl,1642519882,Question about breaking up…,"I’ve been dating someone for about a year and a half. The first date, we met over drinks. Since then, I’ve realized how important drinking is in his life. I never clued in at the start, since we’d go out for dinner, or drinks, or cook at his place, or play tennis or go for a hike and have a beer (or more) after. 
At the start of the relationship I fell hard for him. I was surprised when he said he hoped to see the person he dates about once a week. I found that odd and said I’d like to see the person at least 3x a week. We did live 45 minutes apart though. Now about 6 months ago, I moved even further away for work; now it’s about a 75 min. drive to see each other. We still basically only meet for a once a week date and sleepover, though we have done some weekends of just us; and short trips with my kids. And now after the last 9 months or so I see him drinking at 11 am (at the cottage, so on holiday), at the airport before 10 am (again, he’s on a family holiday), at the ski hill with friends in the morning, and basically any reason by lunch time on the weekends. I am just a social drinker and not really a day drinker except for special occasions.
I feel almost repulsed by the amount of drinking. I even found an almost full bottle of Baileys was finished and left with an ounce in it, by him; yet I never saw him drink any. My children don’t drink! This is also causing him weight gain and to snore really loud, in fact I need to find another place to sleep mid-night, every time I am with him!

My question is…..I want to break up with him, but am wondering if it is acceptable to break up on the phone, or by text. He’s currently on a family holiday so this may not be the time, but driving almost 100 km just to break up and turn around and drive home also seems like a waste of time. I don’t want to seem mean so I may just say we don’t get to see each other enough; and I need another kind of relationship.

Of the last 32 posts,

15 were identifiably by WSM (women seeking men)

7 were identifiably by MSW

10 were identifiably either by someone LGBQT+ or were (at least in my judgement) unclear as to to OP's gender or the OP deliberately removed all references from their gender. 

Given that LGBQT+ people are a small group (maybe 5%-10% of the population) and assuming that the split between genders is roughly the same as overall, for posts where OP gender cannot be identified, it appears though that about 2/3 of this Reddit is WSM. 

Of the posts here my MSW, most of them have to do with a situation where either the OP is:

* not confident about his financial situation
* having difficulty interpreting women's signals
* having difficulty understanding how to interact with women for potential date/sex/relationships rather than platonic encounters

These are actual non-trivial skills that you need to acquire if you are a man. The good news appears to be that men are having less difficulty finding relationships, post 40, than women. I do not know why that is, although I expect that women at 40+ have more psychological problems than men in that age range do. Why that is I don't know but that is my personal observation. 

Nonetheless if you are  man and you are not having success in the dating world, I recommend getting off OLD and learning to operate IRL.

A book that helped me a lot is ""How to Succeed with Women,"" by Louis Copeland. One thing you notice is that it focusses a lot on interacting socially, not on the deep psychosociological factors that people focus on here that gets you nowhere.

84,s7dgq0,1642554704,Interested in someone who lives down the hall...,"Last winter, I moved into the condo I live in now. I'm divorced and have been single for 5-6 years, and I've been focusing on work the past year or so... dating and relationships weren't a priority. I'm pretty shy, too.

A neighbour chatted with me about a month ago while we waited for the elevator. He seems nice and has a positive, friendly attitude that I noticed. It turns out we live on the same floor, just down the hall from each other. A week or so later, we bumped into each other again, and he asked me for my name. It seemed innocent enough, and I didn't think much of it. We bumped into each other a few more times, and each time, he used my name. ""Hi, Sally"" or ""Seeya Sally"" or ""Look doggie, it's Sally""... and I have to say, I really enjoyed the fact that he remembered my name and used it frequently.

So I thought a bit about my experiences with him. I'm certain he's single, and I find myself attracted to his positive energy and friendliness. And I wondered if he had been expressing interest in me that I was oblivious to... so, I decided that I would open myself up to getting to know him better and make more of an effort to return his positive vibes.

Last week, we ran into each other outside the elevator again. I made a point of telling him that I liked how he remembered my name and used it when we spoke. He jokingly replied, ""Thanks, Sarah"" (not my name) and I laughed and got into the elevator, then he called out ""Seeya fluffy\_cloudz!""

Anyway, I'm not sure what to do next or how to see if he is also interested in me, or is just very friendly. We seem to bump into each other about once a week... but I've found myself leaving my condo more in hopes of seeing him again. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I know him well enough to knock on his door or anything like that yet.

How would you move forward with this? I know it's hard to say, but do you think that asking and using someone's name frequently is a sign of interest?

96,s89me9,1642651405,I (37F) would like to broaden my age range and date men in their 40s… but will they want kids?,"Hi there over 40 dating! Basically my title… I have recently been dating men younger than me by a few years and while fun I have realized that one of my top 3 must have’s for a HUSBAND are that he is secure.  I don’t mean that he’ll support me and I can be a stay at home wife but that he is established in his career, he knows who he is and is emotionally mature.  I want to try dating men in their 40s because it would broaden my options but I have heard that if a man hits 40 and is not married then the odds of him ever marrying drop sharply and he is not the marrying kind.  So I’d like to get married and start a family pretty soon and we’ll I guess my planning up until now was to date the hot, fun, jerks.  Well… my question to you all is are you desiring marriage and a family if you’ve never been married and no kids? I’d like to know if I’m wasting my time and primarily stick to men my own age.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s89me9/i_37f_would_like_to_broaden_my_age_range_and_date/

98,s8ci8z,1642660761,Close to taking the OLD plunge - advice on casual vs LTR needed,"Not trying to be flaky… but as I consider (key word) getting back into OLD after a breakup, I have a question for the women in my age range…

If you are looking for an LTR, is a man stating he is looking for something casual an automatic swipe left?  (What if I’m pretty cute?  :-))

I ask mainly because… I’m a bit of a serial monogamist.  Maybe I need some casual dating for a bit.  But, I’d not mind if it started casual and evolved.  Do you think that model exists in OLD at our age?  Or does casual only scream ‘hookup’?  LTR is the goal, so maybe I’m better off stating that and going pretty slow / being up front about my thinking.  Not looking to mislead.
