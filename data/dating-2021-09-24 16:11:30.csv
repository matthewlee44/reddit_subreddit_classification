3,pusxk1,1632518741,When do you think an age gap is too much to be appropriate?,"I'm asking because I'm 31 and have been dating a 23 year old woman for a bit over a month now and there doesn't seem to be any real issue despite the notable age gap. She does turn 24 is a couple of months
 I have noticed quite a bit of hostility towards age gap relationships on reddit, which has gotten me very nervous about potential society backlash toward our relationship.

Maybe I'm not the most ""mature"" 31 year old since I'm not ready to settle down with a family quite yet, but I don't think that makes me a bad or immoral person. We get along great, have similar interests, and are on the same page, so I'm not ending the relationship based on people's comments. Also, yes, we are both independent adults. I'm really just wondering what people think. Is the age gap appropriate?

I’m 18m and can lose my virginity but I wonder if I should tell women if I’m a virgin before. I believe that I’d enjoy it better if she kinda guides me in the process and be willing to go multiple, short rounds lol. I’d like my first time to be an older, more experienced woman so it would be more understandable.

I think it would be so hot doing it with a girl that encourages and applauds me when I’m doing well on my first time I’d feel so great about myself and try my best to make her enjoy it too.

I’ve had opportunities before to lose it but I’ll be honest I don’t know what the heck I’m doing, I only know the basics.

9,putbu3,1632520078,A dating idea and advice,"There's a girl i really liked for the past few months and i bought her roses,surprised her with her favourite song on my guitar,wrote her a poem and gave her a painting since she likes photography 

And this was all during summer and she works as a waitress and she showed signs of liking me back and in monday (3 days from now) her caffe is closing and im also leaving in a few days and yesterday i asked her out and she said yes 

We immediately went on a date a few hours after i asked her out we walked around town for a bit and we sat at a caffe for 2 hours and the chemistry was great she told me things she never told anyone before she also said that she kept all the things i gave to her in the past and she said she's gonna remember me forever which was cool we kept talking there was never a moment of awkward silence we just kept talking i made her laugh a few times i made a few moves in terms of being physical like hugging her and things like that we even took a picture together that i would share here but i cant so anyways 

I wanted to ask her out again tomorrow i wanted to wait for a day to go by so i don't seem needy and i have an idea on what to do but im not sure if its too much or something like that i just need an opinion and advice really 

So my idea is to take her to a place thats 20 minutes away from the center of the city but we can still see the city lights and all of that its basically a beautiful view and theres a bunch of big rocks around and a path and i found a rock thats completely flat and big enough for 3 people and also the sea is right in front of you as well as the city lights and theres an open sky with a bunch of stars so i wanted to take her there take a big warm blanket in case it gets cold buy her favourite snack which i know what it is and i thought that maybe we could kind of cover ourselves with the blanket while we eat her favourite snacks and talk 

I also never kissed a girl before (im 18 she's 21) so im a bit nervous cause she knows im leaving in a few days and so is she so its probably gonna be our last date so im just a bit nervous and i dont know what to do thats why im asking for advice is the date idea good?

12,putvcp,1632521927,Why won’t she admit she likes me?!,"There’s this girl who I’ve been talking to for a couple months now. I kinda new from the get go that she liked me but I wasn’t sure. She then grew on me and we started hanging out. I admitted I had feelings for her and she said she didn’t feel the same (which I was shocked given how much she was flirting) from that point on the flirting from her end just intensified more. 

She introduced me to her friends then wanted meet my friends. I told her I feel like she’s going pretty fast for someone who doesn’t like me and asked again if she liked me or not and she said no we’re just friends. 

Fast forward a few more weeks and this girl is flirting with me nonstop and asking me to hangout with her everyday for hours at a time. So I tell her like what’s wrong with you, why do you keep saying one thing and acting another way. Do you want something more than friendship because if not I’m done with these games. She then talks to me and says that she’s thinking about it. Then that night she texts me she’s like we need to stop hanging out so much if we are gonna be just friends then she blocks my number ( i didn’t even figure this out til much later)

She then unblocks my number a week later (I didn’t even know I was blocked cause I didn’t text her) and she asks me if I wanna study with her and I was like yeah sure. This time this girl is all over me flirting. Forget studying she’s dropping compliments, feeling my arms, etc. then I text her today asking what’s the assignment the next day and she’s gone and blocked me again…

So the reason I knew she blocked me the first time was because yesterday she mentioned that she had blocked me “I needed to block you for a week because I needed to clear mh head and resist the urge to text you” is what she said and I was like ya I didn’t even know you texted me.

13,putx52,1632522102,You're great but... The real reasons that I've dumped someone.,"I think that I need to give more honest feedback to the people I don't want to date. I'm definitely guilty of ghosting in the past. And I've absolutely told people that they're great but I don't feel any chemistry, which was true but there were sometimes more specific reasons that I felt too awkward to say. 

But I also have realised that I tend to want to avoid someone's reaction. Unfortunately it can be really damaging to someone's psyche when actions and intent don't seem to match up and you're left with no discernible reasons.
It seems like many men on here are unsure why they're striking out and are having trouble receiving specific feedback.

Not sure if these will help but here are some specific reasons for why I've dumped a person:

- He made disparaging comments about his exes/other women.
- He couldn't get over the fact that a friend of a friend didn't like him or find him charming (like really bothered by it) even though there was a good reason (he kinda stole this dudes gf).
- Obvious religious/culture differences like conservatism and perceived gender roles and how a ltr would look day to day.
- Made fun of strangers.
- Naff sex that wasn't just because we were still learning each other's bodies.
- Agreed with everything I said.
- Over-complimented me with inane adoration for my looks.
- Kissed me with tongue in the middle of the first date.
- Was cynical and pessimistic about any activities we did, and the world in general (whiny more than philosophical).
- Littered.
- Told white lies to his friends and family all the time.
- Had never travelled outside of his hometown.
- His place was messy and disorganised.
- Didn't have a rich inner life/wanted me to be the focus of his life.
- He told his friends too many details of our sex life.
- He was very very frugal.
- He didn't know how to budget or save.
- He didn't know how to use a washing machine.
- He let his friends down on multiple occasions.
- He didn't express his needs or boundaries well or at all (either deferring to me and wanting me to set everything under the guise of worship, or being 'too stoic' to talk about his feelings and expectations for the relationship).
- He wanted to spend all his time with me.
- He didn't put thought and effort into celebrations or gifts/birthdays for me, his friends or family.
- He was conservative/immature sexually.
- He was very against trying anything new.
- He didn't put any care or thought into his appearance or have a sense of style.

Some of these are based on my own wants and bias so this isn't meant to apply for anyone else - this just hopefully gives you an idea of what women sometimes look out for in potential partners!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/putx52/youre_great_but_the_real_reasons_that_ive_dumped/

15,putxns,1632522150,Had my first date with my ex....,"Gay guys in this story. 

I dated guy for 2 months earlier this year. The thing is I met him and we started dating when I moved to the city that we both live in. It was a big move. I really started to develop feelings but I was overwhelmed and wasn't ready. We had this great connection we both agreed, seeing each other 3-4 times a week, but it was too much for me. I was overwhelmed with my move still, let alone jumping into dating. So we split, very peacefully and civil. I could tell he was really hurt by it. 

The thing is I thought of him every day and really missed him. I just wasn't ready. It's a lot moving across the country in a new city where you don't know people and start dating right away. 

We didn't talk for three months. After three months of not speaking I sent him a happy birthday text which he quickly responded to. A few weeks later he started commenting on my Instagram posts. So I reached out to see if he wanted to meet up to grab a bite to eat. he responded fairly quickly and told me that it would be great to do so. His messages have been short but friendly. I think he was really hurt by the break up so he's being careful. 

So on Monday I texted him to see what days and times work for him. I gave him my availability, the soonest being Tuesday I could meet. He said ""What about tonight?"" I told him I couldn't because I had plans, so we agreed on Tuesday. I confirmed a time and said ""perfect will see you tomorrow."" And then he texted me ""So what's new in your life? Anything new?"" I found it so odd because we were meeting up the next day to catch up, so why as me that before our meet up? Methinks it was to see if I was dating anybody. 

We met for the date and went to dinner. It was great. We caught up and did not talk about the past at all. We really enjoyed each other's company. The place he picked was a place where they take photos of every table and then give you the photo at the end. When we got it, he got excited, smiled and asked me if he could keep it. I told him sure. 

We then went for a walk and he started asking me if I was on any of the dating/hookup apps. Which I told him the truth which is no, not really. He also then told me that he noticed I haven't been posting much on Instagram. We got to his place outside and he told me that he had a great night. We then both went in for a kiss on the lips. Very light quick kiss, nothing super romantic, but kiss on the lips nonetheless. He then told me he would like to see me again this weekend. He looked at the picture from dinner again smiled and told me he was going to put it up on his fridge. He was really excited about the picture and told me he was happy about our night. 

I texted him the following day and told him that it made me really happy to see him. I also told him my availability this weekend. He hasn't responded back yet but that's okay for now. I have noticed his texts prior to this date were friendly but short, and he didn't always respond to every text. II have noticed he's being careful with texts and is letting me take the lead. So I am going to follow up and solidify plans for Sunday tomorrow.

I’ve been looking up things on google about what I feel like I could’ve gone wrong and I just feel like shit about it. Like she was very strong coming off when we first started talking and I asked her out and she said sure and that she will let me know. I followed up with it and she just snapped me a picture of her face and no response. She’s dry and whenever I look it up on YouTube I feel stupid as fuck for coming off as too needy or whatever and looking for reasons she might be dry. She’ll leave me on delivered too for like a day then snap me back and I’m just like damn bro I really did something wrong here like I text to go on dates and have little convos like I don’t know what I’m doing wrong here man. I asked if she wasn’t interested in me yesterday and she responded that she has a lot of people her Snapchat and that she’s really busy but I just feel dumb for asking that too.

38,puvqq3,1632528935,What the hell happened?,"I(28M) got matched on Tinder with cute girl(25f).

We didn't texted much and quickly set up a date. 

It went well, plenty of topic, we both were open and talked about various subjects like relationship with siblings, life in general and, of course, Tinder.

I noticed she was playing with her hair A LOT and generally was interested. I walked her to her train and while we waited she, herself, told me that she wants to continue seeing each other. She came back from aboard, I was her first date in our country and in week we had a date she was out of quarantine.

After she left, I texted her if she was okey at home, you know, usual. Alright, seems fine. 

There was one song we could not found the name of, while on date, and it popped into my YT playlist, so after week I texted her: "" hey was this the song"" ""yeah it was, haha"". I told her I want to help her with her blind dog, she liked the message and asked her for second date, she responded with ""darn I have busy weekend"".

Great...

ONE AND HALF MONTH LATER of silence me being dumb, alone and wanted to close this subject, I texted her ""hey, how are you doing in our country"" and after two weeks of no respond I deleted the match.

Thing is, I have no clue what went wrong here... she herself said, she wants to see each other again, so why the change? Why ghost me for so long and why she didn't simply deleted the match",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/puvqq3/what_the_hell_happened/

Well I did, and \*shocked pokemon face\* I got my heart completely destroyed in multiple relationships.

Now I have some things I'm working through in therapy and my life has basically been an emotional downward spiral since. I still am doing well professionally and appear to be fine outwardly to others. My ex looks like he's doing amazing, has a successful startup business and works in accounting making fantastic money. Gorgeous apartment. Massive glow up, lost weight. And, I'm...  feeling kinda terrible.

I've always wanted to get married and do the traditional family thing. I could have with my ex, but I dumped him and ended up really hurting him in the process. I've spent years feeling terrible about it, never really apologized like I felt I should. Now he's got a new girl and they look like they're probably going to get married soon. It breaks my heart to see it, it could have been me, I left, and now I wish it was me. I have regrets.

I was on a first date with a guy and we were at his apartment (stupid idea, but it was the second date I ever went on, so I had very little experience).

I posted on a subreddit asking if I could still consider myself a virgin after being pressured into giving a blowjob on a first date at a guy's apartment because he was my only ride back to my college campus. I felt somewhat traumatized afterwards and didn't want that to do my first sexual experience.

I am by no means unattractive, I've gotten help with setting up my profiles, but I still get next to no matches. I have friends who put far less effort into their profiles and get matches on the daily.

I also don't really want to go to parties (not really my crowd or thing, especially with covid), which doesn't help.

I usually get shit about my height from short and average woman. They usually go for much taller guys and I've never had that much reciprocation from short and average women. They usually never notice me and they usually have much more guys to talk to and go out with. I definitely think tall women and short guys can relate, heres why. Both are usually not the norm of society. Also both aren't usually sought after as much in a country/society in which shorter and smaller sized women are more the ""ideal"" and bigger and taller guys are the ""ideal."" Also options, short guys and tall women have less options because of that.  


 A lot of tall women have said that i'm legit cute and they actually found me fun to be around with. They even said a lot of guys shorter than them usually have great personalities and are just overall fun. So if you're a short guy, give tall women a shot.

I dont mean to brag, but money is of no issue to me so I invited and paid for her plane ticket/hotel to stay with me when i went to visit my friend across the country. She gladly came along and was flirty, however, she is very distant when hanging with my friend and I.

70,puz9lt,1632542678,He suddenly became appealing after we started dating or i’m just being jealous?,"We confessed to each other this week, and the present classroom returned too in the prep school we study. But since we started studying there(almost 2 years), he always was the loner, no one would talk to him, completely alone. Since April of the last year till last week the classes were online, but he was quite “known” because the teachers often complimented him, but very rarely people would contact him ask for help a subject.

Now the classes are back, suddenly 5 or 6 girls started talking to him, asking for his help and engaging in unrelated conversations, but mostly asking for help. I know that have some factors that i must have considerate like:

•He is very intelligent and good in teaching, and almost every teacher when making questions in class look directly at him knowing that much probably he knows the answer(and he knows).

•The majority of the students are girls, so if a person would talk to him is much probable that that person would be a girl.

•The National Entrance Exam (the exam that most of us are studying) is very close and he is one of the most qualified persons to help in hard subjects.

•Although his look is a bit above average, he is far (objectively speaking, although in my heart he is better than Chris Hemsworth,Jason momoa and henry cavil all together) from being the most handsome dude in class. And his look is not his most noticeable trait and he didn’t changed to much from last year. so i think that can be a bit improbable that girls are approaching him because of it.

But for me, even considering this things, still strange for me how much attention he’ve been getting. And some girls are even trying to be touchy with him, he is even taking some distance when talking to them (he dislike strangers touching him). And the other thing that is bothering me is that i pulled this strategy to know him better (asking for helping and using it as a way to engage in unrelated conversations to know him better e.e).

I don’t think that I’m insecure with it, nor mad with him nor the girls(maybe a bit annoyed with their touching) and i trust him a lot and very confident about our relationship, but I can’t help feel a bit strange with this situation. I will not ask him to stopping talking with them, actually i’m a bit happy that he is making friends since aside from me he doesn’t have a single one.

He texted me after not texting me in a few years. He would text me good morning, compliment me, and ask me how my day was. A few months later, we met up. He came to visit my state and see his friend and we figured we’d meet up. We went out to dinner. I didn’t expect them to be dates but he paid for the dinner and he kissed me towards the end. We then went on another date and went for a walk. He was dancing with me and we started to open up. He then drove back to his state to go back home. 

After the dates, he would always invite me to see him but due to Covid (this is when it first started), I didn’t feel comfortable. I was terrified. He said he understood but would continue to invite me. I would say I would go but then don’t follow through with the plans because of my fear. 

He then drops the news that he’s moving to a state that is further away. I immediately thought there is no way this is going to work. But he continues to invite me. 

Someone in his family passed away and he goes back to my state for the services. He invited me to go to one of the services he also invited me to meet his friends and family. Also invited me to Thanksgiving. But again, I said no because of Covid. I felt so guilty. He said he understood and said he would make me feel comfortable during my stay. He said he could treat me good and appreciate me. He also mentioned that he hasn’t found the one, but has liked me for a really long time.

Eventually we went out separate ways (don’t blame him) and he got a girlfriend. They only lasted a couple of months (super curious as to why they broke up). After a few months of breaking up, he reached out to me again. Now we are talking again and he mentioned that he’s coming back up to my state and would like to meet. I asked him if he’s looking for a hook up or is genuinely interested in me and he said that he’s genuinely interested in me but likes hooking up…whatever that means lol. After I brought that up, he didn’t speak too much to me today. But I could be overthinking.

I really like this girl in my class I talk to her every day and she's very fun to talk to. Either way I started catching feelings for her, but was wondering how can I tell if she's catching feelings for me, Just Incase so I can make a move .


She has 1 other friend not including me , I'm pretty sure she talks to me the most , we even walk to the bus together

She gave me her Snapchat, and I didn't even ask for it. I was just scrolling through she grabbed my phone and added herself without me doing anything/asking. 
She's a extremely nice and adorable person and very fun to talk to  and she seems to be enjoying my company. 
Not really sure what the signs of people having crushes on others are besides them strating at you from time to time but that's it.

75,puzhwn,1632543614,Age is just a number or???,"So there’s this guy I have been friends with for about 10 years. I’m not the type to have friends with the opposite sex usually (I’m just more of a girls girl) but we really hit it off! When we first met we were both single but worked together so it was always kept professional. And he’s 7 years younger… so definitely friendship right? I never even had feelings for him until recently due to his age and other factors. 

Well anyway, we hung out after work all the time and we have always kept in touch on social media and chatted quite a bit… for 10 years but it was always kept clean. No flirting ever or nude pics or anything like that.  Just talking about … everything! Dating, the universe, politics, etc etc etc and we have everything in common.

 At some point I had changed jobs and moved a couple hours away and began dating someone (got married and divorced btw). But he stayed my friend throughout the course of this relationship because he was respectful of our relationship and so the three of us even hung out sometimes. 

My divorce just became finalized. We have been separated for a year.  As soon as I separated my crush suddenly started talking to me a lot more via text and social media. Like… a lot lol. I am now planning to move back to the same city again closer to him and suddenly for the first time in 10 years I have feelings. I am moving for a job, not for him, by the way. But I am now worried that my feelings may not be unreciprocated. He talks to me a lot but it is always kept friends. But then why does he talk to me so much? Does he like me in a romantic sense and is just waiting for the right time or does he just really like my friendship because I’m older?

88,pv0psb,1632548863,28f having trouble connecting with men,"i’m 28 i’ve never had a boyfriend except for one relationship which lasted about a year (age 22-23) and was absolutely insane. i moved in with a guy (35) who never even considered me his gf (why did i do this??) and was mean to me and basically used me for my ability to drive him to work (he had multiple DUIs)

for some context - my dad left when i was 7 and i never saw/heard from him again. my grandpa (moms dad) was known for being a cheater and i had no relationship w him. my dads dad i only met once and he died when i was 6 but he had children with multiple girlfriends while married to my grandma so i know that somehow affected me too. i never had any type of male role model or even relationship in my life, ever.

as a kid i was teased a lot by boys for my weight. i was always scared of them. when i turned 16, i was no longer the “chubby girl with acne” - i was gorgeous with glowing skin and curvy. all the guys who made fun of me suddenly wanted to f\*ck me.

which has led to... over 100 sexual partners and not one boyfriend. it’s so hard for me to connect with men. i can’t help it, i always immediately assume the worst to the point that it’s just impossible to connect with me. i know i put my walls up high and i overcompensate by offering sex. which never gets me anywhere with someone.

on top of what’s happened to me in the past year .. i attracted the absolute worst person to come into my life. around this time last year (i was 27) i met a guy (44) on bumble. he was rich, amazing in bed, everything i could want in a guy. after years of feeling like i could never connect with someone romantically i thought i truly met someone i could seee myself with. he constantly complimented me took me on nice dinners and just seemed perfect.

he ghosted me after 4 months and after a little research i found out he had a gf the whole time, was a rapist, had several domestic violence charges against him from several women, and in fact wasn’t rich at all - he was charged with fraud, and was basically running a ponzi scheme.

im rereading that paragraph and i know how insane that sounds but yes that just happened to me. but i fell for him so hard (expert love bomber). the connection was the false intimacy he created. the ghosting sucked so bad, i just felt so rejected and constantly replayed everything in my head for months wondering what i did that he didn’t like. i’ve never been so heartbroken by someone. i even was suicidal at one point (i’m aware this isn’t normal)

it’s been 6 months since i last saw him. he tried coming back after 3 months and i didn’t respond .

anyways, where do i go from here? i feel so hopeless. i have plenty of guys in my DMs but i just can’t motivate myself to go on one date. what’s the point?

i hate to say this without sounding narcissistic but i think i’m too pretty. guys are either scared of me or see me as no more than an object. and me with not being able to put my walls down.

i’m getting older, i’ve already lived alone for 5 years. this shit is lonely. i can’t go on the rest of my life like this. i’m getting nervous that the more that i grow into this loner hyper independent person the more difficult it will become to connect...

any advice, resources are appreciated - i pray every night to overcome these issues. i want nothing more than to share my life with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pv0psb/28f_having_trouble_connecting_with_men/
89,pv0r2p,1632549036,A guy was too touchy on a first “date” and it made me feel really bad,"
Apologies if this is the wrong sub. I’m feeling kind of anxious, don’t know where to put this. I don’t know what happened or why I feel so bad, maybe I want a sanity check or someone to tell me Wtf happened. But in it anyway, I hope there can be a lesson for other women in my position and also other men to gain some insight on how things feel for some women vs. how they portray they feel as a result of fear/shock/not wanting to be rude, etc. 

This is slightly me venting. I don’t really know who is to blame here, but I feel like it’s my fault for not having stronger boundaries. Met a guy on Hinge, messaged him and said I’m not really looking for something too emotionally intensive right now, and said exactly that I’m looking for “friendship/casual connection”. He didn’t ask me to elaborate and I feel like because it was so vague, it was my fault I ended up getting more than I bargained for. 

Immediately when he sees me, he gives me a very strange hug that lingered. Something felt very, very wrong from the start. I was wearing a cropped black off the shoulder sweater with a black skirt and something told me to bring a jacket with me. So I had my oversized denim jacket on my arm. He knew I was at the park earlier and immediately pulled at my skirt and asked me if I usually wear skirts “that short” to parks. I’m usually a bubbly person, very talkative and confidently spoken. But with this guy I turned into a quiet stuttering baby. I was so shocked I felt like an insecure teenager again. He put his arm around me immediately and he would keep pulling me close like that. I put on my jacket not even 5 minutes into our walk and he got pissed. I apologized and said I was cold. He would stop the walk and ask me if I wanted a hug every five seconds and when I’d be like “errr??” he’d be like “oh cmon Wtf it’s just a hug” so I’d think to myself yeah it’s just a hug. Every time he would hug me his hands would linger down my body when he was getting out of the hug and it really rubbed me the wrong way. He would say he hates girls that waste his time snd say they want something casual but can’t follow through and I was just lost for words. One time we passed by an alley and I was just like “oh that looks interesting” (I know, dumbass) and he said let’s go in. I said no I don’t want to, he asked why? He said all I’m going to do is take you into the alley where no one can see and “befriend” you. I think he made a killing joke after but I was gone at this point. He was referring to the fact that I said I was looking for friendship in my earlier text. At one point when he asked for one of his hugs he slipped his hands under my jacket and started running his hands over my back and pushing my top down a little so that his hands were on my skin. It happened so fast and with such purpose and intent I literally just shut down. I just let him do it telling myself it was nothing. He kept doing it and saying no wonder I was cold if this is what I was wearing. I really don’t think that’s normal? Like in all my years of hugging people no one has ever put their hands under my clothes during a hug. Then he wanted to warm my nose because it was cold so he said let me rub my nose on yours it’ll be cute, idk why I said okay... but he did that and then he kissed my nose. So fucking weird. Then we commented on each others smell and I said he smelled good (again, idiot... I was trying to make conversation and be nice and I guess I felt bad... and that makes me feel horrible because it feels as though it was my fault for not establishing with words (but my body language definitely spoke for itself) that I didn’t want this). So he started rubbing his face all over my neck and chest snd said he wants me to smell like him so I can “remember this”. I told him I needed to leave early several times and he would make me feel bad about it.  I told him that I am originally from Arab roots and he said that I’m a horrible Arab to be here with him and he like said I’m “bad” and slapped my butt. What the fuck. My hand actually instinctively went to stop his but it was too late. Then we passed by a food place snd he said he had a food baby snd asked me if I did and then started rubbing his hands all over my stomach/torso. I hate being touched there and told him. He wouldn’t stop and his grip was so strong snd I kept being like “please I really don’t like being touched there”. I was saying that while actually trying to get his hands off until I guess he woke up and stopped. Before it was time to go he kept saying I need to give him a goodbye kiss or a “good goodbye greeting” and I was like I don’t know I don’t think so, etc. before we left he asked for a last hug and I finally managed to say “I don’t want one right now” and he got really pissed and said “oh so I did something wrong?” And said he’ll leave now because he must have. So I said no etc then when it was time to go I myself stupidly said “can I have a goodbye hug now?” In an attempt to make peace/be nice and he actually gave some a normal one. I feel like I set myself up for this by not explicitly verbally saying I didn’t want any of it and only have myself to blame. He hasn’t stopped texting me after I removed him from hinge and it’s been a few days and I’m still just as anxious and I don’t know what happened really.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pv0r2p/a_guy_was_too_touchy_on_a_first_date_and_it_made/

Also, I really really liked him and the closer we got the more timid and nervous I became which I guess built a wall between us. On the other side of the coin, he’s always breadcrumbing me, last minute planning with me and giving me sweet attention when it’s convenient for him. We’ve been dating for 11 months and he always told me how he wanted to take it slow and and was quite adverse to “relationships”. I myself mentioned that I’m not sure if I have the mental capacity to be in one but I told him I liked him, I wanted to be with him, and I couldn’t take the concept of him talking to other people. This went in limbo for a long time where he stated it was not fair that “I didn’t want to be with him but I didn’t want him to be with anyone else” when he had already put that boundary between us. I’ve been so honest with my feelings for him but he just pushes me away everytime, I know he has trust issues but he deflects it on to me (I do too).

we start talking again, things are okay, we’re planning on being friends for the time being. We get to talking and reminiscing about funny old memories, it’s going really well. And then, she’s on her bed and says “you can come sit closer yknow…”

My heart stops and I’m so confused, for months she’s been keeping me blocked and at this strict level of contact. I’m instantly like turned on and emotional, but I just sat down and asked her straight up, “Are you sure?” And “Do you think this is a good idea, I just don’t want to us get hurt.”

And she says, direct quote, “I don’t think so, but if your asking, I’m not using you haha”
Just like that. With that adorable laugh at the end. I just dove on top of her. We’re getting into it and like 10-15 minutes, in the middle of being naked, I’m about to vomit. I get up and it’s like music and throw up noises.

And she’s being so caring, like bringing me stuff, turning on her mom voice to make sure I’m okay, helps clean me up and cuddles with me it’s just impossible not to feel loved at this point alone.

And then she fucks the absolute shit out of me, like I rarely see this side of her, it was like it was her first time again, I was so turned on but I was so happy. I told her I love her and she said it back…

I drop her off at work, we avoid her friends bc she talks with them a lot about me.

And then we go to hang out again, shit starts going sour because I can tell something is wrong. She got angry and said she thinks it was a mistake, and that she was just confused. But that thing she said about using me just echoed in my head, and I was wondering what made her change her mind..

And now I’m blocked. I was gonna ask for advice, but no one says anything except “just break up” as if they’ve had anything close to what we’ve had and been through.

The best way to describe him was like a 2in taller machine gun Kelly looking dude. A complete 180 of my type. We share a lot of things in common and both are looking for potential relationships. Literally on our first conversation he messaged me first and made plans when and where to take me out to dinner, and what time he’ll pick me up. We talked for day’s leading up to the date. When he arrived he was such a gentleman and opened the car door for me and stuff. Whole car ride the conversation never died. He surprised me with this fancy behind waterfront restaurant I didn’t even know existed! We saw green shooting star btw on our way in. The place had $65 steaks. I’m like tf we could’ve went to longhorn or something. Lol. However, the food was underwhelming for the price. He agreed. The salad was bomb though, and the setting made up for it. He paid for the whole thing! But anywho, he was super sweet and never ran out of ammo for a conversation! Complimented me a lot telling me how beautiful I was. We talked about life and goals. He’s a pretty chilled dude. He seems like a guy who cares you know. He explained to me how his long time girlfriend/ex of 4 years cheated and had a baby with another dude. Noting ever since it’s been hard for him to date. You can really see the hurt in his eyes. But I feel like the date went well. He held doors for me and made sure I was always in front of him never the side. Telling me to text him when I get home after after he dropped me off.  I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. He’s super consistent and I like him a lot. Idk where it’s going to go cause he lives a little far but I’m excited. Let’s see how long this lasts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pv209c/first_real_date/
