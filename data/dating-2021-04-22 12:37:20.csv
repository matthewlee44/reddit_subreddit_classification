3,mwae3d,1619113645,I have a girl friend. Met her for the first time on 21st birthday weekend. Many thanks to this sub.,"Many thanks to this sub. I’ve learned a lot about both what to do and what to avoid in relationships. I’ve always wanted to wait for the right person because I want to love the person in the relationship. I love this girl so much. I’m so glad I was patient and found the perfect girl.

I was homeschooled from 4th-12th grade and was pretty isolated. I had a semester at college before covid fucked up everything. I was a wreck and the friends I met at school helped me learn how to be happy. I was so isolated during those years and I feel so happy to have such great friends. I love my gf and she loves me. I feel so loved with her. She is so special.

I first met her in an online economics class around September. It was the class before the first mid term and prof set everyone in groups to solve problems on zoom. Four people in the group but, of course, the other people didn’t do anything. This girl and I solved all the questions super fast and easily. Then we finished the problems and still had 20 minutes to talk. Even though I couldn’t see her, I can tell a lot about how a person looks from a voice and I knew this girl was attractive and wicked smart. Most girls seem to act dumb and I respected that this girl could easily keep up with what we were talking about. She’s studying business with a minor in economics. I’m studying computer engineering. This girl and I are talking about our exploits with CS. And, by the end of those 20 minutes, I felt friendly with her. She gave me her Instagram.

We kept texting. The next month, I met her for the first time though it wasn’t a date. Just got a boba drink and talked for 45 mins basically continuing the conversation from that day on zoom. It’s a three hour drive for me to visit her area but I have college friends there. I figured to bundle everything into a few days. I offered to pay for drinks but she wouldn’t have it and paid. She was very kind and probably figured it cost a fortune to drive there (which it does). Costs me $150 each time.

We kept texting on snap chat for like 6 months. Then, in February, she starts getting flirty and asks me to flirt. I literally have a panic attack. I’m in the car with my bro and a friend doordashing and I start breathing hard and I couldn’t think. I was totally in a panic because I didn’t know how to flirt like that. A few days later, she asks if I like her. I liked her a lot but I took a few minutes to reply to make sure I wouldn’t later regret what I said. I said yes, of course. She said she liked me too and asked to setup a time to meet. I’m so glad she asked because I was so nervous and I’ve been rejected so many times.

I drive down to visit college friends for 21st birthday in March. First thing when I get there is go on a date. She told me the day before to kiss her. This is in San Francisco. She pays for food and then I get in her car and she drives to the marina beach on the north side of the Golden Gate Bridge. I was so nervous when I first met her in the car that I barely said anything. I told her I was nervous and she was so kind. She made it easy for me. At the beach, I start feeling more comfortable with her and we start talking about a lot of things. We talked about school, life, and goals. She is anxious to graduate ASAP and pursue master’s degree. I am further along in my program and want to savor it especially since I transferred so many credits. Internships are difficult/impossible to secure right now with covid. We talk about high school. She let me touch her breast. Then, out of nowhere, she touches me down there over my jeans and it felt amazing. Then she hints for me to kiss her. I admit first that I’ll fuck up because I’d never kissed before. She was totally cool about it and showed me what to do. We kissed. We kept talking about plans for fall and how her classes were going this semester. I took this semester off but she’s taking 22 units. She drove us back to the other side of the bridge to drop me at my car. I forgot where I parked. Parking there is a nightmare especially since I drive a huge car.

Two days later, I take her to dinner and a movie. I paid for the movie tickets and she paid for dinner. We spoke about stuff at dinner. I explained more about the stock trade bot I was working on. The tab somehow ended up being only $13 which is crazy. Restaurant for some reason discounted it almost entirely. It should have been $50. Then, we go to the movie. I had purchased tickets for two seats in the back just in case we wanted to kiss without people giving us looks. I touched her hand the whole time and played with her hair. About halfway through, she places my hand on her tit and let’s me put my hand down her shirt. She starts touching me through my jeans. We kissed. I kept touching her hand for the whole two hour movie. I wore my friend’s jacket and snuck in her favorite candy. Afterward, it’s dark outside and we walk back to my car. Then, out of now where, she asks to give me a hand job. She takes her top mostly off and sits next to me. Neither of us knew what we were doing though I place myself the lesser. She sat on my lap though and started humping my leg. She gave me this look. I could see her pretty well because my eyes had adjusted to the darkness. She gave me this look like she wanted to rip my clothes off. Face smirking. We had to stop because she had a bio homework to finish that night and her mom was texting her to come home.

I drive her back to her car and let her pick a song to play. We are both suckers for Eminem.

A few days later, the last day I could stay before going home, I drove to her house. We drove to the beach and I was touching her hands, hair, and thighs the whole time while she drove. We talked the whole way. At one time, I started fingering her through her pants. That was fun. She kissed me for the first time with tongue one of the times we pulled off the road. It was so amazing. I’ll never forget that moment. I tongue her back following her movements because I’d never done it before. 

Later, we’re back at her house and we decide to try to do some sexual stuff in our cars. We both enjoyed but it was annoying because people were out walking and driving and we were always nervous about getting caught.

Two days ago, I saw her for the first time in almost a month and it was amazing. We talked and touched each other. She got us Taco Bell. I had to go back to meet my parents at IKEA. In the dark parking garage in her car, we kiss. I finger her and this time, I get four fingers in. Her face starts looking like she’ll cry. She touched me through my shorts. She let me suck on her tits and squeeze them. My parents call me twice and I pickup the second time because I want just 5 more minutes but we have dr appts in less than an hour. I almost tell her I love her and then I disguise it saying I love touching her. Then, I slip and I tell her I love her. I kinda stammered it out because I was afraid but desperately wanted to tell her. She says it back. I kiss her one last time and then I open the door.

We text every day. We practice solving leetcode problems together because we both want internships in the next year.

I bought a car a couple weeks ago and it’s scheduled to be delivered today or tomorrow. A 2004 post face lift BMW E46 330Ci manual convertible in silver with an inline 6 3.0L m54 engine. 83k miles on the clock. After I learn to drive stick, I’m driving straight to see her.

5,mwammo,1619114299,I Feel Like a Failure,"For context: I'm a 22 year old man about to graduate from a top university. People think I'm smart, kind, and good-looking. I'm 6ft tall and in athletic shape, women often tell me I'm a gentleman. People assume that I have an active dating life. And yet, I have not even once been on a single date. I had a rough start to dating: my strict parents banned me from dating in high school and I had experiences with sexual harassment from an older woman and a student at my school. Because of this, I was not able to go out with several girls who were interested in me at the time and I later had a negative attitude towards intimacy. By the time I was ready to move on and begin dating, the girls I knew in high school had lost interest in me besides just being friends. I found that I had little in common with the girls at my college, which has a very exclusive culture that largely shuts out transfer students like me. There was one girl I wanted to date, but after getting to know her better I found that I really didn't like talking to her and we had little in common. 

Still, after turning 21 I decided to persevere and pursue girls elsewhere. I'm introverted and was never told by my parents anything about dating (other than sex before marriage is evil and like the worst sin you could ever commit or whatever), so it wasn't until my early twenties that I asked a girl out. After having met a woman on a dating app, I found that I really liked talking to her and after a few days I asked her out. I received no reply. The first time I ever asked a girl out I got ghosted. I moved on and found a girl at my college who I really liked, but just days later the pandemic sent everyone back home. Then I went to online dating again and found a girl I really liked. She and I talked for a while, but when I asked her out (this was a few weeks after we matched), she said ""I'd love to meet with you but I'm concerned about the pandemic....."". Eventually we broke things off and again, I moved on to other people. By this point I was a senior but due to social distancing rules I couldn't really meet new people in person on campus. I tried online dating again and found a girl I liked, but after talking for a few months things just fizzled out between us. I found another girl who I've gotten along with much better and when I asked her out she said yes, but only after the school semester winds down because she's busy (that's like a month away). 

I feel like such a failure. Three years of effort and almost nothing to show for it. (I also tried casual sex rather than typical dating, but also to no avail. Whether it's sites like Tinder or visiting local bars I have found no one who wants to come home with me. Sometimes I couldn't even find a woman at all at the bar, except the bartender, as all the patrons were men). It's depressing honestly. And I really tried: I stay in shape, treat women with respect, put myself out there, but almost no progress since 2018. Maybe things will work out with this latest girl, but I'm uncertain. She might say she just wants to be friends, or give me the ""you're a sweet guy but you're not my type"" talk that I've gotten before. Am I just unattractive? Many women tell me I'm handsome and that I should have no trouble finding a girlfriend, but sadly this isn't the case. I don't know what to think. I look back on high school and practically kick myself for not disobeying my parents and secretly going out with the girls I liked, just because at this point I feel like I've missed out on what it's like to be young and in love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwammo/i_feel_like_a_failure/
6,mwapy5,1619114539,What the hell am I supposed to say to “I want to get to you know better”??,"This has happened to me a few times. Meet a girl online, we get along well, I suggest meeting for a coffee or whatever, and she says something like “yea let’s do that but I want to get to know you better first”.

My response is usually something like “ya no problem. What would you like to know?”. To which I almost always get radio silence.....

Like I understand that in most of those cases when she says “I want to get to know you better” what she really means is “I don’t feel comfortable meeting you yet”. But even then, what the hell am I supposed to say to that comment??

In the most recent case I even followed up 2 days later with:

“Ya i never know what to say to that. I’ve had a colorful life and I’m happy to talk about it,  but I don’t know if me breaking off into monologue would be endearing. So when I say “what would you like to know”, I meant it. Ask me anything :) “

When he dropped me off, said had a great time and that he’d message me.So to my surprise, he never followed up. I was confused b/c things went great and he wasn’t moving for another 8 months. So I assumed he wasn’t interested then deleted him off of Facebook and moved on. 

FAST FORWARD TO FEBRUARY, he randomly added me on Snapchat. We exchanged two snaps that had no substance and I forgot to reply. Then last week I got an **AN UNSOLICITED DICK PIC** that said “maybe this will get you to reply faster.”**  Given the fact that he ghosted after our last interaction I asked why he felt it was appropriate to send that/ why he didn’t follow up. His excuse was that was busy with school and felt it would be awkward to message me weeks later. He said he didn’t know if I’d want to meet up again since he was leaving ...oh and did I wanna meet up after finals to .... *get railed?* “

My favorite color is red, I have a leftward sloping penis and I like music and singing ocasionally, basicly any genre if its a good song and ill give you a recomendation for a great song that just came out, look up One Last Time by TITUS.

My hobbys include speeding, browsing facebook marketplace, and thinking about what i would do if i won the lottery.

So if ur a girl and you live near St. Paul MN, pm me and ill send you a picture of my face and shoulders and if ur lucky you might even catch a glimse of my arm in there too just one though id ont know if you could handle both at one

I am willing to split the prize money if that helps, and heres a great idea we can each take our $5 to goodwill and buy the other something that they have to wear for the rest of the day.

24,mwciop,1619119370,Cant get this off my mind and everyone has a different outlook. I just want the answer. Was she interested or not,"Why was i so sure she was interested when she clearly wasnt


There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She asked about my life i asked about hers. She remembered little things i told her. She is real shy and doesn’t ever start convos on the floor only in the break room. When i go up to her she is glad to talk and usually lingers around me for a while after the convos over. Usually when she talks to me on my break she seems real nervous and cant stop blushing/smiling. Initially i thought she was just being friendly until she mentioned she was single twice the days before valentines day. 

She seemed to genuinely be interested in what i had to say, what i thought, what i was doing, what my goals were, etc. this really hooked me because no one has ever been that interested in me and what i had going on. Male or female.  Let alone a very cute girl. I began to really like her as i could really relate to her and genially just enjoyed talking to her. 

I kept telling my self she was just being nice but all my buddies told me she could be interested so i began to think there was a small chance she was. I thought we could have a good time together as we like the same music and alot of the same things. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i work up the courage and asked for her number and texted her the next day. 

We texted for about 2 days then i asked her on a date. She said she couldnt because of covid and a household family member had health issues. I took this as a rejection and told her i wouldnt talk to her anymore. She then said she really liked our relationship and i didnt have to do that. Why would she say relationship not friendship if she rejected me? I told her i would think about it and she insisted. We talked the next day at work like normal. That night i texted her saying i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. The next time i saw her she looked really sad and almost like she was about to cry. I felt really bad by cutting her off, i realized i should make amends and the next time i saw her i approached and she told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. Now when i see her she still looks sad and takes her breaks byherslef. I dont know what to do as i really enjoy taking to her. Any ideas on what went wrong? Also is there any way i can fix this as i really liked her and enjoyed talking to her. 

I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

The things that point me towards rejection are that she didnt text me back on the third day and she said no to a date with no date as to which she is avalable

Also he can't text me much during the day as he doesn't like to be distributed with his studies so he used to text when he took a break and at night we would usually call for an hour now he doesn't text me at all during the day and calls at 2-3am when he's done studying. He gets sleepy really quickly and wants to go sleep because he prioritize it. Yesterday I was missing him a bit more then usual as we only see each other once a week and asked him to stay 5 more minutes and he started saying I knew how important sleep was to him at which I got mad because this has happened before and last time I told him that small things like holding hands and him staying on call make me feel happy because I feel like he cares but he keeps saying I'm trying to force him to do something that he doesn't want.

 So I'm really torn about what to do as I know he loves me but I just don't feel his love anymore and I feel like I'm making him choose between his studies and me which I don't want to do.

26,mwcny2,1619119772,Break Up over Depression,"Hi All,
 
Your advice is much needed. I (27F) have been dating this divorced (29M) for some time now. He’s recently divorced with two small kids and has custody of them 2 days out of the week. He also lost his dad last year and is coming up on his death anniversary in the next two weeks. 

He has gone through mental health issues in the past, is on meds but seems like he is still having trouble dealing with his emotions. 

Him and his ex wife have a bad relationship. A few days ago, he showed up to her house, uninvited, demanding that she speak to him in regards to the kids. She called the authorities and now got a restraining order on him. 

He lost his shit the day he got the restraining order and completely shut down. Had to leave work and hang out with his mom to cope with his emotions. 

Now, she does not deem him safe to be around the kids so he has to have limited, supervised visits with them until the court date. 

Then, a day ago, he told me he has a domestic violence case on him that was “dismissed” but it’s going to be finalized at the end of this month. 

Since then, he’s completely shut down. Become very monotone and has had issues dealing with his emotions. 

This morning, he texted me saying he emotionally isn’t there right now and doesn’t think he should be with anyone right now and I wished him the best and left it at that.

And last year I decided to get out and start dating again  yet it feels so hard not only to attract a woman these days but just to keep her attention, I'm not even sure what I'm doing wrong but I just cant seem to find success in dating

At this point I'm about go say screw it and just become a forest hermit. Because I feel like no matter what I'm never going to be enough for anyone

An example was I was talking to this girl a few months ago she was still living with her parents, no job, didnt go to school but she was cute and we got along really well so I didn't mind. So we go out on our first date and after about 20 minutes she asks me how much I made, it was a weird question but I answered honestly and she responded with ""oh sorry, we cant be together if you make less than 6 figures"" then stood up, and walked out.

Sex ends when the jerk nuts (usually in 5min or less), there is no reciprocity, no affection, no proper foreplay and afterplay. Everything is a rush for him to nut treating the girl like a huge blow-up sex doll.

Having a BF or husbands seems more like a compromise than anything else, because it's what society, friends and family expect them to and not to feel excluded.

Generally straight girls are more comfortable and at ease around other girls and things like ladies' night out, shopping and women only activities.

Just remarks like 'oh she recently became single? I might have a chance then' or 'wow she's cute, I would've flirted with her if I didn't already have a relationship with you'.

It might depend on which stage your relationship is in with someone, It might depend on the intentions you mean by saying this as an actual joke or not but it always bugged me.

My way of thinking is that if you truely like someone whom you have a relationship with, why make that other person feel any less by saying such things?

Even if you don't have a relationship yet with someone but you're aware of the other person his or her feelings, saying such things in the presence of said person is off putting in my opinion. It personally always puts me in a bad mood if it happens to me and honestly even lose a bit of interest.

47,mwfck6,1619126994,Need advice processing a potential ghosting/mixed feelings scenario,"So I (M26) met this girl (F29) off Tinder nearly 2 months ago. We hit it off great, sex was great, hung out a few times, texted 5-6 days a week, spoke on the phone 2-3 times a week, she'd send me selfies and other pics all the time. Thought it was going great, and while we never had any strict conversations, I felt it was agreed that we had some interest in each other and both wanted something casual but consistent. Or so I thought. 

After maybe 3.5 weeks of knowing each other, she ghosted my plans to hang out, and texted back the next day saying she's going through a really rough depressive episode and while she still wanted to talk and get to know me further, she didn't want to meet up for the time being and wanted to take a little time to focus on herself. We continued talking 4-5 days a week (she initiated convos 75% of time but I would not say it was for lack of me reaching out, she would always just beat me to the first text), but I noticed over time the conversations getting progressively less enthusiastic and substantive. She would still tell me that she missed me, wanted to be in my arms, etc, (which I reciprocated) but the convos were almost like pulling teeth sometimes. I would write good responses, often times trying help her feel better, only for me to get 2 word answers a lot of the time. I noticed multiple times she updated her Tinder profile, which I somewhat minded but also totally understood as we weren't dating. 

As time wore on, she started texting less and I started texting her more, but I found that she would start to blow off my texts, responding days later. I got the vibe that she wasn't interested anymore, so I asked her what she was feeling, while also slightly calling her out for ignoring my texts. She said she was still interested but was still not feeling well mentally, so I decided to give her some space. 

Since then, we have barely talked, maybe 2 times a week if that, always me initiating. The second to last time we spoke, she indicated that she was interested in hanging out again. Last night, I asked her to hang out, and she blew my message off completely. At this point, I haven't seen her in person for just over 5 weeks.

I understand she's not feeling well, but I also feel that the ignoring texts thing is kind of rude, especially when she's led me to believe that she wants to see me/misses me/etc. She follows me on social media and views all my stories, and I can see that she is occasionally out with friends and whatnot. 

Part of me thinks I am waaaaay overthinking this and potentially being a bit possessive/too forward (especially as I just type this out), but I also kind of feel like I'm being given the runaround and being lead on. It's particularly strange for me, because I never feel this way about girls, I'd like to think I'm usually quite chill. For me to get all upset and anxious about this makes me feel like I may have more feelings for this girl that I thought, and I may have played my hand too early and scared her off.

49,mwfdce,1619127050,How to not come across as too alpha (F27),"So I’ve been talking to this guy (M29) for a few months and need advice on how to take it to the next level without coming across as too demanding, bossy or alpha. 

Backstory: I’ve known this guy for a long time (went to the same school together) but was out of contact with him for many years. I always liked him and had a feeling he used to like me too. So, I said why not and reached out to him. To my surprise, he responded warmly. And we got talking. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve gone out of my way to reach out to him. I did a few times back when we were in school. Although, at the time, my intentions weren’t romantic, I just missed him and wanted to catch up. But we never dated and our conversations never went anywhere. 

This time, however, we’re talking a lot. We’ve been texting for three months now. There’s a little bit of harmless flirting, but nothing blatant or sexual. 

I definitely want to explore the possibility of a romantic partnership. But he’s not taking charge. Or, he’s going at it at a much slower pace than I’m normally used to. Usually guys who want to date me will jump on the opportunity and we’d already have gone on a couple of dates by now. 

But I haven’t even met up with him yet. We’ve made vague plans to meet in a few months (he’s out of town at the moment) and that’s pretty’s much it. Otherwise, he is direct, open and honest in communicating with me. It’s clear to me that he’s interested, but is still testing the waters with me. 

He doesn’t have a lot of dating experience. He’s super intelligent and bright. I find that very sexy. So I consider him way out of my league. However, my friends have told me that I’m the one who’s out of his league in the looks department. I sometimes mistake his ‘cautious’ nature of holding back and not courting me as a sign that he’s not interested. I feel insecure staying in this weird lukewarm state. But at the same time, I don’t want to scare him off by being too direct and alpha by straight out telling him to ask me out already, if he wants to date me.

So, to all the naysayers, hear me out, I hate guys that creep on girls at the gym and I’m pretty certain I’ve hit most all green flags that indicate she’s interested:

-we’ve been going to the same gym for a few months and always share a ton of eye contact, often lingering eye contact

-often we we have lingering eye contact she will smile

-after a few days of seeing her smile after making eye contact I broke the ice and talked to her about some generic topic and exchanged names

-the next time we saw each other she smiled and waved, I think she wanted me to come up to talk to her again, but I was finishing up my workout and needed to get going, so I just returned the wave

-the next time I saw her after that she moved to a machine near me and after a while initiated conversation, we chatted for five minutes or so before parting ways for the rest of our workout 

I think the next logical step is to ask for her number, if she’d like to hang out some time, but I don’t want to come off as a creepy guy looking to pick up girls at the gym. My gut tells me she’s interested, really based a lot on the way she looks at me, but it’s hard to determine if she’s just being friendly.

54,mwgdou,1619129854,I don’t understand what’s going on my flatmate/housemate,"My flatmate and I have always been really good mates but in February time we started spending even more time together and I noticed he was giving me more attention that usual. We would go to the library together, watch Netflix together etc. And then over a month ago our flat hosted drinks and I got really drunk and he came into my room and then we almost got together. After that we started having some ‘sleepovers’ together where we cuddle and sleep basically (mostly after we had drinks). Then right before the holidays things escalated and we almost had sex.
I got with him again after the Easter holidays last Friday and we almost had sex again and i slept with him the entire night. Ever since then I feel as if he has been completely avoiding me as we usually spend a lot of time together in the flat along with my other flatmate. Things are always a bit awkward after we get together but now I just feel that I have done something wrong or he hates me or something.
To make matters worse he went on a date on Tuesday just a few days after we got together. I know he is single and can do whatever he wants but I don’t understand why he would do that so soon after we got together? I felt so jealous and had to leave the flat because it hurt me so much He went on a date before but that was literally the day after that i went on a date so I didn’t think it mattered too much.

I would hate to think that I make him feel so awkward that he can’t even see me. 
To make matters I think my feelings are getting kind of intense as I know him well as a person and I have no idea how to handle it.

55,mwgjpv,1619130345,"I met this girl from a dating app, and we can't meet irl anytime soon.. yet I'm finding myself liking her","Not going to keep this post up too long, because I know she uses reddit.

Basically, she lives at home with controlling/homophobic parents, so we cant meet irl for awhile (we're both girls) as she doesn't have a license yet and lives an hour and a half away. And the only way for us to meet is if I drove all the way to her campus, which I definitely couldn't do often because of all the gas I'd be using, and if we were in a relationship id need more from a partner - like being able to do other activities with them or spend time alone together. That probably wouldn't be possible for a long time. 

Another thing is she doesn't text me until like 10pm anymore.. we used to text throughout the day. But now she texts me every night between 10:00-10:30, and once I respond she reads it immediately and we end up texting back and forth until she goes to bed. Not sure why she only texts me after that time and when I brought it up she avoided really commenting on it. Though I do know she avoids texting me around her parents because apparently then they get really nosy. But I find myself wish I could talk to her more. 

But the thing is.. we're eerily similar, extremely compatible as far as values, worldviews, likes and dislikes, what we want in a relationship, etc. I've never met a girl that I click with like that or that I'm so similar to, let alone seem compatible with - gay and bi women are uncommon as is let alone all of that so this is a rare find. 

Should I cut my losses and try not let myself develop feelings? Or should I just see where it goes and still be open to dating someday if it becomes possible and we're both interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwgjpv/i_met_this_girl_from_a_dating_app_and_we_cant/
56,mwgqb5,1619130877,I (31M) confused,"Hi there,

I’ve just come out of a serious relationship and rejoined the dating apps. I’ve matched with a few girls, which has been good, and getting back into the swing of things.

I matched with someone (29F) who is totally my type. We’ve texted a lot and then she went radio silent for a week, which I assumed she wasn’t interested anymore. She came back suddenly saying she got swamped with work and invited me to an impromptu date the next day which went super well. We had fun, ended up kissing at the end, and planned another date a week later, this upcoming Thursday.

We’ve texted a little, but she’s been hard to reach. Usually in this case I’d assume she’s not interested, but I also know she’s got a lot going on in her life (she works and is doing a law degree). 

It’s been different than what I’m used to, as I’m usually texting a lot to build an emotional connection between dates, but find there’s not much texting. Had anyone dealt with something like this? I like her, but also want to make sure I’m not just being played as an option.

She asked if I was talking to any other girls and I told her that I do find her attractive and I am also talking with other women, she was mad at me about this because she wanted me to only focus on her so she was angry and jealous and so I felt really bad about that and a lot of shame. I snap chatted her later and she said it's gonna be hard to hang out as friends since she has feelings and I apologized to her for making her feel that way and I told her that I would stop talking to other women (which i did) and she said she would stop talking to other men too. The next day we hung out again online and we were just hanging out and talking, this time the conversation kind of died down near the end this time and asked if she could leave if I didn't mind and I told her I didn't and we left the call. But then the next day she snapchatted me and asked to talk and I said yeah and when we met she basically said she is not ready for a relationship and has been talking with God about it and would like to be friends-friends. I said if that's what she wants and shes not ready then I will be friends with her but I still think she has feelings because it's only been two days since she admitted feelings for me and seemed so eager to jump into a relationship with each other which was really flattering tbh, and she even snap chatted me the next day after that. She said she's still down to hang out and watch movies together and we're gonna watch a movie this weekend, she also said she was gonna visit a place near me and that we would go get coffee together I guess as friends.

My whole life I’ve been weird about relationships. It’s crazy the shit my brain does to keep me out of getting into a relationship. I think one of the main things is I feel constrained really easily like I no longer have my freedom. Even though that doesn’t make sense cause I don’t even let myself get close enough to a guy where that situation can actually pan out. It’s just how I feel even though that’s not the reality. 

I’m talking to this guy and I’m really trying to make myself push through every time I want to back out, I remind myself that this is a pattern and to break the pattern (learned this in therapy). 

Any way, my new thing right now is when I’m looking at him, he seems kind of ugly. I used to think he was cute and very handsome... suddenly I look at him and he’s not cute to me. He has not done a single thing wrong either, he’a been great.

When we met for the first time, I’ll be honest he did not stand out to me per se. I saw him for the second time around campus after he came up to me and I have no idea why but something changed. After that I decided to reach out to him since we did share quite a few mutual friends and sold him a ticket to an event I was hosting. Our interaction at the event was good in my opinion I approached him as he arrived and bought him a drink. Throughout the night he would come up to me and check up on me. We went outside and had a pretty lengthy conversation at one point maybe about 20min to 30min. And in that conversation he did mention that he used to be even more shy than he is now when he was in high school and that social scenes sometimes overwhelm him. 

After the event about a week later I asked his friends who I’m also close friends with whether he is single and he asked if Im interested well basically he told me that he’s “sending this straight to the group chat” (their boys group chat) 

After that we haven’t spoken. We don’t talk online nor do we message and it’s killing me because he is such a great guy and I would love to see where this goes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwhdas/im_never_interested_in_anyone_but_now_on_the_rare/

74,mwi29h,1619134848,Weird situation with someone from high school (now junior in college),"As I mentioned, this is a weird situation and I'd appreciate advice. I tend to lack social awareness when it comes to women (I'm getting better, but went to an all-male high school and was relatively introverted besides theater, so it's taking time)

A girl I knew in high school through mutual friends and theater ended up going to the same university with me. We weren't really close in high school and she was dating someone else the majority of the time. In October of our junior year (2020), we match on Tinder. I was going through stuff in life and didn't feel like messaging, as I know some people just swipe on people they know.

In September (our junior year), she ""drunk texts"" me while out at a restaurant with her sorority sisters (small school sorority, not huge partiers) and is flirting a lot (one of the parts of the conversation being: me: ""What's your favorite place to drink"", her: ""Your apartment ;)""). I flirted back, but I wasn't really down to meet up with her while she was likely drunk (can't be 100% sure, but was pretty sure she was).

I had to ask her about an upcoming event she was helping with the next time I texted her, so I didn't really follow up on that as I assumed most people are embarrassed by drunk texts. Didn't get a response.

A month later, we match on Bumble and the match stayed up for 48 hours with no messages. Between the drunk text and this point, her roommate followed/added me on multiple areas of social media and commented on some of my posts. I invited her out and heard nothing back, so I moved on.

Last week (6 months later), we matched on Bumble again (I had found a gf in December, but broke things off about a month ago and had deleted my Bumble in the meantime).

I invited her to my fraternity's semiformal because she is a fun person to be around and I'm relatively interested - got a really quick response, but she already had plans that weekend (legitimate plans - she detailed exactly what they were).

My questions are:

Am I reading far too much into this? Should I just straight-up ask her if she's actually interested considering we've matched 3 times on dating apps so far? I'd have no problem just being friends with her, but she seems to have similar interests to me and I'd like a chance to get to know her better. If I should ask (or just ask her out), what's a way of doing so given the situation that won't be weird given that I can't do so in-person (I rarely saw her on campus pre-COVID - with COVID, I like won't see her until sometime in the Fall).

TLDR; Bizarre situation regarding matching 3 times on dating apps with no messages, receiving a drunk text, roommate following me on social media, and my awkwardness/lack of social awareness/anxiety.

but pleaded with me to stick around; he dumped me the night before he left the country, then said he wanted to continue to see me when he got back. He guilted me into giving him and hug and kiss before he left then wouldn’t stop messaging me afterwards. 

It’s been four months, he isn’t back but continues to contact me. I’m angry with myself, because after all this I still have strong feelings for this guy.

When it comes to dating I am a late bloomer. My friends are now married and pumping kids out. 

So they can't be my wingmen and go out with them. Nor do they know single women.

OLD doesn't work, so I am trying to figure out steps to improve my social life to meet new people/ women. I am VERY much NOT a bar guy. I built my own gym, do lots DIY at home, (Almost paid off, SO excited)! I do Paintball, Game, Fireworks...

87,mwj3sm,1619138185,Why can’t people just be honest and just admit they’re not interested?,"I (26F) matched with someone (31M) one month ago and started out with the what are you looking for conversation. To which we both said ideally a relationship but we’ll see what happens. I made it pretty clear I’m not here to waste anyone’s time and wouldn’t want my time to be wasted though if it was clear things weren’t going to work out, and he seemed to agree. 

Things started out fine, we’d chat decent amounts everyday, and recently he’s started to not respond at all. For days at a time. I did say it seemed like he wasn’t very interested and that I’ll take the hint to which he said he was just busy and having trouble sleeping. And then blamed it on “‘mild depression” (he’s a psychiatrist, and I’m not, so who am I to question him). 

Honestly it seems pretty BS-y to me (maybe I lack empathy?) and frankly I would just like him to be honest and say yup, not interested, ok thanks. I mean we’ve had this conversation literally day 1 into talking. He knows I’d rather not waste time and energy on something that’s not working out. 

At the same time I’m aware dating can be tiring and mental health fluctuates and would hate to be someone who writes someone off for lack of initiative when they’re going through a bit of a slump. 

But I have self-image problems and tend to base my self-value on how others treat me. And I’d really rather not spiral into self-hatred because this 31 year old man can’t rip the bandaid off.

88,mwjcen,1619138968,I’m ALWAYS attached to guys I hookup with,"I had my first hookup when I was 16. I’m 22F now. All these years I’ve been running from the truth which is that I hookup with guys in the hopes that they will catch feelings for me too.

I’ve hooked up with four guys so far, only one of them being a boyfriend. The others were guys I was secretly in love with but pretended I had zero feelings for them. Also, I can’t bring myself to doing anything physical with someone I don’t have feelings for.

I pretended it was all harmless “fun”. And although there is some element of truth there, all three of these guys had a strong emotional hold over me. But when things went south, it completely destroyed me. 

The most recent one messed me up pretty badly because he abused me during the hookup. This sort of jolted me awake into realising that I am actually a really sensitive and vulnerable person. I can’t just keep burying my feelings and pretending that they don’t exist for the sake of some “fun”. 

For me all of this comes with a cost. A huge toll on my mental health. I don’t think I’ll be doing casual hookups anymore. I am done disrespecting and lying to myself like that. The next time I get physical with anyone it will be a committed and loving relationship because that will be the man who deserves me.

I'm 30  fucking years old and never had sex with a  woman.

This  fact permeates deeply  into all aspects of my life, I cannot believe I  am 30 years old and  still have not had sex, it is honestly haunting and  really torments me  to the point it is negatively impacting my  life/mental health.

I  feel as if,  until I have sex, I will be insecure and down on myself.  How can I  shake myself from this feeling and become more confident?

99,mwkmoh,1619143157,I want the relationship I’m in now to be the healthiest/most successful so far but I have trust issues,"So I (18f) have a very frustrating history with dating. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic, I love thinking about dating and the future and sharing experiences with someone who I care about and who cares about me. I don’t think I’m a person who needs someone else in order to be happy, but I do have lots of fun when I am with someone. The older I’ve gotten the more I realized how hard relationships actually are. I believe my experiences with dating have taught me a lot, but I also believe they are causing me to be anxious about almost every aspect of the current relationship I’m in. 

For some context, I met my current boyfriend (18m) on Tinder around a week and a half ago. We matched and hit it off immediately. He asked me to be his girlfriend on the third date, and we’ve been seeing each other every other day consistently since last Tuesday. We always have so much fun together and I feel like I can be completely myself when I’m around him. We can talk about anything and open up to each other and its great. 

The problem that I’ve been experiencing rcenrly is extreme paranoia and anxiety that he’s going to leave. Whether that means he’s going to completely ghost me or decide he doesn’t like me anymore and break up with me within the next month. It sounds irrational, especially with how well he’s been treating me (texting me every morning and night, telling me when he can’t talk for longer periods of time, expressing his admiration and communicating with me about everything going on in his life with his ex/family) and I can’t help but think its because of the way I’ve been treated for the past 3~ years. 

My last two relationships I was in ended very soon and abruptly. They were both very wishy-washy when it came to wanting to commit to me. My most recent ex also made the mistake of telling me he loved me as soon as we decided to be partners and it had only been about the second date. We got in the routine of saying this to each other and he broke up with me around a month later and said “I love you but I’m not in love with you.” This broke me and my perception of love and I feel very sensitive when it comes to that word. I also had a few encounters recently with men on Tinder who will talk to me for a few days (some who will even come to see me) and then completely ghost me out of no where. 

I sincerely don’t think my boyfriend will do that to me, he has been nothing but sweet and trust worthy and we take turns driving and hour to see each other every other day or so. His last relationship was 7 months and he also met her on Tinder, he told me had the intention of being in a relationship and not to just use it as a hookup app, which I was honestly thrilled to find out. We are going to college in the same town next fall and things look to be really bright. How can I overcome my fear of being abandoned and just enjoy the time I have with him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwkmoh/i_want_the_relationship_im_in_now_to_be_the/
