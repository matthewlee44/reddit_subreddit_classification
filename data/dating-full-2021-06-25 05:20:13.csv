We met unexpectedly at a friends wedding, he asked me to be his girlfriend in a week, we both agreed that finding each other was meant to be, “when you know you know”. We were everything we both were looking for and wanted, the timing was right, we had everything in common. He said I love you early on and we said it every day. Things were going great, I met his family 2 weeks ago. His mom said I made him so shoot and hugged me! I met both his kids twice, he was always giving and kind and said I was the best person that came into his life as I said/did the same. I thought wow, I finally found the love of my life. 

He got a bit quieter since meeting his family, but still called and texted daily. I just visited him and he was being slightly distant but not a whole lot. I asked him what was wrong and he said he has been stressed but didn’t want to talk much. He said he was stressing about ex/kid/legal stuff, work stuff, money issues. I got more concerned and was trying to be supportive but he wasn’t giving me much info at all. I was having anxiety and asked him to call. He started to blow up at me and then said he needed space and hung out on me. I texted and called and was confused. He sent me another vague message that he needed space and don’t want to talk. This gave me more anxiety so I texted and called more freaking out. He stopped reading my messages. I started to get into hyperventilating and panic attack. I told him I wasn’t okay and needed him, he said nothing. I got 3 hours of sleep. I sent him a text at 11:30am that was kind and understanding but asked him to please reach out because I was worried. Overall he didn’t answer for 18 hours since last night. Hours later he calls, he says nothing except I made things worse and he needs to be alone right now. I told him that I almost went to the hospital for passing out from hyperventilating and he said nothing. I cried and pleaded that we could have a middle ground and find a solution. He hung up. 

I truly don’t understand how people can be so heartless. Everything was going great. I feel there’s more he didn’t tell me and kept hidden. I feel he was no different than any jerk. He manipulated and used me. Dropped me off like garbage. I’m so devastated, I feel completely heart broken. He already changed his FB relationship status, deleted me off Xbox and Snapchat. I feel he lied about everything idk what was even true or real. He also owes me $525 for a TV he picked up for me to Mount and he won’t reply to my messages, that fraud it’s not his money!

here’s the story:

as of the past two weeks, I’ve been hanging out with this beautiful girl from work. We started talking 2 weeks ago because i overheard a coworker say she thought i was attractive, and since i already interested in her for her looks, i went and asked for her number after having a handful of flirty conversations. she didnt give me her number, but she gave me her instagram and we followed each other. thought i got rejected but boy was i wrong. 


fast forward 3 days, ( keep in mind we’ve been talking and flirting at work each day on our hour long breaks ) she offers to drive me home. we have great deep conversations on this ride about our experiences at work. she asked about the videography business i run, and i told her stories about some of my experiences on set. she seemed very interested in my life and my past. 



2 days later, she asks me to go on a run with her to target. i went, cause i thought this was her way of shooting her shot with me. it totally was, as after the run we made plans to go to the movies before we parted ways. but while we were in the car, someone called her; and now shes driving me home instead of the movies. she said she’d reschedule. 

thought i got stood up, but when she got to the house; she saw my cat in my window.


she loves cats. so she asked if she could come inside and pet her. 

shes comes in my living room, and starts playing with the cats. at this point i went and got her a water, and then before you know it she asked for a tour of my house after a few minutes with the cat. 

once we got to my bedroom/work studio part of the tour, she jumped on the bed and turned on the tv. i asked her what she was doing, and she said she canceled her plans to go party in manhattan for me ( we are based in NYC ) 
and that we should watch a movie. i was hype. 

anyway, fast forward later night, we cuddled and touched each other ( consensual of course ); but we didnt make out because she said she only feels comfortable kissing someone she loves. 

we had a deep convo about our feelings and our intentions for each other, and were completely transparent with one another. i love that about us, water couldnt be more transparent. its weird to me because initially she didnt want to tell me anything. 

fast forward the next 3 days, we’ve hung out every day after work and on our meals at work. we’re very fond of each other, and we’ve teased each other a whole bunch. there was a ton of built up sexual tension between us. 
anyway, after we hung out i even let her tag along for my long video editing sessions after my day job. she loves back seat editing lol. 

after 2 hours though, she pulled me out of my work chair and pulled me onto the bed. she started kissing my cheek and told me i should lay down with her and take a break. i listened and we cuddled and watched scary movies until 3 in the morning. during this, she started touching me and i returned the favor. she also asked how many girls ive been with in this time, and asked alot about my love life. we bonded over our past traumatic relationships. 

she also met my sister , who lives with me. my sister told me that she asked alot about me when they spoke. 

the next day, i was up late working hard to finish a project because the deadline for a client was approaching. she came over that night and supported me the whole night, making food with me, making sure i ate, stayed hydrated, and happy. we watched movies while i edited, and then after i was finished we layed down together. at this point, we both wanted each other so bad, and got down to business. we had sex for the next hour, and she spent the night until she had a shift in the morning. she went on and on about how great my head game was, and i thought it was hilarious because that was my first time ever eating a girl out. the sex was amazing, passionate, and rough. better than anything ive ever experienced with my exes. she felt similar, as she told me that when i walked her to her car in the morning. she kissed me goodbye, and i contemplated what she said about “kissing someone you love”. 

we had raw sex, and so, she was obviously nervous about pregnancy since she was ovulating. i personally knew i didnt cum inside her, however i wasnt taking any chances and she was nervous, i wanted to put her at ease since i care for her so dearly already. so i sent her 50$ without hesitation. she said that was a test to see the type of man i really am, and i passed. she kisses me again at this point.  

she calls me while shes at work to tell me shes getting birth control, which i found amusing. 

2 days later, she comes over again after work. we go straight to the bedroom, and have 3 back to back rounds of passionate sex. at this point, we’re being extremely rough with each other in the bedroom. shes leaving cuts on my back, and im leaving hickies on her breasts. i should also note that we’re now kissing regularly this time around. making out passionately every chance the sex position offered the opportunity. she spends the night once again, and she wakes up early in the morning to me working on a project while on the phone with another client. she kisses me and swears i’l make it because of my killer work ethic. i muted the phone, waited for her to leave the room; and nearly teared up because she made me so happy. 

she made me breakfast, and then we went to the gym together since it was both our days off from work. i gave her the best workout of her life at the gym, and i power lifted the whole time to impress her. it worked, as we had shower sex when we got home LOL. 

she went home this day because she felt sick, i took care of her the best i could. when i walked her to her car that day, she seemed upset and didnt want to kiss me goodbye. i was fine with this however, and just told her that if she needed to talk that i was always there for her; and that she can confide in me. she told me shes not ready to open up about this issue yet. i told her thats fine, take your time, and then kissed her on the forehead and sent her off. 

she calls me hours later on instagram, ( because for whatever reason, she still doesnt want to give me her phone number..? even though we’ve had sex so many times? i dont get it, but i respect boundaries so if this is one shes set for me for now, im fine with that )

on this call she tells me im not over my ex, because i spoke about her alot the day prior. i could tell thats why she was upset. i understood, and put my heart on my sleeve for her. ( i was in an all around abusive 6 year relationship, and while it was terrible its made me a stronger man mentally and emotionally. ) and i explained that to her. i told her the only reason why i bring my ex up, is because that relationship turned me into the strong and transparent person i am today. she told me to put my ex in my past and focus on her, and i giggled. we talked on the instagram video call for the next 3 hours, and then she hung up abruptly. i texted her to see if she was okay, but she didnt answer until the next day. 

at this point, ( the end of the second week) we’ve hung out every day this week. ( i must highlight that we’ve been having sex every day this week, 2-5 times a day. )
however yesterday she went through my phone and found old texts with a girl i spoke to a month prior. it was nothing nearly as serious as what i feel for this girl, and i was actually planning on putting the other girl down easy. she was upset initially but i told her if she wants to be exclusive with me she can be. she giggled. we went on to cuddle, but she went through my phone again when i went to go make her something to eat, and she said i must be hiding something. i let her go through my phone even though it gave me so much anxiety ( mainly because nobody but me is allowed on my phone, so i never delete any messages ever with anybody unless im on bad terms with them ). she went through for 45 minutes. she found alot of diary entries in my notes, and asked for permission to read them. i told her my thoughts are yours, and some of the things she read made her cry. she went on to kiss me and we cuddled for the rest of the night until she had to leave for work at 4am. 

now the final day (today): she came over after work and watched me edit again. she stayed over the whole day, and we spent it editing, making love, and watching scary movies. she made alot of jokes about me being her girlfriend. i tried to go through her and unlock it on her face id as a joke since she went through mine, and she unlocked it right away and gave it to me. she said she doesnt delete messages either, and that i’l be upset about the things shes said to other guys in the past. 

i told her i believed her, and that it was just a joke. i kind of wanted to look through it to see if it was a lie and if she was talking to other guys, but i thought about the fact that we are not actually together and that thats kind of a toxic behavior ( even though she did it to me ) so i chose not to. 

she also came over today from 11am and left at 10pm by the way. 

at this point now that you guys are up to speed, i want to know what some of you think. i did keep out some things like the specifics of our deep conversations, but they trust that they were very thoughtful and heartfelt conversations. 

do you think i should ask her to be my girlfriend? i feel like me and her click so well, and we’re both very transparent about our feelings which i love. since shes older than me shes so mature, and im quite mature for my age so i feel like we match up nicely in that department. our sex is fantastic, we both finish every single time. i honestly work like an open book for her, so i know im not questioning anything on my end. i want her to be mine. however, she still hasnt given me her number yet. i feel like thats fishy. like, we’ve been having sex multiple times every day for a week. how can i not get your number still? i dont know. 
she also seems to love to test me, meaning test my interest in her, my morals (evident in the plan b thing ), and how loyal im willing to be. id be lying if these tests didnt strike anxiety into me, as i feel like i could lose her if i mess up. but the reward is so fantastic that i love it haha.

now the final day (today): she came over after work and watched me edit again. she stayed over the whole day, and we spent it editing, making love, and watching scary movies. she made alot of jokes about me being her girlfriend. i tried to go through her and unlock it on her face id as a joke since she went through mine, and she unlocked it right away and gave it to me. she said she doesnt delete messages either, and that i’l be upset about the things shes said to other guys in the past. 

i told her i believed her, and that it was just a joke. i kind of wanted to look through it to see if it was a lie and if she was talking to other guys, but i thought about the fact that we are not actually together and that thats kind of a toxic behavior ( even though she did it to me ) so i chose not to. 

she also came over today from 11am and left at 10pm by the way. 

at this point now that you guys are up to speed, i want to know what some of you think. i did keep out some things like the specifics of our deep conversations, but they trust that they were very thoughtful and heartfelt conversations. 

do you think i should ask her to be my girlfriend? i feel like me and her click so well, and we’re both very transparent about our feelings which i love. since shes older than me shes so mature, and im quite mature for my age so i feel like we match up nicely in that department. our sex is fantastic, we both finish every single time. i honestly work like an open book for her, so i know im not questioning anything on my end. i want her to be mine. however, she still hasnt given me her number yet. i feel like thats fishy. like, we’ve been having sex multiple times every day for a week. how can i not get your number still? i dont know. 
she also seems to love to test me, meaning test my interest in her, my morals (evident in the plan b thing ), and how loyal im willing to be. id be lying if these tests didnt strike anxiety into me, as i feel like i could lose her if i mess up. but the reward is so fantastic that i love it haha.

For the past couple of months I have been trying to say hi to my crush at his work at the local grocery store. I was nervous so my friend helped me send a message over Facebook Messenger asking if I saw him at the store (it was during COVID when everyone still had to wear masks). Had a short convo for about 3 days (most of it was about make and how he’d it was to tell who was who and about batman) . 

Then one night while drinking my friend suggests that I ask him (my crush) if he knows him (my friend) as he said that they were cousins. It was in a way a strategy to try to talks to him I guess. He replied yes why and I said how sorry my friend got ahold of my phone and how he wanted to say hi. 

A couple of months later my crush shows up on my quick add on Snapchat and I think screw it and added him. Nothing happened for a week and I was discouraged. Then after about 2 weeks toy surprise he adds me back! I was ecstatic. I tried commenting on his story (of him being at the basketball stadium) about the state basketball team abut how maybe they won’t choke this year. We exchanged a couple of sentences and then I’m left on read. A couple days later I sent hi how are you and he responded right away. He said good hbu and I said good except for my laundry staring me down. He opens it the next day (the messages were  sent the night before) and doesn’t say anything else. He also views my stories and stuff. Augh! It’s driving me crazy. He’s probably not into me as he doesn’t really respond, but then why add me on Snapchat in the first place and it’s not like he unadded me after that either. It is very frustrating especially since I have liked him for a long time.

I’m a romantically inclined 28 year old man. I’ve had a string of short term relationships over the last year. I’ve had sex with more women in 2021 than in the rest of my life put together, and I’ve turned down more women in the past two weeks than in my first 27 years. And I’m so lonely. Having casual sex feels great! But I just found myself saying “I love you” to my roommate’s dog because 1. She’s lovable as hell, and 2. I don’t have anyone else I can say it to. 

I started out by searching for a serious relationship, but over the past 2 years, I’ve only dated 3 girls who even indicated long term interest in being my gf. The rest were interested solely in casual so I began accepting casual sex on the theory that it might one day turn into something more. And the belief that some casual sex is better than no committed sex. Plus I’m getting better at it. 

Now I’m in the position of having two sexual partners who were up front with me that they wouldn’t be monogamous with me and expected me to behave the same. I’m enjoying them both and would happily settle down into a more traditional relationship with either, but they’re not interested. One left my house the other day saying “happy tindering!”

I just want to tell her I love her. It’s not even true just yet, but it could be true if both of us wanted it to be!

So I went on a date a couple weeks ago with a guy, I’m 22 and he’s the same age. We really hit it off, he’s studying law, has a successful job and he’s extremely good looking and just generally ticked all the boxes for me. 

We went out for drinks around 6pm and didn’t finish at the bar until 2am, we were talking all night. He was asking lots of questions about me and wanted to know what happened in my last relationship, he kept wanting me to go into detail, which was fine. 

He started showing me photos of his family, and asked to see photos of mine. He wanted to know what my long term goals were for my career and I said I’d probably like to set myself up by investing in property and he replied “another way to set yourself up for life would be to marry rich” and he started pointing at himself and then added “I’d make sure you had nothing to worry about financially” and winked. He kept bringing up the “we should just get married already” thing and by the end of the night he even went as far to say TWICE that he thinks he knows what type of engagement ring I would like. 

On the date he found any excuse to compliment me, touch my hands or be close to me throughout the night. He even took charge as I told him I was quite indecisive with picking a drink and he asked if I had any allergies or foods that I didn’t like, jumped up without hesitation and said he would sort out the drinks. (The drink he picked was delicious btw) 

Through discussion we found I had a lot in common with his mother, looking after ourselves in the same way and that me and the guy also both loved to cook which we agreed we should have a cook off. 

He asked me what i thought my best quality was and I said my independence he replied “that ticks off the box for me” I asked him his and he said he was quite a chilled out person. He then asked what I thought my negative quality was and I said “I probably am too loud sometimes” he laughed and said “well I’m abit deaf so that’s not so much a bad quality to me” we both laughed at the fact that we both have bad hearing. 

Throughout the entire night he said he was having “so much fun” with a lot of excitement in his words. 

By the end of the night he started getting really flirty and asked if he could kiss me (this being in a really busy bar) I accepted and we kissed multiple times. He complimented my kissing and said he could get used to it as he hasn’t met many good kissers.

After abit I started to yawn and so did he as it was quite late, I think he noticed I was about ready to call it a night and he suggested he can make us an even better drink at his place if I wanted to join him. It was about a 5 minute walk away from the bar to which I just said why not and we left. 

He offered me his arm to walk down the stairs and across the street and was stopping me along the way to kiss me a lot. When we got to his apartment building he showed me around the courtyard area and we laughed and talked more. 

He then said he noticed his brother that he lives with, was in bed so we would have to be really quiet. 

Obviously he lead me to his bedroom where we were sitting on his bed and he said “can you hurry up and kiss me already” we started kissing and he tried to suggest sex to which I declined and he said that’s okay we will have to next time, he also kept saying he wanted to pleasure me but I had to deny and work around it because it was that time of the month for me so it just wasn’t an option. One thing led to another and I ended up giving him head. By the end he wouldn’t stop telling me how good I was (I know it’s something I’m skilled at so I wasn’t surprised) he seemed amazed. 
He asked me straight away if I’d like to see him again and I said yes. He suggested the next night to which I laughed and he quickly corrected himself and said “is that too soon? Should we wait a week?” I replied and said “I have plans next weekend but we will sort something out!” He asked again to confirm if I did actually want to see him again and I reassured him I did. 

I then felt abit weird sticking around after giving him a bj because I didn’t want to be annoying so I just told him I needed to be up for work super early (at this point it was well past 3am and I did actually have to get up for work) he insisted I just stayed for abit and laid on his bed to watch tiktoks. He started showing me some of his favourites and I did too we were laughing a lot and he asked for my tiktok name so we could send each other funny tiktoks. 

The next day he messaged me and we have been talking pretty regularly, I’ve just been so busy with work and he’s had his last weeks of uni. He continued to flirt with me over text and said he would “love to see me again” it’s been about 3 weeks, I’ve been away on holiday and he was texting me every couple days asking how it’s going. He then started flirting saying when will he get to “return the favour” to me, I said we might need to organise something soon and he agreed. We then continued talking and he was talking about how he was wanting to pleasure me and have his body on mine, lots of dirty talk while I’ve been away. He then said that I tease him so much that it “makes him want me even more” because I keep telling him to be patient. He said he wants me to “hurry up and come home so we can see each other again” 

Ever since getting home he has quickly planned to see each other again, he invited me over to his place Saturday which I said I’d let him know in a couple days. I was sick and ended up telling him on Thursday I would be free Saturday night but I understand it’s super last minute now if he had plans it’s all good, which he ended up having a fundraiser for his gym so he said he couldn’t do this weekend anymore. Which this was a little confusing because I was just assuming I was coming around late for a hookup but now I’m thinking maybe he wanted to book out the entire Saturday night for us to see each other? 
He has been going on about how he still has so much he wants to do to me, and how much fun he had with me last time. I also cook a lot as I’m talking to him and he always says I should cook for him one night if I wanted to invite him over and if I ever wanted to invite him over to cuddle I could? 
Not to mention he ALWAYS sends me tiktoks of funny videos and ones like “the hottest person in the world is going to come onto the screen” then it’s like “smile it’s you” ??

But now I’m like is it too forward of me to try organise another catch up with him? 

Since he said he was busy this Saturday he still is acting the same, messaging me the same and chatting to me but I don’t want to come off too keen and scare him off! What would be the best approach? Wait for him to ask again when I’m free next? Or do you think because I kinda blew him off I need to organise it?

Keep in mind this is a guy I can just see would be able to get any girl he wanted. I am still living my life and not texting him all the time. It seems like I’ve got control over most of this but I’m still wondering why he’s saying he’s so excited to see me again but we aren’t really reorganising it after him saying he was now busy? 

I also noticed I was the only girl he followed on tiktok so he obviously doesn’t go just handing that out to anyone. I’m not sure what to think of this because I feel like if he just wanted sex he wouldn’t have bothered talking and asking questions about me on the first date till 2am and definitely wouldn’t be messaging me during the week if he just wanted a casual hookup? Most guys I’ve dealt with casual flings just message me the night they are drunk and want a hook up and just say “what you doing?” Or “you up?” The fact he’s putting in more effort to plan in advance seems weird?

We get along really well I actually feel like we could be great friends and there’s alot of sexual chemistry between us.

Earlier this month, we messaged for literally 8 hours straight, all night. Then a few days later, he started ghosting me. It just baffles me. Being able to stare at my phone for 8 hours straight messaging someone seems incredibly profound to me. It's so hard to fathom talking that much with someone... and then being completely unable to send even a short explanation.

For context... this is not a new person in my life and far from the first time he's ghosted me, but even after all this time it just confuses me. I'm not sure if he gets a little anxious, and then I pressure him, and that makes him more anxious and avoidant? Or maybe it has to do with an absence or surplus of weed. I know he wants to sext because we did it years ago, and I know fuckboys will lead you on and say anything, but 8 hours of talking? If he wanted to emotionally manipulate me he could just be a little nicer while messaging me a normal amount, he doesn't have to ruin his eyes for it lol. 

He just drives me crazy. I want all the best for him; even if he didn't want to date me I would like to try to make his life better as a friend because I think he's a good, captivating person.

It just seems like such a contradiction, the amount we talk, him telling me ""ttyl"" or that we'll talk to tomorrow, telling me that he likes talking to me, being an open-book. Then he's just gone for long periods of time, never explaining if he just wants space (which I would respect) or whats up.

Things are going well and he treats me really nice. There’s been talks about the future, marriage, children and I think those are good signs. I never had to worry about infidelity or anything because I’m quite confident with the love that he has for me.

The only thing is he’s a lawyer and a very competitive one at that. He is working really hard trying to be a partner in a really big law firm. Therefore he doesn’t have much time for me. I told him that I want him to see me minimum once a week and he tries his best to uphold that and I appreciate him for that.

I’m working in aviation (cabin crew) and lately  I find myself having a lot of free time. I’m not as busy as he is therefore, loneliness  creeps when I’m alone. I try to fill up my days with schedule, activities, going out with friends socializing but there’s this feeling emptiness in my chest. Asking is this really sustainable? 

Whenever we’re together, we’re really good. I know he tries his best. Whenever he sees me he always makes it to the point to take me out and exert extra for it. Last time he took me to this really nice staycation away from the city and I had so much fun. I know he is tired but he always try and plan something nice for me. Last week, I didn’t know he was kinda sick but he still came to see me. He didn’t wanna cancel on me. 

I know this is not his fault. Right on the very first date he told me that he works a lot so I’ve been warned. I guess I never really understood the extent of his work at that time. I thought, well, I’m busy too so this maybe a good thing. But a lawyer busy is unlike any other busy. 

I don’t really know what I aim with this post. I’m just really sad and lonely and crying. I miss him. I want more attention, more time. There are days when I feel like I can’t keep this up anymore and I have to leave him but I do love him and he is such an amazing man with ambition and he always understand and validate my emotions even when I am very handful and throwing loads of tantrums sometimes. He has been my rock.

I don’t think I’ll ever find a man who will understand all my emotions the way he does. It’s been a really tough day. He knows how I feel about this already so I don’t wanna pester and fight over this. He’s got enough on his plate at work.

I need advice on the situation I am going through.

Three months ago I (27/m) met a guy (30/m) in my parents' village (4 hours away from where I live, I was there visiting family). We had coffee and liked each other so we met the next day and everything seemed fine. We had similar interests so we started talking more regularly on Instagram, and then on WhatsApp.

Since then, we have met 4 more times: three times in his village, and once in my home town (he came to visit me and spend the weekend). 

My dilemma is the following: he tells me that he likes me a lot, and that he hasn't felt this way for a long time, but I'm not sure what I think or feel. The last three times I saw him.... They were good, but I don't know if I feel a spark or not. We talked, and we had a good time, but I'm not overly excited.

I'm afraid I may sabotaging myself. I've never been in a long distance relationship, so I don't know if my lack of enthusiasm is because I'm putting on armour or because I'm not that interested in him. 

On paper, everything should be going great, but something isn't clicking, and I'm afraid it might be me. I have a lot of thoughts running through my head: Am I wasting his time? Am I leading him on? Should we stop talking and seeing one another in case I fall head over heels in love? Would I be able to handle a long distance relationship? And so many more...

Tomorrow I'm going to go to where he lives to talk to him about our situation. He's noticed that I am colder, and that I still have my dating profile.

The conference we met at had a huge broad scope, so our friendship doesn't really help us in terms of networking-aka, this is not a ""friendship of convenience"" or business relationship. And since the he's changed fields too. I always did wonder why he took the efforts to keep in touch, as most people would not do it over the years. I was in grad school at the time and so was he and I had mentioned that I'd want to get a job in his city.

A few years later, here I am. I recently moved to his city for my job. We met up a few days ago. I wasn't sure if this guy was interested in me romantically, or as a friend, so to keep things casual I suggested we meet for coffee if he's down. He chose a fancier dinner place and paid for it, saying it was his treat to welcome me to said city. We made plans to meet again soon. 

The only times I've dated people, were through dating apps, or through direct set-ups where intent was very clear. I've never randomly met someone and dated them so maybe I'm unsure how to judge things. The thing is, this guy is known to be social, more than other people our age, I'd say. He mentions how he meets up with these guys he grew up with, keeps in touch with high school and college friends, etc, so this may really just be another friendship and nothing more. Or maybe he's trying to scope if there's room for more.

How can I tell? I don't want to directly ask him. I'm a shy person. And he's a friend and I know this would likely cause embarassment on both ends if I was wrong. But I'd like to know what's going on. Anyone have any advice?

I personally have struggled for a long time with social anxiety, shyness, lack of a romantic life, etc., and always, ALWAYS the advice is ‘be confident, be outspoken, be bold’, etc., and while I have become more confident and more comfortable with myself, which I see only as a good thing, I am ALWAYS going to deep down somewhere be that anxious, shy, uncertain and sensitive dude. That’s never gonna change. People tend to like me, I’m awkward in a kind of charming and disarming way, I own it, etc., but I’m never gonna be confident and love myself unabashedly. 

For so long dating seemed alien to me. I knew for a fact I was never gonna be that guy who walks in a room, says all the right smooth talking things to some girl and sweep her off my feet, while simultaneously being vulnerable and opening up to her straight away. It is not, and will never be, me. But beyond even that, I would never have complete quiet confidence in myself. All I’ve ever seen when it comes to dating advice is kind of pseudo-intellectual bullshit of ‘just love yourself, be confident in who you are, how can anyone love you if you don’t love yourself, women like bold men’. And while it’s well meaning, I think it’s hollow. Some people will never love themselves, or be confident in themselves, or be bold, or confident, or any other personality trait we revere. Does that mean they’re not deserving of love?

Fuck. No. And it’s so fucking refreshing to have someone sift through all the bullshit, and tell people like me something we are never told: you are okay. You don’t deserve any less just because you don’t fit the ideal that’s been drilled into us since birth. We tell people who have issues with social anxiety, self-worth or self-hatred, shyness and confidence issues that, essentially, all these traits are inherently unlovable, and if you can’t magically fix them and love yourself, nobody will ever love you. Telling someone who feels unlovable and hates themselves that, hey, they’re right, their issues do make them unlovable, less valuable somehow than they would be if they were outgoing and confident is just fucking crazy, and it’s been the underlying tenet of modern dating advice for as long as I can remember.

It’s bullshit. People do not need to go on some epic odyssey of self-discovery and healing to change who they are so they can find someone who loves them. People are people. We’re attracted to all different types of people. People aren’t solely attracted to confident, self-assured, positive types. I think people like to have the myth of ‘if you’re unlucky in dating, it’s because you’re not trying hard enough or you’re somehow morally in the wrong’ so that they can feel better about their own success and their own character, but it doesn’t reflect reality. Dating and attraction isn’t a game of self improvement. Human connection isn’t a reward for being your best self, whatever the fuck that is meant to mean. Sure, the confident, self assured type might be what society deems the ideal, but there will be people out there who don’t give a fuck about that, who will like you for you, as corny as it sounds. It’s okay to not be perfect, and you deserve love regardless.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,858996,public,self,Currently reading ‘Quiet: The Power of Introverts’ by Susan Cain and I think it nails the toxic nature of modern dating advice around ‘being confident and loving yourself’,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7om7y/currently_reading_quiet_the_power_of_introverts/,all_ads,6,,,,

Ive dated a lot since my breakup.  But something Ive noticed is I can get really excited about someone new after 1-2 dates and think that he might be the one! But then, we continue dating, and it starts feeling weird to plan dates (I think I become anxious about finding new fun ideas and every idea seems boring), and my then interest starts to decline for no reason. 
I think that I kind of miss being in a relationship where we really share our lifes together (ex: being together with friends and family, planing meals for the weeks, etc), so planing dates for only the two of us becomes boring after a little while and a bit inconfortable.

This is happening to me right now with a new guy (we've seen eachother once a week for one month now) and he is really great, so I just don't know why Im losing interest when I felt sooo into him in the beginning.

I just wanted to share a positive story

I was sitting at the airport the other day, waiting for my changeover, when I spotted an attractive girl.

She was about 5'9, black, curly long hair that went down to her waist, and dark eye shadow. She wore a black tank top, with black leggings and flip flops. She had a rather athletic build with an hourglass figure, almost like a swimmer.

There was not point in pursuing anything, as we weren't going to the same location.

Still, I wanted to give her a compliment.

She sat cross-legged on her phone in the seat across from me, in the waiting area.

After some hesitating, I stood up and walked over.

""Excuse me"", I said.

""Hm?"" She glanced up from her phone

""I just wanted to say that you're very beautiful"", I complimented.

""Thank you\~"" She replied blissfully, giving a little squint, before returning to her phone.

I returned to my seat.

The takeaway

Not every woman is the same. Everyone is their own person.

The things that we fear in life, almost never turn out the way you think they will.

Can the interaction go badly? Possibly, but it can also end well.

I then got the cold shoulder as she was at a crossroads in her life and exploring career opportunities in a bigger city and likely to move. 

Two weeks passed and I got a message saying she'd accepted a job and would be departing this summer, leaving only a couple of months to hang out.

Since seeing her again the past month, she's been totally upfront about keeping it as friends to avoid complicating things, which I've accepted, yet we've spent increasing time together and message each other daily.

The lines got blurred after watching a hockey game at her apartment this week. After a lot of booze and some really deep conversations, she opened up and explained she's been talking to her close friends about being more invested in me and thinks about me a lot. Later than night she initiated physical contact, one thing lead to another and I spent the night there. 

The next day we both acknowledged it could have complicated the friendship situation given her impending departure, and when I approached the topic - she said she didn't regret what happened but doesn't want to blur the lines, at which point she seemed hesitant to talk about it anymore. 

Needless to say I was happy playing the friends game in the hope that one day in the future we might make a go of things, but I now I know her feelings and she's warming to me, I'm not sure what to do given she's been badly hurt in the past and has her guard up to some extent. We've since hung out again and while we didn't talk about the situation, things were not awkward and had a great time (as friends). 

We're now both on respective vacations for a week so won't be spending time together, leaving less than a month with each other before she departs.

What do I do next?

Any advice to keep things alive with him while I’m gone?

I don't know if things are different in the US, but I live in a European country, and simply finding a date, let alone a relationship, from a dating app has proven impossible for me so far. I'm nothing particularly special looks-wise, probably a 6 at best, but the pictures on my dating profile were all taken at very flattering angles and in great lighting, so therefore I look much better in them than I do in real life. And my prompts have all been vetted and approved by my friends as being funny and interesting. So on paper, I should have no trouble right? Wrong.

I use Bumble, my distance range is set to 20 miles, my age range is 22-28 (I'm 25), and I still only get about five matches per week max. And with every match I've ever had, one of the following has happened:

1. (The most common)  They don't even reply to my opening message, and therefore the match expired after 24 hours. 

2. They only want a one night stand or friends with benefits situation.

3. They only talk about themselves, and the entire conversation just feels like an interview.

4. We have a seemingly good conversation for a couple of days, only for them to ghost me for no apparent reason.

5. They ask me for my WhatsApp or Instagram after we've exchanged three messages. When I tell them that I don't feel comfortable giving them my personal info so soon, they either get mad or unmatch with me.

I've been on Bumble for three months now, after having been on Hinge for a year prior to that, and I have yet to go on a single date.

And just to be clear, no I am not only swiping on ""top 10%"" of men (not that there would be anything wrong if I was, because women have every right to go for men who they find attractive, just like they do with us). But yeah, although looks obviously do matter, I have matched with several guys who weren't my type physically but seemed like they could be compatible with me due to their interests, or had intriguing or funny prompts. And the exact same things that happened with the more attractive guys happened with them too.

The bottom line is, unless you're looking for casual sex, online dating is NOT easy for women. Yes, we may get more attention than men, but when you discount the astronomically large amount of people who are only looking for sex, our odds of finding an actual relationship from a dating app are probably even lower than men's.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,859338,public,self,Being on dating apps as a woman is NOT easy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7sqez/being_on_dating_apps_as_a_woman_is_not_easy/,all_ads,6,,,,

If men like chest and glutes women will also like them, only in a different way dependent on the characteristics of each sex/gender they prefer. Also, beyond general trends, each person has their own unique preferences. I don't have clear-cut preferences myself, I like a great variety of body types that are outside of the 'canon'.

My question however isn't about the more obvious stuff, but about the quirkier things that people find attractive. For example, around 1/5 of men has a foot fetish, while it looks like only around 1/8 of women has it. I read for example in many forums that a great amount of women enjoy veiny hands with thin fingers (if true that would be a good confidence boost for me ehehe).

So my question is: what are some physical features, little behaviors, and peculiar style choices that aren't evidently or explicitly suggestive of anything sexual but still arouse a sensation of sensual pleasure when you see it and you find yourself attracted to?

I'll give you an example of certain things I like in women (but men also) so you get an idea. Mind you: this list is short, and I personally find myself attracted to very contrasting things sometines. I like little slow *floaty* movements of the body. I like seeing defined chest features regardless of breasts size (collarbone, pectorals, ribs). Underbreast tattoos or corsets. Tattoed hands. Feet with jewellery. Smell of very recent sweat. Homewear, consumed clothing and pajamas. Androgynous or careless mannerisms. Breathy voice, regardless of pitch. Etc...

She is a Canadian resident originally from Venezuala and is an LPN working her way to becoming a Registered Nurse, her english is broken but it works.

I have no idea how to date honestly, I spend a lot of my time (especially with covid) by myself not talking to anyone, I do have a lot to talk about and a fairly interesting life story filled with trauma, good things and bad I have done and been done to me, that I have shared with strangers in the past but I have not disclosed yet because we are just getting to know each other.

She seems pretty cool and her bio mentions her being a women of character, that she is looking for a man who is a non-drug user/non-player, I haven't had a drink in 10 years and lack the callousness and false charisma to be a player lol. I would say I'm.an honest person.

I'm just kind of at a loss what this relationship should look like, our last date was pretty good and made even better by the fact she wanted to go for a walk at the local park after we had some gourmet wood fired pizza. 

I have a list of date ideas of things I like to do

Bouldering
Taking some dogs for walks at the local SPCA
Hiking
Kayaking

I wouldn't say I have the butterfly's everytime I think about her that I used to get when I was a kid, but I really like her character and we have similar long term goals, marriage, possibly kids, ect.

We had been planning this big fun date for the upcoming week texting everyday as usual. I noticed though his supposed ex would comment under all his recent photos .Confronting him about it he said she actually was still his girlfriend,they’ve been living together for the past few years and she knew about me as their relationship was open but I didn’t know about her. I was devastated he apologized over and over saying that he didn’t expect to like me this much he still wanted to see me,he wish he was single/would most likely be single soon etc etc. We spoke in person honestly mostly crying and I decided I couldn’t continue seeing him like this. A year later I saw him on tinder again and stupidly with time passing I was curious as I felt so strongly on him before .His relationship at this point had fully ended and we had a fun chill afternoon I told him I had at that point forgiven him. He hurt me so badly before but I just didn’t feel like this with anyone else. He texted me later thanking me /saying he had a fun time ,I replied saying the same and sent him something we spoke about.He never replied. A few months later now yesterday I saw him and a girl as we where crossing the street at the same time. I realized from the timeline/ social media he had started seeing her immediately after ghosting me. Admittedly Im really hurt all over again . Im an attractive person but I always seem to be a rebound or second option .Honestly though in a lot of these past instances when people hurt me/ do something a bit off I see the best in them or focus on how they’ve made me felt as something to make up for the mistake and forgive them. But honestly I’ve learned this the hard way over and over again when people show you who they are believe them. I should of never entertained this man in my life after what he did to me. Allowing him back into my life after all the apologies he hurt me more in the end. I am pleading ya’ll to not make the same mistakes I have if a comment /action especially at the beginning of a relationship is disrespectful and does not align with your dream please leave!!  Know your worth ,it only matters how they treat you how they make you feel is honestly more so a projection of you experiencing yourself through another person. Your own capacity to love is what’s making them great they just suck !",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,859549,public,self,Do not give second chances,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7vjpw/do_not_give_second_chances/,all_ads,6,,,,
