I apologized in case I wasn't clear enough with my intentions and said no hard feelings. A couple of weeks pass and she invites me out with her, her roommate, and her roommate's bf to go drinking and we all proceed to have a good time together. Fast foward couple of days she and I go out drinking and dancing again alone together and have an amazing time together. Fast forward to tonight we end up going out together and drinking and dancing together again. She invites me out to go drinking and dancing again followed by a smoke session at her place in a couple of days and I agreed but as I got home I realized I can't take this shit anymore and pretend to be friends with her. I've fallen for her pretty hard and I can't pretend like I don't have feelings for her any longer.

5,q55j21,1633861756,"I avoid fighting with my gf, but starting to think that isn’t healthy","Everyone’s heard that it’s natural and healthy to fight with your partner.  But I just avoid it.  As I’ve grown older I’ve started to learn the value of seeing situations from others perspective, and learned that the 99.99% of the things my partners does that pisses me off are never with malice towards me.  Everyone dates someone who inherently lives in their own reality and I know a lot of arguments that couples have come from this.  Most fights come out of miscommunication, miss understandings or just plain lack of consideration, and I would say the majority of the things my gf does that piss me off are one of those three things above.  Her just existing in her own reality in that moment.  Every time something like this happens I take a step back, try to see things from her side, generally let 24 hrs pass so I can evaluate things better with a clearer, less emotionally driven mindset and come back to communicate with her.  The result ends up being me seeing things from her side, and ultimately realizing that if I had acted out of emotion and blown up at her, it would have been the wrong choice.  As our relationship has progressed I’ve been using this logic with everything.  But I’m starting to feel like it might be causing me to get walked on sometimes.  She never ever does anything with the intention to hurt me, so why pick a fight? But I also don’t want to be that guy in the relationship that always just lets things go, and possibly never gets the emotion of frustration out (starting to feel like that as getting bottled up inside).

7,q55yjz,1633863792,"[30M] first few dates go well, totally fuck up third. game over?","(Awkward) Story so far: First two dates go very well, second date has much more chemistry. We're texting everyday a fair amount as well, just getting to know each other, that's going really well, flirty and getting really into each other. She's about 7 years younger, but I'm out of a ltr and open to whatever right now and she seems mature. I don't date much, but I get compliments from her on how well it's going. She dates a lot more, apparently.

Ok, third date. Cooking is a shared interested, although i'm just an amatuer compared to her skills. She comes over and we make food, I fuck it up but we salvage and adapt to a new dish, she's ends up making most of it, I feel like a tool, but it turns out great in the end. Bad fumble, but not the worst part. 

The real fumble - years and years ago I suffered from performance anxiety in the bedroom. Which is where we went while we waited for some food stuff to sit. We had been getting pretty worked up over text the night before. We were both over eager and I should have slowed things down likely. But we go for it and it doesn't work. Mostly. She's super cool about it, says it's no problem happens all the time. I do my best to be chill, but I was stressed before hand so this didn't help. Put too much pressure on myself for this date. Try to stay confident after but that's a hard L to take and stay in it as a guy for another 2 hours of cooking/eating haha. I get a few unintended self depricating remarks in that likely don't sit well, bad humor, but try my best not to unravel entirely.

Here's the caveat, I tend to be a more emotionally attached dater, I think. Keep expectations real, but if things are going well I can only focus on one person, until it works or doesn't. She's been with about 4 times as many people as I have, and hits me with the ""FYI you're not the only one I'm seeing right now"" just as we get into bed. I get that's normal thing I guess, it just didn't match the vibe I thought was going on, totally fine, just caught me off guard and probably didn't help with performance. 

So, day after, texting slows way down, she reassures its chill. But, I mean whatever level of confidence I was presenting has to look pretty fucked now, and competing with a second guy is a real head game. I just don't have the time/mental energy in the day to be seeing that many people at once. Not sure how people do it tbh. But fair enough.

Feeling a bit dead in the water here, trying to take that loss on the chin and stay in it, or stay standing. Difficult to go from - day before going really well, high energy into each other - to an absolute fumbled fuckup. But entirely my fault, too much pressure.

Not sure how to proceed. I feel like I know my worth, but that shit is difficult not to get down about. Thanks for reading. 

Tldr; early dates go well, third date i put way too much pressure on myself and get performance anxiety in bed, fumble in the kitchen cooking as well. She's seeing several people, and I find that difficult. The house of cards feels like its collapsed.

It comes across as so aggressive/surly that it’s an immediate ‘no’ for me. I also don’t want to have to have to guess what a waste of time means to them, so why would I risk wasting their time by connecting with them to find out what is that they don’t want to waste their time with! 

If they’re specifically looking for a relationship then all apps have the option to specify this. If they don’t want something casual, they can specify this. But the “no time wasters” thing is just so off-putting, how do they not realise this?

I noticed she always tends to jump on certain words that i use and always think that i have some malicious intent (when it is obvious I don't).   
I love her a lot but honestly this is becoming a bit tiresome as of late, especially since I'm constantly sending her texts, presents, supportive gestures overseas and she acknowledges it and says she loves me a lot etc. She acknowledges she can't control her emotions well at times but chalks it up to her female emotions.

14,q56ivl,1633866386,Get Them Excited On The First Date," When you have been talking to someone online for a time you both may decide to take the next step with a real life date. Online dating can be very beneficial but without a good connection in real life, you cannot move onto something more with long lasting potential. Many people are concerned about moving from online dating to dating in real life. It can be very dangerous. Online daters also need to worry about the other person not being honest about them. The best thing that you can do is to simply give it a shot. In the dating world, you will experience many failures but it is possible to have a good and true relationship if you try hard. The first date with an online friend can be nerve racking so you have to be sure to get the other person excited about meeting you.  


First it is a good idea to plan a first date that will take place in a public place. It is easy to lie online and you do not want to find yourself to be a victim of an online predator. To be safe, you need to suggest meeting at the place of the date instead of getting into a vehicle with someone you do not know. Plan a date for the daytime and it is usually a good idea to have very little alcohol involved. If you are still not sure about meeting for security reasons, you should suggest a group date where each of you brings a few different friends.  


There are a number of good date ideas that you can use for your first date. You should always have a meal at a good restaurant or go to the movies. However when you are eating or watching a film it is difficult to get to now another person. You can suggest a date based on common interests that attracted you to the other person in the first place. For example if you both enjoy sports, you can go to a baseball game or playing golf. If you like the outdoor adventures you can plan a first date at a rock-climbing place. For more quiet dates, you can meet at a coffee house or listen to a soft music concert.  


The most important thing to remember about a date is to make sure that each person is comfortable. If you are both having a bad time and it is obvious, it is not inappropriate to suggest leaving early. However if you both are having a great time, you may want to extend the date to another activity after the first date has ended. Leave the first date open because not every person will have a connection with you. You need to be prepared for both success and failure.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q56ivl/get_them_excited_on_the_first_date/

Help me read him?","On Friday, I asked him if he would be interested in going out for coffee with me. I was a little bit shy about it, so I just started off with ""hey since we aren't going to be coworkers anymore... nevermind."" He smiled, and pushed for an answer. He's usually... passive-ish? 

I asked him out for coffee. He said ""Yes. But I am very busy.""

Our supervisor teased and said that he talks about me a lot when I'm not there. I couldn't tell if she was serious or not however. In response, he did a goofy smile and blushed and walked away protesting.

We didn't work together very often, like 1 day a week on the busiest day. He didn't seem to mind getting really close to me, even more than necessary for our industry (banking). He doesn't protest when I touch him, either (on the arm, adjusting his tie, touching his back when he was opening the vault). I asked him if he minded, he said it was fine, so 🤷 

He *seems* to go out of his way to stand close to me and give me tips on technical parts about the job, more than necessary. Counting a bunch of mutilated bills with me. On Friday he went out of his way to explain which of the dozen keys was the vault key and brushed his fingers over mine. I would give him a side glance and look him up and down (subtly). He did an adorable genuine smile and stared at me.

Yesterday (Saturday) was his last day :(

I haven't heard from him yet. I know he said he was busy, but... he wouldn't have said yes if he didn't want it, right? He would have subtly declined by changing the topic to something work related. He is classy and sensitive.

My eventual goal is a relationship, but I know you have to date and get to know people before you can get there. But I struggle a lot with moving too quickly and wanting to get more serious faster than others do - part of why though is I think I just might have a warped perception of what's too fast when meeting new people. I also have an anxious attachment style, so I get comfortable with people easily and I guess I just forget other people don't, even if they still like me. I also get attached quickly and want to see people frequently, at least once a week, or if that's not doable I try to make plans so I at least know I'll be seeing them again. If they don't want to do this I start to think they're not interested. I'm trying to become more secure though.

So I'd just be really curious to see how other people see it, how long it takes you all to feel comfortable with someone, how frequently you try to see new partners, etc? I'm hoping this will help me calibrate my expectations appropriately, and learn to quiet my attachment-related anxieties when someone else doesn't match my energy or expectations right off the bat.

Basically, we matched on Tinder on talked for a bit, so by the end of the day she\[21F\] offered her IG and WA, so we continued talking there the next day. To add people for some reason open up to me TOO quickly with private things and problems, be it on OLD, or just meeting people in general IRL.

So along the way she discloses that she is dropping out in order to change the course she was attending(music school) for mental health reasons, but the more we talked she mentioned taking meds for depression, queue talking a bit about MH and all that. So later that day she asked me if I wanted to go out sometime next week, to which I said sure.

The problem is I don't know what to expect or how serious it is, and I read one too many horror story about caring for a person with some kind of depression on Reddit.

I (24F) am pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating, since I was painfully shy and awkward until just a few years ago. 

I’ve been working on my confidence and I feel pretty secure nowadays. I have healthy friendships etc, and I wanna start dating. One problem, though, is that I tend to crush on unavailable guys. 

I guess it’s because it’s scary to be vulnerable. And if I liked someone available who liked me back, I’d have to DO something about it. The horror!

Joking aside, I don’t want to go on like this. It doesn’t feel healthy or productive to just daydream about someone I barely know. I want to be able to be interested in someone without immediately starting to think about what it would be like to marry him. 

Has anyone been in this situation and managed to turn it around?

There’s a guy I’m interested in now, and I try to remind myself how little I know about him and avoid getting carried away. It’s going ok so far, but I’m scared of being tempted to daydream about him and getting too invested. 

Tl;dr: I get obsessive crushes on guys I barely know, and I’m trying to stop doing that, would appreciate advice.

37,q59kbi,1633877697,The person your considering asking out... DO IT!! (my last few years to my last few weeks),"I'm a 29M average looking guy a bit on the short side that is pretty sociable and all but never really had a lot luck with girls. I always had confidence issues but that started changing a couple of years ago. I moved abroad (to US) for grad school and made a lot of friends but also my research and classes were going so well for the first time that I became increasingly confident about myself. Then I started addressing my love issues. I was (still am) terrified of being rejected so asking girls out was always a massive hurdle for me and when I did and they agreed to it I was almost always super anxious and while having fun was never super comfortable. As result, I went on a few dates, dated a couple girls for a couple months (though I wouldn't call any a relationship) but at the end of the day never met anyone that I really really enjoyed being with. Most of these encounters were through OLD.

&amp;#x200B;

So as I finished grad school and moved to work on another (3rd) country, I was feeling great because I got a great position at this great company. But a) no way in hell I'd ever date people from work; b) all girls that talked to me made me feel like I was in an audition to be their husband even though it never in a date situation and I had no interest in any of them. I gave OLD a try but same issue: couple dates, nobody I really liked. Meanwhile I started going to this gym and I met this cute girl that is also a foreigner that had recently moved, we somewhat talked but I'm somewhat quiet with ""strangers"". I got really into her and sometimes would catch her on the way to the gym and ride together. So I decided I wanted to ask her out which terrified me because she's super cute and somewhat intense. We didn't see each other for a week (later found out she changed gyms) so after being sad just gave it a big ole F-IT and DM'd her on IG asking if she wanted to go out. She said yes immediately. We hit it off so well about 3-wks later we're hanging out almost every other day and are in that weird grey area that we're not officially dating but we pretty much have a bf-gf dynamic. I am over the f-ing moon. So here's my point: if you are busy enough (school, job, etc) the pain of being rejected can linger for a few days, but the happiness you may get from a ""yes"" can carry you to a much more overwhelming happiness. So that girl/guy you're thinking about asking out, DO IT RN!!!

Okay so I (M25) haven’t dated in 6 years and am a rather shy and introverted person and have had this crush on a girl from my work for a while so I finally asked her out on a double date to a sporting event about 3 weeks ago and she took a few days to respond but she ended up coming with and it was a fun time. I asked her in person after if I could take her out to dinner and she said yes, we text a little but we both aren’t huge fans of texting but we texted pretty much everyday, we’ve played video games online a few times. On to the second date. She rescheduled once but then I finally got the chance to take her out. Everything seemed to be going well and we get along well in my opinion. BUT with my luck I got food poisoning and got sick as we were leaving and it felt like it killed the whole thing. I was stunned when it happened because it hit me like a brick wall. I’m really not even embarrassed because it wasn’t like I was slamming liquor (I was the driver and know my limits) or anything like that I got generally sick and, well, shit happens. I texted her the day after as I was home sick from work and essentially apologized for spoiling the evening and told her I was trying to laugh it off and I’ve got no reply. I guess I’m not really sure what do to. I would assume if she went on these two dates with me she is (or was) semi interested. But we never really had a conversation about what each other were looking for because I was more interested in just getting to know her. How long would you wait for a response?

Her ex had suicidal tendencies and emotionally blackmailed her to kill himself if she leaves him. So she behaved in a way which would convince HIM to break up with her (late replies, not acting interested, not talking to him till days) and eventually he broke up with her after 2 months.

Now she does have feelings for me, but is afraid she'll hurt me as well. Also, in her past 2 relationships she was the one who initiated everything and put in efforts but the other person did not reciprocate, took her for granted. So now she is basically scared of even the thought of getting into relationship with someone. I can grope her out of this self-deprecating mindset but obviously it will take time and effort which I don't know if it is worth it ( I do really like her tho and would want things to go further)

I'm planning not to invest all of my time waiting around, but not writing her off totally either. Will basically tell her the door is open but I won't wait for her, keeping the ball in her court. She will take the shot if she wants to, nothing from my side (I might date other girls too)

45,q5aknk,1633880889,The interest everyone gets is part of why they feel good/confident; with 13 years of trying the most that I've had happened is getting lied to. How do have things go like how they do for you and anyone else instead of I? (M 25 )," 

\-I feel safe enough assuming that the people here like being in a relationship. I feel safe assuming that most people here have been in at least one if not many more than that.

Also is there those, like me, who hasn't been able to get even one if their life so far. To all those with this going on, I'm sorry that you know how it is and what it's like. It's... well, hurts in a very special type of way. I'm sorry that you personally know about it.

&amp; If you happen to be like me, who has no family, no friends or people to even speak to really...

Well, you can guess how and what that's like. Pretty much everyone'll know loneliness but, for most, it's just an absence of a partner that makes them feel alone. Generally they still have friends. Generally they still have parents. Generally they still have family. Generally most people do seem to look pretty good, which'll help them most of their issues of loneliness.

But... What about those orphans that can't attract anyone? The friendless and those that don't have family; I measure their sadness would be one that's quite stark, The things like those are so easy to spot; but I think this would be only if your experience is the same.

\---

For some, I bet it's every single day that they get new attention. new interest, new matches and new messages. Moreso for women than dudes, but I include them too.

I hear women talk about just using their accounts for a confidence boost (I guess it is some kind of nice to know that you have a few hundred/thousand people interested in you and wanting to talk to you + whatever other fun. It beats 13 years going by with only getting like maybe 7 matches and 10 messages + 0 dates/relationships)

I see bios about comatose partners of certain women that want to have fun while their boyfriend can't know. Mostly though, I see bios that don't even have anything. + There's these women that don't even show any pictures of themselves.

Would you like to know what they all have in common and what they have over me though? Each and everyone would do better than I. Not even one would go 13 years of trying to date or be in a relationship without it happening. ***especially women***.

On that hand where dates and interested swarms and banished loneliness are stands another beside, but instead of the one that has nice things that only others are allowed, let's speak about what my hand shows now. (some figurativity here, don't think too hard about it and take it literally)

\---

\-A ... rejection? (Let's call it the modern kind, I guess, where the person asked just doesn't even say anything... Pretty shitty that's even a thing if I may say, for some reason I bet they don't like it much when someone they really like won't even say anything to them) So the first attempt, this try of mine, didn't go too well. It makes me sad, but I'm not mad about this one or anything. Sad that she couldn't speak is how I am.

\-This second person was one of the closest I've ever been to having something actually happen. However...Well, she moved away, supposedly.

(the story, highly shortened)

We spoke for most of a certain night, spoke about meeting up the next day, and a plan was made. It was really sudden honestly, but it made me pretty happy. That next day, when we were supposed to meet though she messages me about an hour before, after I get fully ready and everything all of a sudden I get some message saying that she doesn't know if she wants to meet up still. Supposedly some other guy that she had over for the morning was really creepy and it made her not want to chance meeting with me anymore for fear that I was/could be creepy too.

The reason was understandable to me, most of my fun comes from the fun that others are having and it clearly wasn't the best time for something to happen.

I really just wanted her to feel better again and have things be like how they were going for us.

Now, I'm not sure if everything, or nearly everything was a lie. Of what she said about it. It could've just been that the morning dude was far better than I so she aborted me away, Better looking, more like what she's after, rich, who the hell knows, but I wonder the reasons and I wonder the exacts.

I guess it's time for what was really hurtful here. after she talks about this morning dude being really creepy, I asked if she'd like to possibly set up another hangout, whicever day and whenever she'd like. Months or whatever from now I told her I'd wait.

She just said no and that there's something else in a different city that she wants to date.

...None of these make me feel great, but this one just feels tormenting. I don't know if it was some kind of game or just bad luck on my end, or if all was actual truth.

I feel like the one hurt most by it all though, I mean, it's terrible to say, but she was able to spare some mega-creep some time and let him in her house and basically gives me the middle finger he earned.

I feel slighted, I guess.

Now... well, she told me she's moving away and I haven't heard anyhting back from my wishes of wellness for that.

...

\---

the humour I often see seems to mostly be harm. It's what people find funny for some reason. Most seem to take emotional harm lightly and as a joke but what does getting orphaned to do someone? Is it physical, or is the effect mental/emotional?

When a village is bombed, and all the people die, the ones you know, the ones you didn't, and you end up the only person alive... The pain there, is it physical or is it mental/emotional?

What I want seen here is how hurting feelings and thinking nothing of it really makes you quite atrocious; you're quite like anyone who drone strikes or kamikazes a place.

A Warlord is what you're like if you find hurt feelings, pain, and suffering enjoyable or if you don't see wrong in it.

What makes me speak this all is the next ""relationships"".

\-This third woman was so so gorgeous, omg... It really hurts me knowing that she doesn't want anything to do with me.

To me, she was what perfect could look like and she brandished it all so well. I only heard her voice maybe 3 times but I really wish I could've heard it in person at least once. The moon on her face was so pretty too...

What was it that happened between us? Well, super simply, we spoke for about a week, she said that she likes my weird vibe, likes what I say, She didn't like how much I would write though, it caused problems for her so I spared her my usual and gave her what she wanted.

But... 2 days before my birthday she sends me a a few photos , asks me a question which honestly I hate to say that I forget, and then suddenly says as I prepare myself for a few pictures for her ""okay... listen, we don't really have much in common and I don't like the vibe between us""

... That's where this one died. I'm not sure what hurts me the most with this one. One thing I do want to say though is I don't know how she can determine whether we have much in common or not when she never really would say much and never really talked about herself.

This one... it made me mad when it happened I won't lie about that. Sad too, my anger about it is mostly gone though and it's sadness now

I personally feel like some better looking dude came along; this lady was clearly a model and I can't describe her properly. She was wondrous, let's say that.

I really would have liked to have actually know her, It torments me that that's not what she wanted though.

\---

(For you sadistic people and pretty much everyone else too I guess; you'll love this one. If it's happened to you, how'd it make you feel, if I may ask? It made me want to call tall buildings my friend, honestly... The others, with nothing like that going on, how do you think it'd make you feel?)

For this 4th ""lady"", well, I can only hope I don't come across any others like her in any way and I really hope you don't either. a lot has made me suicidal and nothing's really came as close as this one.

What the hell's wrong with her? Mmm, it's hard to say where I should start.

At first, she was promising and incredible. I've never felt anyone be as interested in me as she was. I've never felt as much care from anyone other than her or my Mother.

She, well, she made me feel loved. That's what she gave me and it's something I've haven't really felt. Maybe twice, at most.

It was fucking beautiful.

But... what I felt was false. What I felt was onesided, and honestly what I felt was only warm on one side. What I gave to her was where warmth came from and in the end everything she gave me was about as cold as landmines.

Why's that? well, it's because everything was a lie. Not on or from my side, I gave only truths and promises.

Like when she made me feel so badly about her living situation and about what her family does to her that I said that I could be the Brother she should have had, not those ones that sexually torment her with their father.

Like every stupid creation I ever gave her to help her feel better. I gave a message that was bascially ""I know that we're on opposite sides of the worlds and that our cities are different. But, if we slept around the same time, would that be like resting together?"" I don't know how that seems to you all, probably corny or just stupid or something but all I meant with it was nothing but sweet.

Fun fact I feel you should know, this lady was a 22+ hour flight away (supposedly). Sex is not why I was interested in her. I liked her sexually, she was super cute to me, but I ***liked*** her. I wanted life to be better for her and I even told her that it's fine for her to say that her life could only become better with me gone from it and I would gladly leave if it'd make her happy.

She never told me that though, so I figured everything was fine. :)

""I don't know what talking to me does for you but for my it makes me really happy and it makes me feel so less alone.""

\^ I gave a lot of random things like that and the other to her, usually I just felt like it's something she could use hearing, I know it'd make me feel great if someone put anywhere near the same effort for me and I figured it'd be that way for her to since her life was pretty similar.

\----

Between us sounds something probably pretty, I hope. It sounds like something going on, doesn't it? A relationship... Well, I thought we had something to.

I am the biggest idiot though for thinking that and for anything of everything I ever said or did for her. ..I'd... if I could go back I'd rather take all the time spent on her and just watch it disappear. I don't even want it back I just want it gone.

...I wish I could have taken that time I gave only for her away and give it to my Brother. He died before I even met her, but those bonus three months with my brother would've been beautiful and I can't ever have that.

...

(I spoke of something I probably shouldn't have, fair warning that I may seem more upset or kind of mad now, I'm sorry for it.)

She was a liar. The worst and biggest one I've ever known. Liar doesn't sound like nearly enough for what she is, she's awful.

This change is sudden, huh? Would you like to know why? It's what she lied about.

Everything.

She told me that a member of her family died recently, but this was untrue I later found out. She told me that she's forced upon and touched by her family, this was untrue, she's never been touched in any way like that. She told me that she's poor, but she is very far from poor. She told me that she likes me, that she thinks I'm attractive and that I'm even hot, but actually she just says that I'm about the furthest thing from what she finds attractive.

She even told me that she's never been in a relationship... But she's actually been in one for the last 6 years.

...

There are some lies I'm leaving out. Here's to quarter of a year wasted on the worst person I know. thanks lady...

\---

I tried to keep these all in order, form oldest to newest.

I've been here for like 2 + hours writing though so I'm going to be quick with this one.

for this final woman, I ruined everything. It was just and only me. I wish she wasn't so sudden to banish me away, but it's all because of me that it happened.

I'm not sure if it sounds like I did something really bad, but I kept ""flying off the handle"" when I was chatting to her, in her words. I never felt like I was, but she surely did, and I hate myself for not honouring her wishes more properly.

What hurts me here though is she's one of the best looking people I've seen anywhere in my life and I made it so she couldn't want anyhting to do with me when she surprisingly was interested.

Even without the looks aspect it was still absolutely horrible of me.

TL;DR Well, that's most of my experiences really. Anything that was more than clear disinterest or pointless talking. Or scammers lol.

The last 4 of those are from this year. So since 2009 There's been 5 opportunities. All went to crap though and some were just torturous.

A lot of people ""go through"" like hundreds of interested people a day. However, it takes me 13 years just to get lied to by someone I like a lot.

I want advice for having things go the way the likely go for you. I doubt anyone's gone 13 years of active trying just to have nothing happen except atrocity.

13 years go by for me and I can't even get one relationship; 13 years go by for pretty much anyone else but especially someone great looking and they'd have dipped into half of the city likely.

Supposedly I'm kind of cute too! so WTF, I really don't get this stupid bullshite

I mean, I know why most people feel good and I bet it's cause they can get relationships. I think 13 years of trying's going to make someone feel pretty bad, I mean, there's people who don't even have pictures or anyhting that do better than that. I can try and do worse than anyone lol.

# 

I met this really great guy on a dating website about a month ago. I'm a big gal and I joined a dating site that is for BBW's.

He was a little younger than me, but nothing too bad. We got along great. He had a lot of the qualities I like in a man. Very sweet, attentive, sensitive and really gentle. We talked and texted a lot. Our phone conversations were over 3 hours. The only bad thing is that he lives 4 hours away and didn't have a car. No big deal. We would work it out.

Then he stopped calling and our communication wasn't really there. I became concerned. I got the excuse of being ""busy"". Fuck that. As time went on, something wasn't right. I felt it in my gut.

Come to find out about his living situation. He told me he was living with an ""abusive"" partner because of his financial situation. Turns out, it's a girlfriend. I asked him if he still slept with her. No. He's in another bedroom. Yeah, right. Also, she still thinks of them as being together. One last blow, he's still active on the website where we met. Oh! Also he said that he was going to have to go back to his parents but he wasn't ready for that. I call bullshit. If I had an abusive partner, I would run back to my parents and they wouldn't hesitate to take me back.

I decided to delete him from my phone. He's gone. I'm done. I won't do this. It's a stupid situation that I don't deserve. I won't compete. I won't be second best and I'm not going to wait until he's ""ready"" to leave her. I am done!!!

I think I did the right thing. I went with my gut. Sorry it was so long!!!

I picked this bar specifically because it's quiet with soft music, and no one really knows about it.  Perfect intimate getting to know you type of place.

1-2 days before the date I get a haircut and a clean shave.

Day of the date I go to the gym, wear my best outfit that molds to my body making me feel sexy.

On the date, I immediately greet her with a warm-friendly sideways hug.  I take an authentic interest in everything she says.  I was one of those kids who was 100 percent all ears in class when the teachers would talk about their fishing trips or whatever.  I love hearing people talk about themselves.

Authentic laughs are had.  I'm pretty witty especially when slightly nervous.

I pay.  I tip.

We walk out and I quickly access the situation.  My date a week ago didn't want a kiss because she had her head slightly turned while putting her arms up for a hug.  So I hugged her, and then I texted her to make sure she got home safely.

In my brain the date went very well.  I mean... about as well as a date can with at total stranger off of the internet: convo flowed well and laughs were had.

And then I never hear from her ever again.  Then I go back to swiping.  Rinse and repeat without a lesson learned.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5aumt/the_hardest_part_of_dating_is_doing_everything/

&amp;#x200B;

* Met a girl one month ago, been on 4 official dates. Instant chemistry, reciprocal. Text every day. We love to be handsy and show affection. Until last night we never did anymore than hug or cuddle in bed.
* Last night on the way home she was a little drunk and said she thinks I'm too good for her. Her reservations: I don't drink, I'm a little younger, not as many life experiences, and it's still soon after my divorce.
* She said she does like me, enjoys our time together, finds me ridiculously cute/attractive, and loves putting her hands on me, but she's worried i am not right for her and will essentially bomb out in a month or so.
* I reassured her it's not a rebound, or a lustful thing and that I truly like her and enjoy spending quality time with her (without going overboard with lovebombing). This spark I truly believe is the beginning of something.
* We get to her place and she gives me the eyes, start having sex. I am super nervous because it's my first time since my divorce and with another woman whom i really like and i can't get hard
* She seemed ok about it and asked me to just cuddle naked all night. I took care of her down there which she seemed to like. We woke up and i went home, she said she would call me later.
* Her Match profile is still active, but mine are offline now.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past I've REALLY overthought this shit because of lack of sleep and over-analysis. It could be she just has reservations, and I was just having a little PA during sex and we may do stuff again and everything is ok. I'm thinking just keep shit as is and don't bring it up?

53,q5b4fg,1633882570,Did she lost interest in me after she invited me over to her place after our first date and we simply ended up doing homework and watching movies? We didn't even kiss. Did I f*ck up?,"Okay..

So I met this girl in my online class. I first thought she's a teacher, because she wrote me an entire page of what I missed in my first class after asking in the chat. Then later I figured out that it's a student and that's where I thought that she might be into me. 

**Before we met in person:** Anyway, I asked her for her number and we started writing each other A LOT on whatsapp. I immediatly scheduled a date for the first upcoming weekend and she agreed immediatly. We texted a lot during the week, before we met in person.

**The date:** So.... honestly... I don't even know if that was a date or we just met up. Anyway... this is what happened: 

We went to the park and we basically continued talking what we were writing to each other. We also had few topics that we preferred to save up for in person. So we were doing that for few hours at the park and then it got late and cold so we decided to go her place to do some homework and watch movies.

Honestly... I was myself skeptical about getting laid on the first date, since I knew her only for about a week. But we didn't even end up kissing. When we were texting I tried not be so flirty, because I didn't knew if she looks like in her picture. But after I met her, I tried to be more flirty and even did touching and hugging(not in the creepy way lol). She didn't back up(I hope that's the correct way to say it), but she also replied minimal to it.... Anyway she ended up driving me back to my place at 2 am.

**After the date:** I didn't text her anything for about two days after we met. I just didn't knew what happened that evening/night and how to feel about it. I wanted to see if, maybe, she will write me first. She ended up replying to me after I asked for some help with an assignment on our class chat. And she put so much effort on helping me out, like the professors didn't do. She even stayed up late, because she thought I might need some extra help. I know that, because she said it.

We continued talking with each other, maybe for a week and then we stopped. Even on our class group chat.

**Most recent things we spoke about:** So.... maybe a week or two after the first date, I tried scheduling another one. But she said that she's too busy. Which makes sense, because I asked her out on Friday. I'm guessing it could make sense that she already made plans for the weekend. Then I stopped texting again to see if she will text me something first. She ended up replying to another question of mine in our class chat, but then instead of joking around how we usually do she just send me a thumbs up.

It was either before that, or after, but since she was still replying. I tried asking her out to hang out. This time for our almost 2 week school break, which was 3ish weeks when I asked her(last week). I asked her if she had any plans for the school break and she said that she will hang out with her friend. Then I asked if it's for the entire school break and she said yes, because they haven't seen each other for long time. Since she was still replying, and not in short, I asked if she might have time to hang out with one more person and she replied - idk, because I will be out of town, but if I find some time I'll let you know.

Since she was still replying - I decided not to give up just yet. After not texting again for few days - I send her a funny meme. Then she replied how funny it is, not in short way. Then I wrote her something after that and she replied - day and a half after that. But I saw her online on whatsapp even the same day after I wrote her..... again, not in a short way. With a sentence. But it was day and a half after that and I saw her online.

I also just realized that whatsapp shows your online status each time you're actually online and not when you open the message. Which means that unknowingly I was doing that to her all the time.

**Some background on both of us:** We're both 25. I'm from Europe, currently studying in Canada. She's from the town where I live now. I'm tall(6'2) and athletic. Not average looking. Many ppl define me as good looking. And yeah, I've dated before. My last relationship lasted about 2 years. No, I wasn't nervous around her.

She's average looking, basic pretty. I just liked her personality and that she's nerdy. Some things I figured out about her is that she never tried smoking, weed or any other drugs and she very, very rarely drinks alcohol. She's also not too much into partying and prefers to spend time with her mom, sister, and close friends.

So.... what do you think? I know it's a long post and there is even more to it. But Id rather discuss in comments for further details. Do you think I still might have chance with her or I should move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5b4fg/did_she_lost_interest_in_me_after_she_invited_me/
54,q5b5lq,1633882671,I’m afraid I will always face scrutiny for my looks so I can’t date?,"I am just curious if other girls/women (or other genders, to be honest) can relate? I do not have anger that I am not found attractive, as that’s my own problem and everyone has a right to love who they want to love so long as that is consensual and healthy.  I just feel that each time a thought pops up in my mind, I feel that it just isn’t possible. Obviously people of all sort of images and imagery date and experience the thrills of life, ups and downs, I just never have and never have been desired by anyone. That I am sure of, it is not in my head. 


That said, I am just wondering because I will be 29 this week. I look back on my teens and 20s thus far and this has never changed. It kind of hurts me deeply. I am okay with rejection but I take certain things as a fact. For example, I had an intimate moment with someone who wasn’t physically attracted to me. It’s a long story. He seduced me and touched me but I was very naive, just thought he was a friendly person being funny and nice. Until he was naked, of course. I had all of my clothes on. He was very ashamed of me, and told a model he began to date that I was his stalker—not a girl he had a “thing” with at all. It caused years of pain because the narrative was that I was an ugly, desperate stalker that dating him when that was not the complete case.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5b5lq/im_afraid_i_will_always_face_scrutiny_for_my/

My biggest issue is she plans on quitting soon because of work conditions and the managers treatment of her. I really might just quite after she quits partly cause Ilshe won't be there but also cause now my work load will be that of 3 peoples work too. I really don't want her to leave, especially never being able to see her again, but I don't want her to stay where she isn't appreciated and idk what to do or what to say to her or talk about that isn't as mundane as work but also doesn't just seem totally out of the blue. When we'll talk about work or the terrible manager usually she'll stop what she's doing and stand like right by me and talk, I found that kinda weird cause while we are working we're face to face and like 4-5 ft apart at the counters, she'll also kinda linger after the conversations over like she wants to talk about more but idk what to talk about but work really without just randomly bringing something up, like hey person I work with hat I like I just got an apartment or whatever ,you know.

John and I went to different schools and would talk every now and then and eventually hooked up. Throughout the years, he would always try to reach out to me. 

Last year, we hung out for the first time in five years. I didn’t expect it to be a date but he kissed me and he bought me dinner. We then when on another date where we went on a walk, danced, and opened up. It was cute. A few weeks later he breaks the news to me that he got a job opportunity in another state that is very far away. I immediately thought there is no way this is going to work out. But we would continue to text every now and then and FaceTime once in a while. He would invite me to visit him but this was when Covid first happened and I was terrified. He continued to invite me and said he understood and would treat me well if I ever were to go down. For months, he would ask, and even though I would say no, I really wanted to see him.

Someone in his family passed away and he called me the next morning explaining everything that happened. The service was going to be back at my state and he invited me to the services. He even invited me to see his friends and family. I said no because I was nervous because of the gathering. I felt so guilty I couldn’t be there for him, so I surprised him with a gift when he went back to his state. He said he loved it and admitted that he has liked me for many years. We began opening up to each other about our pasts. He would ask me to visit again and try to plans trips.

Months go by, and we eventually go our separate ways and he got a girlfriend. Who is much more gorgeous lol.

61,q5cb0s,1633886162,Can't find any interested women. Is it me or the times?,"I'm 31 years old and I've never really had a girlfriend. It seems like the older I get the less interested women are in me (not that they ever were particularly) and I seriously wonder sometimes if it's me or the times. 

The only time I've ever got any sort of female attention was in high school and my early 20's. I had an opportunity to lose my virginity when I was 15 to a girl in my grade that was head over heels for me for a reason I couldn't at all understand, but I didn't have the self-confidence to follow through on her advances as I was bullied constantly and considered the ""ugly kid"" in middle school. Having a girl like me obsessively was weird after the girls in middle school thought I was nothing but disgusting, so I sabotaged myself and lost the opportunity. 

Throughout the rest of high school and during parts of my early 20's I also had girls that were (very blatantly) interested in me, but it just didn't work out for whatever reason. I wasn't attracted to them, I fucked it up because I had no game, self-esteem issues ect. 

Ever since around the age of 25 the amount of interested women has been literally zero. So now I sit here, 31 years old, never having had a girlfriend. I always imagined myself as a father and a husband but it seems like time flew by and now I feel like I'm going to end up a bachelor for life. 

I don't think it's due to my desirability dropping (not that I've ever been particularly desirable, because facially I am not very attractive) but I am still in decent shape. My body fat percentage is 12%, I make like 75k a year, still have a full head of hair with no sign of balding, I own two nice vehicles and managed to buy a house a few months ago and am 100% self sufficient. This still probably puts me in the ""average joe"" category, but I would hope it would be enough to find a decent woman. 

I get no success in online dating, at all. In fact I don't do it anymore because it lowers my self esteem so badly. What I'm wondering is online dating and the modern dating landscape really the cause of all this, or is there something wrong with me? The amount of female attention I have gotten seems to directly correlate with the increase of popularity in online dating.

When I was in high school online dating didn't exist. When I was in my early 20's only ""weirdos"" and ""losers"" used online dating. In my mid 20's is when online dating became mainstream and it was like immediately I got no female attention at all. Women seem completely indifferent to me. I feel invisible.

I don't know if it's me or if I really am at a bigger disadvantage than I used to be because everyone is using online dating now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5cb0s/cant_find_any_interested_women_is_it_me_or_the/

So cut to a week maybe two later I ask her out for the weekend. She said she was free on Thursday and wanted to go to our local fair and she said her brother and bestie will be there. I think this is even better because not only do I get to meet her I get to make an impression with her brother as well as her best friend. All good in my mind - And it was we all had a great time for like 3-4hrs of walking around and chatting. I really get along with her as well as her brother/friend. Solid day

We keep chatting and I set up a date again. This girl does work weekends and has a flexible schedule because she works as a waitress/bartender. We set up for Wednesday night which works out since I'm off work at 5pm.

She said I could come to her apartment and she would cook us food and we could hangout.

This girl has such a positive energy about herself. She's confident and fun and just isn't afraid to be herself. I feel like she's what I have been looking for in a girl for a long time just never really met anyone like her. I get like an old school vibe from her and our connection is solid. I feel like I'm not afraid to be myself and idk it's like we can bounce back and forth with each other in a way.

This date went extremely well! We had a great time, talked a lot, ate some good food, even got to snuggle and get close with each other. I haven't felt something so content in years. I was quite grateful I met someone so amazing. The date was 5 hours long and I said I would text her when I went home and then went to sleep. Now I'm crushing on this girl

Here is where I'm needing some advice. Cut to the morning I get a text that reads this exactly

""Hey I'm going off the grid a bit. Shutting down my phone... personal stuff. I need to escape people for a bit. Too much stress for me right now. You can reach me here by text but I am only on my phone twice a day now. Mornings and evenings.""

I said ""I totally understand, we will talk soon""

She said - ""Thank You &lt;3""

Now in my mind this raises some questions and concerns. Firstly she did say You can reach me by text so she still wants to stay in contact. That has to be a positive.

What's concerning is how do I proceed with all this? I am very curious to know what's going on and if everything is ok. Also I'm really trying to see this girl again because I want to still where this leads because it's been so awesome so far.

I was considering texting her either today or tomorrow. I know last night she worked a double and today she works 4pm-11pm but mentioned she is off Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

I just don't wanna screw this up. I'm nervous and excited and hoping to get some advice. Thank you

83,q5ect6,1633892475,Had to end it,"I don't know if this is the right sub to post this but here it goes. I (21f) used dating apps few months back. Met a guy(23f) there who was very different from me but we started talking anyways.

He came out as a bit of self obsessed/narcissist but he wasn't there for serious dating neither was I. We kept talking and he opened up being cheating by his ex several times a year back and how depressed he was. Basically he loved that girl a lot and the cheating shattered him. He wanted to marry her and even his family was aware about her. 

I empathised with his situation due to previous experience in a four month relationship but my hurt was not as deep as his ( his relationship was 2-3 year long). He was on antidepressants and he sounded kinda done with life. We talked quite a lot over text and met him once for a short while. Never thought of dating him cause he wasn't my type , physically or otherwise.

He used to sometimes talk about cuddling with me which I thought was just out of loneliness and hence I told him that would be inappropriate and that was that. He had to go back to his University (he was a medico so super busy schedule) for a while in between and we lost touch for a month. But then he came back after a month and texted me and we got talking again. 

This time I really realised that I liked talking to him. And we talked a lot. We talked all day. He had his flaws. His thinking was quite conservative ( I m liberal) but still he was not a bad person. 

And then he started saying I love you to me often. And even talked about spending some time together. I told him clearly that I don't like saying I love you to anyone. And I am not into flings. He still kept talking about cuddling and the I love yous kept increasing. He would get upset if I wouldn't say it back. And then he even progressed to saying he really had the desire to kiss me. All this while I had started liking him a lot but he still talked about his ex once in a while and he had told me earlier that he wasn't ready for dating. So I knew it would only lead to me being hurt. 

I was really confused about confronting him cause our bond was mostly over texts. And also I did like him. But then finally I just got tired of his request to meet sometime and cuddle. I understood that he needed some emotional and physical love but I was not into flings and I was not sure if he would really be with me( cause I am not a stunner and this guy had options  the way he described). 

So I asked him directly if he would date me? And he said I knew his circumstances and he can't date anyone. So I said it clearly that don't say love you to me when you don't mean it. And I am not into flings so talking about kissing or cuddling or more is highly inappropriate. Also he got angry if I would go offline and won't ping him for few hours. So I felt that behaviour was inappropriate if he wasn't even ready to date. I told him if he wanted to be a friend he was free to ping me anytime but better not say I love you and all. 

We did not talk for 24 hours after that. And then he just pinged me "" I need you"". And it just gave me a vibe that he was lonely or he was trying to fill a void with me. 

Then he said ""and would you date me?"" And I replied ""no because I know that's not what you want. You are not even interested"". He said he was interested but I feel he liked me , even loved me but he was so stuck on his ex and often talked about contacting her ( but she was with someone else so he didn't)so I just felt he wasn't 100 percent into it. So I said no you are not. And he ended up blocking me which felt bad for a while. And that time I was taken aback so I pinged him on another social media platform. 

We talked for a bit and he said he found it tough to talk to me now given what I said yesterday. I asked him what he meant. He said he felt clingy but the truth is I never implied he was clingy. I really cared for him. But I can't act like his girlfriend when ik he will not make me one. It would be some fling or something casual. I would give way more than I would recieve. So he wished me luck for future. I did the same and asked him to block me cause otherwise out of concern I would have texted him ( I get too attached too easily and take a while to get detached even if the situation is unhealthy). 

He blocked me . It was an hour back. And I feel sad and devastated. I like him a lot but ik if I continue this both of us will get hurt . I am tired of getting hurt. Hopefully I will feel better in few days.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5ect6/had_to_end_it/

I met one guy online who was the same culture as me. At that I was seeing what was out there, not laying any roots down. But because he was of the same ethnicity, conversations flowed better, and there was a general cultural understanding. This stood out at the time cause I didn’t realise til then… the difference? I don’t know if I made sense.
Anyway, we decided that we’ll hang out. We ended up doing things. We kept this going for a few months.. and (with a few breaks here and there) carried on for a year or so.
While dealing with him, I admit that I caught feelings. Not extreme feelings. But I cared for the dude. We became friends - to my understanding. I knew what was up with him and why he was just sleeping around. I accepted that for what that was and took what I could I get out of it. I tried to get him out of his funk, but maybe my method wasn’t great. 
We ended up calling it. I can’t really remember how it ended. He either ghosted me or I ghosted him. Either way, we called it.  

Few years down the line, he texted me through viber. Which was strange.. I wasnt expecting it. I was in a different mind space, more emotionally aware of implications that follow after falling for their tricks. I was friendly and kind, but very not interested in any one way transaction. He was kind, more open and seemed happier than when I left him or when he left me. We start talking again. The whole time I was waiting for the shoe to drop. And when it did, he was gonna get it.
He dropped.. more like he slammed the shoe by saying some shit bout my mouth technique being one of his favourites and wishing to see me again. I shut that shit down ASAP!
That same year, but a few months down I was hanging with one of my friends when she mentioned that she made some new friends. She mentioned his name and we fact checked by checking his Instagram. 
I told her everything. 

This year comes around, we hang. I’ll occasionally ask her about him and she would say nothing in depth about it. Until she opened up about seeing a new guy. I probe, she doesnt give any details but that he stepped in when she needed it the most. Month down the road I find out (not by her) that she is seeing him. She hid it cause of our close friendship.

90,q5em0l,1633893250,Should I tell him I like him?,"Hi!

So I'm writing because I'm not sure what to do. The story goes like this. In the first grade I (F) started liking a classmate (M) of mine. 6 years later he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I ecstatically said yes, because I *really* liked this dude. For whatever reason though I couldn't muster up the courage to talk to him after that in fear of ruining the 'relationship', because I was highly insecure at the time. To no surprise, after two days of this he ended things, because I didn't talk to him at all when we met face to face. 

Fast forward a couple of years. We haven't talked much but we're in the same friend group so we spend some time together. I'm in a relationship but I still feel the funny feelings for my cursh that I did in the first grade. Fast forward to this summer. I break up with my boyfriend and my crush also gets out of a short relationship he was in. We meet up and chat and things are really nice. We have a lot in common, we have a good time, and he tells me he's positively surprised how well we've been getting along.

Why I'm writing here is that I'm not sure whether I should tell him I like him or not. I'm not expecting him to have the same feelings for me, but I hate this uncertainty. I'm afraid of telling him because I fear I'll lose the friendship that has begun blossoming in the last few years, since he's a really cool dude. On the other hand I had a small crush on some other dude and found out he recently got married, so I can't stop thinking about missing my chance to tell my current crush in fear of him finding someone before I get the opportunity. 

I guess I just feel like there are no right options here and I keep going back and forth. Plus we live two hours apart from each other. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Does anyone have any insight? Anything is appreciated :)

However, I get so nervous to talk to him bc I know I really really like him. My mind goes absolutely blank and I don’t want to ask a question that seems like I don’t know what to say around him.

I’m pretty naturally reserved so that makes it worse. However, when I’ve had a drink to keep me sociable I find myself more loose and can talk to him. Not exactly how I’d like to, but I can hold a conversation.

I don’t want to have to drink to talk to him though. He finds himself comfortable around me and he sometimes also gets choked up.. but I feel like I look bad bc I look like I’m not comfortable around him.

What mentality can I adopt that will make it easier just to say what’s on my mind as if I’m with my best friend??  

I really want him to get to know the real me. He’s seen me, but not the loose and care-free me.

Does this mean we’re just not compatible?? Or that it isn’t meant to be? This is the first guy I’ve dated after my break up btw.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5ergl/too_nervous_to_know_what_to_say_when_im_around/

This is the impression I got off this girl I was seeing, I'm kicking myself because I never reassured her ever because I didn't want to seem clingy, instead I think it just filled her with doubt because I was aloof. She told me on the first date she is socially awkward, I was stupid and tried to be cool and said ""I know"", retrospectively I cringe so hard because she was opening up to me. I may have savaged it somewhat because I jokingly smiled and squeezed her shoulder a bit. She ended it recently after the second date, and I didnt ask her to elaborate why. But she did say she ""really really likes me"" which has just felt me confused more than anything.

 Really bummed because it was probably my fault inadvertently and I did truly like her. Maybe I'm just overthinking it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5f03o/do_girls_ever_breakup_with_guys_because_they/

96,q5f9z0,1633895305,Feeling disgusted,"The girl I liked for 3 years confessed to me 2 months ago. I was over joyed and accepted it without thinking.

At the start it was decent, but I was starting to feel like she never really put in any effort. Like literally not texting me until I text her, going days without talking if I don’t, no flirting…basically we were like friends (wh rarely talked 💀). I took all this thinking ‘after all it’s her’ like damn I was blinded by my liking for her.

But this started bothering me a lot and I wanted to confront her but I justified it to myself saying ‘all that touchy feely stuff is for kids, this is nothing’, now after 2 months she broke up with me and told me ‘she wasn’t involved because she wasn’t ready for a relationship’ and I feel absolutely disgusted at myself for bearing this and not dumping her myself.

I’m a 19yr old male and I’m honestly super innocent. I’ve never kissed a girl, done drugs or anything of that sort.

I’m just a regular kid into sports, music and working out, very independent also. However, I don’t know if women would be into a guy that has no relationship/sexual experience.

So I’m just asking if a girl would be interested in someone like me, because it hasn’t happened yet. Honest answers please thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5fhkn/do_girls_find_innocent_men_cute_19m/
