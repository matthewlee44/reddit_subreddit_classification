Am I running away too quickly?

My girlfriend (f25) of 6 months lives with her parents, day drinks, says she doesn’t like working and currently has no job and no desire to get one. She was going to school when we met but has since dropped out. She smokes weed all day (I also do like smoking but not all day). She currently walks a dog every day a few times a day and that’s her entire responsibility. She watches tik tok and Netflix all day and plays games on steam. 

Here is the problem, I love who she was when we met and recently she’s been sorta half there. Sometimes we talk for hours and sometimes she says almost nothing and just stares. She doesn’t talk about any of her issues and refuses to get therapy for many reasons. She also says she will do everything in her power to not get a job but she’s so stupidly talented. She does graphic design stuff for herself (not as a job) and I keep telling her she should pursue that but she has insecurities and always has a reason to not go after it. 

I was so attracted to the artistic side of her and the ambition when we met but now I feel like it isn’t what I thought it was. The sex is amazing and we have really good days and sorta bleh days. Should I try and help her out if this slump and wait it out or call it? I work 2 jobs full time plus I write scripts for a Netflix tv show on the side and I don’t know if we have aligning life goals which makes me so sad.

More of a Learn-From-My-Mistakes than an I-Need-Advice... I know what I have to do.

This is going to wander a little... Bear with my heart. Letting all of this out.

I (30f) started dating a wonderful man (39m) last summer. This man was warm, had heart, was tender and would just melt me with the most irresistible puppy eyes- Had all the love and sweetness I'd been craving.

But, right off of the bat, on our second date, I saw how his mood could just SWITCH. He'd go from swaggeringly confident and jovial to aggressive and irritable within an hour. As our relationship continued, this trend stayed present, but the wonderful experiences I had with him made his mood swings a small price to pay. He warned me that he could be insulting and that he frequently offended people. I told him I'd give him grace, as I felt I'd been through the worst that could possibly happen with my ex. (And, by god, grace was needed. There were insulting things said.)

The sex was always a little strange- The first time we were intimate, we were both so drunk we didn't remember each other's tattoos the next day- But I do remember something that struck me as strange. He held his body away from mine. There wasn't snuggling or embracing- It was almost distance-fucking. I chalked it up to a new experience at the time, and let it go.  
As we progressed and developed feelings for each other, the sex was addictive- We'd finish, snuggle a little, look at each other, and go again. He'd send flowers with love notes, I'd cook us dinner. I told him I was thinking about starting college, and he told me he'd be right there at my side. ""Your success is our success."" Gave me a key to his apartment. Sent gorgeous gifts.  
I knew I had everything I'd ever wanted. I told my friends I'd consider marriage. I was head over heels.

Then I was called away by work for two months. The first three weeks, we did fine... Zoom dates, and even fell asleep on Zoom together. It was the sweetest, and I felt so happy, supported, and in love...   


Then one day, a few days after a fight (I missed one of our digital dates due to overloading myself with work, and was not my best self about it) our connection was just GONE. Poof.  


The last five weeks of my two-month deployment was desperation on my end, apathy on his. I wrote letters. Texted. Sent little presents and treasures. Sent him on little surprise dates which he accepted, but there was an emptiness about it- He was doing it like he was doing a chore for which he got rewarded, not because he was excited about me. While I was gone, I was dreaming of coming home to him... While I was away, I guess he was letting go of me.

When I finally returned, I came back to a different person. I barely recognized him. There was a glassiness in his eyes, and deep sadness. He wouldn't touch me, would barely kiss me. That physical distance was very present again, and when I tried to touch him, he'd move away. Any fool could figure out that he felt like I chose work and money over our relationship (This job paid 4x what I usually make).

Over the winter months, I chased that goddamn motherfucker as hard as a girl can chase a guy.  
Bought presents. Concert tickets. Fancy sushi dinner, where he kept staring at other girls, literally twisting in his chair to watch someone as she walked past. Cooked dinner for his friends, and for his family on TGS, only to be ignored as a reward. Took him on a blindfolded date to a movie he'd mentioned. Wrote letters. Asked to have deep talks. I worked stupid hard all winter, cooking for his friends, him, his parties, helping with whatever I could, bringing him soup when he was sick, riding through the winter rain on my motorcycle just to see him... His roommate, a sweet man, said, ""Why don't you let her borrow a truck? You have two."" My boyfriend just stared at the TV and didn't reply. His nonverbal skills are strong... And god, that cut to the bone. 

As for that amazing sex... It's vaporized. We haven't been intimate since last August, before I left. I've tried, over and over. When I reach out for him, I literally feel like he's repulsed by me, and he doesn't return my touches. I bought gorgeous, expensive lingerie in his favorite color and wore it to bed after I'd made us dinner... He said, ""That looks nice,"" and rolled over to go to sleep.

It was all returned with stonewalling, bitterness, blame, sarcasm, and explosive anger. Found his Reddit, where he talked about being single literally the week I'd taken him on another special date. We weren't in the same world. The insults grew in strength and number, and he established a pattern of blow up, stonewall, apologize, repeat.

None of my bids for connection were being met. I cried, hurt, had glorious pity parties, ate tons of chocolate, gained 10lbs. I was a damn mess.

I drifted into depression, languished for a couple weeks, recognized where I was, then talked to a dr, got on a low dose antidep and started working patiently with a slightly clueless therapist.

Simultaneously, I've watched his health and mental health decline... He used to be a bodybuilder, and has been too depressed to go to the gym for months. He's mentioned cocaine and cheap handjobs quite a few times. That could be a confession or just a distancing technique- Regardless, not what you say to your girlfriend.

We talked, about a month ago. We agreed that we want a relationship with each other, we're both special finds, we could be a power couple, ect... But he still holds himself away from me. To kiss me, he leans in on his toes to be as far from me as possible and pecks my lips. I ask for hugs, for touch, for anything to feel connected in this sexless relationship... And he does it like he's fulfilling a request, not because he wants to. There's such an energetic difference.

But he's up late on Messenger while ignoring all of my FB posts (used to be my biggest fan) he stays the night, but it feels like a special chore to accomplish, he doesn't introduce me as his girlfriend anymore, hides his phone when he's using it around me, (if he's sharing the screen to show me something, he puts it on do not disturb and doesn't let me touch it, while he takes my phone and scrolls around on it freely) we talk about our goals and future but he's usually drifting a million miles away. When I do have his full attention, he watches me with narrowed brows and it's like he's looking for anything to pick apart, rather than being warmly interested in what I have to say.

I know and have known exactly what all of this means, but I've been waiting around, hoping to hear the words.

I don't feel love from him anymore.  
There's care.  
But I don't feel love and I'm destroyed over that loss.

I looked over our old messages yesterday and cried for hours. The sweetness that came out of him compared to the bitterness now... Fuck, it hurt to see that.   
I'm so twisted up over this... I know it's dead. I know all of the signs. I know I have to let it go. I should have let it go back in November instead of killing myself this winter trying to raise the dead. Maybe it would have been better for both of us.

But, God, I loved him... He was perfect.

He was perfect.

In summary, from an external viewpoint, this was a trauma bond. He and I were both recovering from awful life experiences that had happened just before we met. I'm grateful and glad that I got to experience it, all of it. I've learned how to accept disappointment, be alone, stand up for my needs, spot red flags early, and now... I have to learn the lesson of ending something I would have loved to have in my life forever.

In other words, a capacity for violence. Now for women, I can understand them wanting a man who is willing to do that; a lot of women like to feel protected by a strong man.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this is male-centric is because I (24M) find a willingness to fight and kill highly attractive in women. See, a few years ago, my ex-girlfriend was out in the woods visiting her grandparents, when her dad encountered a rattlesnake. She had a machete near her and ended up decapitating it before it could bite her father. And when she told me about it, she wasn't very upset about having to kill it. Ever since my ex-girlfriend saved her father's life, I've always found a ""killer instinct"" extremely attractive in women.

&amp;#x200B;

But knowing this about myself does kind of worry me. I've always found strong women appealing--and growing up in a time when action chicks like Xena and Samus Aran were celebrated probably helped--but I do think that finding it attractive when a woman has the nerve to fight and kill (even if it's to hunt) might be a bit weird or disturbing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking to date a criminal or anything, but a capacity for violence comes off to me as strong and a little masculine, and it honestly makes my thoughts turn to proposing to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

So is it weird, abnormal, or wrong for a guy to find a ""killing instinct"" attractive in women? Maybe someone in r/RoleReversal might say it isn't--no shade to them--but I genuinely am worried and insecure about that.

I saw on his IG story that he was out with a friend so I just asked what they were getting up to tonight. He said “That’s my friend James who’s gonna be with us on Tuesday.”

This was the first I had heard of this. 

I asked for clarification and he said “We always hit the games together. He’s really really chill. We’ll still do our thing. he’ll just ‘be around’ lol hopefully that’s cool.” 

I don’t like the idea of it, although I’m not quite sure why I don’t?

I had recently (a week ago) been dumped by a girl that I’ve been dating for a year and 2 months. We fought quite a lot due to miscommunications and external situations that I could not control. I had helped her become confident and guided her through a lot of her insecurities. 2 weeks prior to our final breakup, I was trying to address an action of hers that made me uncomfortable and she had impulsively broke up with me. 2 days later she texted me saying she wants to be with me and she was sorry for being so selfish and I decided to give it another shot. The following week she was very distant and focused on herself(as she should) and I increasingly became insecure due to lack of trust from breaking my heart the first time.

The next day she wanted to talk and broke up with me. I was so upset because I felt as if my new found insecurities, weren’t worth her time to help me through so I blew up (worst mistake ever) and expressed how selfish she’s been in the relationship and she left the car.

I wrote an extremely long letter during this time to express what I’ve learned through our relationship and I wanted to show her I understand what happened and could start our relationship anew and healthily. She cried and then responded “thank you and you’ll be okay” I told her that I love her and she said “I love the person you are” and then proceeded to say how she wants to block me on social media because she couldn’t bare to see me with other women.

Honestly it was a mess, I could barely form a coherent sentence because I was so angry, I just screamed at him. Didn’t even ask about the girl he met this year, we just argued about him sleeping with his friends (now ex) gf.

It happened while I was on a break with him because I needed to fix my insecurity issues LOL. Imagine I’m working on my jealousy while he’s fucking someone else.

He seems to think he didn’t do anything wrong, as we weren’t “in a relationship” but mentally I was still 100% in it. We never had a discussion about boundaries on the break, and I never asked him if he spoke to/slept with anyone, because I didn’t think I’d have to. I thought it was a given that this was a temporary split for my mental health.

The fact he was so remorseless about fucking over his friend is definitely sending alarm bells ringing in my head too. Like how can you just do someone like that?

The worst part is he literally just said “this convo is going nowhere with you so mad, so I’m going to bed we’ll talk in the morning”.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you're well!

&amp;#x200B;

I habe a question on how to look more approachable and would be grateful if you guys could help me :)

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently moved to the U.S from a middle eastern country where the dating culture is quite different and am having trouble connecting with men over here: in the past coupe of months, I have been approached by a couple of guys (they either verbally showed their interest and in two cases they wrote letters) but those were the ones that know me for some time and I considered them as friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that I do see men staring at me when I'm in a cafe with my friends or in other setting such as hospital, shops, libraries, etc but they almost never approach me. I would say my appearance is ok and I always try to be put together. I asked my friends for feedback and their said it might be due to me not making eye contacts and keeping a poker face.. Unfortunately in our culture women are we taught to not look at men while talking to them so this makes it extremely hard for me to make eye contact with men while talking to them, but I'm working on it. In the meantime would appreciate any other tips/helps on being more approachable. Is there anything other than eye contact/smile that would help?

I (33M) was in a relationship for about a decade. 

After nearly 10 years of gas lighting, being the only one who worked the entire time (we did not have kids either) and bring constantly put down some bad things happened and me and my partner parted ways. The entire time I was with her, no one ever really flirted with me, wanted me, wanted to know more about me, made advancements at me. Ever. No one asked, no one knew she was there. Which is fine, because I'm loyal and dedicated, I've never cheated and never would.

After we parted ways some very bad things happened to me, but instead of writing a small novel about all that I would rather just post some observations and ask some questions.

I have been on all the dating sites (Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, FaceBook Dating) for about a year and a half now. I have made it a mission and swiped right on I can't even imagine how many girls. It absolutely must be in the hundreds of thousands at this point. I am not super picky at all, in fact I don't care how much money a girl makes, what kind of music she likes, what hobbies she has but one thing I ask is at the very least she be just moderately in shape.

I am not talking perfection, I don't care if she has a few extra pounds or isn't built perfect. I don't care if she wears glasses, I don't care if she's a bit dorky or this or that or the other, but I'm a very serious amateur athlete (I make my money elsewhere) but take fitness very serious. I am not attracted to people who are really big. I'm sorry. Aside from that I am pretty open.

The thing is, I have been back stabbed, thrown away, had kind games played on me for years and have been through some very traumatic things in life. I do not take anti depressants or medication and do my absolute best. I stay positive, I'm outgoing and kind, I work out, I participate in many groups and do things, I put myself out there yet... No one ever wants anything to do with me.

I'm not the kind for hookups, but no one has wanted me in that way either for years. I have not had sex in years. Anytime I have started getting to know a girl in real life it seems some other dude swoops in and tries to compete with me and steal her away and it's like I always lose this competition. I'm tired of competing, if someone wants me I'm here but if I have to compete, is that love?

In this year and a half or so on the dating sites the only girls to ever like me are extremely big girls. Girls who have liked me that are not extremely big I can count on one hand. Of all the girls I have swiped right on I would say around 100 have matched up. Of those 100 only about 25 or so ever responded.

Of those 25 or so to ever respond less than 10 ever took the conversation past a few texts and of those I only ever met 1 girl I person just recently...

Now, the lovely thing about all of these dating sites is that apparently women have an entire lineup of men at all times. You are one of hundreds on a daily basis. They can pick and choose quite easily. Even if you look at social media you will notice most girls have thousands of followers and thousands of friends, some guys have hundreds but for me? I have less than 100 friends on Facebook and less than 100 followers on Instagram. I participate on both quite regularly as well and I run groups and even do photography.

Whenever I talk to these girls on the dating sites it feels like I'm on trial, it feels like a job interview. There were a few times where I started getting to know these girls and it was actually going really well, we had a lot in common and seeing to really be connecting in our personalities... Then all of a sudden they just stopped talking as much, then they stopped talking at all. Somebody better, with more money, bigger biceps comes around. Currently I am a full-time student, and I'm not in poverty by any stretch of the imagination and have the money to do things. I'm working towards a career that will make a whole lot of money very soon, but I'm not quite there just yet.

I am a very adventurous person, I have been told I am a very patient and understanding person I know how to love somebody very hard, and be there for them anytime they would need me. I don't judge people or their past...

Because I have been through some really bad things it's hard for me to fully open up really fast, and it would be nice if someone would actually gain my trust instead of asking me to just give them every bit of it without even telling me why. I have had people tell me to open up to them and when I do, they tell me it's okay to ask them questions they tell me it's okay tell them my fears and concerns and when I do they say no thank you, throw me away and block me.

I have been told to just be me and then when I am just me, it's like it's not okay that I have been through some bad things in my. Been told by some people that I need to go out and ""heal"" But I have spent years working on myself, doing my own thing... It really gets lonely and there have been some very hurtful times and I think myself it would be so nice just to have somebody who is happy to see me to build memories with, to grow old with, explore and have adventures with.

Of all the girls who actually did talk to me at length it seems like they all have a guy best friend and this is supposed to be totally okay. Not just one but usually several guy best friends. And you know why? That's fine by me... But then they will go hang out with them till 3:00 a.m. and not say anything about where they've been. If you even hint or mention or wonder what was going on you get immediately blocked and thrown away. I have had them tell me that it should be totally fine to spend the night at their guy best friends house even if they're in a relationship. That they should be able to travel with their guy best friend. That they should be able to go and have dinner with their guy best friend several times a week. Is this really how things work nowadays?

It feels as if a relationship is simply just a position like a job now. I have a few friends, and they're good people and I'm happy with that but I'm not super close to them. It feels like so many people want some enormous circle of friends that they put all of their heart soul and emotions into it. It's almost as if it's wrong to put your emotion into a relationship, and that you're supposed to put emotion into the friendships and that a relationship is just there and if it's not that's fine too. 

I have had some people tell me I am a very confident outgoing person and I like to think that I am. I'm definitely outgoing and I do have confidence myself, but it feels like if you have any insecurities deep down whatsoever that that's wrong and that you should not be in a relationship or have anybody. That if you don't have a thousand friends and you spend 90% of your time with them that it's wrong to want anybody.

It's funny too because I've actually had a few girls around my age who have been in are still very good friends of mine but their spouses do not want them to hang out solely with me. Poor people on the other side from my perspective it's like I don't get to hang out with my lady friends because their spouse wouldn't be okay with it. I'm talking in the middle of the day too, and once every couple of weeks or so maybe. Nope.

I have been told that I need to be totally okay inside my head and that I should also be better off financially... Why is it not okay just to be mean? I pay for my bills and I pay for my own food and I have my own transportation. Before long I will actually have very good money and then a lot of money but I'm doing my career because I love what I do and I'm very passionate about my work. When I have a ton of money I'm not the kind of go out and want to I just want to be able to travel around the world and explore and do fun things and participate in my hobbies. I would love somebody that would like to share that with me... But apparently I'm not worthy. I'm never good enough and I always get thrown away, but that's not supposed to take away any of my confidence, right? 

I'm 33 and watch everyone around me, with their kids and their families and their lives and their husbands. And I have been alone for years... I try to be a gentleman and I'm not trying to get into anybody's pants. I have always felt and said that I wanted whoever I was in a relationship with to be my best friend and I've always felt that to get to that point you have to be okay being best friends with people which I have been and even made it clear that I would like that, but when they are not in the position for that or maybe they don't want that for me that's totally fine... But no one ever does. Still I'm fine being mean but it seems like That's all I ever worth being, never somebody's partner.

I have heard of girls who say they have been through some really traumatic things and that they need someone to have patients with them and it seems like that's totally fine for them... But for a guy it's like it's not okay to have been through some bad stuff, that no one should need to have any patience with you. You should be turn key, ready to go in every way.

Not to sound cliche but it seems like they're really truly is no true love anymore. It's just a job that has a very extension set of qualifications now. And even though I have some great qualities that I could bring to the corporation, I have to meet all of the qualifications. 

I have been told that I'm very funny, that I'm great at conversation, that I'm genuine and that I have a big heart. I'm patient understanding. I have been told that I'm fun to be around. But it's like no matter how hard I try it's never enough... But I'm still supposed to be confident.

I finally had my first date out of all these dating sites just recently... I did my absolute best and really had a lot of fun. I was trying very hard not to say anything wrong through the text conversations... But this person asked me to open up a bit, that it was okay to tell some of my fears and worries... And when I did in the nicest way possible and even explained that I wasn't upset, that I didn't think they were doing anything but that I was just curious how certain things work they told me good luck, and blocked me. That's a very sharp stinging pain and I've had that and many others happen over a very long course of time not just recently.

I'm sure once I do have plenty of money then people will be interested in me... And at that time I will have no interest in them. I don't want people to want me for my money. I love my career and would want to do nothing else in my and I feel truly blessed to be able to be doing what I'm doing right now. I've had a passion for it since I was a kid. But I don't want someone to want me just because of the money I have and something like that. I want someone to want me just for being me. But it feels like I'm never high enough on the totem pole to be anyone's choice, people get chosen over me and it's always a game. 

I wish with all my heart I could just feel what it was like for somebody to genuinely care about me, to be excited to see me, to put their arms around me and tell me it's okay that I'm not perfect. I would give that person so much love, so much devotion and dedication, so much patience. I wouldn't care if they had friends, I'm sure they're an adult and they would have their own stuff going on but I wish so bad I could be important to some of like that and know that when I came home at the end of the day they were there for me.

I’m new to reddit and the advice that I am offering is likely to be found elsewhere. However, I feel it incumbent upon me to offer some insight, given my station in life. I’m 42(M) and have been married for almost 19 years. I am a working professional and a father of two young daughters. I’m a highly typical man of my age but am an astute observer of the human condition. 

If anyone delves deeper into my posts/comments, you’ll see that I have an embarrassing romantic history and am married to a woman who would up with me as a matter of happenstance; I was there (we were friends in college) when the love of her life forced her hand (he cheated and told her that he would date both my now-wife and the girl that he cheated with; my wife refused and dumped him to her dismay). He was clearly the love of her life (she would have married him if he would have asked, a point that she confirmed as recently as yesterday) and she has made a variety of comments over the years (along with some actions…or inactions, I should say) about him that place him above me in her mind.

With that said, despite my lack of skill in the game, I understand the game. Nick Saban was a mediocre college football player at a mid-major program but is the greatest college football coach in history. This is not to compare me to Saban but to illustrate that skill in the game and skill coaching the game are not the same thing. 

For all of the men here wondering, “How do I get a girlfriend?”, here is a primer:

First and foremost, here are three heuristics to keep in mind:

1)	“Be yourself” is awful advice. It’s the sort of thing that people say because they have to, like “I’m sorry” after your father dies or “I liked it” after watching the film Juno. If being yourself was great advice, you wouldn’t be asking for help on reddit on a Saturday night; you’d be having sex with your girlfriend. 

2)	No one owes you anything. Relationships and sex are not rights that you are entitled to. It’s fine to be frustrated but you don’t get to be pissed off at the girls that don’t want to fuck you. You can be mad at the situation but not them.

3)	Not all things are for all people. The odds are that you will find someone to date at some point. This, however, is not ensured. As a result, your dream of sleeping with tons of girls is not going to happen. If it were, you wouldn’t be here on a Saturday night (see #1 above). You likely have many gifts; the ability to attract women is not one of them, so adjust your dreams accordingly. 

In respect to what to do to increase your odds of getting a girl, here is some advice. Make note that I did not state that “This is how to get a girlfriend”, as the advice below is not universal.

1)	Be hot. This one is simple but difficult, like lifting a heavy rock on Dagobah. Tall, good looking guys just have to show up and women flock to them; that’s life. There is nothing that you can do to make yourself 6’4”. There is little that can be done (reasonably) to make yourself handsome. You can (largely) control your weight and physical fitness, so this is a solid place to start. However, 5’6” and jacked is a bad look, so go for fitness instead of muscle (unless you are already tall).

2)	Be rich. Like being hot, this is simple yet difficult. Wealth opens a lot of doors in society and dating is one of those doors. This is not to say that women want money (some certainly do) but unless you are bringing something else to the table (such as hotness), the lifestyle that your money can buy will go a long way. Being able to take a girl on a spontaneous vacation, for example, is a huge draw. 

3)	Be talented (publicly). If you have a strong talent in a performance art, lean on that. Playing an instrument, acting, standup comedy, and anything athletic are good places to start. The key is that they are public. Remember the stupid douchebag jocks in high school that chicks loved? A lot of that had to do with the referent power that came from their public displays of excellence. Private talents (programming, etc.) don’t work, as no one sees you doing it and, most importantly, no one cheers for you while doing it. With that said, open mic nights, starting a band, joining a team, etc. may prove useful. 

4)	Be part of a scene. If you don’t have any performance-based talent, at least be part of a scene. Lots of girls are into lots of things and the ways that you meet them are by being at those things over and over again. Being a regular within a certain scene (live bluegrass music, street racing, dog shows, etc.) will expose you to women within that scene. You can’t go just once and expect results – you need to be a regular that the women see there often. From there, perhaps some rapport can be built.

Our most recent text was me replying to him Thursday afternoon. 
Background:
I met guy out one night and we quickly exchanged numbers and hit it off. One of the first things I said to him that night was “are you one of those guys that is gonna waste my time and is going to tell me he’s not looking for a relationship?” He told me that he did get out of a relationship a few months ago but that he is open to a potential relationship if things naturally go that way. I told him I was on the same page. 

We’ve been on a few dates and on the second date things got pretty hot and heavy he asked if we wanted to have sex but I told him that I need to be exclusive with someone before doing that.  right then and there he said that he wanted to be exclusive and that that wasn’t a problem for him. I told him that it might be a little soon to decide on that and then he agreed and said he didn’t wanna pressure me if I wasn’t ready and that it is no rush.  The frequency of us talking has been us seeing each other once a week and pretty much texting every single day. Some days we only exchange one or two texts and we have gone a day without contact before. 
On the fourth date we did end up having sex we got caught up in the moment but right before we were about to do it I confirmed with him that I want to be exclusive and he said he agreed. We have still been consistently talking to each other the same as before and recently I spent the night at his house with him and he let me stay there in the morning while he had to leave for work he told me I could  “stay as long as I wanted.” We texted a little bit after that but then noticed that this past week he hasn’t been contacting me as much as before. The most recent text was from me so I feel that he should be the one reaching out now? I’m not sure if this is a red flag or not but we’ve gone 2 days without talking to each other which is the longest we’ve gone. I’m not sure if this is just normal and he is getting into a more normal routine with us talking to each other? But it gives me anxiety.

After a month he ended things, saying he doesn’t think we are meant to be. It was like a knife to my heart, but I accepted it and moved on….Or tried to. 

After about 2months I started questioning if I had major red flags, or what made him feel the way he did. I reached out to ask his reasons for the breakup. He said nothing was wrong with me, he just didn’t have those feelings for me. 

Since reaching out we’ve started talking more and more as friends. Even got lunch &amp; caught up with each other. He crossed the friendship line with flirting, and kissed me. I said I can do either a relationship or friendship, but I’m not settling for in between. He said he likes me, and wants to keep see me again. He also said he’s not sure if what he wants exists, or if he should just stay alone. This was 2 weeks ago and he’s asking me to hangout tomorrow to watch movies before work. Should I go?

I understand my friends say “he just wants sex”  “your boosting his ego “ “he’s using u “ etc.

While that may be true.. I like him. I like his honesty. I told him we can be friends. He told me he jerks off before seeing me bc he has to in order to focus. He is respectful of my boundaries, but he still flirts and is open to doing things if I want to. I’m wondering if it is a commitment thing, if he just wants sex, &amp; if men can grow feelings for someone over time?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163456,public,nsfw,Should I still pursue a guy I like eventhough he said we aren’t meant for each other?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tcyxy4/should_i_still_pursue_a_guy_i_like_eventhough_he/,no_ads,0,,,

It seems like the guys I have gone on dates with want to move too fast into making me their girlfriend within a few weeks or sexual stuff. I am using online dating since I’m kind of a homebody. Online dating is not an organic way of dating, we all know that. To me it feels forced compared to meeting someone at work or someplace else and getting to know the person before even going on a “date”. With online dating it feels like there is a rush to move fast with everything. Maybe men want to have sex, maybe they think there is all these other men they have to compete with so they want to rush into making a woman their girlfriend , Maybe both. But to me it is just too fast for me to expect I sleep with a guy on a third date or kiss him on the first date. What is the best way to explain this to a guy? I want to be able to explain it clearly so that I can weed out men who are not ok with this and also explain so they understand. I also don’t want a guy to feel like I am just leading him on and wasting his time. I have tried explaining to one guy why I didn’t want to be his girlfriend yet after two months of dating, and he thought I must be seeing other men. It is important that I take my time. 

Should I say I just want to start off as friends first ? So that there are no expectations? Or just say that I need to take things slow and get to know the person before jumping into sex or a relationship? The only thing with the friend thing is that I would assume that men would be irritated to pay for dinner for a “friend”, but I’m also not in a position to be splitting restaurant dates so with dating men have always payed for dates. Also not sure what “friends” would do on outings together besides resteraunt dates. I do see however on peoples profiles, even men, that some would like to start off as friends first.

I was friends with his housemates, we'd grab drinks and go home together after parties and make breakfast, and the sex was very sweet and tender and passionate. He told me he has had periods of his life where he questioned the role sex played for him, but he was always very into me. He's a lovely human and I do not regret it at all!

After not seeing each other for a month, he expresses that he wanted to ease back into the physical aspect of our friendship. He apologized for being slow and we continued to hang out platonically. When I checked back in and asked if maybe the physical aspect was completely off the table (which would be totally fine!) he gave an ambiguous answer saying not necessarily. The next party he said something flirty to me and I thought that was a green light to make a move. His housemate also encouraged me, so I got in bed to hold him but was promptly rejected. He later clarified that he actually meant to say no to physical stuff last time but ""didn't want to be harsh"" and I apologized profusely and told him just to be honest next time.

We saw each other again at a party and it was very fun. I asked if he wanted to watch sports again (I had gone over to watch with his household a week prior) and also drop off some baked goods. I like to give them to friends and have brought them to him before. He ended up being busy. Then I learned about an event that happens every Friday and thought he might be interested so shared it with him. He said ""uh I might be too tired"" to which I was like lol I'm not even going just thought this was up your alley. The next day I get a long text apologizing for being curt (I didn't think he was?) and saying the night a few weeks ago when I misread his intentions actually ""got to him"" more than he wanted to admit. He said it wasn't my fault at all and it would've been nice to watch sports and eat pastries with me and asked what my plans for the week were.

??? I'm confused because I thought we had already cleared things up and were totally normal the next time we saw each other. I'm obviously going to reply and reassure him and maybe ask for clarification. But I'm curious what are your thoughts? Do you think he thinks I overstepped being friendly and didn't realize that's my normal platonic self? Does he actually not want to hang out but feels guilty so apologized and said he wanted to just to be nice? I also feel bad if I really made him uncomfortable that night and he won't tell me because he's too kind.

TLDR: Former casual fling asked to step back a little from physical intimacy. Miscommunication and an awkward situation happened but I thought we cleared it up. I was glad we could be friends and did my normal friend things weeks later like offer baked goods and see if he wanted to watch sports but he was busy. Then he sent a long text apologizing even though he hadn't done anything wrong and saying the situation did actually get to him even though he seemed fine the next time we met, said he wished we did hang out.

Is this true?

Also about what I'm doing right now, I am actually getting more fixated  on becoming a game developer rather than getting a girlfriend, I mean sure I do definitely sure as hell want one because I've never really experienced what it is like, plus I would also like to get married and have kids one day.

But I feel that what I'm doing at the moment is actually not only going to be beneficial for myself, but also my love life because then I wont be super clingy or needy or any of the stuff that really annoys women.

But yeah what's funny though is that I'm starting to find myself post more on game dev subreddits rather than dating ones lol.

We had a great connection going on, and we spent several days together. One night, he introduced me to some other people we met at the hotel. One of them was ""Jack"". Jack went to the bartender and asked if any of us wanted anything. I asked him if he could get me a water.

I sat down by myself on the couch as Jack got it for me. He gave it to me, and I had a couple of sips. Jack sat down so close that our butts were nearly touching. He put his hand around my waist. I had to use the restroom, and he offered to come to the restroom with me, but I said I was fine. I don't remember much after I stood up from the couch. I know that I wasn't able to walk on my own after using the bathroom, and Jack and another girl helped me. Jack said after I was gone that I was beautiful and that he wanted to hook up with me. John got mad and said he couldn't hook up with me because he liked me. The next day, everyone told me what John said.

I asked John if that was true that he liked me. He denied it, and said that he had a girlfriend, and that everyone else must've bought it up a joke. I told everyone what he said, and they were shocked. They had no idea that he had a girlfriend. He never brought her up. I know he got really mad at them for telling me, but it’s his fault for telling them in the first place. He cut off contact with me. 

I know they broke up about two months later. Ever since then, he’s been watching my social media and TikToks. He’s always one of the first people to watch them, so he has to be looking at my stuff almost everyday. For example, one time, I retweeted a Star Wars meme. Not even an hour later, on his social media, he posted a picture of a Star Wars character with no context, just the picture. There have been other examples where he’s done something like that.

What usually happens is when the time to get the bill comes there’s the smallest awkward pause, and I immediately suggest we split and they agree at once. And on all the next dates splitting costs becomes the norm. I have no issue with this, I make a good living and will happily split costs on a date. Moreover I always end up feeling like I owe them something when they pay for a date. 

The guy I’m seeing now seems different from everyone I’ve dated before in this sense. Since the first date, he’s asked for ‘one check’ immediately without waiting for me to say something. We’ve been on a few dates and he’s paid for almost every activity/restaurant we’ve been to. I’ve suggested a few times that we split, or I pay but he said not to worry about it. The last date, he took me to a nice restaurant and we got food drinks and dessert and he paid for all of it, even after I suggested we split it. 

Now on the plus side, I’ve never been ‘spoilt’ like this before so it does feel nice. But I also don’t want there to be any sexual obligations because of this, because I want to take things slow. He hasn’t really made any moves yet, but I don’t know what to expect in the future 

So when a guy spends on dates like this, what are they expecting really?

At the moment I am a 21 yr old guy and would date any girl in the 18-28 age range but I live in India which is a conservative country and dating is hard here and many Indian parents too doesn't like it if their son or daughter has a girlfriend or boyfriend and there are still arranged marriages here in India and I don't want it.

I called him out for it and now he’s not replying to my message. 

I (30F) met him (32M) through a dating app a month ago. We’ve met up about 7 times over the past month and it’s always been great every time. 

We had arranged to meet Saturday night and on Friday he went out drinking with some friends and went a bit overboard so obviously was hungover the next day, the day we’d arranged to meet up (at night). 

He texted me on and off all day about how hungover he was and it became clear we weren’t going to meet up. He never officially cancelled but it was obvious he was in no state to go through with meeting. 

In the late afternoon I decided to message and set a boundary of sorts because if he was that hungover he should have told me and I could have made other plans. I was originally meant to catch up with a friend on that Saturday but I moved those plans because he said he wasn’t free Sunday. So he knew I’d moved plans for him. And now, because he was too hungover to hang out, I was left in the lurch with zero plans. I didn’t expect him to apologise but I told him that it wasn’t really cool that he was hungover when he knew we’d made plans. He said he’d make it up to me but not much conversation happened after that. 

I know hangovers can be unpredictable but would you really go out drinking hard and heavy when you know you have a date the next day…

I texted him this morning and he hasn’t replied, which is strange so I’m feeling like he’s been put off by what I said. 

I’ll end by saying he’s not a great texter to begin with but it’s never taken him over half a day to respond which is what’s happening now.

I matched on tinder with this beautiful 28f and within a couple days of chatting, she agreed to go on a date with me.

The date went fine. I got the venue reservation and got there early. Very nice place with wonderful scenery and good first date scenario. She then came in and saw me and it seemed things were going to go well. We talked about our lives, careers and hobbies, the usual stuff. I tried to make her laugh and showcase the personality I displayed briefly when we were messaging and she seemed to have responded fine. We must’ve been there for 2 hours talking. I got to know a lot about her and she did of me.

I asked if she wanted me to pay the check and she pulled out her credit card and said “no, let’s split it.” In my experience, it’s always better not to dispute this so we split the bill. When the check was paid, she got up rather quickly and waited for me by the entrance.

She seemed like she wanted to end the date right then in there but I insisted I walk her to her subway stop, so she let me. We talked some more and it was a quick hug goodbye. She made sure to turn her head so there was no opportunity for a kiss or any eye contact.

I took an uber home and on the ride I texted her that I had fun getting to know her and wanted to see if she was available over the weekend.

20 hours later she finally gets back to me and says, “hey! it was good meeting you last night but i just want to be upfront and say i see this as platonic.”

It stung since she was the most attractive woman I’ve been on a date with in like 2 years but I got a textbook rejection response from an article on the internet and just said, “No worries, thanks for letting me know. best of luck with everything.”

**1) Livining in many different countries, but seeking something long term:** I am a 23 years old italian guy, currently studying abroad in Austria. However, I still don't know yet if I will spend my summer in Italy or in a country abroad (I am looking for a summer internship) and also in September I will move to Paris for 3/4 months of exchange semester. I feel like this will not be the only time in which I will not be living in the same country for a year, because I am really trying to focus on my career so I would literally go everywhere I find opportunities. Long story short: at the moment for me remaining in the same country for one or many years it's not something that I would like to do (until I am 24/25 I think). Considering this, maybe some of you would imagine me dreaming having many short term relationship or something like that, instead**, I am really craving a relationship that could last much time.**

**2) Long-distance relationships:** Considering what I said above, I am thinking that maybe having a long-distance relationship could be the ""solution"" to that thing. I know, I know, having a long-distance relationship is really something complicated, but anyway for the position in which I am right now, every relationship I would start would become a long distance relationship in few months time. Considering what I said above, it's 3 days that I am texting with a girl, I know, not so much time spent together, but we made a lot of deep talk through messages (friday night we were awake texting each other from 1.30 am to 3 am, something which was really lovely) and in general I am feeling like I am falling for her (if a person is the right one, then I can fall really fast). However, she lives in Slovenia. Considering this, her home is basically 2 hours and half of car away from my parents second home in italy, and 5 hours of public transportation (that's the method of transportation I would take) away from my place in Austria. I don't know what to do, I would really like to invest time and effort in this (one side of me is also thinking about going to Slovenia one of the next weekends) but at the same time **I am scared of the possible outcome in the long-term.** 

**3) Mental health is involved in this:** I have to admit that there are two things I really like of her, the first one is that she always joke and has a great sense of humour. The second one is that we share a really similar mental health situation. In particular, in the night we had deep talks we talked about our dramas, our traumas, our past, going to therapy and stuff like that. Talking about the dark side of people is something that really make me interested in someone because I feel like I am not lonely and in this particular case a side of me thinks that ""since she lived similar experiences, then she understands myself and this could positively contribute to a possible relationship"". For example, in our night of deep talk, we both expressed the fact that we have a fear of abandonment and I think that this thing impact our way of messaging in certain moments, like yesterday evening she was really sleepy and she told me that she was going to sleep soon and then she gave me the good night saying that she would have talked more to me tomorrow after her work (in this way she comforted me for my anxiety while making me know that tomorrow she has to work, I don't know if it was on purpose or not but it felt really great and caring). I don't know, **I feel like many of you would say that I shouldn't pursue someone who has her own mental health problems, especially while I am having mine too, but I am really thinking that this is something which helps me to build the kind of relationship I want (with really open and deep talking, caring a lot about each other).**

Many people I’ve dated have moved on to happy relationships (which I love, I’m genuinely happy for them), although I can’t help but feel like a stepping stone - as while we’re dating they’ve expressed that they’ve experienced some traumatic relationships and are unsure of how to accept someone who genuinely cares for them, like I do.

I’ve always been adamant that I’m happy to walk at their own pace in whichever way they’re comfortable, and I’m happy to get to know them in a way that helps them build a true picture of who I am, in whichever ways are safe and comfortable to them. I’m direct in my communication in the sense that I ‘check-in’ and ask things like “how are you feeling with the way things are, and how can I approach things to make you feel supported?” and take care to learn and understand how it is they prefer to communicate, how they feel appreciated, and emulate what qualities are important in a partner. 

My latest ‘relationship’ has lasted several months, although I’m beginning to see the signs of strain that my previous relationships have, and it’s quite stressful. 

I’ve taken time to understand who she is and what’s important to her, and have gone to great lengths to help her feel appreciated. For instance, she’s explained that her last relationship broke down because her partner didn’t want to spend time with her, and wasn’t responsive to what made her feel appreciated - something that I’ve always gone to great lengths to maintain regardless of how busy I am - date nights, experiences, picking her up from work to spend 20 minutes with her since she’s busy otherwise - anything, as long as I can convey that she’s important to me, and whatever time we have is important too. We haven’t seen each other in a week, and she had an important milestone today - so I left her a cake to share with her family to celebrate, along with a face mask, coconut water and some other goodies to use last night because she was having a big day of drinking with some friends. 

Both of our families know of and approve of each other, we’ve met friends and have had plans to introduce each other to other groups of friends and family. She’s spoken about me to her therapist in length and has said she thinks I’m special, and her therapist has agreed and thinks “you’ve finally found someone who cares for you like you’ve deserved.” 

She’s pulled back and forth and her communication has started to drop - she no longer texts in the manner she used to, she doesn’t call, and she no longer reaches out to organise time to see each other. There hasn’t been any discernible reason for this, she’s been endearing and sends reminders of how I care for her out of the blue, speaks to me about all of her issues in length and general goings of her day - and then she’ll pull back, almost as if she’s become too comfortable and is waiting for something to go wrong.

I’m relatively good looking, I’m well traveled, educated both in higher university education and trade schools, involved in several businesses and always make time for those I care for.

Woke up this morning and my account wouldn’t work at all. Nothing would load, so update is on this account.

So after spending the whole day yesterday crying I decided on going through his twitter dms some more and found out he **[fucked his friends girlfriend while me and him were on a break](https://imgur.com/a/GcrsEDT).**

When I found those messages I just turned up unannounced at his house, and when he let me in I blew up on him.

Honestly it was a mess, I could barely form a coherent sentence because I was so angry, I just screamed at him. Didn’t even ask about the girl he met this year, we just argued about him sleeping with his friends (now ex) gf.

It happened while I was on a break with him because I needed to fix my insecurity issues LOL. Imagine I’m working on my jealousy while he’s fucking someone else.

He seems to think he didn’t do anything wrong, as we weren’t “in a relationship” but mentally I was still 100% in it. We never had a discussion about boundaries on the break, and I never asked him if he spoke to/slept with anyone, because I didn’t think I’d have to. I thought it was a given that this was a temporary split for my mental health.

The fact he was so remorseless about fucking over his friend is definitely sending alarm bells ringing in my head too. Like how can you just do someone like that?

The worst part is he literally just said “this convo is going nowhere with you so mad, so I’m going to bed we’ll talk in the morning”. This asshole went to sleep, with me in his room crying on the corner of bed. I honestly didn’t feel in a state to drive so I ended up spending the night to talk in the morning when he wakes up.

Well we just finished talking. About everything. He admits he should of told me about what happened on the break, but still said sleeping with someone was his right and he didn’t do anything wrong. And that he wasn’t sure if we would even get back together at the time.

I confronted him about the original messages I found, and mainly about “red”. He claims that he met her, because she’s an E-girl with a quite lot of followers &amp; he is thinking about becoming a social media influencer. That’s why he suggested mini-golf, as it seemed like a cool place to take pictures. 

He claims that she set him up &amp; he thought they were just gonna chill, but she changed up the plans last second to get him to her house, which the messages seem to corroborate. He says he could tell she fancied him because she always liked his shit which is why he dmd her and arranged to meet (for exposure). He even went on her insta profile and showed me she had posted them chilling, and says if he was cheating he’d never let the girl post him because “that’s bait af”. And he let her post to get some of the exposure he wanted. He says she tried it on but nothing happened, and that I was free to ask her myself. He showed me texts from the day to his best friend saying shit like “this girl so thirsty I gotta dip before I get groped”. So it seems like he didn’t sleep with her, and didn’t really want to which is why he didn’t stay the night.

I just drove home, and honestly I’m not even sure what to think. I told him I’m absolutely not okay with him arranging to meet girls without telling me, and he said the only reason he didn’t tell me is because he thought I’d trip out because of how things used to be.

I put us on a break while I figure out my next move, and told him if he even breathes in another girl’s direction in the mean time that I’ll cut him off forever, and he seems to understand.
