I have gotten a few (admittedly bad) fever sores that look terrible but it seems to be less and less as the years go on. 
Sometimes I get canker sores inside my mouth and occasionally if I’m really stressed I might get a few on my lip but I’m good about catching them early and putting the herpes chapstick or whatever on it. 

Anyway since I contracted it, I’ve been avoiding dating and obviously just don’t want to give anyone (much less someone I like) a lifelong disease just because I got horny or lonely. 
And I don’t want to be alone my whole life so I was wondering what the etiquette was on this? 
I know it’s common, and most people know they have it when they give it to someone else, do you just keep passing it on? 
Do you tell your potential partner before you kiss? (In the process probably completely shutting down the attraction I’d assume.)
Do I hope she has it too and start the relationship in a place of honesty?
Do I put it on my dating profile????!!!

I really like him: he's super level headed, thoughtful, always up for an adventure. In fact, there's normally something that will have turned me off a few months into a relationship (I'm really picky and admit I'm a classic love bomber who overlooks things I KNOW aren't right for me at first and then these things inevitably grow and I lose feelings) but I never felt this way with him, I am attracted to him physically and mentally and I was just enjoying getting to know him better.
My only concerns were long term as I'll be moving next year (not sure where yet) which he had been aware of since date one and continued to date me despite this.
We never had a proper conversation about where things were headed so I was a bit in the dark about his true feelings and have no idea if he was dating other people. 

I then met another guy that I immediately clicked with on a personality level, but deep down knew wasn't my type physically. He made his feelings clear pretty quickly and is in the same line of work and around the area I might want to be in. I had to stay with him so things were quite intense in this weird bubble and I got to know him really well, really quickly, and even felt like I knew him better than 33(M) I was dating for 3 months.
I'm very much a one guy at a time kind of girl and I thought because my head had been turned and I got on with this guy SO well, I owed it to him and 33(M) to break things off with 33(M) and to pursue things with the new guy.  
Fast forward and I now realise I did the love bomb thing and this new guy isn't right for me and we're just better off as really good friends.
When I broke it off with 33(M), he was super mature about it and said although he was disappointed he was happy for me and wanted to stay in touch. He even offered to meet for a coffee in a month's time for a catch up or to cool things off. Out of respect for the new guy, I opted for the latter.

We're now 3 weeks after I broke it off with 33(M) and the new guy has said he thinks we met at the wrong time, which I admit I felt relieved about because it's given me an out (which I feel terrible about). 
I'm now worried I made a grave error. 33(M) was the first guy in a long time that I was 100% attracted to in all ways and we have similar views morally and about marriage and children. When I mentioned the new guy to my best friends, they immediately said ""noooo what about 33(M)?!"" as they really liked him for me. 

I was unsure about where me and 33(M) were headed long term and was ready to ask him how he felt about this, but then hadn't seen him for over a month when I met the new guy. I truly think if we were exclusive and seeing each other more often, there's no chance any of this would've happened with the new guy. But we weren't, and it did. 

Did I make a mistake and should I reach out to see if the offer of a coffee catch up is still on the table? Or am I wanting to go back to him because things didn't work out with the new guy? 

I feel like there's unknowns with 33(M) that I still want to find out but I don't want to mess him around.

It's kind of funny story and I don't know what should I ask. Maybe to tell me what would you do if you were in the same situation. 


So, almost a year ago I matched with a girl on tinder. We didn't have any conversation at all because after asking my nationality she ghosted me. Then jokingly texting her again "" Are you still searching in google map where the country is?"" Of course she didn't reply. 

Today I went to work and I see a CV of her. She will start working in September. When I looked at picture it was same picture from tinder. I still have that match tho. 

So question is how would you act? Would you mention tinder and remind yourself? Or just let it go and that's it. I told to one of my colleague. Probably know everyone will know it.

I went no contact for 3 months, till her father died in april. I sent her a text with condolences. We started talking again more, did meet up again 2 months later and started calling. It was always me who asked to call or to meet up (she did initiate converstations through text) and we'd call for like 3 hours straight.

But when we met, it couldn't be labeled as 'date', although it wasn't just as 'friends' either. Just trying to get to know eachother better in real life.

A week after we'd met up and enjoyed our time together, she learned about how I had a date with another girl. She did before tell me she didn't want to disappoint me again like she'd done in the past and not to focus on her alone and have too much expectations. But a day after she learned I had a date with someone else, she told me she considered dating again with other random guys through Tinder. I suggested her to date me, or indeed date other guys, but then she wouldn't get to date me in the future anymore. After giving it 2 days thought, and I asked again for some clarity, she chose to date me. The first free day she had for me was 2 months later...

Suddenly in the upcoming 2 weeks it felt like she withdrew a bit more, she'd text less, take longer to reply (before she used to text while at work, now only after work) and I felt something was off. I told her I wanted to actually date someone who would want to put in more effort, who showed me a bare minimum of having interest in me, cause it started to feel like I was chasing her again, and didn't want to meet up again. She was saddened to hear this, didn't understand, and talked about it with her friends. Her friends told her she had to step up, set things right, cause I was in the right for having been too patient already too long. She contacted me, said she'd try to match my energy, look for a day sooner to meet up. I gave her another chance and we would meet up within 2 weeks.

The following 2 weeks she didn't put in more effort though. She would even text me less, tell me almost nothing... Ever since we agreed to meet up under the label 'date' it was a total different vibe. In those 2 weeks I did tell her I heard her less and asked if something was up. She told me nothing was wrong, she was just really busy.

The day we'd meet up, she got corona symptoms and had to get tested. She couldn't meet. I understood this, but was bummed out, and accepted it as a sign from the universe. So I started to withdraw, which she noticed. Then I told her she hadn't put in more effort like she'd promised, she had texted me less, and I was tired of being confused wether she did like me or not. She told me she did like me, that she still wanted to talk with me. I said I was done with it, this was mentally unhealthy. We did call a last time, talked 4 hours, and she even suggested some of her friends I maybe would be interested in.

My question is: I've been wondering now for 3 weeks if I overreacted? Should I apologize and have kept a slow course, or was I in my right after being too patient too long already? Why would she suggest to date a friend of her? What does that mean? And the whole deal with 'i will date only you' how should I interpret that?

I took a break from dating for about 2 years after my previous LTR. I had a couple of flirts right after but then I took a break for a little less than two years.

Early this summer I decided it was time again to try dating, but holy shit is it just me or is dating a fucking shitshow at the moment? We're a mere 3 months further and I already want to quit again and take a break. I used mainly Tinder, Bumble and Hinge because considering my age, it's not easy to find available women ""in the wild"", especially when we're still having Covid- measures.

And man, this shit is exhausting, frustrating and a pain in the ass. I'm just burned out already from ghosting, first dates that seem to go well but then just stop and don't go further, endless swiping with barely any matches...

So a summary, I had in these past three months several matches and 6 actual first dates. A few highlights from those dates:

\- First date, a women I found attractive. First date went really well but when I asked for a second date the next day, she said she didn't feel ""the chemistry and my hormones didn't go crazy"". She still wanted to be friends which I kindly declined without blame or anger (not interested in being a friendzone). She then told me she would keep my number around because I was a good looking, honourable man with intellect and if she would get tired of only finding scumbags, she'd come to me (I am not making this shit up, I posted about this here back then). I told her to lose my number.

\- Another one went fairly well too, but the next day she says she's actually not really looking for a relationship right now. The fuck are you doing on Tinder then? If you're not interested in me, that's fine but at least tell me like it is.

\- Next date, same story. ""Not actually in dating more right now""

\- Next date, she was just mind numbingly boring. Though I don't blame her. We just didn't have matching personalities.

\- Next date, she was super arrogant. Just downright insufferable. 

\- And finally, yesterday, date went really well. She even proposed to go for a bite together and we laughed and had a good time. When we parted ways she texted a bit later that she ""didn't feel the spark and the chemistry"". I mean it's fine if you are not actually attracted to my personality but wat the hell is this ""spark"" or these ""raging hormones"" everyone talks about? If I have to rely on my raging hormones to see if I want to date someone, I would want to date any hot chick I meet, because for me, raging hormones means I'm just horny.

Anyway, that is for the actual dates. Then I'm not even mentioning matches that either don't respond at all, ghost you after a few messages, ghost you even after you exchanged phone numbers, or when you ask them to go for a coffee, which I do fairly on in the conversation, tell you that they have barely any time right now.

This is a mess. I'm not blaming women or hating on these particular women. I'm just frustrating by the dating scene as a process. It's just a chore right now. And I came to a point that if I was to go on a date tomorrow, I'd assume it's probably going to go nowhere, just like the rest.  

It just tires and bores me to go through the entire process of doing small talk first, coming up with original first messages, asking about their hobbies, being nervous that during a date you say something that makes you look dorky, sift through all these fucking profiles again and again... ""I love to laugh!"" says her profile. Oh really? Damn I hate laughing! That's so weird that you love it! Oh you says you ""enjoy having a fun life"" damn I hate having fun. I want to be miserable all the time.

You know there are more and more moments where I just don't want to put up with it any more and if I want to get my physical needs met, I might as well just go see a sex worker. It's legal here after all and it's much less of a hassle and I'll pick up back dating when I actually want to go back to the whole dating game again. 

Now I understand why some good looking men still go use their services to be honest.

I think it's time for a break from dating. What worries me is that I took an almost two year break, only to get sick of it again after a mere three months.

Sorry if this sounds stupid but I’m very young and this is the first girl I’ve ever tried to date in my life so I’m very inexperienced 

I’m M(22) trying to flirt with this girl F(20)through text. 

She’s my classmate I’ve hangout with her all of last semester on a almost daily basis and I meet her half way through last semester and I’m going to ask her out next semester but in the meantime I’m messaging her since it’s summer break. 

She is 100% not matching my flirting energy but she always responses really quick and if I stop chatting to her she will message me 2 days later asking what I’m up too. 

I don’t get it is she interested or not interested? 


Her personality type is very shy and reserved and she’s not an expressive person she didn’t  even tell her best friend happy birthday could that be the reason the energy is not being returned back or is she just not interested?

For example she said she would have made me a specific Pudding but she never did and I got that pudding from McDonald’s 

I  sent a snap of the pudding and told her how could McDonald make me this pudding before you

I think I might see shadows in my room today (jucie wrld reference because we both listen to him) 

And she just replies did the pudding taste good??? 🤦‍♂️ 

The thing is I give up on texting her because the energy is not being matched ( so I’m like I will take the hint) but she always hits me back up which I’m like I’m going to give it one more try and the cycle repeats it self. 

I have had people saying why do I only send this girl specific snaps when they want me to show them the same things e.g if I send her a photo of some new clothes I bought someone will tell me why didn’t they receive the snap as well as they are interested in see my new clothes as well  so she’s definitely talking about me behind my back

I really feel like I’m talking to a brick wall

....
So I'm on dating apps, I just prefer it as a tool to draw since I'm shy and the people who approach me in real life haven't been the best people. I met my ex through apps as well, so I know it works

When you're on apps I would say 1 out of every 10 people you talk to actually make conversation.

I met this one person who said they liked my personality and were very complimentative, we talked on the phone all the time for a week and they asked me out to hangout today (Friday)

The night before I messaged and said are we still good, since no time or location was set. They said they will get back to me

I'm being stood up for the first time where I actually really cared and it sucks. 

What do I say to this person if they message and how do I like move on from this bummed feeling?

TL:DR
Person stood me up after talking on the phone for a week and being attracted to one another.

For context I'm 21yo male

I like this girl from our friend group, we went to the same high-school but she was in a different program, I often met her parties hosted by our friend group pre covid. 

At every both of us always ending up sitting together, drinking and talking about random things for an hour or two, one of my friends that often hosts the parties noted it to both of us.

Anyway, recently with the restrictions being lifted she hosted a birthday house party, during that party I talked to my crush's BFF and she told me that I'm the most suitable guy for her, she also gave me other advice to meet her alone for coffee or lunch in a sober setting.

Here's where I need advice, I'm concerned about certain things, 1st is height, while I personally don't care, I'm worried what she would think, I'm 165cm and she's 187cm. 

2nd is that I feel like she's more stable than I am in more ways than one, she's been working full-time for the last year since graduation and been living with parents, so she's more stable than me economically, I have started working a lot more over August and having a future plan.

3rd she has a driving license and a car, I'm still working on getting mine but I've flunked it so many times...

And final is cultural differences if this goes any further, I'm an immigrant, my family wants me to marry same religion same race or at least same religion, but I don't care about that and I'm just worried clashes will happen with my family if it comes out I'm in a relationship with an ""infidel""

Though likely not the best move to be obsessing over why it ended, I can't help but ruminate over the possible things I could've changed.

I should preface, I have pretty severe anxiety (my bf was aware of this from the beginning) and have been seeking professional help for it the last few months.

I should also mention that I believe I have many reasons for why I felt insecure in my relationship that wasn't just from uncontrolled anxiety. At the beginning of our relationship, my bf wasn't too keen on labels that immediately made me question how serious he intended on taking his relationship with me. Over time, he eventually called me his gf. He lives at home, but fully hid me from his family and friends. He snuck me around his house, so I never was properly introduced to his closest circle. I am white and he was Asian, so at first I thought it was the cultural differences. When we went to a Starbucks on one occasion and his sister walked in, he asked me to go back to the car so she wouldn't see us together. Clothed or not, whenever his mother would knock on the door and I was in the room, he would throw a blanket over me like I wasn't there. His family eventually guessed who I was, but he allowed them to think I was a work colleague. It took almost a year for me to be introduced to a friend, and it was only because I mentioned I would like to meet someone close to him. He always accused me of overthinking when I'd express concerns that it was because he didn't see me as long-term material, but I later found out that it was, in fact, the case.

When I asked if he wanted to meet my parents/friends, he declined as it was ""too socially awkward"" for him. It was only when I expressed it was important to me, he considered it. When I asked him at around 6 months in what he wanted from his life in the future (marriage, kids, etc.), he got really stressed out saying I was pressuring him to check off boxes for my own expectations of him?

Every natural step in progressing the relationship felt like walking on glass/pulling teeth for me...

He said I magnified issues, which lead to the breakup. When it came to conflict resolution, we had a mismatch of techniques (I'm anxious, he was avoidant). I always wanted to discuss issues head-on, while he'd need time to process his feelings. I tried to adapt to his needs by giving him time, but I always tried to check in to make sure he was okay. He would never tell me how much time he'd need, and would stonewall me for 7 days at a time, giving me no context for his feelings, which made my anxiety skyrocket. If I expressed that something he said had hurt me, he would shut down and in turn make me feel guilty for my emotions and I would end up apologizing for my feelings. He always said I should bring up my concerns, but I would always end up feeling silly for them. When I would say something he said had hurt me, he would usually reply with: ""You're too sensitive, it was a joke""/ ""You're making issues where there aren't any""/""Guess I won't say anything at all."" It was only when I was break down and helplessly cry would he soften and talk me down. I begged him countless times to communicate more with me or to discuss methods that worked for both of us, and he would just say he did his part, and that ""there's no point in talking about something when I don't think you will change."" I didn't think that was fair to me. I would give him gifts (a love language) to try to cheer him up during these lows, and he accused me of ""having a manipulative agenda to monitor his emotions when I did something wrong."".....I didn't see this as calculated, but rather my attempts at being a supportive partner?

When I confided in my parents about my experiences, they believe I was emotionally abused--does it seem that way?

I am not perfect and definitely wasn't an easy gf by any means, I needed a lot of reassurance. But I loved him with everything I had and would've fought for him until the end. Was I in the wrong throughout all of this?

Maybe it's partly because I was never born attractive or athletic myself. So it's always been something difficult to attain. I was always the smallest/weakest kid growing up. Since 15 I've been doing my best though and with the exception of a few years when I was unwell and couldn't, I've lifted weights at least 3 times a week or done body weight or cardio at least that often every week. Currently I'm working out hard every day of the week for at least 30 min - either swimming, biking, or lifting weights.

I've tried all the approaches people suggest (eg. push/pull/legs splits, full workout every time, no cardio, more cardio, etc). I've tried loads of different diets. Tried bulking and cutting. Currently I've settled on intermittent fasting and for the past few years I eat within 6 hours a day.

The best I've been able to get with all these years of work is 14% body fat and a pretty slim physique. I just can't seem to do any better. If I cut more I lose muscle. If I try increasing calories I get fatter. I finished puberty around 100-110 lb, and I'm sitting around 140 lb now so I'm up 30-40 lb of mass from baseline. I have read some resources that suggest that is often the most many men can naturally gain.

To be movie star physique you need to get down to around 10% body fat. I am continuing to work out but I am increasingly thinking it is not possible or at this rate of working out daily it might take years more to get there by the time I will be in my 40s.

In terms of other factors, I will run through the checklist: I have had lots of friends in my life of both genders, I'm sociable, I'm emotionally competent, I'm intelligent and interesting, I have a 10 year degree, I make top 1% income, I am fun to be around, and I have lots of hobbies outside of my interest in fitness. I don't talk about fitness on dating apps.

Although many women claim to not be attracted to buff men, I have seen dating experiments that demonstrate otherwise. In the cases where women say they don't care about how buff a guy is they usually seem to expect him to be tall or white or look like Paul Rudd.

I’ve had no success with women. Like I haven’t had my first real kiss, I haven’t gone on a date, I haven’t even met one girl that was remotely interested in me because of how ugly I am. Like I’m 3 years into college and I put my self out there and I haven’t been able to meet one girl that likes me. I don’t mean I’ve met a girl and I wasn’t interested, I haven’t met a single girl that liked me.

I felt like it was getting to a point where it was clear that no girl is going to want me anytime soon, and I wanted to try sex and finally not be a virgin that I hired someone. It felt like if I didn’t do that I would end up dying a virgin.

I regret it. I feel like such a fucking loser.

Anyhow, I met this 30-year-old man last month on tinder, and we chatted a bit, and then we stopped chatting but began chatting again only to meet each other for brunch last Thursday finally.

Brunch went well, and we clicked, and the flow of conversations was good; before that, we would also text a lot during the day and week, so communication is good in our case.

We also found out that our parents are from the same country and had similarities, so all looked good from then on, and he also dropped me home after our brunch.

So I suggested we have a fun at-home movie hangout ""date'"" so yesterday he picked me up from my home, and we went over to his home and watched a movie, and he bought me some food.

Anyhow this is when he began making moves on me, so he placed his hand over my shoulder/began stroking/holding my hand and eventually, he told me he wanted to kiss me.

So we kissed and then proceeded to kiss and ultimately fooled around for about 30 minutes but with limits and No sex, but he did get an erection. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we stopped eventually and had a little chat about what we wanted out of this; hence, we felt so comfortable with each other quickly and at ease with no awkwardness.

I asked him if he wanted a hookup solely, and he proceeded to tell me that he was looking for companionship and eventually a girlfriend. 

He then tells me that he does not wish to hook up with me but wanted us to build a relationship, but I did tell him I did not perceive that based on his current action and he disagreed and assured me that Sex is not the top priority and that he wants more than that.

So anyhow, we cleared that up, and he dropped me off, and we kissed goodnight.

He does text me good morning every day, so communication has not ceased.

We are hanging out tomorrow again, so my question is that if you do move too fast in a relationship, is it a sign that it may fail? 

We have met only twice, so this seems fast, but I do feel comfortable; however, are there questions I should ask him?

Warning signs I should look out for?

I didn’t think he’d remembered because I’d said it briefly to him in passing, but yeah. 

He asks me those types of questions all the time.

The problem is not so much that I get rejected, but that I get more and more depressed with each rejection.

I realise that rejection is all part of the process and that as an average looking guy I’m basically forced to deal with a bunch of rejections until I finally get a date. However, it’s just all so much effort and the whole process is just taking a massive toll on me. I spend a bunch of time and effort finding and getting to know girls I like and that I’d actually be compatible with, and then of course when it becomes time to ask them to date they’re not the slightest bit interested in me romantically. The rejections aren’t getting any easier to handle - I do get over them in the individual sense, it’s just that the cumulative effect of one on top of another isn’t taking me to a healthy place mentally and I suppose I’m just a bit worried about the direction in which things are going really.
