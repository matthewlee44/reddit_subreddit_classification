I got out of an extremely toxic relationship about a month ago, and have spent a lot of time working on myself. I'm quite comfortable with my body and myself in general as i have spent a lot of time working out, and building a life i am comfortable with, and comfortable bringing others into.

I've realized i miss having the sexual intimacy with women, and am unsure where to start. 

are dating podcasts and youtubers worth looking at?

how do I go about online dating? I've never used tinder or similar platforms, but have heard they are a good way of meeting women.

I like to think that im funny enough to make people laugh, and most of the people that I hang out with often have a smile on their face, but find it hard to bring chemistry and sexual tension into conversations.

And that is, I‚Äôm going to set my mind on working hard towards my dream job and some other things with getting a girlfriend not necessarily being one of my main priorities.

But even at the end of the day of working on myself, there is still part of me that really wants a significant other soon because I‚Äôve personally never had a real girlfriend which means I still have yet to experience what it‚Äôs like to have one.

And based on what I‚Äôve heard and seen, it just seems like it feels really good to have one and I want to experience what others do.

I mean I get that I‚Äôm 19 and that there is no need to rush, but I still want to figure out how to get one.

And I know what your all going to say ‚ÄúIf you want to go get a girlfriend, you have to go out and meet people‚Äù.

But how is that really going to work though?

I mean in my mind I was thinking okay maybe I can go meet a couple girls that I go to work with or at a podcast or something.

Idk I just feel like alot of the girls I‚Äôm going to see just in general are not really going to have ‚Äúgetting a boyfriend‚Äù in mind when I go meet them in public.

Also I‚Äôm not really a big fan of ‚Äúbeing just friends at first‚Äù either because if I find a girl really beautiful and really like her personality, I tend to get feelings for her quick and that has put me in the friendzone a few times in the past.

Idk I guess I‚Äôm just not confident in finding a girl in publicüòû. 

Plus another issue is that I‚Äôm studying stuff from home (game development, drivers training, animation, and some others), and so I don‚Äôt really go out in public a lot.

I mean as someone who is into nerd culture, I suppose I could go to a place like comic con but I just feel that women are there to have fun and not get hit on by random guys.

Ugh, idk maybe I just need to go practice giving cute girls hints that I find them attractive and maybe that‚Äôll get them to catch feelings for me quick like I do with them.

Anyways some advice would be helpful.

I just don‚Äôt want to wait until ‚ÄúI have worked on myself‚Äù enough to get a girlfriend because I‚Äôd much prefer I‚Äôd date someone who can watch me grow as I do the same for her.

But yeah I guess as of now, I‚Äôm just going to post this, see what you guys say, and continue working on my dreams and such and hopefully find myself a gf alongside that.

I mean I understand that girls hate desperate guys, but I really wish that was never a turn off because I feel like it just makes things harder for us guys making us even more desperate.

I really want to figure out a way to just have me and a girl find me super attractive from the very start and have them be the one desperate for me, it would make things much easier.

Also I‚Äôve noticed that most of my posts are r/Dating posts which probably isn‚Äôt a good thing because I feel that says a lot about how desperate I probably am.

Idk I think I just lack confidence like I already said.

I often feel that I‚Äôll never get a girlfriend even after I‚Äôve ‚Äúcompleted myself‚Äù.

I‚Äôm hoping that I can have more r/Gamedev posts but I think my lack of confidence of me getting a girlfriend isn‚Äôt helping.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162971,public,self,"As someone who is 19 years old, how can I get a girlfriend?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t8jk9z/as_someone_who_is_19_years_old_how_can_i_get_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,

He reassured me he would be able to deal with it two weeks in and I know I should have known better but I kinda believed him. He kept saying things like ‚ÄúWhere were u all this time‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou awakened my dead heart‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy gut is telling me this is worth a shot, ‚ÄúWith you hours feel like minutes‚Äù.

out‚Ä¶ Which kinda did but I slowly started to give him his energy back and not
shying away from
the fact that I really liked him. Second date we got really intimate and I was drunk and acted a little bratty but nothing crazy, just mood swings but he reassured me it was fine. I listened to him when he talked about his interests, talked, watched all the videos he sent me, asked him about his life.. Around the 4th to 5th week it got dull and he started flirting less and stopped asking me about my life. I sensed it and confronted him, he said ‚Äúplease I still have feelings for you‚Äù and we managed to get over it. The lack of thoughtfulness and interest in my life kept going on for 4
days and I confronted him saying he doesn‚Äôt care about me as much as he thinks he did. He later admitted that he was thinking of taking a break and that his feelings were so strong in the beginning but cooled off. I rejected the break and said that if I already drain him out now we should quit talking and he wanted to stay friends, which I refused.

I don‚Äôt get how I was draining, I wasn‚Äôt even pushy with late texts and always told him that it it‚Äôs okay if he replies later‚Ä¶ We videochatted almost daily for a while but both of us had a great time and when he said he‚Äôd go I didn‚Äôt make him stay.

After ‚Äúbreaking up‚Äù I noticed that I can‚Äôt sleep or stop thinking about him.

He said he isn‚Äôt smart enough to know why and that he is happy with the situation and sad I don‚Äôt want to stay friends. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how somebody can go from intense, strong emotions, almost love bombing me to cold and unbothered in the matter of a single week. The sudden switch really irritated me.

I was always an overthinker and he was more of a normie in that sense but my overthinking is due to trauma. I did sense that he lacked the emotional range to talk to when sad or have deep conversations but didn‚Äôt want to decide to end things that quickly‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I am devastated and can‚Äôt believe somebody can stop caring about me so quickly when we had so much in common and both of us felt like we could be ourselves.

I know it seems so early to say that but it‚Äôs how I feel. For some background, a few months ago I had gotten out of a 6 year relationship. After some time and therapy, I came to the conclusion that he was emotionally abusive, something that I was used to because my dad was too, just drunk. During those 6 years a lot happened to me that made me have to grow up very quickly (I won‚Äôt say unless you‚Äôre curious) and because of this my mental health fell tremendously. I looked at him like my savior. Anyway, flash forward, he tells me he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. I have abandonment issues, trust issues, and the occasional anger issues too. Took a while but I made it out alive but I‚Äôm still hesitant and just decided to download bumble. Almost instantly my self confidence skyrocketed which felt amazing. I went on a date that went terribly, that‚Äôs a story for another day, but then went on a date with a different guy, told him about my anxiety and decided we should do an activity instead of the usual dinner date. It exceeded my expectations. Once we sat down and started talking, I started to feel so comfortable and he‚Äôs lived a pretty interesting life. Needless to say, I loved talking to him. Once we were done with our activity, we went to pick up some Chinese food, I was still too anxious to eat but still happy to be there and we actually cuddled in the booth while waiting to take it back to his apartment. You can kinda guess what happened after that. 
But here‚Äôs the thing, he‚Äôs my type to a perfect T. The consideration, the want to kinda show off to me but still listen to what I had to say, and the ability to laugh with each other. Also I brought up a physical insecurity of mine and he acted like he didn‚Äôt even notice that there was something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me. On the date I got several signs that it was what I was supposed to be doing. From something having to do with pizza, to literally being beside the restaurant my dad worked at, to my ring breaking after we talked about it. It was magical to me. We talked for a couple weeks after that, just waiting until our schedules lined up again for another date and a friend confessed his feelings for me. Now I had had a small crush on this friend in the past but pushed it down because I was in a relationship. I panicked but ultimately, I cut off date guy, he was very respectful about it, and I started dating the friend. 3 weeks later, friend and I were too different and we ended things. Today I texted date guy and right as I opened the app to text him, I got a notification from another app saying ‚Äúthis is a sign,‚Äù I was already panicking but I just about shit myself right then and there. 

I‚Äôm no psychic but this feels like it‚Äôs supposed to be like this. I‚Äôve been thinking about him since I matched with him. I‚Äôve got the biggest crush on him. Sleepless nights just thinking about how our date went and what future dates could be and of course I‚Äôm doing the girl thing where I picture what our wedding would look like. I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship at this time but I want one with him in the near future. 

And if you are curious, I‚Äôm doing the thing where I act like an idiot around him, I try to show off a little, I lean in, physical touch, I want to know everything about him, and he makes me nervous but in a good way. I don‚Äôt know the last time I really felt that.

I am a full-time college student-athlete and part-time waitress at a nice restaurant. I have dark blonde hair and blue eyes. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm beautiful. I have no debt, my car fully paid off, and savings. I have kind people in my life who truly care about me and who I care for too. I have everything I need and am quite happy with my life. Unfortunately, I find it difficult to connect with people around me on a deeper level. I think it is partially because I still see myself as the elementary school kid with wet hair, wire rimmed glasses, weird clothes, and braces. I also grew up in a conservative Christian family where my parents were very picky with any friends I did want to have. My family judges me on my physical appearance, accomplishments, friendships, and everything really. I'm smart and was often the teacher's pet so that did not help me make friends growing up either. I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend or been asked on a proper date. I work hard for what I have and value genuine relationships with those around me.

I look like the most confident and capable person in the room many times but still feel trapped by how others make me feel and the thought that almost no one understands my thought processes and who I am. I am happy with who I am and am confident in my ability to succeed, but I don‚Äôt feel like others see that I am intelligent and pretty. When I am in a social situation I feel rather plain to the world and like people are unable to see who I really am. This is really crippling to me when I am trying to get to know my teammates or present my best self to people I don‚Äôt relate to. My personal beliefs and values make it hard for me to nod and smile if what someone is doing or talking about is disrespectful to my religious beliefs. I end up going into silent mode because I don‚Äôt want to cause trouble for anyone but this leaves me unable to connect. I truly care about others and have friends, but I just don‚Äôt have someone that fully understands me and who I am. The closest thing I have to someone fully understanding me is an absolute angel of a co-worker who is also the most irritating and irresponsible person I‚Äôve ever met! I love him so much and we are dating without the label of us actually dating. He caves in to peer pressure and I‚Äôm the exact opposite of always sticking to my beliefs. He drinks and vapes, and I have never had any of those substances in my life. He is a Catholic, I‚Äôm a Christian. We both try to learn about each others faiths even though we both believe strongly that our own is correct. He loves having tons of friends, and I can‚Äôt seem to be a social butterfly. We have almost all the same interests and dreams for our futures. I understand him perfectly and could finish most of his sentences if I needed to. He wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of emotions, and I am really guarded emotionally. He has many secrets even though emotionally, I read him like a book. I‚Äôm super open to him with my life. We can‚Äôt really date because Christians aren‚Äôt supposed to date outside their faiths and because I can‚Äôt accept substance abuse, but we have a solid friendship. I feel like he genuinely cares for me too because he shows it without actually saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù or asking me out formally. We aren‚Äôt good at communicating at all, but I‚Äôm ok with that as long as we both know that we love each other. I want more from our relationship, but know that there are so many things between us. He really is my answer in having someone who fully understands me. He takes the time to ask deep thought provoking questions to understand me better.

Although I have the perfect life in a material sense, I feel like I am going crazy with everything going on in my relationships with my thoughts. I usually have a very bubbly and fun personality around my family, close friends, and with my customers at work. I can‚Äôt seem to transfer this to my other relationships. Even when I do have that bubbly personality with my close friends, no one ever fully understands me, how hard I work, and what I am thinking. The thought that everyone is constantly judging me like was the case in the past when I wasn‚Äôt accomplished and pretty and the thought that I can‚Äôt be with the one person that is truly learning to understand me is killing me on the inside.

About 3-4 times a week I go over to visit him because he can't come to my place, since he's allergic to my cat. We talked about me moving in with him, what we had planned for the future and so on. I was a little unsure what to say, so he told me to just think about it.  
I love him and want to be with him, I don't think that feeling unsure about it is something bad either. It's a big step in every relationship and I can't handle change very well, but I do have the feeling that one day I will feel ready.   


But so far, I'm worried about it. My apartment has grown on me, it's the first one I've had since moving out of my parent's abusive household. It's quiet and cozy and decorated to my liking, and I have the ability to alter it however I want to. It's my safe place. If I were to move in with my boyfriend, all of those things would be gone. I wouldn't have as much privacy or even just the ability to be alone and have my peace and quiet, I wouldn't be able to have a cat that I love so dearly, it wouldn't feel like home because I would have to get rid of most of my furniture and decorations. I need some space after a day of being at work/studying, but he wants to spend every free minute with me. He also chose the apartment based on what he needs/likes, so I find it hard to feel at home there, even if I'm just over for a few hours. I know that moving in together is about giving and taking and making compromises, but I don't know if I could handle living in a place that I only feel 50% comfortable in. I thought about moving into a completely new apartment with a separate room just for me, but that is financially not possible at the moment.

I cooked for her, even made dessert and overall just really made an effort.
She wrote me a few hours before we were supposed to meet, that she got notified by some friends she was out with, that they had tested positive for COVID. She said she would feel better if we didn't meet until she was sure she wasn't positive as well, that she was sorry and she was really looking forward to it and I told her that I understand, even though I would have taken the risk, since I think that everyone is going to get it sooner or later. 
I was already finished with preperations for dinner, so figured I would just finish up and bring her some of the food, since it would be too much for me alone to eat and she lives nearby. I asked her if it was okay if I drop it off an hour later at her place and didn't get a response. I called her once after the hour was up and the food cooled off, but she didn't answer her phone.

I'm 27, M and I've never really had a relationship in all my adult life. The women who 'seemed' interested in me was only interested for means of using me for money or something else other than actual interest in me.

I know I'm not attractive and it's been proven that I'm not. If I'm out with the guys and a group of women decide to join us, they pay no attention to me. When I do try to put my thoughts into a conversation, they nod and pretend to acknowledge what I say with that half-assed ""oh yeah same!"" and then throw they're eyes onto the other guys they were already fixated on. That alone is enough to send me home for the night. Honestly, although it hurts, I can't blame them. I'm below average height at 5'7 and practically lost all my hair. Im out of shape but still have a decent amount of muscle mass but muscle mass doesn't count for anything in this day and age. I did briefly get back into shape for all the wrong reasons, mainly to try and look more appealing but soon reverted back to this again when I still wasn't getting results with women.

I do have a female friend who compliments my dress sense when I go out but she's the other half of my friend who I knew before her. So I don't know if she genuinely means it or its just a confidence booster as she knows I struggle with women.

I do have one friend who is stupidly attractive, he's 5'10, olive skinned and has a slender figure. Whenever he goes out he has at least two or three women who will hang around him regardless of him showing interest as he also has a girlfriend. He is everything I wish I was but I'm stuck in this ugly short troll body instead. He tells me confidence is my issue but even when I try and put a bit of bravado into everything I say or do it seems to have even more of the opposite effect that I desire.

I also get told often that I'm looking in the wrong places and try with places that bring me joy. The problem with that is, my interests are very male dominant. Gaming, tabletop, rugby and DnD has little to no women interest and if there is, they're already taken.

I don't really know what Im looking for from this. I guess really, I need advice to accept that I'm the living paradox of 'there's someone for everyone.' Because if I'm honest, it tears me up seeing people being happy with the ones they love and my physical attributes literally prohibit me from having the same. Just to add, if for whatever reason a woman would show interest now, even if it's genuinely for me, my instant thoughts are now ""what does she want from me?"" it's either going to be my bank account or to scrounge a free drink from me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162976,public,self,Women outright avoid me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t8lyte/women_outright_avoid_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,

When I see posts about how especially young people seem to loose hope and talk about how they'll never get into relationships because they're short/ugly/not rich/etc, I always feel like having to lift their spirits so here I am.
Here's the thing: you're not a failure. Just because it looks like every other person around you has a much better life because of a relationship it doesn't mean they actually do, and even then, that doesn't mean you failed at anything. People are different, some people get to certain things faster than others, some get into situations that others might not. But just because you don't or didn't get to experience stuff others around you do or did, doesn't mean you are a looser. Even at almost 26 years I feel that the majority of my life is (hopefully) still ahead of me, I have still a lot to learn and experience and live. If not tomorrow, then next year, or the next. And don't let anyone shame you for not 'being already there. Who cares if you're a virgin? The right people won't the ones who do don't matter. Especially don't let yourself pushed into situations you don't want to be in just so you can 'catch up'.
And also, it might seem like that only conventionally attractive/high/rich people get dates and get to be happy. Thing is, I know many, MANY people who don't fit these descriptions and are √≠n happy relationships, some of them already married. Hell, my ex and the girl I'm currently planning on asking out can both be said to be 'uniquely attractive' and to me both are beautiful.
You relationship status does not define you or your worth, and I do believe there's someone for everyone.

It started slow and then she showed a lot of attention and also was seeking for it when I wasn't always available. After 2 months I really showed her how I want to see her, being very nice and cute and it all started going weird. It was very hard to get to meet with her, usually what we did is she came to my house to see some movie and have sex. I spoke to her about this feeling of being taken for granted a few times and she always said that she feels something she didn't feel for long time for me, and that she doesn't love me yet cause it's hard for her because of her break up since May, however she said I am the best of her dates she had. 

&amp;#x200B;

But everything is really weird now, she does write me good morning herself most of the times, but she always speaks to me in delays in messages, she never calls, it's very hard to catch up with her and meet, whenever I ask if we meet she disappears and either says she didn't see or not available and offers me another day, and that they she completely forgets about it/not talking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I'll give her time, but nothing is moving except 3 days ago, I was at her house and I didn't expect anything, didn't touch her at all, until she started kissing me every time until we had sex and that disappeared after the sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am being taken for granted, or I am just over thinking and rushing, I don't know it's been for too long. I am not sure if the best option here is to break up because I don't know if it can be fixed.

At the start of my twenties, I just took for granted our culture's insistence that one of the goals of life is to find romantic love. But having now actually experienced long-term romantic love, I'm amazingly at peace with having been single for 6 months and I feel no desire whatsoever to seek a new love, even though comparatively my relationships were pretty normal. 

It's true that there's a lot of joy in romantic love, but it's also true there's a lot of pains. Most of the joys come at the beginning of the relationship, but once it matures I think the hedonic scales begin to balance out.  

Those exhilarating romantic feelings that seemed to enchant your whole world give way to much more familiar, almost familial feelings of affection; as you deepen in your knowledge of who they really are, you realise that this person you once idealised is just like you: a deeply fallen creature with major faults; arguments, bickering, and annoyances become part of normal life; inevitably they hurt or disappoint you in a more serious way; and then there's this general feeling of fatigue as the years go by and all the irritations, hurts, and resentments pile on top of each other. 

And then, worst of all, even if you split amicably (as I've been lucky to have done), they will in some sense haunt you afterwards. Once you've loved someone so deeply, you'll always care about them, you'll wonder how they are, you'll hope that they're doing well, and you'll worry for them. 

Now, obviously there's a lot of joys alongside all of this: we are social animals and few relationships offer the same level of physical and spiritual intimacy. But at the same time, I can't help but feel that the sufferings either outweigh or balance out the joys. And even if they don't, they come close enough as to make me question the value of relationships in the first place. I'm not saying they're a bad thing to have, but I no longer believe that people without them are much worse off, if at all.

On Valentine's I managed to get a gal's number whom I really want to get to know. We texted briefly about work the day after but that was it. We work at the same place but have separate jobs and don't really know anything about her or if her situation permits her to talk.

I thought she might be interested since she exchanged numbers with me but she hasn't initiated either since we spoke. I'm a reserved and introverted individual and am pretty terrible at reading women, I don't know if she is the same way or if she is already talking to somebody else.

Initially, I found him cute but that was the extent of it. You know how you can objectively see that someone is attractive? Yeah like that. I have a tendency to be sweet and friendly, which might have come off as flirty. He was nice at first, then became tense and nervous. I backed off once realizing I was making him uncomfortable. He stared at me a lot. Almost obviously. It made me uncomfortable and I was confused. When Id try to be friendly to him, such as something small like i‚Äôm passing out the donuts and ask him if he wants one he looks mad and gets snappy. Like I am not flirting with you. Calm down. Then I started avoiding him then he would begin to pursue ME for conversation, act nervous, act very polite, then seem to get nervous again and get mean and snappy. In conversation, I have the urge to run away because I can feel how carefully he‚Äôs planning his words, gaging my responses very carefully, almost like he‚Äôs performing or it‚Äôs a job interview.

I'am quite stressed right now. Me (27m) and my ex-girlfriend (26f) have been thinking of getting back togeather. We have feelings for eachother but things are a bit awkward sometimes. We have been seeing each other for a few weekends now but, last weekend she told me that the dates are quite boring and that they are kinda awkward.

We have 1 TV and a console (PS4) so we have been playing and watching each other play a couple of dates so I can understand where she is coming from, I'm just not that much of a interesting guy and, socially pretty awkward so am bad at coming up with stuff on the spot. So I am trying to think of what we could do next weekend to make it a bit more exciting. 

My current thoughts are maybe building a cozy fort and play a CO-OP game, or some boardgames, but she aint that much into anything else than videogames. But would love to get some suggestions.

i'm starting to think he might be married or something. does it sound like it? my friend said she doesnt think he's married, but maybe doesnt want a relationship (with anyone). she said she thinks that because he goes to different cities each time he's away, not to the same place every time, and i have no sign of another female in his apartment. so that would mean he barely ever sees his wife, if he had one and that doesnt make sense. i guess that's a nice way of my friend saying he's just not that into me? (if he's not married, that might be the only other explanation).  he is also sort of unhappy with his new job in my city and he doesnt know many people here. my friend said maybe he's thinking about leaving and going back home (where he grew up and where his family lives) and so he has like one foot out the door and isn't trying to get into a relationship in my city. 

that's a thought but i just dont get why he can't respond to my texts faster. i think several hours is just unreasonable. it's really agonizing to have to wait for his text. it's like torture!

What should I do?

(22M) I met a girl (24F) on Bumble, where she started off by complimenting my curls.  
We chatted for about 1-2 weeks and the conversation was great, as she also often sent me random videos of her day. I proposed to go out for drinks and she said yes, but since she was very busy with her work during the week our dates got cancelled (in advance, not last minute). After 2-3 times of them getting cancelled, I didn't try anymore and she proposed a date on a Friday night because she was hoping to get off work earlier but wasn't sure 100%. It eventually ended up being a late work day so she cancelled (not last minute) and she proposed a day date the next day (a Saturday).

We went out, I took her to an Italian sweet shop in Milan (in her bio she said that she would catch feelings for you if you exchanged sweets with her if yours was better hahaha) then we went for a walk. We talked a lot and about everything.

It was then time to leave for her (she had a birthday dinner) so we walked back to the subway (for my ride) near her house: she told me she had a great time, to text her when I got home and to see each other again.

I then texted her once I got home (about 30 minutes later) that I was really glad I got to meet her and to see each other again soon.

She replied ""Siiii"" (which is the equivalent of ""yessss"" but more enthusiastic in Italian, which she doesn't speak).

I then asked how her night was going (the night of the date), to which I got no reply.

Since I texted her a bit late that evening and knew she only had her weekend free, I texted her on Sunday if she would have wanted to hang out together on Sunday but I got no response.

I haven't texted her since then, but after checking on Instagram I can't see her Instagram stories anymore and not even her Highlights (which means she hid her stories from me).

It already happened before that she would forget to answer me on Whatsapp because of work but we would have a whole different conversation on Instagram in the meantime: this time I got her stories hid from me though, so I know she is ghosting me on purpose.

I'm not mad, just disappointed and confused as to what happened.

Should I text her something along the lines of me not appreciating being ghosted but not begging for her attention or should I just move on?

I'm more inclined to just move on, not text her anything and not care, but it still sucks.

I am not in a good way. I think my self-esteem has been completely shattered. I can‚Äôt even look at myself in the mirror right now. I honestly can‚Äôt. After spending the last ten years intentionally single so that I could raise my daughter and focus on being mom, because I didn‚Äôt want her to ever feel second or like she had to be comfortable with a stranger coming into her life when she was so little and I didn‚Äôt want her to get attached to another father figure that would just walk away, I decided it was time to start dating again. 

I worked heavily on myself. I lost thirty plus pounds, started taking better care of me, found my confidence and upped my position in life. I have a great career that‚Äôs very rewarding and fulfilling. I live in a nice home and drive a nice car. I have all the things that one should have when considering the possibility of bringing another person into their life. No, my body isn‚Äôt perfect. It never will be. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much weight I lose, which I wear a size 12 jeans, my body will never be perfect. I‚Äôm an odd mix of Japanese and Sicilian and French. My face is very Asian and my body is very Sicilian. My teeth are white but a little crooked like my Japanese grandma‚Äôs. Idk. Im not horrendous to look at, but I‚Äôm acutely aware that I‚Äôm not the prettiest woman either. But I have a genuinely good heart. I don‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm loyal to a fault, I try to be kind and considerate to everyone, I give more than I could ever take. I don‚Äôt have a mean bone in my body. 

So when I met ‚ÄòRyan‚Äô via an online dating app and we clicked right away, I was thrilled. He said all the right things, was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. Super consistent which means everything to me because that‚Äôs who I am. There were some major red flags though. Huge. The conversation always went back to sex. He called me things like baby and my love way too quickly. He was heavy with the ‚ÄòI ‚ù§Ô∏è you‚Äô. Before we had even met and please don‚Äôt be thinking that we were talking for months. I know I know. I KNOW. That‚Äôs my bad y‚Äôall. I just got excited and wanted what he said to be true. 

We exchanged pictures almost daily. I wanted him to know what he was getting. He‚Äôs a 6‚Äô6‚Äù military man with a pretty fit body. He was definitely not physically perfect, but I didn‚Äôt care at all. Anyway, we exchanged pictures and I made sure to tell him, ‚ÄúI have a mom bod‚Äù. His exact words were, ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm not superficial at all. Bodies change, looks fade, nobody is perfect. I have stretch marks too. I don‚Äôt care what your body looks like, I just want to see you. But do you have a picture in your bra and panties so I can see what ‚Äòmom bod‚Äô means?‚Äù üòí No he did not get a picture like that from me, thank God. He was constantly telling me how beautiful and perfect I was and how cute and sweet. Just laying it in thick. After so much of that, you start to really like it. I looked forward to hearing it every day.

Then it was time to meet. He lives an hour away from me. I‚Äôm OKC and he‚Äôs Lawton. Originally, we were supposed to go to dinner and go have drinks or find something fun to do in the city since he never comes this way. He changed the plans at the last minute saying he‚Äôd had a long week and just wanted to relax. He asked if we could hang out in the room and order in. I said okay. Idk why. I just did. It was also going to be late by the time he got there since he had been at work all day. I went above and beyond to make this work. He loves anime and DBZ. I stopped and bought him a DBZ hat and a Naruto shirt. He bought me Plan B lol. I showed up to the hotel and he opened the door and for a split second I almost bolted. But he pulled me in and he was his normal sweet self. He kissed me, like a really nice sweet first kiss, and then I pushed him back. I knew exactly what he was wanting to do and it wasn‚Äôt going to happen. I had told him already I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with him until we were official. He said he just wanted to have ‚Äòus time‚Äô and cuddle. 

I‚Äôm soooo stupid. I know that. I ended up staying the night there, at his request, but still nothing exciting happened. He wanted to make plans immediately for the next weekend, since he was originally supposed to stay Friday and Saturday, but again changed the plans. We made plans for him to come back the next weekend and stay with me. Again, I know stupid. Even though I don‚Äôt think he ever actually intended to keep those plans. Everything he said via text, he said in person. Everything. He didn‚Äôt seem disappointed or disinterested. He made it a point to tell me I was beautiful. That morning we got up and around. He was great, apologetic for leaving, affectionate. All of that. At one point, he came up behind me and pulled me into this really tight and affectionate hug. He just held me there and swayed back and forth and told me how happy he was that we met. He would just sit there and stare and smile. He didn‚Äôt have to do all that if he didn‚Äôt mean it. 

We left the room and went to the elevator. He was still kissing me and being affectionate. He told me to text him as soon as I got home and he would do the same. I did text, one short message saying I was home and thanking him for being him. He didn‚Äôt text. I checked off and on all day. He wasn‚Äôt active on Facebook for 9 hours. I figured he was busy and left him alone. Then suddenly he popped up. No text or message back. I almost messaged him again to check in, but before I could, he blocked me. I was shocked. I did then send him a text. We both have iPhones and I noticed immediately that my messages were not delivered. He blocked me there too. I was crushed. I didn‚Äôt understand why or what happened or what I did wrong. The next morning, I messaged him via snap and let him know I was confused and hurt and asking him what happened. He asked me, ‚Äúwho is this?‚Äù Like he didn‚Äôt know or maybe I wasn‚Äôt the only girl? I told him who it was and no response. Immediately blocked.

I don‚Äôt know what happened. I still don‚Äôt know what I did. I can only assume I wasn‚Äôt attractive enough or funny enough or something enough. My heart hurts so bad. I‚Äôm just glad I didn‚Äôt sleep with him because I wanted to. And I‚Äôm mad at myself for believing in him so strongly. I feel absolutely worthless right now and genuinely hurt.

Or 'I think we should stay friends' or 'I think we are not a good fit'. Are prashes that make no complete sense.

This makes dating insanely hard and frustrating and yess reality is more nunanced and there are exceptions. Feellings don't correspond with wel reality. Let me give you a example, so lets say hypothetically you would date the guy; and he goes in for the kiss. After FEELING comfortable now after the kiss you did not FEELL it so you cut the connection. Just a week after his investment in stocks skyrocket and he made over $300K. And you found out later, now you missed this chance because you didn't FELT it on that moment and later regret it. See? A COMPLETE JOKE.

On top of that Dating is a JOKE too. Do you really care about his job, hobbies, friends, intertrest? If John B and John C bolth have the same status, job, hobbies and lets say also looks. But for some reason you want to be more with John C, despite their stories being exactly the same; what would make the difference then? Exactly attraction, but now look that atraction is getting a time span now. Because it can fade and now the outcome is exactly the same despite John C being more 'attractive'. Because you stopt FEELLING it. Isn't that completely retarted??? Ofcourse i'm sure that you have your share of 'retarted guy things' too...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162976,public,self,Changing your mind,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t8rwbj/changing_your_mind/,no_ads,0.0,,,

After that we had a big dinner and all went clubbing. At the club we danced together a lot, and afterwards she came back to my place with a few common guy friends for carbonara.

Me her and another guy ended up passing out in the sofa, and when i woke up in the morning she was leaning against my shoulder which escalated to snuggling. After our friend left she asked if we could sleep in my bed instead, so we ended up cuddling, which led to making out and some light toughing on my end. I then tried to take off her shirt but she said she was really tired so we went back to making out and then she fell asleep.

I got up and made us breakfast after a while, which we ate in bed. We then went back to cuddling and talking until she said she had to get back home and shower, so she kissed me goodbye and I asked if she wanted to meet again sometime and for her number. Things felt a little awkward but I‚Äôm not the smoothest at asking people out so i just chalked it up to that. The thing that has me guessing is after she gave me her number she warned me that she tends not to have a lot of free time, which tbf does make sense considering how much she works with college events.

Normally i would assume that means she‚Äôs not interested, but in this case I‚Äôm not so sure.

1. We were both sober
2. She made most of the first moves
3. The kissing felt more romantic than sexual
4. She looked at me and smiled  and laughed a lot while kissing
5. She chose to stay over quite a long time
6. She kissed me goodbye

I guess I‚Äôm worried I came on a bit strong or serious so she lost interest. What do you guys think? And what should my next move be? Invite her on a date? We were both into some of the same sports so that could be fun. Should I invite her to a party to keep it casual? How long should I wait? Should I text, call or wait to see her at school? 

Thanks for any advice, I really like this girl.

Sometimes the dating world can seem so unfulfilling, but when you finally find that person, all of your experience with love, or lack thereof, falls into place.

For most of my adult life until I nearly turned 30 (man), I was single. I had only one long term relationship with a woman between from age 25 to 27. I met this girl through a friend at a time of desperate loneliness, and it turns out we were both dealing with that pain, so when we found each other it seemed to be a good thing. Within 6ish months I knew the relationship was doomed to fail, but I never had that kind of connection before, so I decided to just ride it out and enjoy it while I could.

Huge mistake, not just because I knew it wasn't working for me, but because she had a crippling fear of loneliness and would never leave me no matter how incompatible we were. She had a lifetime of negative male figures in her life, and no matter how much we didn't line up, I would always treat her respectfully and with kindness, or at least I always tried to. She became dependent on my kindness, but she did not give that respect in return. She was bitter, jealous, and hypocritical in her expectations of me and our relationship. I was holding back my own life's desires to make sure she felt supported, even though inside I was struggling to justify any of it. 

We tortured ourselves by staying together for nearly two years. When I finally decided to end it, she was surprisingly shocked and brutal in her response, but I stuck to my decision. I will always harbor the regret of leading her down a path that I was not prepared to follow. She saw it as me wasting her time, I saw it as an opportunity to learn about myself and what I did wrong because I did a lot wrong.

I spent the following two years trying to date, but I'm introverted and anti-social so it was difficult. My biggest resource was online dating. I tried them all, Match, Tinder, bumble, eharmony, you name it I tried it. In a two-year period, I went on a total of about 10 dates. Matches were few and far between. I got to the point where I just accepted I was one of those people who are meant to just be alone, so I began focusing on myself and trying to be the best me I could be.

I kept at the online dating though. I still wanted to make a human connection. I had started using Hinge with a little better luck than I had with the other services, then one day I matched up with a woman whose pictures took my breath away. Surely it must have been a mistake that she swiped right on me and she'll just ignore my message, but surprisingly she responded, and soon enough we had a first date scheduled. That date was the night my life changed. When we walked away from each other I knew something significant had happened. 

She also confirmed a very different experience in online dating as a woman. Whereas I would go weeks or months at a time without matching with someone, she would be constantly fielding many candidates at a time always with a massive list of men who would respond to her at a moment's notice. How crazy the experiences differ. While I was struggling to find anyone who would give me a chance, she was going on many dates and finding herself just as unfulfilled as I was. 

As we got to know each other, it became clearer to me that all of the pain and loneliness I had encountered in the dating world all led to this relationship. Without all of those lessons in not only loving another person, but also loving yourself, the peace that I've found with this woman would have never been possible. Everything led to this relationship, and life could not have happened any differently to get me these. Our wedding is scheduled for Oct 15 and neither of us has expressed a single moment of doubt or anything short of unconditional love for each other.

Point being, no matter how desperate things may seem, as long as you stay true to yourself you will find someone who loves and appreciates all of you. No matter how long you've been searching, when the day comes you find that special someone, you'll see the events in your life could not have unfolded any differently.
