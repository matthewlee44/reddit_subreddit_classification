Hey , so I met a girl who is 17 , around 8 months ago and since 8 months we have had alot of conversation and we enjoy each other's company....I have a friend who is just like my brother(consider his name as""Ryan"") , Ryan too was having conversations with her during the same timeline, from the start I and my friend ryan, we both knew the fact that she was into ryan. 1to 1.5 months later she started giving signs and confronted that she had started falling for me , I didn't took her words seriously and continued to have casual conversations with her and told her THAT HER FEELINGS FOR MINE ARE JUST INFATUATION AND SHE SHOULD TALK TO RYAN , WHICH MIGHT HELP HER SUPPRESS HER FEELINGS FOR ME , later she stated whatever she said to me about falling for me was just a joke. I being curious to know her real intentions decided to stop having conversations with her for a month. A month later I was informed that she confessed ryan that she loves him and they are going quite well. I got my answer to my curiosity so I started reaching out to her after that 1 month of silence, we were having postive conversation , sometimes she used to bring up conversation about her and Ryan and I too didn't mind , Things continued like this and I found out that she was in a relationship with Ryan , I continued having conversations with her though until one day she suddenly told me that we both should stop talking to each other, I assuming that this might be a consequence of her going in relationship with Ryan and Ryan being insecure about her talking me , so I didn't retaliate and decided to stop talking to her. The next day ryan called me up on my phone and said that he broke up with her and he is sure this time but he didn't clearly stated the reason why he broke up , I being curious decided to reach out to her and  know what's the matter. She said that the previous day she was on a verge of committing suicide but before attempting that she called Ryan and Ryan somehow managed to change her mind and saved her. Still she said that she broke up with him but didn't really stated the reason for her decision to break up with him to me . Days later I asked her out for a meet up and she agreed , we had a great time. In 12 days I asked her out and we met each other 4 times , we ended up ""making out"" on the 2nd and 4th occasion. In this timespan she at several instances told me that she loves me , I accepted her feelings and we are now in a relationship , Now she is very loving and makes me feel loved every moment, she confessed that she had been in many relationships in the past.


SHE SAYS THAT SHE USE TO LOVE ME FROM THE BEGINNING , SINCE I DIDN'T RESPONSE AT THE START SHE STOPPED HITTING ON ME AND THOUGHT THAT HER FEELINGS FOR ME WILL EVENTUALLY FADE AWAY, SO SHE INSTEAD WENT WITH RYAN , WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER , ACCORDING TO HER SHE BROKEN UP WITH RYAN BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING GUILTY AND INFACT REALISED THAT SHE ONLY LOVES ME, ALTHOUGH RYAN STATED TO ME AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO BROKE UP SO HERE BOTH OF THEIR WORDS ARE CONTRADICTORY


SHE ALWAYS CONFESSED THAT IN ALL HER PAST RELATIONSHIPS , SHE HAD PHYSICAL INSTANCES I MEAN LOVE MAKING WITH HER BOYFRIENDS , SHE ALSO STATE THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE ORAL JOB TO ONE OF HER BOYFRIEND ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T WANTED TO . MY FRIEND RYAN ALSO HAD HIS HANDS ON HER AS SHE SAYS THEY KISSED AND HE TOUCHED HER CHEST ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO HER RYAN WAS THE ONE WHO INITIATED...... ALTHOUGH SHE STATES THAT SHE IS A VIRGIN, I DON'T KNOWN


I LOVE THE WAY SHE MAKES ME FEEL LOVED , WE ARE JUST IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR 4 DAYS AND AFTER HEARING ALL HER CONFESSIONS I AM  IMAGING ALL THE SCENES OF HER MAKING OUT WITH OTHER GUYS IN MY HEAD AND ITS HAUNTING ME.

After getting some sense into myself, I decided to cut communication with him and stop trying because it was clear to me that we wanted different things and I was getting hurt by keeping him round.

What baffles me though is that his mum texts me to see how I am and wanting to meet up for a coffee.

I had a date last night I thought things were going well but he tried to come back to my place but I politely refused saying I have to be up for work tomorrow and today I’ve heard *crickets* 

He did send me a text straight after the date and sent me an Insta follow but it’s the lack of communication all day today and being so blatantly forward in wanting to come to my house. 

The other guy who rejected me was showing so much interest, meeting up every week etc. we kissed but didn’t have sex because I don’t want to have casual sex I rarely do one night stands and even when I do them I get horrible anxiety after. So I ask this guy who’s been on and off showing interest for 3 years if he ever had any feelings “in that way” for me and he said no and I’ve had feelings for him before and I don’t want to get hurt so I said ok sorry I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to see each other. But it still hurt a little that he was totally fine making out obviously expecting it’ll lead to sex but I don’t do that. 

The other rejection was from my ex who’s dumped me twice, but had no issues having sex with me after even though he knew I was in love with him and that’s why I kept doing the deed even after the breakup. 

It’s like to all these men I’m only good enough for sex and nothing more. And I don’t take it personally, I’d rather find out sooner than later. 

But if I’m being honest sometimes it’s exhausting. The only other guy who seemed to want a relationship got too obsessed too quickly, it got scary and one night he fondled me chest in my sleep without my consent and I class that as assault. This year I genuinely feel like none of the men I’ve met have wanted me for more than my body, even the ones I thought were decent tried to do things to me while I was asleep and just wanted a cuddle. 

I keep my chin up and it makes me happy that I don’t give into sex with these men but it’s starting to make me a little sad. I do enjoy sex and my sexuality and have a very high sex drive - but with someone that I love. I don’t feel those urges with men that I’m not committed to but it seems like the men that I meet move on so quickly if I’m not willing to give them what they want right away. 

I try to stay positive but sometimes it really hurts. I have my flaws but overall I really like the person that I am. I have a big heart and I don’t think I deserve to constantly be let down like this, I don’t understand why it happens to me.

Now we both went on holidays and when we came back we had a cinema scheduled, that got cancelled because he was too tired/ busy with work that he had to catch up on.

After that, I invited him over for food, then drinks &amp; cinema. He agreed on Sunday, and we organised it over a few days.

Saturday came, he went out and called me the next morning to iron out a few details. He apologised as we had to postpone until later evening, we cancelled the meal at mine and settled for cinema/drinks. I think he wanted to get a few things done (work related) before the date, which I understood bc he has a tedious job and had a presentation.

He also apologised for going out the night before knowing we had something planned, and I didn’t get why at first bc he can’t plan his whole week end around 1 event.

I thanked him for making the time bla-bla-bla. We agreed on a time, location and programme.

A couple hours later, he texts me saying that he’s getting worried about work &amp; that he wouldn’t be able to enjoy and relax knowing he’s got so much stuff to do, implying he’d want to reschedule.

I ignored for a couple hours, he texted a few times in between trying to get my attention. 

I was pretty upset/ disappointed - had I known I would have planned something else for my Sunday so I didn’t reply until I wasn’t.

When I replied, I said I understood in many words but that I was disappointed.

He then apologized saying any other afternoon/evening would have been great, thanking me for understanding even though I was annoyed and that he sensed the disappointment.

I answered again saying I understood, but that I was annoyed I couldn’t be annoyed blabla, and that I didn’t reply immediately bc I don’t like being rash in my replies bc I can sound so blunt by text.

All he said after was “You are good I didn’t take it that way so don’t worry 😘” 

I didn’t reply.

No date has been set for the new date, which I’m not happy about - the least you can do is offer an alternative and I did give him a few cues to do so.

He’s leaving in 10 days for a holiday, don’t know if he’ll be back before December bc he has landlord issues.

Don’t know what to do. Pause this until he’s back? Move on completely? Ignore his last message? We had a great momentum and now it’s dying down - to me at the very least.

I don't even know where to go if I were to go out because I know no venues like bars where I'd be comfortable. Many girls I know also do drugs which is really common here. Again, never done that.

Haven't ever come even remotely close to being intimate with a girl so I cannot relate to people who have.

. Tells me has other girls after him

. If I send him a photo on social media he replies with “ I love how your sending this to how many other guys aswell” then doesn’t believe me when I say I’m not

. Every little thing I do now annoys him even though in the beginning we was so care free and always had an absolute laugh
. Before when we’ve joked we’re going to replace each other he would laugh whereas now he goes mad at me and tells me I can’t believe you have said that
. Tells me I only message him when I’m drunk but it’s cool and no worries (even though this isn’t true)
. He went away for 2 months to a different country and said is “there any point in this/us anymore as he is away” when I accepted it and deleted him to move on he went mad and asked me why I wouldn’t let him finish what he had to say, but to me if it’s finished what more do I have to say.

First date wasn't the best or worst first date I've ever been on. But I liked her enough that I wanted to see her again.

So I asked her out again a couple days after the date. She agreed but said she had plans to fly home and spend Halloween weekend in her hometown.

So we set a weekend date the following weekend. We planned on going to the aquarium. I told her they do times entry tickets and they needed to be purchased in advanced. She okay'd this and I got the tickets for the agreed time and day.

Morning of the date she tells me she is sick, throwing up, and will need to postpone the date. I tell her it's okay, just feel better, the usual stuff.

I thought she might be lying, but I posted our text convo here and the consensus said give her the benefit of the doubt. So I did, and honestly her pattern of behavior, unusual lack of social media activity over the days she said she was sick, sent me selfies (she looked sick) makes me believe her. And at thos point, if her motive was to get out of seeing me, this whole thing was way more elaborate than it's worth to just say no to me. So theres that.

This past weekend I had to work three 12s and had no time for anything hit work/food/sleep. I asked her if she still wanted to reschedule, she immediately replied ""definitely!"" But we havent picked an actual day yet. 


Now, from what I know about this girl through our date, our conversations, and her social media, she seems to be shy/introverted. And not particularly experienced dating. I could be wrong but I kind of get the feeling she is interested, but doesnt want to, or know how to put in the effort to make it work. She was also very nervous on our date, and I dont think it was me. I look like my pictures and am above average looking. 

She still responds texts immediately, sends selfies, sends flirty texts..but we barely ever see eachother. 


So I guess I'm trying to figure out her pattern of behavior. It must be explained by either

- She's interested and we are both just off timing wise
- She's shy and inexperienced dating
- Im wrong about the above and she's just not interested

Thoughts? I dont want to keep investing time in something that isnt going anywhere.

Lol so I, 19F, broke up with my long term boyfriend about a month ago and since then I’ve gone on 4 first dates with guys I met online. I’ve regretfully bailed on like 5 other potential first dates (made the mistake of wanting to only focus on one person at a time- I regret that). But yesterday and the day before I went on two different first dates and in both occasions I was like- wow they’re hot. Yesterday especially so.

Maybe I’m just biased but wow. He’s so far out of my league in my opinion, but I did have a fun time talking to him so hopefully we can at least be friends (he goes to my university). 

And like, I think that’s pretty common for a lot of guys since they don’t tend to catfish and/or even have super posed and flattering photos of themselves. My friend has told me my photos are a very good representation of how I look irl (my skin is a bit bad at the moment but I can wear concealer etc and it’s healing now that I saw a dermatologist and started a routine). And it’s not perfect in my photos either. So I think she’s probably right. I don’t use any photoshop or filters. Sometimes I wear different makeup I guess, but still. I do think I look quite pretty irl other than having problems with my hair and skin at the moment (which I can mostly fix).

So that's why I wonder if my current standards are higher than they should be.

I've been ghosted so I started thinking why, and I think that the reason was how open I was about my insecurities too soon and too strongly. And I think I can appear kind of not sane sometimes, so I'm working on that and in the future I won't do excessive validation seeking with guys. I've been getting more and more stable and recovered from my eating disorder btw so that's cool.

Now, I'd like a reality check. My idea of a relationship would be very slowburn, like getting to know each other as friends and having comfortable chemistry, growing together and learning to love each other for real, forming a lifelong stable connection. I don't want to call him my boyfriend after two months and then watch it fall apart.
My requirements are that he should be conventionally handsome, and that I should be his physical preference (body type, hair/eye color...) unless he has none. I am 100% sure I would not date a man who has a thing for chubby women, or redheads or anything I'm not. But I'm afraid because what if I get that beautiful connection only to find out that his ideal woman would look nothing like me? That's not something I'm willing to compromise about, since I don't really have a type, only things I'm into or not into and I obviously won't date a guy I'm not into.

Does it count as showing crippling insecurity if I ask a guy quite early on what's his physical type? I really need to know because if a man says something like ""my favourite colour is green"" I immediately assume he has a thing for green eyes unless he stated otherwise. I want to avoid that kind of stress.

And my other requirement is that he should be a feminist (or think like one), and want marriage and kids. Is that contradictory? I just want a man who is progressive but still wants a traditional life like me.

Also will it be considered a red flag by guys that I never had a boyfriend before? I'd sleep with pretty much any safe guy but when it comes to serious stuff, I'd like my first boyfriend to be my last, like, someone I extremely care about and I know for sure I'm in love with.

Once there we order drinks, I make her laugh a lot, she is flirty, it's clear things are going well. Kept playing with each other's hands throughout. I ask her if she had ever tried \[activity\] to which she replies no so I invite her to go together on Sunday or Monday. Again she smiles and says ""Yeah! I would like that!"". At around 3 am (so 6 hours after first meeting) but after a while she says ""actually I have to help a friend who needs to remove her cast on Sunday, in that case we can go on Monday"". Alright.

I take her home, we stand in front of her building for a bit, we kiss multiple times. Once I'm home we have a final exchange on whatsapp (where the screenshots start, see below).

The following 2 days she takes *hours* to reply and...Well, you can read the rest here: [https://imgur.com/a/HdiXNRb](https://imgur.com/a/HdiXNRb)

Keep in mind that I'm absolutely not butthurt by the fact that she said ""no"" (it's a numbers game) but only by the fact that I made it clear my time is valuable and to respect it (as I respect hers) and all she did was making up what I think were a bunch of excuses to either not see me again or just string me along in case the better prospect didn't work out (I'm 99% that was the case).

In the hours she was ""too busy"" to reply she would post stories on freaking Instagram...

Or maybe I totally overreacted and I should have taken what she said at face value. In that case: any suggestions on how to recover?

So, awhile back I posted here talking about how it is hard for me to find a traditional Catholic woman. I am now out of the U.S. and living in Poland and I see that there are many traditional Catholic women in the smaller towns and villages. But many of them that are single happen to be in their late 20s like me. As of now, I'm about to be 27 years old as of the end of November.

Personally, I find myself not wanting to get married and have children with a woman who's even a year older than me because she'd probably be 30 by the time we'd be married and have our first child and for some reason, I'm not comfortable having children with a woman in her 30s. It's very odd, but I can't help myself. Lately, I've finding myself more attracted to younger women *(19-22 years old)*. Yet, every time I bring this up, there will be some people who will give me flak for liking someone who's 7-8 years younger than me. Although other people will say there's nothing wrong with that age gap. 

At the same time, its rare to find a woman in her early-mid 20s to be a traditional Catholic Christian at all and embracing the traditional lifestyle. I'm sure there are some around and maybe I'm not looking hard enough. But until then, I'm in a pigeon-hole it seems. I want to be married and have a family of my own one day, but I do not know which age group I should stick with. Early 20s or Late 20s?

Thus, I've come here to once again seek advice from you all.

So I am going into week 9 NC. Brief overview:

We had a disagreement over text. I was first to reach out after a few days - silence. I reached out again to apologise for my part in the disagreement, also said it was clear he was not speaking to me and I would respect that - I was again met with silence.

He began orbiting my social media which hurt my feelings. In order to protect myself I removed his access to my social media stories for 2 reasons - 1 to stop myself posting things to try and get his attention (we have all done it come on guys), and 2 to let him know that it's not ok to orbit me whilst ignoring me. I don't do toxic i'm sorry and I have stayed in NC without 1 slip for 8 weeks. It's been tough.

I have known him a very long time (Friends that go way back) and our relationship is just under a year, I am still shocked that it has ended over something so small - a disagreement! I have hoped and prayed every day since that he would reach out so that we can resolve this.

Week 9 and I am starting to resent him, resenting him for treating me like i'm nothing. I'm a good person and did not deserve the silent treatment - TWICE!!! I thought our long time friendship meant something - clearly not. I have been tempted to reach out a third time but for what? Another ghost no thanku!. My upset is turning to anger and I suppose acceptance. I would still be open to a conversation I think i'm owed that. However it's not on me to put this right anymore.

My thoughts - anyone who ghosts to end a relationship/friendship is in my view an asshole and a coward! I have not once begged or pleaded, never been constantly calling, messaging, not liked or bombarded social media. certainly not a story watcher either!

 I am a good person with a good heart and would love to hear why men/women end a relationship/friendship this way and whether they felt bad afterwards?  I would like to think that he would contact me one day but whether I will be forgiving is decreasing everyday that passes.

Any thoughts/advice appreciated and any ghosters with their stories I won't judge - curious as to why people do it more so in long term relationships/friendships??

So have I (M32).

I have determined that it is because he is being too picky / choosy. Here is the thing. He has an excellent education and career and is in fact in a very enviable position résumé wise, especially for his age. But in my view this has come at the cost of him neglecting his body. I'm going to be blunt but he is physically unfit having a huge beer belly (despite being a teetotaler).  I know that being physically unfit makes one physically unattractive, regardless of gender. Further, he has grey hair that makes him look 40+

On the other hand my friend has had Women show interest in him but he has turned them down, primary because he wants another educated professional. That, along with moral character and having a good connection / getting along are what matters to him. He doesn't seem to really care about looks. Which is great but it doesn't change the fact that physical attraction is necessary in a relationship and it is hard to be attractive when you are physically out of shape.

On the other hand, my friend is convinced that he is a top-tier catch because he has a good education and career and is also really good with kids + has certain domestic skills. According to him, he brings both the traditional male and female roles to the table and therefore ""deserves"" someone who is about as successful as him career wise. Essentially he wants a ""fair deal""

I was getting tired of him complaining about being unable to find someone who I laid out the bitter truth and told him that he can't find love because he is in truth not much of a catch because of his looks and it doesn't matter how much he *thinks* he brings to his table - if you are physically unattractive it doesn't matter and that he is not in a position to be picky. If a Woman is of good character and you get along and there is mutual attraction you should date here and not restrict yourself to successful professionals.

This triggered him and he got hurt and angry. He went on his usual spiel on how he brings a lot to the table, how he ""deserves a fair deal"", his view on how the male provider role is entrenched and how it's not fair that he's expected to ""marry down"" despite being good with kids. He also said that he does in fact exercise regularly, and has healthy behaviors, etc. (you can't tell that by looking at him). and that it is not like he is obese or anything and in fact is physically fit when you look at the running / walking / biking he does / is able to do. He acknowledges that he is overweight but doesn't see it as an issue because he is not looking for a ""supermodel"" and doesn't really care about looks anyway.

And sure that may all be true but if you appear physically unfit and 40 you are going to have a hard time finding someone in their early 20s and you need be willing to compromise on certain standards. I also think he is en route to becoming one of those cat ladies who can't find someone because they refuse to consider those less successful / educated.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126710,public,self,I told my friend he is not the catch that he thinks he is and should lower his standards.

After a pretty rough fight we never talked and I always felt bad for never asking her out. Today she sent me a friend request in FB. (We blocked each other on insta and she didn't have fb back then) so I assume she's wanting to be friends or am I reading too much into this as I still have some feelings for her? I don't even know how should I start a Convo with her after so long if I even accept the request.

I recognized her one day on the public bus and we had a good conversation and I asked for her number.

We exchanged numbers and texted for a bit before I asked if she wanted to grab dinner sometime.

She said ”I’m not looking for anything at the moment, I hope you understand!”

Me thinking she was implying she doesn’t want a relationship I clarified texting “I’m not looking for a relationship, just something casual if you’re open to that”

She never responded and the next day in class she moves her seat to two rows behind me instead of 1.
