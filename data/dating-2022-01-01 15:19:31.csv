3,rtt7s3,1641073050,"How to have the ""exclusivity"" or ""define the relationship"" talk","I (25M) met a girl (23F) online about 2 months ago. We talked a bit but didn't really get to go on our first date until just over month ago (I had some stuff going on in my life and I was also seeing some other girls so I didn't have time). 

Our first date was just coffee and a walk but it went really well. Since then, we've had a weekly date (8-12hours) once every weekend. After our first kiss on our third date, we've started having regular phone calls/face time calls every few nights (5-6 hours long).

I spent new years eve last night with her. We have a trip planned where we're going away for one night for skiing. I really like this girl and although I haven't told her (and she probably doesn't know) but I dropped all the other girls and stopped using OLD after our second date. I like to go with the flow but I'm also worried I'm making what we have to be more than what it actually is. I think she does like me too because she baked for me the other day.

We haven't really talked about us or our ""relationship"". We haven't had sex (and I don't plan on it. I'm not comfortable having it so early on). We have made out quite a bit though. My question is, is it worth it to have a talk about what we are and make sure we are all on the same page? And if so, how and when do I bring it up? I wouldn't mind going with the flow and I don't want to make thing awkward.

4,rttaf0,1641073251,How to friendzone the men I work with?,"I don't mean to toot my own horn. I just started a new job and there are a handful of men who are progressively being friendlier and friendlier, like coming over to visit me at my workstation and trying to talk because that's pretty much the only time they do have to talk to me. As time goes on one guy has already offered to take me on a road trip, a ride home, out to eat all in one day (I'm staying away from him) and I can feel some of them starting to work up to try and ask me out. I hate the level of discomfort I feel around so many men, I just want to be friendly without it being seen as flirting and not think about every single thing I say to not potentially lead them on. I truthfully have a crush on a couple of them but I still am not interested in dating or being more than coworkers because I really fucking value this job and would hate for any tension to be there. I also want to know everyone's habits and personalities for at least a year before I even think about it.

Basically I'm afraid someone will ask me out for coffee and I won't know how to say no without being rude. It's worse because it seems they all know that I'm single, and for some reason that also means ""available."" I always keep the conversations short so that I don't get in trouble because it happens so often. I'm new to being single after getting out of a 5 year relationship and have no idea how to navigate this without the excuse of having a boyfriend. I don't have any friends in the new town I'm in. 

I was just wondering if there are any tips women in the workplace have for keeping men in the friendzone. I just had to leave my ex a year ago and I'm scared of dating again, he turned out to be a completely different person than when we met.

8,rttdwp,1641073525,My (26f) boyfriend (27m) of one year belittled and embarrassed me twice at our dinner party for his friends,"Tl;dr My (26f) boyfriend (27m) of one year belittled me twice at our NYE dinner party in front of his friends.

We have lived together for a year. 
Last night we held a dinner party for New Year’s Eve with 6 other guests (3 couples).
They are his friends first, because I moved countries to live with him. 

The planning of the day went smoothly, I organised the entire apartment and prepped everything that way.. he prepped all the food. It was good teamwork.

Fast forward to the evening. He belittled me twice whilst we were eating together. We were all sharing a Raclette board. 

Firstly, I’ve just been diagnosed with under active thyroid and I’m super fatigued lately. Therefore making clumsy mistakes. I accidentally used my own fork to turn the tofu on the shared hot plate. He caused a scene about this and told me not to do that so everyone heard. The lady at the opposite end of the table said “it doesn’t matter don’t worry” after I apologised. He really made me feel like an idiot for doing it but it was a careless mistake at worst. 

Secondly, he needed to get up from the table and I had the end seat.. he asked me to move firstly. Within 3 seconds (because I had a hot Raclette tray in hand) he told me aggressively to “MOVE” to the extent that two of the women darted their eyes at me to look for my reaction. 

I was mortified. I then followed him out and asked for a quiet word privately. I told him not to speak to me like that.. as if I was a dog under his feet that he was scolding and he became irate at me doing that. 

In the kitchen I asked him for a kiss.. he responded “get off” because he clearly couldn’t bare to just give me a peck on the lips. Then he had the Audacity to act as if I was the one causing a scene for being upset. 

His friends speak a language I don’t speak yet.. but they make effort to include me or translate which is lovely. He doesn’t bother so much and leaves me entirely to my own devices. In normal circumstances that’s fine but the communication barrier gives me anxiety and I want to feel supported. I’ve expressed all of this to him but he responds by shutting me down, rolling his eyes, stonewalling me or saying “you’re giving me a headache”

9,rttk0o,1641073997,Should I tell the “other woman” about him?,"I just got out of a relationship with a horrible, horrible narcissistic abuser who was the worst person I have met in my life. And I have met a ton of people and have lived in and visited various countries. And have even unfortunately been involved with a couple of narcissistic abusers before (I have definitely learned my lesson now). His abuse and narcissism has absolutely ruined, demolished, destroyed my life and has shattered me into a million pieces. 

I recently discovered that my ex has been cheating on me with another woman. I followed him on Instagram once again after deleting him for the longest time because of his treatment of me. They had many pictures together and she seems very happy with him, seemingly oblivious to the extent of his demonic and demented personalities and behaviours. 

She seems like a nice girl, we were all in a mutual chat group before, should I contact her to tell her that she is the other woman and warn her about him? I actually am concerned for her. I don’t want her to be involved with someone like him, I am fully certain that he has been hiding his true self from her because their relationship very much seems light and easy, whereas the narcissist was vulnerable with and opened up to me and thus abused me. I saw him for who he was. 

Usually I do not get involved in or want to cause drama, but for the first time in my life I want to provide a warning to someone and feel ok about doing it.

I was broken up with today by a girl who I really saw something special with. Our relationship was so fun and genuine, but I took it too fast out of excitement. I had (have) a massive crush on her so it was amazing. She started becoming unhappy the last few weeks so I don't blame her for her decision.

We're in medical school and I move tomorrow to start clinical rotations on Monday. Not a fun start to the year. We'll be away from each other for 3 months so it'll probably be good for us. It sucks but I also don't want her to become more unhappy. I wanted to do something to improve it but she didn't want to take the risk of it getting worse, which is understandable. We have been friends for about a year prior to dating but only dated for 2 months so we really didn't date officially for very long. It's just too bad because we both agreed that there was a ton of potential.

I definitely have issues with sexual intimacy because of this, and in an ideal relationship I wouldn’t feel like my worth was solely determined by sexual acts. I know I’ve got a lot of personal healing yet to come, but I don’t think I should have to continue to lower my morals and values for fear of being “boring”.

My favorite dates are when someone’s like “here I have this really cool secret spot I always go to see this amazing view of the city”, or one of my favorite dates was with a guy at a bar and we played pool and he asked me what songs to put on the jukebox and took me and started dancing with me.

90% of the propositions I get these days are guys texting me at 10pm saying they’re already out at this bar and I should meet them.

I do however want to hang out still to do things like catch a sports game or see a play. I want to tell the guy right away that I don’t see a serious relationship happening but I’m open to continue dates.

My reasoning is if this guy is seriously looking for a serious relationship, at least I won’t waste his time or he won’t except sex soon. As I get older I think back on guys I dated, I miss being around them; but I was so upset at the time that they didn’t want a relationship. 

Now I’m open to just dating openly cause I don’t want to miss out on hanging out. I don’t have guy friends and if I attempt to find some on apps, they usually just right towards flirting and dating. 

I’m not looking to date several guys for an ego boost or money, so I want to be honest on my intentions as to not send mix signals. I’m on here asking this cause I’m nervous and hoping he is not a psycho who will go off on me (you know all those “nice guys” that snap if things don’t go their way trope), and will just go with the flow.

I regretted that decision, but tried my best to move on as best as I could. I stayed true to my roots, and stuck to serious inquiries only. The only problem was that almost every guy I tried to date after that was turned off whenever I eventually revealed about my phase.

Talking to my girl friends didn't help, because most of them said that I should either hide it or lie about it (claiming I never had such a phase), but it's not in my nature to manipulate a guy like that. Following advice from reddit, I decided I would just not bring it up unless specifically asked for.

I had started dating a new guy 3 months ago and we got serious. We spent the holidays together, and had a nice Christmas together back in my hometown. But long story short, he ended up finding out about my past. And 2 nights ago, he ended things.

He explained to me that he felt weird that I gave him the impression that I was an angel, and that I wouldn't give it up to just any guy. But now knowing how many guys I've been with (and the type of guys a.k.a douchebags), he didn't feel the same way about me anymore. He had also gotten cheated on in his previous relationship, so he felt that the fact that I hid my past from him was another factor.

Normally I'd go to my girls so that they could tell me ""Oh he's just a jerk, forget about him"" or ""You'll find someone who accepts you for who you are"", but I'm tired of this. I'm tired of the culture we live in where we get on apps and make mistakes, instead of how it used to be done where we meet in person and build genuine connections. It sickens me that I made that mistake a couple years ago, especially knowing that most of the guys I've slept in only viewed me as an object. And now I'm paying the consequences for that...I don't know how to carry on with my dating life.

23,rtud4h,1641076241,I feel my boyfriend is mad at me but cannot be sure.,I had a really stupid argument with my bf today. Our sex is amazing and overall our relationship good. We just had our first misunderstanding in 11 months of dating about a common friend of ours that is flirting with me when we all go out together and the amount of attention that I give him that isn't friendly. I called him myself to apologize and took back some of the stuff I said. Issue seems to have been resolved as we actually discussed it and admitted both making a mistake but I feel I was a bit insulting to him especially since he opened up to me and gave me a very genuine speech about his feelings for us and how he sees us going long term. He accepted my apology but sounded a bit cold (I say that as a precaution since it might just be my interpretation). The fact that most of our common friends agreed with him didn't make the situation better. I texted him in the night a normal routine text. He's usually responsive but hasn't texted me for some hours. I wouldn't normally worry but given the context I am not sure if this is a deal breaker for him. On the phone he told me we are together and we are fine. Couple of days ago he asked me to not be so overly attached to him in public. Then we get in a mini fight because he thinks I was being way affectionate with this common friend and I tend to socialize with him more than with anybody else. Mind that this friend is pretty easy going and makes me laugh but I'm not attracted to him I just enjoy his company. Should I let him come to me when he's processed this and he's ready or wait and call him tomorrow? I am not a fan of leaving a second text when the first one isn't answered. He told me that he considered our argument as resolved but I'm getting anxious. I do love him a lot just got in the heat of the moment. I preferred he tells me if he's mad at me. Given his feedback that I've been overly attached and affectionate I don't think it's smart to call him or text again before he got a chance to contact me but this is also a guy that admitted his strong feelings for me so I want to fight for this relationship as I feel the same but kind of screwed up.

I'm also thinking of starting therapy to cope with old issues, trauma and related self-pity that crop up when things go wrong in the present. I need to fit in a work out routine- get a structure to my day. Once these are all in place I know I'll be golden. Maybe I'll even find time for my neglected hobbies.

I often rely on it to give me joy when I'm unhappy but I often don't realize it at the time. My inner well is dry.

I'm not conventionally beautiful by the ""local standards"" and being dark skinned was an insecurity and matter of much criticism for many years. But I am attractive and have a curvy but nice figure. I'm kind, warm, intelligent and talented with a broad range of interests and hobbies. I've always wanted to be ""known"" and loved rather than be ""seen"" and loved- but men are visual creatures they say, sigh. When I was in shape I had many admirers- I was happier in life too back then. Several things have gone wrong since then and I've often worn a haunted look. Things are finally looking up now. But I have baggage- I'm not the ingenue I once was. This journey is hard. And I'm tired of going alone. I'm jealous of people who seem to have had it easier finding a partner. I really don't know how or where someone like me meets someone. Most people are taken/ married around my age. I could emigrate in a few years and I'll definitely find more like-minded people- that's what people who know me suggest- that I'm a fish out of water here. I don't wanna stay single so long but I'm scared of ""settling"" too.

My question: are the movies fake or do people choose to date unhappy people too, who are still working on themselves? Or must I radiate happiness to make men want to engage? (Seems obvious but considering how high my standards are for myself I don't see me reaching them and being content too soon.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtv4aw/do_men_besides_the_ones_with_savior_complexes/
33,rtv7ix,1641078638,Be friends or move on?,"I had been talking/dating someone for about 3 weeks. It's not long, I know, but the chemistry/connection I felt with him was stronger than anything I'd felt before. Everything was going very smoothly. I felt totally comfortable and had no anxiety at all which is rare for me when I'm getting to know someone new. I should mention he is 12 years older than me (36M and 24M).

Anyway, a few days ago we met up for a couple drinks. Conversation was as good as ever. As we were both finishing up our second round, he put his head down and said he needed to tell me something. Basically he explained that in the past year he got divorced from a man 9 years older than him. He said the age difference ended up becoming an issue, so he told himself he wouldn't do that again. So basically he ended things with me and it was a total shock for me.

Now, I totally understand hesitancy with the age gap and I don't hold that against him, especially considering how fresh he is out of his marriage. However, he did express wanting to be friends. We get along well, and I'd really like him in my life still. But at this point I'm not sure if I can just see him as a friend. I'm currently giving us both space while I heal a bit.

36,rtve32,1641079147,How do you politely reject someone? (Without offending them),"I went to a party for NYE at a friend of a friend’s house. The house is beautiful and huge, like crazy expensive (we are in Seattle.) 

I get along really well with the girlfriend of the guy who owns the home, and tell her I’m single during our conversations. I mention I’m taking a break from dating but of course would love for her to set me up. She gets super drunk, and I’m DD’ing so I don’t drink. I get up and leave and she’s told all of the tech guys at the home I’m single and looking for a boyfriend.

None of these guys I want to date. I don’t care about money. They’re all pretty out-of-shape, and physical fitness is really important to me. (I don’t mean a six-pack, I mean general health/having a normal BMI.) I go up to her and tell her that, and she kind of shushes me and says I can get someone to lose weight, but it’s hard to find guys who make $$$. WTF, I am not about sugar baby grifting. 

Anyway, the fact that I’m single and looking to mingle has emboldened these men. The whole night, I get hit on and hit on. I politely express no interest, but it doesn’t seem to matter. They all ask how old I am and if I have a boyfriend.

One guy at the end of the night comes up to me and says he’s had a crush on me the whole night. He is maybe 100 pounds overweight, and he is staring at my body/making comments about how “hot and in-shape” I am. I just say I’m not looking to date right now. He says he’s going to move to Seattle in a few months and that I should give him my number, in case I want to date when he moves here.

I just say “no thank you, but that is kind,” and he spends the rest of the night glaring at me and sulking. 

WTF am I supposed to do? I get that no one likes rejection, and of course I want to give people chances, but I know myself really well, like I work out eight times a week, and I just couldn’t date someone who doesn’t also prioritize their health.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtve32/how_do_you_politely_reject_someone_without/

Whats my next course of action. I would like to note this my first date in over 6 years as I just got out of a LTR. For reference I’m 25 she’s 23. 

The following happened in just over a week. So I met this girl on tinder we spoke for a bit and she agreed to grab drinks. I picked her up, we went out and had a good time. I took her home, I thought he vibes were right and went in for the kiss. Well i was wrong no problem we hugged and she went inside. I texted her the next day and told her I had a great time. She agreed and said we should do this again. 

A few days later I went out with some friends and some girls who were coming from out of town to hang with my buddy. I invited her out, figured a group would help break the nice and keep it light. Again I picked her up we went out and had a good time. On the way back she asked me what i was doing for New Years and said we should do something together. New yers comes around but I got called in for work the next day at 6:30am. I tell her this and she understands. She calls me around 10:30pm asking me to pick her up(20 min drive) because she got into an argument with her friend and didn’t want to be there and more. I tell her that i’m already in bed and that i wouldn’t be able to. I text her the next day and say something like “Good Morning, did you get home okay” and I get radio silence.

I suddenly came across this girl, who I know. And, we MATCHED.

How do I know her? 2 years ago, I met her at work. I was a senior, and she had been hired as an intern (she was a year older than me, but thats a story for another day).

Whilst at work, me and her got along like fire. If either of us saw each other in the kitchen, or at lunch, we would hangout and just talk nonsense. The banter and connection was there - BUT, she had a boyfriend. So naturally, I told her about my dating experiences and we laughed all about it. Now I didn’t really make a stronger effort to pursue anything with her too. I should mention that we even went out for brunch (outside work) before she finished up. 

Since she finished, we never really talked much. We’re friends on Facebook and follow each other on Instagram. I’ve changed a lot since we last saw each other (lost weight, put on muscle, more confident), and majority of my recent posts have been photos of me, which she has liked (this steps into overthinking territory).

Now we matched on Hinge, have had a brief catch up conversation, and organised to grab lunch tomorrow. 

My question is - is this a date? Or is this just a friendly catch up? And am I allowed to ask what it is? If so, whats the best way to do it?

I see a lot of discussion online about  how the dating standards bar is set so low it’s basically in hell and based on my personal experience, I agree. I generally date people 2-8 years older than me. I’ve been dating casually and I’m saving myself a lot of time setting boundaries that, by my socialization, almost feel petty. My average time taking with/seeing someone is about 2 weeks. 

Here are some examples: 
• can’t clean a dish to completion? Not teaching you. Bye.
• skid marks outside of being exceedingly ill?? No sir. 
• Having to tell them more than twice about a boundary. You’re done. 
• Doesn’t pick up their own trash.
• Disregards my boundaries outright and tries to “make me understand” instead of compromising or even *listening.*
• Constant interruptions in conversation. 
• Demanding too much of my time and attention.
• Emotional incest with mom/sisters. 
• No desire to save money or do better for their financial situation because they make enough to get by, but only barley. 
• Doesn’t wash hands after peeing because their hands are dry. Yuck.

66,rty1lh,1641086883,Is she losing interest?,"I (27M) have been talking to (28F) someone for about a week now. We met online and our conversations started off great.

Our messages (even up until now) have been fairy long. For the first four to five days we would be exchanging messages throughout the day (usually responding every 2-3 hours) and she would be asking me a lot of questions. She would answer my question (over whatever it was about) and then ask me about it. And vice versa.

As I said, messages are still long but the time for her to reply is becoming longer and she’s not asking nearly as many questions.

After about four days of talking, we had a phone call and it was me asking most of the questions. E.g., I could ask her about something she’s been watching (as a fun, friendly question) and she’d answer and not reciprocate. I had to keep asking questions (after she’d give good answers, I’d say) to avoid awkward silence. It was so strange to me because she was asking me a million things per day up to that phone call. And even with all the long texts, there was so much we didn’t talk about.

Keep in mind, we have NOT met in person yet. First date is suppose to be next Friday (due to our busy schedules). She told me this week she’d probably be too busy with existing plans but did come back and say “maybe next Friday?” (Which we had discussed over the phone).

She texted me at 6PM yesterday with a fairly long but underwhelming response (underwhelming relative to how it was when we first started talking). I replied at 9:30PM. She then texted back at 3:45PM today. She started the text with “Sorry! I thought I answered you!” Followed by a cry-face emoji. The rest of the text was somewhat long and also asked a few things like if I had plans for today and how my day has been.

I know that I’m worrying way too much about the texting and that we’re texting too much. I know better than to text like that, phones should be primarily for setting dates, not getting to know each other’s life story. I’m thinking it needs to be reduced and I need to tell her in a friendly way (via text) that texting can be monotonous at times and that I can’t wait to finally meet her next week.

Where do I stand? Is she losing interest or am I overthinking it?

And correct me if I’m wrong, but the only way to really know if there’s chemistry or not is to go on that first date and perhaps even a second or third date. Phone calls and texting don’t tell the entire story.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rty1lh/is_she_losing_interest/

She is like 5 years younger than me and we used to talk in the beginning a lot. She broke up when we met with her ex-boyfriend and then after one week they got back together but still she would flirt with me a lot at work. A lot of things happened at work but nothing actually happened with her because she wanted to stay loyal to her boyfriend (who cheated on her twice). In September I had to leave and go to Europe for like 2 -3 months and after 1 month she broke up and called me right away and said why I left and she wants me there. Of course I thought that she said that, just because she broke up but we kept snapin each other and she wanted me to visit usa as soon as possible, fast forward to last week and iam back, so she offers me to pick me up with another friend colleague from work. We went out that night with a friend of our friend colleague and I was trying to make out with and she would say no. After this I heated on another girl and she immediately goes and makes out with a random guy. On our way home I slept at her place and I don't remember much of that night. I wake up in the morning in her bed and actually nothing happened and I was trying to kiss her and she would just do not kiss me but still hugging me and being close in the same bed half naked. She brought me home and after this I send her a message that a friend of mine sent me about her making out with a random guy and she is like who sent you that and I didn't respond because at that night I didn't know all this and I was pissed. 3 days after this story and we didn't write anything although she would say that she couldn't wait for me to come.

73,rtylvn,1641088586,Why Size is such a big deal,"I have had a lot of time to think about this, especially when it comes to why women seem to have such a different view of it than men do. And of course, this is just my opinion.

I think a lot of women have been getting weird messages about their bodies and how they should feel about them from a young age. We all do really, but for women there are a lot of things specifically relating sex appeal. A lot of my high school classmates would talk about their breast size and waist size. This is long before the majority of us were even having sex. And these days, I see so many things about lip size, thigh size, and even eye size? It just seems like so much, so many things they are always thinking about and being told they should think about. 

And I guess it makes things like having a preference for a guy's *piece* feel like something that is normal and not a big deal to them. I mean if you're worried about whatever a thigh gap is, something like a guy's junk probably seems normal to have a preference for.

It sucks for sure. I'm definitely not a big boy. But I get it I guess and it has really changed my interactions with people to think of it this way. Hope it helps someone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtylvn/why_size_is_such_a_big_deal/

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is though in 2022 the inequality has gotten so extreme I have literally heard women say they use Tinder to have sex with the best looking man and they call all the ugly men creepy and then they will date those same ''creepy'' men and then they will call it settling because they couldn't get the man they wanted and those same creepy men often have to work 10x as hard just to make ends meet and have a high income.

&amp;#x200B;

You have males going in their late 20's to 30's who have never even had women look at them and then you have 25-year-old females who merely by existing people buy her stuff they treat her nicer society always encourages them to cheat as a form of empowerment.

&amp;#x200B;

Know I'm not going extreme and saying fucking go full patriarchal take women's rights away and dehumanize but can we not go in the opposite direction by denying the numbers?

Like compiling this all together being a man in 2022 is like being a rotten corpse every day is worse and every day your life feels like shit.

I'm beginning to worry that the trope of ""online dating is killing relationships because you have endless options on your phone"" is beginning to actually effect my mental ability to cultivate a relationship with someone.

96,ru04p5,1641093303,How do I know? Please help me!,"How do you know if you don’t like someone or you just have an avoidant attachment style? There’s this guy I’ve been seeing for a little over a month and I just can’t make up my mind about him. When I’m with him I feel comfortable and I feel like I can talk about anything with him. He’s kind, considerate, intelligent and masculine. I was the one who actually talked to him first. Unfortunately I’m still on the fence about him. I’m not feeling butterflies or magnetic attraction but I’m also not feeling repulsed which I’ve felt before. I just started to notice I get uncomfortable and nervous when he looks at me in a sweet and caring way. I feel like I’m starting to pick out little flaws in him and trying to find red flags and reasons to not continue with him. I’ll get short bursts of attraction to him but then it will leave me. I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I’ve always been very self sufficient and independent. Maybe I’m afraid of letting him in? I’m not sure. I’m so tired of dating and it never working out. I hate breaking the hearts of really great men. Will I be alone forever? It seems like I’m only super infatuated with men who are distant and out my reach. I’m also worried that if i continue with him I might be settling out of fear but at the same time I’m afraid of regretting leaving such a great guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru04p5/how_do_i_know_please_help_me/
97,ru07tk,1641093576,I feel so unattractive...,"I (30F) started seeing this guy (27M). He always tells me how beautiful and hot he thinks I am, but actually I don't feel that way.
I have been overweight all my life. Now I have lost a lot of pounds and I know I look a lot better, but I have always been body shamed by family members, coworkers, school mates, strangers, etc. Like everyone had something to say about how bad they thought I used to look. 
I have changed my habits and I can be considered chubby or thick now, which means I have curves, and I recently found out men likes that about my body.
The thing is, I feel so unconfident about how I look, it's like I feel less than other women, like there are a lot of girls that are way prettier than me, including my sisters.
I have 2 younger sisters and I think they are so beautiful, in the inside and the outside. They are my best friends, but I can't help to feel that I'm the ugly sister and I'm afraid this guy I'm seeing thinks in the same way.

Today we were texting and I mentioned something about my sisters. He said we all look so alike, and then said that if I make him upset he'll go for my sisters because they are my ""improved version"".

I couldn't help to feel hurt about this comment.
I didn't say anything but I made clear I didn't like it. He said he didn't mean to make me angry and said it was just a joke because he likes to tease me. He said something like I'm so cute and he finds fun to tease me, but that he didn't want to make me upset.

And it's true, he always makes that kind of jokes. But it's the first time he says something that implies he consider other women to be prettier than me. And I just feel sad about it because I always thought it was true. 
I know maybe I'm overreacting, he was just joking and my insecurities are making me take this in the wrong way. Because, in the other hand he always tells me how much he likes me and how much I mean for him. But I can't help to feel sad.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru07tk/i_feel_so_unattractive/

99,ru0as0,1641093826,i’m still in love with my ex but we’re best friends,"we met in like october or november of 2019 and we immediately clicked. our relationship was amazing, but he was stressed about money and focused on getting his own things (yknow his own place &amp; car) so he ended up dumping me a year later and moved back to his hometown. things didn’t work out in his hometown so he moved back with his mom out where I live and we were right back on again but as friends— hell I even road tripped with him back to his hometown to gather his belongings and helped move him back. anyway there’s still the same amount of love there except no couple stuff like kissing and other intimate things. 
we have been two peas in a pod ever since they moved back in february but it still really stings me. i’m madly in love with this person. we hang out nearly everyday and i love being around them, they’re genuinely my best friend. but I often just get really sad bc they’re no longer my person. sure there’s always the possibility especially considering neither of us are interested in other people (that I know of), we still have sleepovers, we are always together, we take care of each other, etc. there’s no one else I could see myself with. 
I just wanted to let that out, it might not make sense but i just wanted to vocalize that somewhere. I know someday I will be loved but i’m just hoping it’s by them. I really am.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru0as0/im_still_in_love_with_my_ex_but_were_best_friends/
