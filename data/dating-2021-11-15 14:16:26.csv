My ex is moving to another country for a year in less than 2 months and even though he knows I still have feelings (I think he does too, but not too sure), he keeps saying that he’s leaving soon. He gets jealous when I talk about other guys and I obviously feel the same way so we try not to talk about other people. He’s going out of town this weekend and my date is this weekend.

3,quphr8,1637007827,My ex wants us to get back together but I'm conflicted,"Before I start, imma apologize for any broken English, it's not my first language. So me(20F) and my ex (21M) dated for 10 months and we broke up 2 months ago. 

We broke up over this girl, F.  I didn't trust her because I found out that she was talking shit about me and my relationship to her friends(which ngl, is none of her business). But since my ex and F had mutual friends, his friends were kinda wary of me and one hated my guts because of all things they heard about me from F.

I actually found out about this because my then-bf told me that their mutual friends came up to him. They asked my then-bf about the things F told them. Once I knew about this, I immediately told my then-bf that I do not want them to talk to each other anymore. I also texted F and told her that I felt uncomfortable that she's texting them and she said that she understands (which I thought she was gonna respect my boundaries).

My then-bf was kinda dismissive about this and kept saying she has a bf, so she's harmless to our relationship. But honestly, I don't really care at the time. I was insecure about our relationship and I felt disrespected that she talked shit behind my back. Before that we might not be close friends, but we were very civil and respectful of each other. I didn't expect her to talk about my relationship problems to other people when it wasn't hers to tell. I asked my then-bf to block her and he did.

More than a month after that, he asked me if he could unblock her because it's been so long already and it's not like he's gonna talk to her. At this point at the relationship, I felt more secure so I trusted him. 
When school started, I saw him hanging out with her and their mutual friend. I didn't pay any mind to it until I saw her touching the back of my then-bf's shirt. (Yknow the type of touching that's like dragging??? like whereever my bf walks, she walks behind him) I was very upset by this behaviour so I went up between both of them and told her to stop touching my bf. I immediately left after that because I just hate confronting people and I just didn't wanna see their reactions. 

I told my then-bf that I was uncomfortable with her and again, he dismissed it by saying that she has a bf so she's definitely harmless. To me, it's her behaviour that was unacceptable because I don't go around touching other guys or her bf??? Throughout the week, I tried to be civil to her and smiling when I see her but she always gave me a fake smile which makes me think she also doesn't like me. I told my then-bf this and he again, dismissed it. 

A week after that, I asked him if they're texting again and he said yes but they are only sending each other tiktoks and she always send the links to all her friends. At this point I felt betrayed but I also didn't wanna blow things out of proportions so we made an agreement that she can text him and he'll answer, but he cannot initiate the conversation further more. I also found out that she sends the tiktok links to ALOT of guys(idk if her bf knows this but I kinda find it weird because she doesn't send them to her girl friends?). Nevertheless, we agreed and I was really trying my best to trust my then-bf.

10 days later, I asked if they still talk and he admitted to initiating the conversation with her, despite our agreement. I was very frustrated because he crossed my boundaries. I told him to explain himself but he decided to break up with me. He felt like he should be friends with whoever he wants and I shouldn't control him, which was valid.

After we brokeup, he kept saying that he regretted breaking up with me and he apologized for crossing my boundaries. He said that really wants us back together by next year because he misses me. I told him that for us to get back together, he must cut all contacts with her because throughout our relationship, she was always the problem. I honestly didn't think he would because him and her are actually in a pretty close group of friends. But he told me that he will stop texting her but he's pretty sure he can't avoid talking to her irl since they hv mutual friends. 

Now I don't know what to do because I don't wanna make their friends feel awkward and if their friends find out that he cut her off because of me  they're gonna hate me more. I truly think he regretted breaking up with me and he truly regrets his actions. But I don't  know if i should be with someone that broke my boundaries multiple times.

TLDR; me and my bf broke up because he crossed my boundaries over another girl. He regretted it and is willing to cut her off for good but idk what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quphr8/my_ex_wants_us_to_get_back_together_but_im/

For 2 months I (17m) have been dating this girl (16f) and the beginning of it was rainbows and butterflies (though nothing was made official). I met her parents and we had a lot of fun together. These past couple days she has left me on delivered on Snapchat for no apparent reason (I have left her on delivered for extended amounts of time but not days). I figured she was either busy or playing games. Today, I saw her in the hall at school and looked at her. She saw me and looked away. In the past, she had looked at me and we occasionally smiled at each other. At lunchtime, I went to the library, where she normally hangs out (as do I). She was not there either. So, I  believe that she is avoiding me. However, she was glancing at me in math class but I did not ask her to be my partner when we did work.

I’m a 20 (M)This might be pretty long but bare with me here.
     I’ve been at a very deteriorating low point recently for the past 2 years.Ive gotten to a point where I’m very lonely.So this dating world become almost non existent to me.No one ever flirted with me or showed any sign of interest in the past 2 years.Hell maybe they did but I was just too down and with very little self esteem to notice.3 weeks ago I meet this girl that I liked very much(this hasn’t happened in a long time)I ask her out for coffee she agrees.
  We meet and it goes great and I can tell she was very interested.She said she really liked me after the date and I was just shocked and I couldn’t understand why.I thought maybe she was using me for something or she thought I’m rich or smthn.Ik thinking that was bad but tbh no one was ever interested in a long time so my mind will refuse to believe in anyway this is true.
     
      We meet again after the date and she came to my place a few times so did I.Until now it’s going great.I love the way she looks at me and smiles and texts me herself from time to time.Yet I feel sad that I’m happy about all this.Man I’ve never felt this valued ever and everytime I tell her goodbye I’m scared that she’ll ghost me and I have to check from time to time if she blocked me because that happened before once out of the blue.I’m so scared to get attached.I wasn’t able to cope with all the depression before she came and I had very dark thoughts in the past.Does she deserve a fuck up like me?No.I don’t understand what’s there to like about me here.I’m not tall neither do I look good.I really like her but my head is just fucking with me and I can’t understand what’s going on.A month ago I was crying on my couch alone and now I have someone who kisses me in the morning.I couldn’t fix my own problems.I’m not trying to sound pathetic her about myself I’m just very lost and I can’t explain what I’m feeling so I came here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quqgyk/im_overthinking/

My first observation was that there were guys who were pretending to be smb else. I deleted them immediately, but it is definately not safe for girls who are unaware of such tricks.
The second observation was that most guys were looking for hook ups. Some were frank about it, others were joking around until asked straightforwardly or shown that nothing would happen before good relationship.
My third observation was that there are cute and caring men, so a girl or a woman needs to be careful but should try online dating at least once.

In my case, I gave up after two weeks of being on Tinder . I didn't like anyone I saw there, and those who I liked, neither responded nor made a move.

30,qur7co,1637012461,Dating advice,"Read whole thing to understand:

So this girl I met at church is amazing and great. Were still trying to get to know one another because we only have known each other for a few times. A lot of the girls there and her friends like me and so does she. She's very nervous when around me, but likes me a lot and she introduced me to her parents and does other little things under the rug to show she likes me. I add her on instagram and then added her on snapchat as well. I didn't really snap her at all for three days until today. We're having a get together to hangout and play games and eat food at a building with other groups of kids. But unfortunately she's not going but her friends are:( 

She told me she would check her schedule and she said she can't because of work, but she asked her friends and she told me that her friends are going also. She told me thanks for the invite and stuff and left it with that. But now I'm worried if she's setting me up with her friends because her friends are into me. :( 

Her friends are nice, but just not my type what so ever. First off I am an attractive guy and I do get a lot of attention and that's  great. But this seems to happen a lot to me. Where the girl I want acts like she likes me and gets so nervous around me and can't even be in a room with just her and I. But as soon as I ask them out or ask them to a party to hang out. They get weird and then never talk back to me. Maybe I'm just blind and I'm not seeing things straight and I'm completely wrong about her liking me. It's always the girls I don't want that want to have a relationship with me, but the girls I actually find attractive only want to do things we shouldn't be doing or they just don't feel that way about me. The girls I want flirt with me and get all nervous around me and they always seem to want to be in my presence like any of us would if we liked someone lol. But as soon as I make a move on the person they seem to run away and act like what were you doing.

&amp;#x200B;

This same thing happened over the summer, where I invited a girl out to come hang with us at the mall or go bowling with a group because I thought that was a great ice breaker and to get to know her more. But it usually doesn't work out. The girl over the summer found me attractive and even talked with me about it and would flirt like crazy with me and not any other guy. Same with the girl at the church. I'm not saying she's not into me and it's the first time she cancelled plans to hang with a group. But wouldn't the girl try to make an effort to be with you or try to reschedule? 

I feel like girls like to flirt with me and that's it. Like they find me attractive, but don't want to actually go out. Is that normal or am I just losing it? I've just been down this road many times and I've seen where this goes a lot and I just don't know what to do. 

Moral of the story is that I feel like girls I like, just enjoy looking at me like a piece of meat and then don't actually enjoy going out with me. I've had a girl ask me over the summer when we were on a date, if I have tons of girls on my phones that I talk with. And I was like huh? And then she blew it off like nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S this girl I liked asks me all sorts of questions like how old am I, she never leaves me alone with her friends, she would be asking me about marriage and what I thought about these love stories, introducing me to her parents and saying hi and then running away right after she says hi. She would stare at me for long periods of a time.

We’ve had about 6 dates now. I’ve met his friends and siblings. However this past weekend we went out with his siblings and friends to a bar and he got super high on weed and drunk. He tried fighting a guy in a bar that I had to stop (and he got mad at me for stopping him fight the dude). He then left me in the bar by myself with his family to go smoke weed and when I told him I didn’t like that, he got mad at me. That night when we got back to his place he told me (while again high and drunk) he didn’t care what I thought about him and didn’t think this would work out. I still slept over becuz I knew he was high and drunk and then the next morning he apologized and said he didn’t know why he gets mean like that when drunk.

However he reiterated that morning that he thinks we might be incompatible becuz I won’t have sex with him. He also said we’ve had six dates and he still isn’t sure what he wants with me and feels like he should know by now. Somehow I ended up staying longer at his place and we ended up going to breakfast and watching YouTube videos at his place and laughing. 

He was still a bit distant and cold the morning and afternoon though. I finally left and before I left asked him if this is what he still wanted and he said yes and said he would tell me if this wasn’t what he wanted anymore. We gave each other a kiss and hug and then I left. He hasn’t called or texted me today at all and didn’t say as I was leaving that he would text or call me like he usually does.

So I sit at my desk and I have this weird feeling there is someone staring at me. So I look over and it looks like she is looking thru my coworker and at me. Interesting. 

So I do a bit of a conformation of this by getting up and walking by his desk several times. Each time it appears her head is tracking my movement staring at me further. Interesting… I’m thinking she either finds me super attractive or historically hideous (and I’m not a bad looking dude) 

So after they leave I ask my coworker, was it me or was she staring me down? He said yeah, she was. I was trying to make eye contact with her but she was looking past me, right at you. Unless you weren’t at your desk. Cool I’m thinking. 

She’s coming to pick up said goods tomorrow (my coworkers off day) and we’ve orchestrated that I’ll be the one to deliver the goods. I’m thinking of saying “here’s my card, it has myCELL PHONE NUMBER on it (which it does) so feel free to text me with any questions or comments or anything. Congratulations, I’ll text you tomorrow and make sure everything is okay.” 

That way the ball is totally in her court but I’m certainly hinting for more. If she thought I was all that attractive, surely she’d take that as an invitation to pursue a bit. I just want to tread lightly here as the last thing I need is to lose my job. 

Tl;dr girl seems interested but is a customer from my company. Need to get opinions and see how to pursue this further without coming off as creepy and losing my job…. Which my manager said he’s totally cool with me doing this.

Every week we would hang out alone for 6 hours  alone around four days a week for a month after matching. This went on for some time and eventually I kissed her and she kissed back ( not just once ). So I asked could we just be physical with each other and not label it. She originally agreed then panicked and said I was pressuring her and she just wanted to be friends again. But I said I couldn’t go backwards. So now we no longer meet and  have wasted a month falling for someone and am heartbroken.

50,qus9rp,1637015365,What do you think about dating people who are out of your league/more attractive than you?,"So I (19F) went on a date w/a guy yesterday who I met on hinge. I already thought from his photos he was quite attractive but he did like me first (we had originally matched on bumble and planned to go on a date but I bailed because his profile said he was not sure so I figured he was looking for something casual iirc- talked on hinge and turns out he’s also looking for a relationship too but open to friendship because he doesn’t want to pressure people) and said he’d still be down to hang out. So we did. 

He goes to my university and is a bit older than me and our date was less of a date and more of us getting food and talking a lot. I think he’s great. He’s fun to talk to, I can relate to him and think we have a lot in common and got along well, and since then I’ve been texting him and enjoying the conversation. The problem is he’s extremely attractive and I feel like he’s more attractive than me and am thus worried he won’t be into me attraction wise. I do think I’m a decently pretty person but I was rejected recently which did hurt my confidence a bit (likely wasn’t related to my appearance but I’m not sure) and like- I’m not his equivalent in my opinion 😂. But he does still seem relatively interested. And he’d make a good friend if he isn’t into me romantically. And he did stare deeply in my eyes a lot lol like I feel like there was decent chemistry.

But anyway, has anyone had this experience where they felt like the person was “out of their league” per se? I had someone on Reddit tell me I was going for top guys who weren’t into me and had tons of other girls and that kinda made me doubt myself. I honestly do think I usually aim for people who are similar levels of attractiveness and fit w/like other important aspects of personality and values. But this guy is especially hot (and did like me first in my defense).

52,qusbyy,1637015537,Maintaining/Repairing a Friendship after FWB.,"Reconnected after about 10 yrs with an old friend during the pandemic.  Kinda Lonely 🙄

We started hanging out during the pandemic and one night got a little carried away after a few too many drinks. After that night we decided to have a FWB situation. Both single adults and a bit lonely. 

He works out of state so I was okay with that.  Not seeing him often helped keep him at a distance. Plus, his situation wasn't something I feel would have been satisfying as a long term arrangement. 

We talked often. Hung out from time to time when he was home. 

He got a bit distant about 6 months in and starting making remarks that I should ""find a 
boyfriend"". 

Ironically, month or so later I did organically meet a great guy.  The guy I met was so great that I stopped seeing the FWB, and had a heart to heart with him about how I didn't feel comfortable any longer with FWB situation. That I plan to pursue the new possibility. He's early/mid 50s I'm late 40s F. -Watch what you ask for guys, we tend to take those things seriously- 

Never said I didn't want to maintain a friendship, just wasn't going to have sex with him anymore. Just didn't feel right, and I really liked the guy I met.  He is closer to my age, doesn't work out of town, and overall a really wonderful person. 

FWB will hardly speak with me now.  Occasionally calls intoxicated, I've since stopped taking calls from him after 9 p.m. I tried to go have another talk with him prior to the drunken calls, but when he discovered I would not be staying the night he would not let me in his complex. So, I left him alone. 


This was my first run with a FWB situation. And my LAST!  I assumed when it began that I'd be the one heartbroken in the end.  Nerve thought in a million years I might possibly hurt my friend. Not really sure if I did or didn't.  But, that's the vibe I get since he wanted me to come over, but decided not to let me in when he realized I had zero intentions of staying and only came to talk in person. 


Do you think FWB ruins all friendship? 

One side or the other ends up hurt? Even as grown ass adults. 


Is this friendship repairable? In the sense that we remain just friends and zero benefits. Is that even possible now?

It really bothers me that I may have caused some one grief. TIA

Me and my ex dated for about 7 months. Everything was going great for the first 3/4 months. Soon after the dynamic of our relationship changed. We started to see how different we were in so many areas but tried our best to make things blend considering we got along, until we didn’t.

56,qusxk0,1637017222,Comparing myself (25M) to her (25F) ex," Hi everyone,

Been seeing this girl from an OLD for over a month now. We've been on roughly 8 dates, 4 of which were whole days/nights spent at my place. We get along well, text everyday, communicate well, and had agreed to be exclusive (confirmed we weren't seeing others or talking to others).

Last night, we were having one of our really long/deep chats, and began talking about communication. Her last relationship of 7 months was basically the guy telling her he doesn't want a relationship, then continuing to do relationship things. He lived a few houses away from her, so they would see each other 3 times a week, and she was too afraid to ask him the 'what are we' or label question, because she was afraid it would end. She did eventually pull the plug as he was a bad communicator.

So in our chat, she told me it was refreshing and amazing that I am such a good communicator, and likes that I have told her what I want, and where I want this to go.

But since last night, I can't help but think or compare myself to her ex, in the sense that I typically only see her once a week. She is a nurse/shift worker, and lives 15-20 minutes from me, and my place is on her way to work (so she drives by). We saw each other last night, because originally we had planned to do something tonight but she had to confirm, and turns out she had her brother/family visiting which is fine. So she told me that she wanted to catch me last night, as she wouldn't be able to see me the rest of the week.

She obviously has to have some down time after work / regather herself etc. and I have already offered for her to come over to my place after work and she can just shower/sort herself out and we can hang out (as opposed to her driving home, then coming all the way back), which she appreciated.

I just am not sure whether I'm doing something wrong, because I'd love to see her more than once a week, but is it too soon to be wanting to do that? I have told her before that in my previous relationship, it was the total opposite, where I would only see my ex like once a fortnight, and that I would like to 'at least' see her once a week (which is why she made an effort to see me last night, as she wanted to stick by that and not disappoint me).

I guess I'm just overthinking, but is it even worth talking to her about it? I feel like it just devalues me in front of her if I'm wanting to see her more.

TLDR: dating a girl for over a month, been on 7+ dates, see each other once a week, she told me she used to see her ex 3 times a week as he lived super close to her, and I can't stop comparing myself, wondering whether she wants to see me more or if I can tell her I want to see her more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qusxk0/comparing_myself_25m_to_her_25f_ex/

I would also buy the beer so that I knew that there was a specific day I was going to see him because I was going to bring it over to him. I fed into his alcoholism to ""Keep him"".

70,qutsml,1637019674,How do I make a male FWB want to date me?,"I am 18/F. I was friends with this guy (18/M) for about 2.5-3 months, early June-late August. During this time he was FWB with his ex-girlfriend who he had broken up with in April. She was extremely controlling and manipulative, and he didn’t really like her but could not say no to her. He did not get over her until late July. Three days after she left for college, he kissed me, and we have now had a FWB relationship since then (it started in late August, it is now mid-November). 

In the beginning, he gave me tons of attention. He called me beautiful, held my hand while making out, told me I was all he could think about. This lasted 2 weeks. After that, the attention waned. 

I am very obsessive, so I texted him a lot. I got upset with him when he stopped coming over as often. 

Desperate for him to like me, in October I asked him if he had feelings for me. He very clearly told me no. I didn’t have feelings for him at the time, so it didn’t bother me too much. I also knew he was still recovering from his breakup.

But lo and behold, I have feelings for him now. I want to date him. I am giving him until next summer, when I will tell him that we have to be dating or I want to end our FWB relationship altogether. (I know that I am better than being in a FWB relationship, but for the moment I have no other options despite being in college.)

I feel like everyone around me is just doing so much better. They can interact with women, have friends, hang out every day or go do stuff. But I just do everything alone. I try to hang with friends but all my friends are guys who are just as socially awkward. They don’t have any friends who are women and I’d rather try and be around more women, even if it’s friendly because I feel awkward around them.

We hit it off pretty well, turned out we have a lot of things in common. After few days talking we decided to arrange a date. We decided to go for a beer next week, nothing extraordinary. Fast forward the day after. She suddenly asked me if I'm gonna be free to meet tonight instead, which I was. We went for some drinks, everything was great, we were enjoying ourself. Never really ran out of topics to talk about. She even brought me some cookies she made (earlier that day we've been talking about how she loves to bake and was baking some cookies)., which is really lovely.

We ended up spending 6 hours together, walking around, and even went for drinks in another place in the end. We briefly planned our next date, which was suppose to be a visit to an art galery, more on that later. Gave her a kiss on the cheek as a good bye. After the first date, we keep talking, just as much as before, which I take as a good sign. And then couple days after I brought up the plan about the art gallery we briefly talked about. But this time she told me she might be busy all week until the evening, and that's an issue since the art gallery closes rather early. So I offered to cook her some dinner at my place, she agreed on that and even offered to make some dessert for us.

Overall I think things are going well for us. Just wondering if I moved too fast. And what should my next step be??

74,qutxkn,1637020083,What exactly does a man need?,"I'm 26(F). Unfortunately, I'm not one of those lucky people that found love in high school or got chased by many guys. In fact, my longest connection lasted 4 months and we didn't even have a label. 

I spent my entire early 20s to focus on school and work as I came to the U.S for school. My biggest goal has always been being able to get sponsorship and settle down through employers, not love/ marriage. I know many people that came here after me already got  sponsored and of course through real marriage. They'd rather find someone, fall in love, get marriage, and get sponsored through their spouse. But, I don't want to love someone based on conditions. I closed off myself and focused on my career. I want to love someone because I love them, not because of their US citizenship...

Now that I graduated, got a job, and sponsorship has just stared by my company. I started online dating. The one that I dated 4 months was my first one and we clicked immediately. Unfortunately, he wasn't ready or never saw me as his future partner. We parted away right when Covid started. He found someone new, and we never talked again. 

It took me almost 1.5 years to recover from that event as I really really liked him and he was my first. I talked to many guys to find rebound, but then ghosted or rejected people. Not because they are not good, I felt like a mess and didn't deserve their affection/ attention...

Recently, I started dating journey again as finally I feel happy within myself again. I talked to this guy for 2 weeks, we met, and it was great. It was the first time ever that I felt I wanted to love someone (usually I only looked for red flags and convinced myself that don't move so quickly). 

Unfortunately, after the first date, he went cold for a week and finally sent a message on weekend saying that he didn't see compatibility in us...He wishes me the best in a very sincere way. I understood where he came from as he just broke up with his ex...I know he wasn't ready or didn't find interest in me. I respect his decision although part of me tell me not to give up :( and a girl should never chase right?

But, I don't know why I am still thinking about him and hurt like hell...I know I sound like crazy but wth is this... It felt even worse than the one I dated 4 months...

I know I have an average face. But I work out and have a nice body, eat clean, have master's degree, speak 4 languages, travel a lot, used to be an artist, can cook, and I don't need a sponsorship from someone, have fashion sense...The only thing I think I'm missing is I'm more on the introvert type and don't overshare a lot...I only open up gradually...and I don't go to bars/ party (not sure if this is an issue).

But, some guys I met rejected me right after the first  date...Am I that boring? I know I have my own values and I should not change myself. And I've worked so hard to be better. But it's a big competition out there, what can I do to keep a guy interested? I don't know how much of ""better"" I need...I am exhausted as many people around me found love, but I've failed so many times...

To all the men, what do you look for in a woman?
To all, should I reestablish connection with that guy just rejected me or leave him alone? It was a peaceful connection between us...and I felt the chemistry with him :(

76,quu0p8,1637020334,Oops! I (26M) want to date my friend (22F).,"I met someone through Tinder last Summer. She told me she **wasn't** looking to date anyone at the time, but we continued to talk off-and-on as friends. To my surprise, we've continued talking and hanging out to this day, and she's genuinely become someone I trust, admire, and value a lot. 

She knows that I had initially matched with her with the intention to date, but I find myself sort of compelled to reestablish my interest as it has evolved from its initial, more superficial state into something I perceive to be way healthier and legitimate. Like, *""Hey, I used to like you because you acknowledged me, but now I like you because I've seen who you really are.""* Although, I do not want her friendship to be perceived as a consolation prize or something I use to mask an ulterior motive, because it's absolutely not. 

I like to take things slow and build up legitimate friendships before I dive into dating, but I also have that fear in the back of my mind that if I don't act, someone else will. Otherwise, I'd be more than happy to just let things rock out as they are.

Any thoughts on how (or if I even should) approach (re)expressing my interest in a tasteful, non-pressuring way? And I fully admit I might be too deep in my own head about it all.

Before my ocd diagnosis I never questioned my partner’s sexuality but every since my diagnosis I’ve been having this intrusive thought of “what if he’s secretly gay and I don’t know?”

A couple of months ago, I saw a picture
Of a porn star with a dildo on in his phone. I asked him about it and I could tell he was nervous (by this point I had threaten to leave so many times over my ocd, so he often felt like he was walking on eggshells). He said “I saw the picture on Twitter and there was a link to it. I screenshot the picture so I could go back to it later. And I did. I click on the video thinking it was girl on girl action. It wasn’t. It was a pegging video. I’d never seen a video like that. I saw it, watched it. Realized it wasn’t my thing and kept it moving” 

Although he told me this I still went into a spiral. A couple weeks after this, I asked “babe would you ever date a trans woman?” He said “ummm probably not. If I didn’t know and we were on a date and she told me, I would kindly decline and tell her I wasn’t interested. I’d finish the date though because I wouldn’t want to be rude. But that would be it. 

Of course this caused me to overthink even more. I’m just so scared. And don’t get me wrong, I love this man. The way he loves me literally scares me. It’s so unconditional.

I want to send something so badly. But I haven’t been able to send anything. I don’t even know if he has my number blocked. It’s not that I want to get back together because that will never happen. He already came back and ruined it (I’ll explain below). I just want him to know how much I’m suffering. I’m losing weight harder eating and my friends are concerned, I’ve gotten severely depressed, and live in fear now with my walls up. I haven’t felt the same, haven felt like myself. I feel tied to him even though our relationship was short. I gave him the best of me, I was 100% loyal, committed and invested. I accepted him even for the baggage he had (two children with two different women, one was a high school gf long term and the other is his ex wife, both whom are married to someone else. He has split custody). I think after finally 10 years of dating (I’ll be 30 next summer) with no long term relationships in my awful dating history I had finally found “the one”, I truly did. Just like everyone says you’ll find it when you stop looking. I had stopped looking and we randomly met. It was fireworks and I was happier than ever. All my friends were so happy for me I had finally found someone. Well our random breakup in June was destructive to me. He ended it out of nowhere. I tried so hard to try to move on the rest of the summer, feeling depressed and each day moved slowly, hoping and praying he would come back... 

2.5 months later he did come back. He texted and we had a phone call that night asked me to give him another chance, gave me promises and reassurances for several weeks. He came to visit me (we are long distance 3 hours) and spent 3 amazing days with me (we didn’t hookup). Then suddenly at the end of September, he did a 180 and acted like I didn’t exist. He gaslit me and made me cry just for wanting to talk to him. Then ghosted me. Dumping me like garbage and in the dark without a word. I cannot stop thinking about him everyday and the whole situation. Who come back asking to date again and then leaves again?? It’s kind blowing! I’m suffering so hard and just want him to know how much he hurt me. My friends say not to say anything but I feel inclined to. The friend I met him through who doesn’t know him a ton said he heard he’s manipulative and controlling. But said his ex wife was also manipulative and controlling too so idk. My ex never went into detail about his past. I never pressured him to tell me, I was waiting for him to open up. 

Like I said he may have my number blocked I’m not sure. I haven’t reached out for over a month since it all went downhill. But I’m utterly confused by this and feel I cannot move on. I have a piece of him in my mind and heart, I don’t believe I’ll ever heal. I’m broken. No one has ever proved to be worthy or stick around. Everything with him was special and different, I fell in love and imagined our future together like he talked about both previously and when he came back. I wish he never came back because it was like seeing a ghost. All the promises he told me, staring into my eyes that he would never leave me again. Him saying that things would be different. He even said he would go back to personal therapy to help with his communication skills and be a better person for me. Him coming back and leaving has ruined me to the core.

Hey guys,  male here who is pretty content with life and have been dating a girl for about over a year now. It’s been pretty solid with a stretch lately that’s been up and down. I have to admit I have reacted wrongly on a couple occasions, context is that she does have a couple exes on social media , but rarely talks to them which was a concern at first but eventually I got over it. My issue is I react wrongly to
These things  from the get go. Don’t get me wrong she also acknowledged she has some issues too that needs to be worked on such as communication as she rarely is able to tell me or formulate words when she’s heated . she is on antidepressants so the sex drive has been a bit of a slow burn. We usually see each other 2- days a week or so as we both work, which is fine, lately she’s been hanging out with her friends more on those days which is fine I guess as she barely sees her friend in a one on one level. My issue is I constantly think these moves are to not see me and try to distance herself from me. I’m trying to change my destructive way of thinking but for example if she says we need to discuss some things and work on things I take it as she wants out. I’m actively working on this and she constantly reiterated she loves me etc and I’ve communicated that my reactions sometimes are not the best way to approach scenarios. But from the beginning it was an issue of telling her to stop the communication with some of her thirsty ex boyfriends which were always in the picture and she finally did end the communication. We were out once and she was messaging a guy she went on a date with years ago and I have learned they keep in contact maybe once a year or so. Another example was she without a discussion wanted to go back to a gym where her ex works , I communicated that I have no issue with this but I wish you discussed this with me prior to going as I would have done that . It just seems she acts never jealous (although in the beginning she was upset another friend who’s a girl would constantly contact me )

It just seems a bit off lately I’m not sure what to do , she still communicate that we love each other and we’re working on it but I don’t know the lack of any sexual intimacy with the minor bickering has me thinking. 

She did want to get married but now has put a pause on it as she says she was being pressured by her mother and she wants to do it on our time. She also asked me to move in before which I had to have things lined up prior to that and she took it as I did not want to and has admitted recently that she was hurt by that and she is being stubborn now when I asked to move in as my lease ends in March. 


Just needed to vent sorry guys

Is it really as basic that they matched with someone new and moved on that quickly, and keep rolling through the matches without actually going on any dates at all? Is it just boredom while you're at work, and then forget about things once your ""real life"" returns on the weekend with friends?
