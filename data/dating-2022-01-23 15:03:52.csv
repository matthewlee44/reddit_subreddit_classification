0,sb3yjs,1642972182,[M18]I’m not sure if i like this girl [F18],"
She’s really pretty. I mean, her face is literally perfect. And she’s also a cheerful girl. I really like talking with her and making her laugh. 

But I’m not physically attracted. Even if she’s beautiful and has a perfect personality, i’m not attracted to her body. She’s underweight, and i don’t really know if she’s ok with that or not. I’m always been attracted to chubbier girls, or normal weight girls ( not to offend anyone ). I’d totally help her gaining a better physique, if she wants it too.

Anyway, i think that getting to know her better might change my idea in a positive way. We’ve been talking for a bit and i’ve never been in such a weird situation. I was planning to ask her out… would it be a good idea? 

My main fear is to hurt her feelings if i find out i’m not attracted. I already know she likes me and i’m actually feeling guilty for what i wrote.

2,sb46o5,1642972745,How do I get this guy to see me as more than a sexual object?,"So this guy and I matched in tinder. He messaged me and then he must have looked me up on facebook, because he told me we had a mutual friend. So we add each other on there and start talking. We check in with each other every day, and at first he was talking about dating, but then out of nowhere he started talking about sex. Well then I explained I only have sex with people I'm in a relationship with. I asked if he was interested in me romantically or as friends, and he said friends for now because things have to build naturally from there. I said I was ok with that, but he still keeps talking about sex. So I told him thats not gonna happen if we aren't dating. He then made it clear that he had every intention of dating me,and that he just was a very sexual person. Ok whatever. So I kinda started pulling away, because I was depressed about him never asking me how I was and not trying to get to know me and some stuff going on in my life as well. I honestly didn't expect him to reach out, but then he did. He was asking if I was ok. I said I was fine. He calls me and said that he knows when a woman says shes fine, shes really not. So I told him everything that had been going on with my family and everything and he was actually very sweet. He listened. He said he understood and opened up a bit about himself. He said he has built a wall to not get hurt. And we talked for over an hour. So we are both only available on the weekends due to work, and I had figured he would want to see me so I let him know I was free saturday night. He said he had plans with a friend but would let me know if he could see me afterwards. Well he ended up staying out all night. And so this morning we are messaging and he says I can come over and have breakfast with him and sex. I tell him I am busy and remind him that we wont be having sex when we date. Then he tells me he has decided our first date will take place at his home with us ordering food and watching tv. Is this all a bad sign? I am new to the dating scene, and I am honestly confused. He goes from sweet to perverted and I get that hes a guy, but I just don't know if he likes me or just wants sex.

4,sb46zx,1642972768,It all seemed to be going so well,"After posting in various places on reddit, a girl reached out to me. She was looking for something too, and it seemed we might be able to help each other out. We started chatting and it was going well - nice and easy, we were chatting for ages. We quite quickly exchanged SFW pictures and made arrangements to meet up yesterday (Saturday - this was Monday). She asked if I preferred to stick with reddit or more to Whatsapp - gave her my number and the conversation continued. 

We talked for hours a day for the next few days, making plans for the weekend.  It started out as meeting for a coffee then going to her place. She asked how long I had so she could work out dinner plans - I was free the whole day so she offered to cook. Then suggested I stay and we spoon and watch a movie together. We were basically creating a FWB type arrangement so there was lots of NSFW chat about what kinds of things we wanted, but we were getting to know each other too - likes and dislikes, interests, hobbies. We even told each other if we were going out or on calls etc so the other knew not to expect a response for a while. 

We really seemed to be on the same page - we both said we were a bit distracted from our day to day lives. I was really looking forward to the weekend - and it really seemed she was too. Eventually she told me to bring a toothbrush etc so I could just stay the night rather than driving home really late. I said I would but that I wasn't going to make any assumptions and we could just see how it went - there really wasn't any pressure either way. She told me what she was making for dinner, and what snacks etc she'd got us. I had told her she didn't need to cook and that we could get a takeaway or go somewhere but she wanted to. Wouldn't let me buy any of the ingredients either. 

On Friday she messaged saying she hoped I was having a more productive day than she was.  This was probably about midday and we spent the rest of the day texting about the weekend and various other things. She told me that ""if a woman has spent say the best part of a week chatting to you over  text messages or whatever for hours a day, she is probably happy to be seduced by you"". I took that as a pretty positive sign! We ended around midnight wishing each other good night and saying how much we were looking forward to meeting. 

On Saturday I woke up and went to send her a message - and I couldn't. I couldn't see her profile picture or status any more, and messages only have a single tick - so haven't been delivered. Initially I thought nothing of it - whatsapp can sometimes be a little temperamental with this stuff and things had been going so well it never crossed my mind that anything untoward might be going on. However as time wore on I was getting more concerned - I tried calling her through whatsapp and it just said ""calling"" without ever going to ""ringing"" - i.e. no connection was made. I tried calling normally - straight to voicemail without even a single ring, and sending a normal text - again nothing. I knew it was pointless but I still went to the meeting place - I had originally said I could get there from around 2pm but we hadn't confirmed the time - I was just going to message her as I was leaving, but I got there for 2 and waited over an hour, just in case something had happened to her phone or something and she still turned up. Needless to say she didn't. 

I'm pretty sure I have been blocked, mainly based on the evidence from whatsapp, but I have absolutely no idea why. Her reddit account no longer exists either.

I'm just so confused. Everything seemed to be going so well and she seemed to be at least as into everything as I was - communication was really open and honest and very much 2-way. Yesterday should have been fantastic but it ended up being such a shit experience.

Not really sure why I'm posting this - maybe it's in the hope (as unlikely as it is) that she sees it and gets in touch. Maybe it is just to get it out there and see what other think so it's not just in my head any more. Is it just me - was I being naive? Does stuff like this happen all the time? If anyone has any suggestions on what might have been going on in her head, that would be appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sb46zx/it_all_seemed_to_be_going_so_well/

2. The second guy thought a (1st) date to MET was a great idea. Gave only 5 dollars for the tickets, acting as if this was a big amount. For the record I was going to give $20. We literally spoke 15 times during the two hours we were there.

Sorry, this is gonna be kind of long since I need to explain the situation. So this guy I hung out with once in a group setting and have been very casually texting the past month and a half is always too busy to hang out. Now I do genuinely believe that he is busy, his job is in the arts and he has periods where it's pretty time-consuming when he's working on a project. I asked him to hangout weeks ago and he said he wasn't sure of his schedule and explained why then I asked the other day again if he'd wanna see a movie or something and he sent a long paragraph explaining to me how he's busy due to a project he's working on but when it's done in the coming weeks he'll have more free time. I feel like it's important to say we live an hour apart too (I offered to drive to him though). I just don't know what to think. I think if he had no interest and didn't want to hang out or continue our casual (sometimes flirty) conversations he wouldn't. But also you're telling me he doesn't have a single free night, ever? (Until this project is done I guess??) I don't know how to feel! I guess I should just feel/wait it out? I know that being ""busy"" can be an easier, nicer way to not hang out with someone if you're uninterested, but the fact that he still is texting me and gives me good reasons for being busy makes me think it's maybe not just an excuse? Some opinions on this would be great! 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, feel like I should mention our texts have been going pretty well. He's not the best texter and our conversations are sporadic throughout the day but he asks for my opinion on things, recommends me music and movies, we send pictures sometimes.

17,sb5vz2,1642977051,Update to Massage Parlor GF...,"Wanted to update the folks regarding my last post.

Definitely a bit jealousy fueled but for those of you saying it was racist.. go eat it.


Some things led up to me become concerned over my gfs new job at an Asian massage parlor.  She is not a licensed MT and we'll ive recently heard stories about those places...

So I found her place in a shady site and got a little jealous when she asked about the HPV vaccine.  And sorta opened up the topic for conversation.

Everything she said jives with what I found online.  About five years ago it was bought out by new owners and to some 'became a complete waste of time' thank God!

Also it is filled with some complaints about leaving the door open and no extras and being pushy for tips.

When we talked she said her friend started working about five years ago there and she had started with some new owners.  They do leave the doors open.  And it does reduce the number of attempts and they also have cameras leading up to it.  She said she's the bully and customers need to watch out for her hahaha.

When we were talking this weekend her friend said some guy did try complain about the door and did ask her for more.  My gf said it has only happened the one time she told me about otherwise no issues for her.

I did not go in because I don't trust her.  I didn't know how to bring it up without saying 'do you give hand jobs for cash?' which seems highly offensive but at the same time I think there are some reasons to ask.

We recently got into a fight about my income.. i make six figures but have student loans.  She was asking why I don't join the army.  Which I dislike the military machine so we got into a fight a little about it.  I asked her if she wanted a military guy or something and she responded that she just likes money.  Then we went to help get her a car and she pulls out ten k in cash after having job issues during covid.

It was just a lot of small things that I was like wtf is going on here... But we cleared it all up and I'm comfortable with our discussion and trust she is honest with me that she is not doing gross things.

Also I should have known because she listens to songs like 'only you' are the only lyrics i understand lol.  The way she looks at me.  The sweetness.  I should never have thought she was capable but again I've dated girls from many different cultural backgrounds and you can find yourself quite surprised when you make assumptions based on historical context (primarily if you have not really had friends or weren't raised in that culture).

19,sb658v,1642977736,Is a long engagement in place of marriage a good idea if either party is not ready for it?,"TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to get married but I’m not ready.

My (28) girlfriend (25) wants to get married but I don’t feel ready for it yet. She tells me that I need to decide within the next six months. She implied that she will leave if we are not engaged by then - for good reasons, which I will explain.

Just for context, we have been dating for 1 year and 3 months, and have been living together for 8 months. She is a grad student from abroad. Her life after graduation has already been arranged by her parents if she returns home. She will become a lawyer and have a career at the bar. It is her dream and something she has always wanted. If she stays in my country, it will because of me. At the moment, if she stays, she has no direction, may never become a lawyer here, and will be away from her family and friends.

She believes that life plans can be changed based on circumstances in life. At this point, she knows she loves me and wants to be with me. She wants to stay with me despite the sacrifices, but she needs to know that I am committed to her. She says it is worth changing her life plans for the one she will potentially spend the rest of her life with. She needs an answer within the next six months because that is when she will graduate and need to make a decision.

Considering the fact that I am not ready to get married, she suggested for us to have a long engagement, say a year or two, and then get married later when I am “ready”. That way she will have the sense of commitment and assurance from me for her to stay and I also get a bit more time before I am ready.

I know that I love her and I know that I want to marry her at some point. But I am just not quite ready now - for following two reasons which I will explain:

(1) She gets very anxious about an ex of mine within my friendship group. I see those friends about 2/3 times a year so they are not part of my day-to-day life. But it bothers me that I have to restrict my social interaction with that group because of her anxiety. She is medicated on a daily basis and is usually fine. It is only when group events are proposed etc that she gets very anxious and upset. Those friends live all around the country. They are from university. They are important to me because they have been with me through very difficult times.

(2) It is not clear to me what her plans after graduation are. I know - it sounds like a chicken and egg problem. She says she needs to know whether or not we will be committed because her life choices after graduation depend on it. Financially speaking there isn't an issue - we are both sorted in that sense. I'm just worried she might be bored staying at home if she doesn't manage to find a suitable job that she enjoys. Its not great when she gets bored. She'll need quite a bit of attention. I would like her to have something to occupy her time.

Those issues aside, I think we are very compatible. Our life goals, lifestyle, interests, etc all seem to align. I can see her as a great mother and I love her very much. We are both stable and financially independent. We have discussed children, expectations etc.

Please give me your honest opinion. What should do? What do you think of her suggestion of a long engagement and then the wedding a year or two later? Is she being reasonable? Is there any other way around this? Any red flags I should watch out for?

So I had a date with a very cool girl two days ago and the date was amazing; she invited me to her house, we ate and talk a lot we then watched a movie and made out a bit and then I had to go back home cause I was working and the date ended there! As i said, it went, I think, pretty well:)

So the day after I decided to texted her to let her know that it had a very nice time and she texted me back some hours later to tell me that she was happy to hear it and asked me how the road went (I had to take the train etc.) so I answered her but after this...no answer? 

I know it has just been a day, but she used to text me pretty often before the 1st date (like in between 30 min to 2-3h) and now for both of these messages she's taking a lot more than 2-3h to answer! 

So, that being said, My overthinking mind is screaming at me that she'll drop the bomb saying that she's no longer interested (and I'm fully prepared and lowkey already mentally there to just let go easily ish) but at the same time I'm telling myself that she might be busy or something and I could just wait and see (pretty much the only reasonable thing to do anyway).

I'm just worried she might be bored staying at home if she doesn't manage to find a suitable job that she enjoys. Its not great when she gets bored. She'll need quite a bit of attention. I would like her to have something to occupy her time.

Those issues aside, I think we are very compatible. Our life goals, lifestyle, interests, etc all seem to align. I can see her as a great mother and I love her very much. We are both stable and financially independent. We have discussed children, expectations etc.

Please give me your honest opinion. What should do? What do you think of her suggestion of a long engagement and then the wedding a year or two later? Is she being reasonable? Is there any other way around this? Any red flags I should watch out for? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sb67fr/girlfriend_wants_to_get_married_but_im_not_ready/
23,sb6b2a,1642978183,Updated me after 2 months. What does this mean?," I (23) was seeing a guy (25) end last year, someone I could really see myself get into a long term relationship with, even if we only saw each other for 3 months. I felt very comfortable around him and things just worked out, at least from my side. I actually got very attached to him, thinking that the feelings were reciprocal. I noticed a shift in his energy and just effort all together towards the end, until he eventually ended things. Apparently, it didn't click and that he was suffering with mental health issues and was just unhappy in general. I went through quite a heartache after he ended it. I still think about him every day, but as time flew, I just came to terms that he was just another temporary person that was supposed to teach me a lesson.

Now 2 days ago he randomly messaged me and said that he's starting therapy next week and medications. What I'm wondering is that, what does that have to do with me? I mean, good for him, I still care about him, but why is he telling me this? Why is he still lingering? What is the point of this message?

I didn't answer back. I don't really know how to, or maybe I don't want to be hopeful of what may happen, once he's better. I don't really know how to feel about this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sb6b2a/updated_me_after_2_months_what_does_this_mean/

27,sb6r0d,1642979366,Can i get out of the friendzone?," 

Yes, i know ""there is no such thing as the friendzone"". But it's easier to say it this way.

So the story is like this, that 2 years ago i actually had a chance with someone. I matched with this chick (who is way out of my league looks wise) on tinder and we actually had a very nice conversation. She seemed interested but sadly i fucked up and it never went anywhere. I have shown myself to be too emotional and clingy and what i realised lately i never asked her out properly. From what she and other people told me i think she isn't aware of the fact that i like her (thought i take it with a grain of salt). So like i said, things never went anywhere. Never got formally rejected, she just got together with another guy and i ended up in what is commonly known as the friendzone. Or maybe even just the palzone, it's hard for me to say. Now, while i don't really regret staying friends, i could never really get over her. The opposite in fact. I started out as being somewhat interested because she was hot and gave me a chance. I ended up falling in love with her due to her personality. Honestly i realised she is the only person i ever loved and propably will ever love, because frankly since i met her i don't think i've even been so much as interested in another woman (which actually made my life as a FA so much easier). Now, while i couldn't get over my feelings for her, i respected her choice and didn't make any moves. Just accepted that we are friends and i better get used to it.

At least until now. I did a lot of self improvement over the last year, got into shape, got a job, got better as a person when it comes to personality and mental health. This all gave me a massive confidence boost. And the idea got to my head that maybe i can still somehow make things work. That if i just tell her things honestly (but casualy) and just straight up ask her out on a date there is a chance she'll say ""you know what? ok"". Now, i'm aware that the chances are slim. We know eachother for two years and i've already shown myself to be a clingy and lonely loser. But i really did improve a lot so i can't stop myself from clinging onto that. I really need your opinion if it's actually possible or if i'm just deluding myself.

Honestly though i decided i'm gonna tell her how i feel anyway. I really need to do this for the sake of closure. I think she won't get upset over it. I just need to wait till the end of february so i can lose a bit more weight, pass my half year exams, get my contract at work renewed and get my pills prescribed. I want to be at my best when i tell her everything.

28,sb6unu,1642979629,Are my expectations too high…?,"I’ve been seeing someone consistently for about 3-months now. 

I really enjoy being with him — but my top love languages are tied at Quality Time and Physical Touch.

He’s very structured, travels a lot, texts me all day long (I don’t prefer texting… I’d rather FT, which he’d said he’d do more of and still hasn’t.)

My issue:
We’re only intimate about 1X/week right now… it just isn’t enough for me. 

About 4-weeks ago, I stopped entertaining other men that I’ve been involved with casually for years… so, now that I’m only with this man, I’m honestly am getting bored constantly waiting around for him.  I don’t feel like my needs are being prioritized, but I feel like his are fulfilled.

It just isn’t often enough for me and I feel like I’m being a bit pushy about it — which frustrates me further, because I don’t WANT to be annoying or have to ask for intimacy. 

Even when I was married, we had sex OFTEN — it was never a problem in the relationship.

I really like this guy, and I’m trying to be understanding, but every time he goes out of town I feel more disappointed deep down… and it’s been building up more and more. 

I tried to address how I feel about it, but I think he thought I was just being silly-dramatic, because he kinda laughs it off and then continues the conversation in a cute-joking manner. 
Then says he’ll fulfill my needs more, but it doesn’t seem like it’s happening (I may be rushing my expectations though).

I just want a relationship where the person wants to see me at least 3X’s a week… 
But I don’t know what the norm is for people in their 30’s in the dating world, especially as adults with real jobs and school, etc. 

Do you all think 1X/week is normal…?

29,sb74gj,1642980386,Asking if I ate yet today??,"I started talking to this female through text messages maybe a week ago and this is the second day in a row her saying “u eat yet today”. 

I did talk to her friend around freshmen year of college and I stopped talking to her cause she was not it, but I’m now noticing that she is the current girl I’m talking to friend. I know this because she sent a picture of her through snap… so obvious she mentioned me to her and probably said a thing or two.

 But last night she was trying to ask deep questions like “is there anything you want to tell me “any struggles in life” stuff like that. But when I was talking to her friend I was probably around 10 pounds skinnier or so while she was maybe on the bigger said and may have thought I was skinner for my height or age. And keep in mind I haven’t even met this girl I’m texting in person yet. But when yesterday she asked “did you eat yet today” I just said yes. Keep in mind I do get 3 meals a day and work out. I didn’t workout freshmen year but still ate. But this time when she asked “u eat yet today” I replied “Are you trying to ask what I ate today or did I eat today ???”. I think it’s weird she’s saying it like that… is she trying to see if I have some type of mental health issues or something ?? And also keep in mind I don’t have any issues I’m smooth sailing if you ask me.

38,sb7krr,1642981645,I'm so confused... women are so weird.,"I (23m) met this girl (23f) at the gym back in June and started hanging out a lot with her, and eventually, we started going on more romantic dates. After a month we ended up having sex, but the day after that she said that that happened too soon since she had broken up with her boyfriend less than 2 months ago, and so she was not feeling ready yet to start something new. 

We stayed friends for the following months, however, in September I moved to another country to do my master's degree. I was really sad that I would not be able to see her again for at least 3 months, but at the same time maybe this would be a great opportunity for me to meet someone new and forget this girl. 

In December I came back to my home country for the Christmas holidays, and I stayed there for 1 month. During this time I reconnected again with the girl, and we were seeing each other pretty much every single day (not sexually). Although most of the time, the ""dates"" were very causal such as simply going to the gym together and me taking her home, I began to feel like in love again with the girl, and I thought she was too, especially considering the fact that we hooked up before. Eventually, I decided to try and kiss her at the end of one date, and she just backed off and said she just sees me as a friend.

Now my question is: is this normal? how can a girl be hanging out with a guy literally every day for over 10 days, knowing the fact that we had sex before, and just see me as a friend? Also, she flirted with me a lot in different ways. So I was pretty confident we were on the same page, but guess I was wrong... Im fucking shocked and I can't understand what I have done wrong. Can she be lying?  Why would she be wasting so much time with me if she just likes me as a friend? I never met a guy and girl who were simply friends, meeting so often, and I definitely don't think that's normal.

I am 20 and he is 25 so there’s a small age difference but nothing too drastic. We usually talk everyday, not 24/7 but we do text throughout the day and we facetime on some nights that we don’t see eachother. We hungout on friday night, went for a drive, got food, smoked weed, watched movies and had sex. Then on saturday morning we woke up and he was pretty quiet. We went for coffee and got his car washed but something ultimately felt kind of off as he wasn’t being as talkative as usual. When I left his house he didn’t tell me to text him when i got home &amp; that bothered me but i still did as i feel like that’s just courtesy and if we’re dating that’s not a big deal. So i went on about my day, told him i was painting my room and we didn’t talk much after that. He sent me a few snapchats throughout the day and some stuff on instagram but we didn’t talk much beside that. I called him Saturday evening to show him that i’d finished painting my room but he didn’t answer so i texted him that i was done and he didn’t respond either. So i went to bed, woke up and still nothing until about 10am this morning when he texted me goodmorning. I replied soon after, asked him how he was and now it’s 7pm and i havent heard back.

2 months into the relationship, she quit her job with no follow up job. She was not financially capable of doing this. She quit as she was moving to a new apartment, which has a slew of costs attached.

About 2 months of no job, and she has rent due at her new apartment in about 6 days with no means to pay for it. I’ve helped all I could to get her where she wanted to be, but today was the last straw.

I came back to her place and it reeked of alcohol and marijuana. She came up to hug me and tried to kiss but I couldn’t even muster up the energy to kiss her cause her breath smelled like shit. It was at this moment I knew she wasn’t changing for the better, and was going to take the relationship down with her unless I broke it off.

It’s so sad because in a period of 4 months she went from being an independent woman who was very attractive and very engaging to date and be around to dependent, using drugs to stave off problems, and broke.

47,sb89c1,1642983557,I took a vow to not never love again and this post will be a reminder (long vent),"I'm 22 old and Few months ago, I got out of a relationship with a girl that I truly believed was ""the one"" and she also told me that we are meant to be together so it wasn't like a one sided love or it was casual. 

When I reflect back on the relationship I have no idea what went wrong. We had strong chemistry and I knew very well that love can be blind and I tried to confirm many times that it wasn't a one sided thing and that she was also putting in efforts so definitely I wasn't loving a ""projection"" of her. And also I had past lessons from dating and didn't do common mistakes like getting overly attached or showering her with interests. And I didn't mistreat her at all so why the fuck did it end ? 

I truly loved her I truly did I reflected it with my actions not words I made her happiness the priority. You see words can be boring even if your feelings are genuine. I made the relationship exciting for her to have a good experience and initially she told me she was busy with her studies so I waited 1 year before we entered a proper relationship and supported her in her bad times (She had some family issues - issues at college...etc), there were some girls that showed interest in me in the relationship that my friends told me were prettier than her but I didn't care at all to me she was the prettiest girl alive. Sometimes I wish she was ugly so I can talk with her more freely. And even when the relationship ended I cared about her wellbeing first I gave her encouragements for her future career and a number to some connection that could help her when she graduates. That's the kind of lover I had for her. It was about commitment and effort and not just infatuation. 

But when her turn came to help me, she didn't. You see last year I started developing an illness (hypothyroidism that was diagnosed later) and I started falling behind in grades. I really needed her support but when I talked to her she was stony cold and eventually I got dumbed. And a few days later I see her hanging with another guy.

I kept thinking and thinking about it and you know what I realized ? Men are biologically wired to take on responsibilities to make sacrifices to hold on to their words. When I decided to commit to her, I continue to commit even if I was hurt even if I found better girls even if I fell out of love/became bored with her. Because as a man I was taught to never break my word. But girls on the other hand just care about their emotions and well beings. Their words and promises are empty. She's infatuated with you / feeling love ? -&gt; She will say ""I will always love you"" or whatever but once her emotions (infatuation) changes, she just dumps the relationship like it meant nothing for her. So how are there long term relationships ? Simple, either she can't find better or she's invested in children or she's afraid to leave.  It all comes down to her well being. 

I don't hate women but this is just the truth and I don't blame them for it. It's known in science that female emotional centers are way stronger than her logical centers. But I'm just annoyed that the beautiful ideas of love in my head turned out to be just pink dreams. It's why I named this account so it's just a fairy tale it doesn't exist. 

I cared about finding deep connection more than looks and I put my heart on the line and I invested a lot but what did I get ? I just got stabbed in the back. The time I spent in the relationship I could have spent somewhere else productive. I used to believe strongly in the saying that hard things to come by are hard to lose but I was just delusional. 

So I've just decided to invest all my time in my happiness and good investments. And if someone confessed to me that I have feelings/chemistry for, fuck it I'm just gonna tell them to go to hell. I might date or hire prostitutes but I will never fall for someone or commit. This guy that believed in true love and commitment is dead.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sb89c1/i_took_a_vow_to_not_never_love_again_and_this/

I want to make sure this isnt one of those cases.  


I am going on a third date with a guy who is not really my physical type but the more I talk to him, the more I like him and am interested in where this goes.

We had two weekend drinking dates (1 coffee, 1 bar) already and is asking me if I would like to go on another date… for drinks …again.  Money is not an issue for him if that is what you are thinking. He also said he feels old and is seeking a committed relationship when I first spoke to him.  


He also isnt really texting me every day.  Just to plan the date.

If so, why?","Until not too long ago, I thought “body count” is only used by immature teenagers/young adults to either sound cooler than they are or shame others for being “promiscuous”. However, I noticed that this trend spills into other age ranges, including my own (27-35). 

I’ve been asked this a few times and honestly, it’s taken me by surprise. I never thought to ask this nor do I care how many partners my partner had. I always have a conversation about safe sex (including testing and appropriate safe sex measures) but it doesn’t include “how many people have you slept with?”. 

Secondly, I feel like everyone that asked knows exactly how many people they’ve slept with and it made me realize that I don’t. I don’t keep a tally, but I know it’s over 100-120, which seemingly is an exorbitant number, considering most guys who asked were in the 10-20 range. 

For those who ask and/or care about the numbers, why? Is a high/low number offputting? Should I be honest about my numbers or give a vague “I’m not sure, don’t keep tabs” answer?

53,sb8ztv,1642985652,She drinks way more than me,"Title sums it up. I (42M) have been on a couple of dates with 34F, and have spent a few weeks exchanging messages as well. During the dates she drinks more than me by a beer or two, but has made comments that she’s pretty much holding back because I don’t drink much. The two beers I’ve had each time are my absolute upward limit, except maybe New Year’s Eve. Also, one night recently she responded kind of incoherently to one of my messages. The next day she confessed that she had drank two bottles of wine (in company of others, not alone).

I’m not being judgmental here. I see this as just two very different lifestyles. I could care less about alcohol, and would be fine not drinking at all. And I feel like I’m on a different wavelength when someone else is drunk and I’m not. But, it hasn’t been an actual problem in my presence, so I don’t have first hand cause for alarm.

Wondering if I'm just subconsciously scared of being vulnerable or just so used to being single, but I do want to date and be in a relationship again","So I went on a wonderful date yesterday and it was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. We connected really well, we like the same things and dislike the same things. We were very clearly attracted to each other physically as well, and the date ended with a romantic kiss. It was super cute.

The guy asked me out again this morning. He wanted to work out with me in the afternoon, as we did so the day before. I didn't think he'd ask me out so soon and I told him I had plans of walking/hiking 10 miles then having a ladies' night with friends. I told him I needed time to recharge as I'm socializing again very soon. There was no point lying at that point I think.

I am almost sure I hurt his feelings, and I messed up because he asked me to go out on Wednesday instead and while I agreed, I panicked and asked him if tomorrow works too. He now seems hesitant about tomorrow, and I wish I just went with Wednesday and had been cool with it.

I know no one knows what will happen next, but I'm just wondering if I did the right thing with taking that time to myself. I love my alone time just as I love socializing with people, and I want to believe the right person--no matter now connected we may feel for each other--understands that.

Not sure what I need advice on, but I guess I'm ready to listen to people tell me that I did either wrong or right, and how I could handle things better next time.

I long for a connection with somebody. a genuine connection. One that's not filled with turmoil or abuse or anything like that. And I just made a profile on hinge and I've been making posts here on reddit. And I know maybe things won't work out with these methods but I figured I'd still try at least. I've been trying to make my profiles as representative of me as possible. And I've been trying to do the same with my posts as well. but the problem comes in when you don't know who you are or what you represent. of course I have an idea about my convictions and maybe I even hold a few strong ones. I'm just trying to figure out who I am. And I have so much love to give but no one to give it to. And that's that saddens me. because what I live for or at least what I think I live for is making others happy. And I want to do that. I probably sound desperate and maybe I am. I probably am and I know that's not a way to go about things. but I guess if you look deeper or past the surface or beyond all of my sadness you can kind of get a glimpse of what I'm like even though I tend to overshare about basically everything as you can see as that's what I'm doing right now. I just want a genuine connection with somebody and I don't understand why it's so difficult to find that. I know things don't happen all that once but there's so many people out there in the world I mean how hard is it to meet somebody you click with on that level?

84,sbbhv4,1642993126,Most complicated and hurtful situation I’ve ever been in,"Okay so, from the beginning. Met this girl in June last year, hit it off immediately. Started seeing eachother and hooking up. We became best friends in the process…like BEST FRIENDS. We never made it official and just eventually called it off. We would still make out the odd time etc. The problem is, I’m almost too loyal so even though we’re not together or exclusive I won’t get with any other girls because I simply don’t want to. She is the opposite and was getting with other dudes. This hurts me more than I can even say (lose your appetite type hurt lmao). The other night she confessed to me that she was thinking about us being more than friends and if it would work. She’s afraid that we’d lose eachother in the long run and end up losing our best friend. That won’t happen because I’m very close with her girl best friend and she’s close with my #1 homie. Anyways after she said that to me I tried to bring it up the next day and she instantly shut it down. Fast forward to tonight, her friend tells me she told her the exact opposite to what she told me and she’s in a hotel with another guy she literally met walking out of a bar. Believe me guys if I could wish for anything it would be to have no feelings for this girl but I really can’t help it, I’m in love. It’s gotten to the stage now where I know too much about her and other guys for me to go out with her if that makes sense? What do I do guys I’m lost.

87,sbbsu5,1642994008,I messed up and left her drunk by herself,"I've been talking to this girl for a while now, and we finally meet up after months of being apart from one another. We meet in one state, and then she relocated to my state, not for me but for work. She's young 19 and I'm 24. We were sexting, and talking about our lives, doing the whole LDR thing, without the term. I even asked if we were exclusive and she said she wanted to say yes, but wanted to wait till we were together in person to commit. 

She finally arrives on Thursday night. I decide to throw her a welcome to your new home party! We had been wanting to have sex for a while, but I told her that we didn't need to have sex on that first night. I figured she'd be tired and would want to go to bed after a some festivities. She responded that we weren't going to have sex that  night or ever. I asked why all the sudden a change. She says she started talking to someone and sends me a picture of her hand and a wedding ring. I got mad, we insulted each other, and it ends with her telling me it was just a joke. She wasn't married/engaged, she was just being mean. 

I forgive her, but tell her I'm feel betrayed. She tells me I'm thinking too much. I decide to invite her to a party where there is alcohol. I was the host, and I just wanted us to get along either as friends or partners. She comes over, we all drink. At one point in the night she begins to yell at me in Spanish, telling me that "" You like it when I yell at you don't you? It turns you on."" I do, and there was another Spanish speaker in the room with us. She left to use the bathroom, and everyone leaves cause they understood where everything was heading. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's gone, and she comes back. I begin to start kissing her feet, and telling her how much I like her. She askes why, and I just say ""do I need a reason to?"" All the gifts I had sent you, and time spent texting, I did it without thinking we would ever be close enough to one another. Now we are. She tells me she was molested as a child and that's why she has trouble engaging in intimacy's with people. I tell her I understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then pounces on me, and is pinning me down, dry humping me. She makes out with me and tells me "" I like you a lot, I like you a lot, but I love Polish boy."" She just keeps telling me, saying that I should just be her brother. I ask her if she wanted to move to my bed, because we were just laying on the floor talking and kissing. She agrees. We go to my bed and I tell her we dont have to have sex. We lay there kissing and cuddling, but she sticks her hand in my pants and starts jerking me. The she begins to blow me. She then says shes cant do this, and I put on my pants. She's new to town, and so I decide to walk her back. 

All the lovely duby feelings disappear and I start getting mad. Cause she had the chance to tell me this earlier, and instead she pulls this stunt. I get mad, and I tell her that I'm upset, because she effectively manipulated me to into having feelings for her. She never told me she loved him, or anything. I keep brining this up. She just gets mad at me, and then starts insulting me telling me that I'll never be able to beat him or match him in any way. Very emotionally abusive things. I get mad and just leave. To be fair, all she needed to do was walk straight and she'd be at her barracks (oh we are in the army too). As I'm leaving some guy pulls up and askes me if I need a ride. We are in the army, we are all friendly to one another. I say no, but that she might need a ride cause she drunk and being mean to me. 

As soon as I get back to my barracks, I call her asking if she made it. She says no and then I rush back to see her. She took a turn and ended up somewhere else. I begin to guide her back home. The entire time insulting me, and telling me she never wants to see me again. just very mean stuff. I finally get her back to her barracks. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked today and agreed we probably shouldn't see each other again. I am very sad, because I feel like I failed her. I feel like a total loser, and that I should of just sucked it up and had taken her back to her barracks correctly the first time. I just wanted to post about this.

89,sbbusi,1642994176,Is it normal for people to be afraid of programmers?,"I've been in two situations now where a girl became afraid of me as soon as she discovered that I was a programmer. 

I didn't think much of it the first time it happened. I was in a group project, and there was a girl there that was very wary about people hacking her. She was asking us lots of hacking-related questions like, ""do you think my landlord is hacking me?"" and that was because her landlord tried adding her on Facebook. After she found out I was in computer science, she just started avoiding me altogether.

The second time it happened was with some girl I only met once or twice. She found out I was in computer science and asked me if they taught us how to hack people. I told her no (which is true), but she was still weird with me afterwards.

I talked to my friends, and they've also had a couple of similar experiences. I only have a small sample size of people, so I'm kinda curious how common this is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbbusi/is_it_normal_for_people_to_be_afraid_of/

91,sbc3pl,1642994913,dealing w 2 month situationship breakup,"I have been having some intense feelings about a situationship I was in 2 months ago and want some input on if my feelings are valid or not. It’s hard to say exactly what I want but I will start from the beginning,

Met this guy on a dating app so randomly and were texting daily for about a week until we met up for the first time. The first hang out went perfectly and we continued to talk as the time passed. He had expressed that he wasn’t looking for anything serious and I was okay with that since I didn’t know what I was looking for either. Throughout the 2 months, we maintained very steady and daily contact. Texting all day everyday and phone calls or facetiming at least once a day. We hung out about once or twice a week in which we did things couples did and enjoyed each other’s company (sexually too but never all the way bc I would get too attached) We also bought each gifts here and there, and he even introduced me to his friends on more than one occasion. To be honest, I was feeling myself developing feelings and asked if he was still not seeing this as developing into something serious since he had made several comments that proposed it. He said he needed more time which was once again, fine with me but left me in an uncomfortable grey area. He had expressed in the past that he was attached but also mentioned he had just went through a break up not too long before he met me. On one of our hangouts, even telling each other we both liked each other as more than friends. Fast forward to the last week, he began to lag a little with replying which was when I knew something was up. At the end of our last hangout, I asked if he was still interested since it seemed like he wasn’t. He said that he didn’t lose interest and thought I was a good person but is dealing with a lot at the moment. He said we can be friends and that he still wanted to be around. He also said that there was potential for a relationship. After leaving it at that, it was mostly very spaced out conversation that eventually died out over the span of 3 days. Double texting like a week later, I asked if he wanted to finish an activity we had started on our last hangout. He kept normal conversation and said he wanted to. When trying to plan a day, I was once again left on delivered. We still followed each other on instagram but after a post that hurt my feelings (sort of matching shoes with another person), I unfollowed so I could start to get over him. Since things were left on sort of good terms, I wondered if me unfollowing made it weird so I followed back a week later since I regretted cutting all contact. I left the follow for a day and no follow back so I took it back (I know way too much but I was overthinking). Since it has been 2 months since the “breakup,” my feelings have died down but still admire him as a friend. I wonder if I should believe that he wanted to be around and try to reach out again to see if we are in a good understanding of friendship since the last interaction we had was me unfollowing him (1 month ago.) I don’t want be annoying but don’t believe he didn’t care at least a little bit since he made a mutual effort with initiating phone calls and interest. Should I reach out in the near future to check up on him or take his behavior as a hint that he is not even interested in a genuine friendship?

I’ve never done that in my life but I guess I was just feeling myself and said fuck it. Worse that can happen is she throws it in the trash and I’m no worse spot than I was before.

I feel like we both find each other safe to be around and love being around one another. He tells me I’m the funniest person he’s ever met and vice versa. Him and I are constantly laughing, as we tease one another.

He’s super touchy (lower back) when there was no reason too, has initiated hand holding, forehead kisses, compliments me all the time about my personality and characteristics and remembers things I never even told him, always wanting to dance with me and tells me he loves me and adores me anytime he has a drink and when he’s sober and we don’t see each other much now because of location. But he has to message me for work once a month and always closes the convo with “I love you lots, miss you lots and always wishing my life is going amazingly.”

Is this normal with male and female friends while one is in a relationship or was he kind of waiting to see if I would reciprocate these feelings back?

Because I have a lot of male friends who are in relationships who do nothing near what he was doing with me?

i’m just wondering, is it normal to ignore them sometimes for yourself? i don’t hate or dislike him at all, but i think (i cant even remember) i have ignored his texts for a few minutes longer than usual so i don’t look too clingy but other than that i reply fast as i’m not very busy.

from this point on it’s just me making an assumption/overthinking. it’s 10:30 at night and he has school tomorrow. he said he’s going to try to sleep. i say this because it feels kinda early to go to sleep lol. is he ignoring me and if he is is that okay?  i feel like i’ve done the same thing where i tell him goodnight but i don’t actually sleep for another hour. is that toxic? bad? after all we aren’t dating so he isn’t my property or anything. it’s not that i don’t want to speak to him. it’s just hard to explain. does anyone do this while being in a healthy relationship?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbcjc0/is_it_wrong_to_ignore_your_boyfriendgirlfriends/
