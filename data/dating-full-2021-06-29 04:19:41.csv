We‚Äôve both decided to take it slow as we‚Äôve both recently come out of long term relationships.

So far, it has been great. There‚Äôs been a lot of communication, we both really like each other, we get on well, we buy each other little gifts, the sex is great, and he‚Äôs really stepped it up more in this last month. 

However, we decided to spend most of the weekend together (usually we only see each other once a week before of work schedules). On Saturday I went to run errands (after a super lush morning together) then came back to his in the evening. For some reason though, he went a bit quiet. For some context: his sports team lost that we were watching, his friend rang him for a deep chat, and I fucked up dinner massively. It didn‚Äôt feel like our usual magical nights together. I actually felt a bit awkward (but this could be me just worrying)

I guess I‚Äôm just freaking out and would love some reassurance üò© everything has been great so far and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll mess it up. 

I understand that people aren‚Äôt going to be happy 24/7 and so the more time we spend together the more we‚Äôll see that side. I think the thing I‚Äôm worried about is that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in the silences yet and I‚Äôm unsure if this is just the next phase and I need to get used to it or if it‚Äôs a red flag?

love is just.
If I feel love for you it means I‚Äôll treat you as nicely as I can with no expectation of reciprocity. 

I‚Äôll give u half of my life savings to get your life on track or give u a boost and I won‚Äôt regret it. Then I‚Äôll use the motivation I got from helping you to help myself.

I‚Äôll give u the warmest softest hugs. I‚Äôll find a way to remove ur stress. Make you fall asleep.

I know it‚Äôs love because infatuation would make me feel trapped with you. It would inflate my ego.

 if others think it‚Äôs a dumb thing to give so much well it is due to a reluctance to empathize with an incomprehensibly altruistic personality.

I've tried online dating but it feels very weird when you have been in a long term relationship. I feel like most, if not all of the dating apps are just monetizing people's loneliness and no one is really getting anywhere. 

Maybe it's just too late for me and I should just be happy with being alone. During these 6 months I have worked on myself a lot, I no longer have anxiety driving long distances, I've tried to connect with friends I haven't talked to or seen for over a year. I have also worked on myself physically such as swimming and running, and focus on fitness and eating right. 

But during the weekend I saw friends I hadn't seen in a while and most of them were couples and I had to tell them that my ex and I were no longer together. I felt like I used to be a part of ""the couple"" group and now I'm just alone. And my ex is a much more fun person to have around, he was always the life of the party and I'm nothing compared to that. And although I want to be mature and be able to hang out with our mutual friends I know that they will want to hang out with my ex more. 
It just sucks, because not only did I lose and am grieving the ""future"" I had in mind with my ex I am going to lose my friends too. I'm introverted so I feel good being alone, but I'm also human and need interactions with friends. 

And I know most people will say I'm young and that I'll find someone better but it's just difficult finding someone who values authentic connections instead of just getting that instant gratification of sending nudes or sex. No one wants to organically grow and build a relationship with someone, and that really sucks.

As well as this, my anxiety and overthinking causes me to believe things that aren‚Äôt really true, such as I am being ignored, they don‚Äôt like me etc.

These issues have just caused me to fuck up a potential relationship with a girl i really liked. I know she really liked me too, but unfortunately I have ruined those feelings. I am so frustrated with myself, because this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, and now I am sick of it.

A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour.

We don‚Äôt get into arguments/fights and have always been supportive of each other. Sometimes she‚Äôs initiated breaks and other times I have. I initiated the current one. Our reason behind our breaks usually has something to do with our personal lives not being compatible at the moment. We always end on a good note and keep in touch and still act flirty/saucy in our conversations. These breaks usually last a few months at a time. These breaks don‚Äôt even seem like breaks/periods of non dating as much as they do us keeping things low key. However, during our last couple of off periods she has been acting off. She‚Äôll go a couple weeks talking to me all day/night and act more interested than I‚Äôve ever see her been. She‚Äôll even verbalize what acts of physical intimacy she would like to engage in when we‚Äôre just texting. She does this for a few weeks, and then she‚Äôll spend a couple weeks acting unfamiliar and uninterested. She doesn‚Äôt show any affection, she barely talks. Her choice of words/things she says seems strange as well. For example, I might send her a message midday saying ‚Äújust a reminder that I love you and appreciate you‚Äù and she‚Äôd reply ‚ÄúI appreciate you too.‚Äù I know I sound like I‚Äôm overreacting but I feel it‚Äôs odd that she leaves out the first part when she‚Äôs told me before many times she loves me and it‚Äôs easy to put in. She doesn‚Äôt use any non platonic vocabulary during these periods and she might not put any effort into keeping the conversation going. Sometimes she‚Äôll give really simple answers to any questions that I can‚Äôt really do anything with and then she won‚Äôt ask me anything/try to engage me in the conversation and in the end it will feel like I‚Äôm grilling her. And if I ask if anything‚Äôs wrong she gives me one of three answers: ‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù (With a genuinely oblivious tone, making me question myself and back out of the situation I created,) ‚ÄúNo, everything is fine,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYes but it has nothing to do with you.‚Äù After a couple of weeks like this she always goes right back to being super affectionate and warm. And then she‚Äôll become distant again. It‚Äôs a cycle. She‚Äôs told me before that she would tell me if she ever lost interest in me, but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to believe she is. I always have a gut feeling that I‚Äôm the only one she acts this distant from during these periods (I‚Äôm saying I have a strong gut feeling she talks to her friends and acts normal around everyone else when she acts like this.) She has said she could see herself going long term with me. I don‚Äôt know what to make of this situation. At points this gets so stressful that I write out all the evidence for her loving me and for her lying about being in love with me. And it‚Äôs honestly way too difficult to figuring out because of how big the contrast is between her warm and unfamiliar side is, as well as because of things she says when she‚Äôs feeling affectionate. For some context which is probably important about her, she has ptsd from being abused by a previous romantic partner and her dad has bipolar depression (I think she might have it as well.)

30M, black, bisexual‚Äîand not the masculine type‚Äîand pretty chubby at 5‚Äô10, 215 lbs.  I exercise and always come up fine in health checks, but I have no intention of changing my size.  I also have long dreads, which I get a lot of compliments on and a few insults.  I‚Äôm told I have a very nice face, though.  (Apple cider vinegar, charcoal scrub, and lotion.)  

I‚Äôm a (moderate) socialist who goes to protests, and not only am I lower-income, I don‚Äôt even value money much.  I have no career ambitions.  I‚Äôm a writer for a big-name digital arts website, which doesn‚Äôt pay very well‚ÄîI only crack $30k a year if I hustle and pick up extra projects‚Äîbut it‚Äôs my literal dream job that I‚Äôve wished for my whole adult life, and I have no desire to do anything else.  And in fact, I‚Äôm working on minimizing my life, moving out of my apartment and in with a roommate, to maximize the amount of time I can spend learning art.  I prefer living communally and occupying less space, owning a few r/buyitforlife things instead of a house full of stuff.  

In short, I‚Äôm a very polarizing person on OLD. 

My type is also the opposite of most members of this sub.  I absolutely love alt (goth, punk, weeb, et al.) BBW and fem gay guys, and have a thing for androgynous folks, trans people, and others who bend or blend genders. 

I live in Philly, which is a very good city to find those types in.  

I‚Äôve been on online dating, mostly OKC, on and off for ten years, learned how the systems work, and have figured out how to ‚Äúappeal to my base‚Äù so I don‚Äôt waste my time and everyone else‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve gotten attracting blue-haired girls who read bell hooks down to a science.  First of all, I have a photography background, so I can take pro-looking selfies with a DSLR.  I focus on wording my profile well and couch the weird shit about myself in jokes.  I‚Äôm very selective about who I swipe right on.  I do pretty well, in that I get a lot of makeouts and hookups, and I‚Äôve made several long-term friends, but it‚Äôs been years since I had a serious relationship off it.  

My last stint was on OKC, Tinder, and Bumble from 2018 to 2020, when I deleted everything because I hate long-distance relationships and didn‚Äôt want to put up with one through quarantine.  I just rejoined three days ago, trying out five sites to see how they went.  Here are the results:

**Tinder** is fairly useless: not just because of the whole ‚Äúlooks are all that matter‚Äù thing, but because the meat-market approach attracts a boring crowd.  It‚Äôs much better for gay dating than straight, although that brings a ton of chaff.  Most of the likes who I identified from their blurred thumbnails were dudes who were the opposite of my type: While I‚Äôm flattered that so many buff, bearded chasers are into me, it‚Äôs unfortunately not mutual.  Out of 40 likes in the first three days, I‚Äôve only matched with 5: One guy who I‚Äôm about to arrange a date with, a few I‚Äôm just sitting on because I‚Äôm not very excited about them (hey, they‚Äôre not messaging me either), and one woman, a cosplay model whose profile says she‚Äôs ‚Äúreal,‚Äù but might just be promoting her OnlyFans.

**Hinge:** I tried this one in 2018 and deleted it within less than an hour, but the constant praise from Reddit motivated me to at least try it for review purposes.  Turns out I still don‚Äôt like it.  Instantly I hated the format: I‚Äôve spent a long time working on a summary that encapsulates what I‚Äôm about, and having it replaced with quirky questions that make it much harder to communicate what I want to throws my first impression out the window.

This app clearly knows its audience, which coincidentally, is the exact opposite of mine. The girls on this site are aggressively ordinary, although they‚Äôre very conventionally attractive and objectively high-caliber.  Great jobs, good degrees, all that.  So I see why so many people like it.  

One enlightened Redditor in another thread complained about the number of ‚Äúmorbidly obese‚Äù women in his area.  Either he lives in Alabama or his idea of obese is 140 lbs., because all I‚Äôm seeing on this app are yuppies with Instagram hourglasses.  

Constant swipes left, and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time watching that loading icon spin.  I haven‚Äôt even bothered looking at guys on this one because I know it‚Äôll be a desert.  I got one match on the first night, though, from a cool-looking girl who asked to read my work.  Waiting to see what she thinks of it.

**Facebook Dating:**  I signed up for this one first out of pure curiosity, and what I found was‚Ä¶  OK.  First match was from a guy in Maryland who was cute despite having unflattering pics, and nice, but practically opened by saying he was looking for his true love.  Slow down there, my dude, we don‚Äôt even know each other‚Äôs full names.  

I like that it‚Äôs legitimately free, with no premium option, since Zuck already owns 2% of millennial wealth.  It‚Äôs refreshing to just like whoever you want and see who‚Äôs liked you back.  The main downside is that it says ‚Äúfuck your distance limits‚Äù and mostly shows you people in other states.  Some of my matches were hot, but not six-hour-drive hot.  First three days brought ten of them, out of I‚Äôd guess about 40 likes.  The main problem was the same as Tinder: most were from homely guys with sparse profiles who weren‚Äôt my type.

**Bumble.**  Looks good at first, but slower than a Nissan Versa going uphill.  There turned out to be a lot of options in my type, although it took hours of swiping before they started popping up.  I suspect the app shows you the women who are rated the most attractive first, then once you run out of them, starts throwing up the supposed uggos.  Not a single like in the first three days, but that‚Äôs par for the course.  When I had it pre-pandemic, it was like that at first too, then suddenly after 2-3 weeks, I started getting likes and dates.  

...Wait, am I one of the uggos?  Oh God oh fuck

**OKCupid:**  I‚Äôm not sure how this became the designated dating app for weird people, but somehow, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs always been.

Contrary to most people, I actually liked when they switched to the swipe format.  Before, it was frustrating blindly guessing who to send messages to, knowing that I consciously don‚Äôt appeal to most people on OLD.  If you‚Äôre anything besides a rich white guy, knowing who wants to give you the time of day beforehand is invaluable.

Of course, the nearly deal-breaking drawback is how many microtransactions and paywalls they‚Äôve added over the years.  I know there‚Äôs always more money to be squeezed out of our broke generation, but it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to see how many stones they can pile onto their own site before it‚Äôs pressed to death.  Also, for some reason, no matter what distance I set my preferences too, this (and a couple other apps) are desperate to show me New Yorkers.  I love visiting the city, but not enough to schlep up there every week to see someone.  Maybe they‚Äôre trying to pad their results.

But this was the first one I joined, it‚Äôs always been my main one, and it‚Äôs still the only one that‚Äôs working.  Being able to write pretty well is one of my selling points, and OKC‚Äôs longform approach is the only one that lets me show it in my profile.

The first three days have brought 62 likes, ten matches, and five conversations.  There‚Äôs one in particular who I‚Äôm getting along amazingly with, the kind you only get once a year.  I know that often doesn‚Äôt translate to real life, but I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic.  Our first date‚Äôs this evening.

When we work the same shift together he always takes his break when I do, and we have some great conversations! We have similar interests as well. 

When we talk he likes to stand really close to me. He talks about how he goes to the gym and often flexes his muscles around me lol. One time he even held my hand to look at my rings. He gives me lots of compliments and one time we were in the break room and I took off my mask and he said it was nice to see my face (he hadnt seen it bc we are still required to wear masks).

I'm pretty good at reading people and I think I make him nervous which is really cute lol

He also unexpectedly asked whether I like guys or girls, I said both. My friends tell me he wouldnt ask that if he wasnt interested. 

The thing that really confused me was the fact that I asked for his instagram and he gave it to me and I followed him. This was about a week ago and he never followed me back? Its possible he just doesnt use instagram that much but if he was interested, wouldnt he follow me back, especially because he knew I followed him? Its so hard to get to know him because our schedules dont often overlap and he hasnt asked for my number either, thats why I asked for his instagram to kind of initiate that. He hasnt posted anything to his instagram recently either so idk

I asked her if she is seeing anyone else and she said that she is. It was a really contradictory conversation, but it is what it is.

I have big goals and dreams career-wise. I wanted a relationship where I didn't want to possibly give up schooling or my job. So when I met my ex, he explained that he didn't have any goals and dreams. I thought it was perfect, but I soon learned that dating someone with no goals was sorta sucky.
He didn't understand my passion.

He's also fairly immature for his age, as am I. We both still live with our parents. I have been actively trying to save money to move out (though I had several setbacks due to medical bills and vet bills and as I stated I am still immature and pay for things I don't need). He gets paid more than me yet somehow always has around 250 in his bank account whereas I have 10x that. I have no idea where the money goes.
I became concerned that I couldn't mature fast enough to compensate for him.
In the four years he and I dated I have gotten my driver's license, paid off my car, got several jobs, got a volunteer position (that I currently can't do due to Covid) and he has been working the same job for almost three years.

I just don't see growth in him. He makes me so happy when I see him in the present, but when I think about the future I can't see anything.

Before I broke up with him, I asked him what is his goal in life. He said it was to marry me.

I noticed later in the relationship I'd yearn for other men. Men who were accomplished, and had dreams. Especially ones whose goals reflected my own.
I felt so unfaithful.

Is my breakup just an excuse for me wanting to see other men? Is it valid? Or am I being selfish and not understanding him?

Because he is a wonderful boyfriend. He's patient, and listens to me, and he cooks for me. He plays games with me. He gets all my jokes. He's perfect except in the maturity department.

I am married and in a selective open relationship. I had to spend a long time working on things with my husband but now we are here. My husband never liked the idea of sharing me but he was ok with it and allowed me to find a fwb situation. Fast forward and I meet the fwb but soon enough I realize I have mad feelings for him. He is basically the other half of me while my husband is my soul mate. Made an agreement with fwb that we would be exclusive because I didn't want drama and didn't want extra people involved. Just keep it simple and he agreed to that. Except then he slept with his ex on a trip to NYC. Didn't tell me but I found out somehow. I asked for additional std testing because that's part of my husband and my agreement with additional playmates. Fast forward and I tell him I have feelings. He responds and says he has feelings for me too. Then two days later goes home and tells me his ex needs some good dick and he wants to help. Ok well I am not dating him so what am I gonna do? I say whatever and get a test when you get back if you would.  End up telling him how that hurt me and he seemed to understand. Couple months later he tells me he loves me on a park bench. That weekend I was so excited to hang out with him. I wanted him bad. He ended up getting drunk with his coworkers and crashed at their house and got his dick sucked by a coworker he had previously slept with before meeting me.  
So here we are months from that. We both clearly like each other. He is depressed, has untreated issues, is going to therapy and obviously has alot going on. I have tried to be a friend as best as I can even though it has cost me. We have absolutely amazing sex or at least he knows how to work me in bed to perfection. I never have had so many orgasms as I do with him and I know he's told me he cares for me and enjoys being with me. But I've asked what we are or if we could date. If not then can we at least agree to having some boundaries? He never responds. He never wants to figure it out or talk through it. I am slowly breaking up with him in my mind because I don't know how long this relationship with him will last. My husband and I have ok sex but we have an amazing relationship. So each of these people in my life makes me feel like a whole person. Do I end it? Do I swallow my pride and accept whatever good comes? Do I move on slowly?

Now, the problem here is that she always tells me that she has a crush on one dude, probably one week later she has a crush on another one, never talk to them or something, but she apparently always falls in love with someone else.

So a few weeks ago I started this new job. The company is great, the team is great, and we all have a fun time doing our jobs. There was also a young lady who mentioned she was into a lot of the same stuff as I was and on the first day we talked for a good two hours about games and general nonsense. The more we talked the more I realized we had in common and she seemed to dismiss that a bit but when we delved deeper into it there seemed to be a LOT more. I'd chat with her on and off every few days about work stuff but she just seemed to have no interest in small talk, only really getting engaged

Full disclosure on this is that I was diagnosed with Aspergers when I was five and I've gotten so good at 'masking' that it's literally second nature to me. I can spot ASD traits in others a mile away sometimes; the ticks, the obsessions, verbal nuances stuff like that. It took me a while but after two weeks it just hit me she was giving these signs off as well only I didn't pick up on it.

She's funny, smart, matches most of my interests, and has had very similar life experiences to me. I really feel drawn to her and want to get to know her better, even if it's just shooting shit on the Xbox but deep down I know I want to date her. We even know some of the same people from tabletop gaming circles and previous jobs. I've tried not to overload her, recognizing my own ASD traits lean me towards this but trying to follow the rules I've previously used to navigate dating in the neurotypical world.

Do the same rules still apply here? This is the first time I've ever encountered 'one of my kind' in the wild but am I reading too much into it? Should I approach her and disclose my own ASD status to see what happens?

So there was this girl at my company that i usually didnt see (she works in another team, unrelates to my job), but whenever i saw her and she passed trough me, she gave a very nice smile to me, and i low-key loved it. 

Anyway, last saturday i asked her out, and she said yes, we went to a nice and comfy restaurant near our place of living, and had a great time. Really.

But i noticed that i was did like, 75% of the talking, and i suck at that, i mean it. The girl is beatiful, but very shy and timid. 

I consider myself a very quiet and reserved guy, but not timid at all, a ""healthy"" introvert, in other words. 

Anyway, we went to the car and probably made out for One and Half Hour straight, lol. 

I spoke to her at the end of the night that i would like to know her more, if it was possible, and maybe we could sort something out with time. She agreed. 

We agreed that we wouldnt give any hints at our workplace.

My problem here is, as a quiet guy myself, i don't know how to proceed here... maybe ask her out again next weekend? 

I REALLY dont know. I am very comfortable and i liked her presence, but at the same time, not having enough subjects to talk to and being bad with conversations with an already timid girl is like... double trouble. 

I dont want her to change, unless she does want to, i just want to be next to her, and be nice to her, but i dont know how to do it and IF i am doing enough...

Could you guys and girls give me any help?
Feel free to ask anything.

I look at various stories about relationships both on and off reddit and can't help but feel a little envious of the happy couples. I know I am not alone in this and most all single people feel this way, but I knew I had to get this off my chest, so here is my soliloquy/rant.

I consider myself to be a very nice and compassionate person. I treat others (including women) with respect. I am healthy, and smart, and funny. I am also sensitive to other's feelings and care about the people who are close to me. All this makes me think I would make for a good partner.

And then I see and hear stories about people who are in difficult relationships. There are posts on reddit about one person really giving their all for their loved one. People asking for tips to help their partner with a mental illness, or support them through a difficult time in life. People willing to go to any length for the happiness of their partner. And all this makes me a little sad for myself. Don't get me wrong, it warms my heart to read these stories of these beautiful people - both men and women - who are willing to fight for their love. It just makes me long for something like that.

I look at posts by so many girls who are with their partner even when the relationship is difficult because of the guy's past trauma or mental illness yet they stick with them. Sometimes it's people struggling with addiction and their wife or girlfriend helping them through it. Or a couple toughing it out through a financial crunch. And I think how much easier it would be for my partner because I am not facing any such problems. Again, I do not mean to belittle others' struggles at all. I know no one wants to be in a bad place, and I have so much respect for couples working through a tough time. Neither does any of these make a person or relationship less worthy. I just mean that I am fortunate to not have any mental illness or addiction or financial troubles. And therefore being with me should not be difficult for my partner. Of course I know that I am not perfect. Far from it. But I am (hopefully) mature enough to handle my own shortcomings.

It's not like I have only faced constant rejection from women. I just didn't have enough confidence in myself to ever consider dating as something that was possible for me. I really grew into my own in the last few months, perhaps a year. I was not very social before that, and then the lockdown happened, so there was no chance of going out and meeting people. However, in these few months, I have worked on my style, my fitness and completely revamped my looks. Whereas I earlier used to avoid being in photos because I was embarrassed by how I looked, I now find myself to be highly attractive. I also started therapy to tackle other psychological problems like my self-esteem.

The issue now is that I don't know how to go about finding a connection. I tried OLD, but that is a proper game. It is a tournament where everything is about glamour and how shiny your profile is. You can do nothing if no one swipes on you. And I don't even blame women for that given the economics of the trade (it's similar to how recruiters only glance at every resume for a few seconds before deciding on it). Sadly, I am not very good at taking pictures, especially of myself (see above).

Still, I know that I can crack OLD given some time and enough dedication on my part (have cracked really tough challenges before). It's just not how I want to do it. I hope it does not make me vain to say that I know I will keep my girlfriend really happy. Others have said this to me before (including women I know). I just don't know how to use this to find someone I would like to be with. I am not even looking for hookups or something casual. I hear how most women want serious relationships with a caring person, and that makes me feels I should not have to play the OLD game. But I just don't know how to make it happen for myself right now in any other way.

All of this makes me sad sometimes.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I would appreciate kind comments. Or just read this and move on.

I (23yo female) have been dating this guy for 3 months now. Things have been going great ever since, we really have a good time together, share lots of intimacy, have a blast.

Here is the issue : in one month, he will go away for 6 months to travel. This has been his dream way before he met me.

I don't have any issue with him going away, but I don't manage to just ""live the moment"" and enjoy the present anymore, I always have his departure in my mind. Is it weird or a sign of emotional immaturity to want to ""plan"" the future ? To want some stability/certitudes ? Or is it a sign of emotional dependency or insecurity ?

I mean, he always tells me ""let's enjoy our time together and we'll see how things will evolve"" but I just feel like I will get more and more attached, even if our relationship has a deadline, and it feels like I'm investing time and energy in something that will not last. He's not sure what he wants and tells me he's not ready for something serious now because of his travel.

He's clear about the fact that he does not want something serious right now, because he'll be traveling. Is it worth it to enjoy our time together until the last day before he goes away ?

Do you think I'm auto-sabotaging my relationship by being too serious or that, in a sense, it is be normal to not want to invest yourself in a relationship that is doomed ? I can't make any project with someone who goes away and he's clear about the fact he won't ask me to ""wait for him"" until he comes back.

I took a woman on a second date to an expensive restaurant, which is something you typically shouldn‚Äôt do when you just met someone.

In my mind, the date was going well. We had a great conversation, and both mentioned what a good time we were having. At the end of the night, I walked her to her car, and after taking for a bit, went in for the kiss. She turned her head at the last moment as my lips collided with her cheek and said, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs awkward.‚Äù

I simply smiled and said, ‚ÄúI had a good time, hope you have a good night.‚Äù We texted a little after, but I never asked her out for a third date.

Although I made a lot of mistakes early on, one of my strengths was that I always handled rejection like a champ. I looked at going on dates as practice‚Äîall I wanted to do was have fun and meet amazing women. The next day, I even texted my friends like it was a funny battle story, instead of a slight. I realized it was for the best and moved on.

Men are horrible at rejection. We lose our shit, and take it as a referendum on our manhood, or our value as a person. It isn‚Äôt. Every single adult has experienced rejection. Meeting other people is a number‚Äôs game‚Äîsome will think you‚Äôre amazing, others will think you‚Äôre corny and will want nothing to do with you. It‚Äôs part of being polarizing, which is necessary for success.

The ability to handle rejection like a man is powerful. If you become unglued when you are rejected, that person has power over you. If you treat it like it‚Äôs minor blip in your life instead of a catastrophic event, you are in control.

Next time you encounter rejection, even if it is rude or stinging, handle it in a centered, ambivalent, polite manner.

Then she found his Linkedin and messaged him on there without me knowing. She was trying to shoot her shot with him and I was surprised she did that, since I told her about him because I liked him. She told me I told her to shoot her shot and I sent him to her, which I didn't do. So she lied to him saying I sent him his profile. Then he told me in a joking way it's creepy if I guy did what she did. I told her not to message because some people might think it's creepy. And that I told him I told her not to message. She threw me under the bus, first by messaging him when I told her about it . Am I in the wrong for it? we're also both single and he is too, so it's not like he's mine, but her lying about me and then going after this guy I'm into is like making me feel terrible and that she doesn't give a fuck about my feelings.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,867909,public,self,AITA for telling my friend not to message this guy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oacffy/aita_for_telling_my_friend_not_to_message_this_guy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
