Hunting, fishing, quading, and drinking are popular in my area.  I've been clean shaven my entire life and the longest I've gone without shaving was 2 weeks.  I got a little more female attention and some said I looked better with a beard while others said it didn't fit my personality.

A little about myself: I don't like guns, I could never harm an animal unless I was starving and needed a food source, I don't have fun fishing, I don't like getting dirty in a side by side or mudding.  I also can't drink anymore due to 3 gastrointestinal comorbidities.  I have nothing in common with a lot of people in this area.

I'm passionate about Technology, my family, watching movies, taking naps, taking walks, listening to music, occasional video gamer, NFL football, CFB, entrepreneurship, investing, and business.

I also am big into being generous to other people and being able to approach and converse with people I feel like introducing myself to who feel like positive, happy, upbeat people. I feel that being clean shaven makes me more approachable.  I just feel like an outcast in my area.

My haircut is a little longer on top and a 1 guard on the sides and back.  I like looking professional.  I like to wear t shirts and sweatpants when I'm home but I like wearing blazers, sweaters, leather jackets, turtlenecks, Chelsea boots, loafers, etc.  I dress pretty conservatively and think before I speak.  While I have some conservative views and consider myself a moderate politically I lean democratic.  Almost everyone in my town is conservative which I don't agree with a lot of their social viewpoints.

I just had shaven tonight and my face has broken out like crazy and is bumpy.  The itchiness was so intolerable and I itched so much I drew blood.  I freaking hate beards and facial hair.  I don't like the aesthetic which I find sloppy, and it feels terrible.  My productivity probably dropped 75% the last two weeks.  I couldn't think of anything else but how much I wanted to shave it off.

To sum it up:  is not having a beard a dealbreaker? Would women in cities be more tolerable of my style?

I hate being in a rural area.  I apologize for the punctuation and grammatical errors.  I also go on tangents due to my ADHD.

Hi, so let’s say:

You’re in a city’s park just chilling, talking with your friends. When suddenly, some girl comes up to you and asks you to talk privately.

Assuming you agree, she then leads you away from your friends far enough so that they don’t hear but then can still see you guys.

She then says:” Hi, do you have a gf? cause I think you’re really cute and I’d love to get to know you. Also, sorry for interrupting you guys”

That’s what I plan on doing but I’ve heard that girls don’t like to be approached by guys like this because:

1. They get approached a lot when they’re just minding their own business/ haning with their friends

2. Some guys do it in a way that corners the girl, which makes her feel trapped( for example, when she’s getting gas and a guy approached and now she has to talk to him because her gas isn’t filled yet) 

3. Guys who do this (at least where I’m from) are considered fuck boys who have 10 other chicks on the side.

And I’m worried that it’d be the same for guys.

So if a girl were straight forward and approached you like this, is it a big no no? How would you feel?

It seems the women I have dated recently have fallen into this category.

Being an anxious attachment person, I want to spend time and fall in love right away. When I don't feel it reciprocated, it's hard to temper my emotions of feeling like the next great ""ghostening"" is just around the corner.

Here are some tips I've gathered with these experiences though:

* They want to hear from you, just not all day. Maybe not even every day. But they do want to know you're thinking about them sometimes. Ask them what they are doing, how their day is, etc. Get them to talk about themselves. 

* Talking about yourself and what you're doing is not particularly interesting to them. Most people are this way, but avoidant attachment people in particular are highly independent and don't want to hear about you unless they ask.

* It feels like the first message needs to ""break the ice"". I've found just keep it simple and short. I used to try to open with a joke or a meme, but I've found that's not really effective, and not getting to the point either.

* Keep most conversations short and to the point. After asking them about themselves, ask them to hang out. Having a long conversation via text is not particularly fun to them.

* Ask them to hang out. That's what they're going to enjoy more than talking. That's where the quality time is built, not through the phone. 

* Make plans to hang out. Don't just say ""would you like to hang out tomorrow?"" Come up with an activity. ""Would you like to go to the park around 2 pm tomorrow?"" will garner much more interest. Do ask it in question form though, don't just say ""I made reservations for us at a restaurant, be there tomorrow at 7."" That's demanding and violates their independence.

* If they say no to your plans, but offer an alternative, you're good. If they say no and don't offer an alternative (typically this comes with an excuse too), just move on. Doubly so if you make plans and she cancels. People who cancel dates are not interested in spending time with you. Don't try to re-ask them out if they cancel, it's a waste of time every time.

* In my experience, physical touch is usually not their primary love language. They may not want to hold hands, make out, have sex, etc. until they are confident you can respect their space.

This is definitely going to sound like I’m fishing for compliments but I’ve always had a complex growing up because I felt like all of my peers were getting romantic attention and I wasn’t, really. But I was constantly told how gorgeous I was and I was pretty well-liked, and when I came to my parents about it, they both said the same thing: boys are intimidated by me. 

And to add to that, I am a biracial girl in a predominantly white area, which just adds a whole layer of surprise to the mix. But once I reached junior and (now) senior year of highschool, I really found my confidence and grew into myself, and frankly, had a little bit of a glow up. I started socializing more than ever and ended up winning homecoming queen. Even boys I had crushes on in middle school have came out of the woodworks and told me that they had a crush on me back then but I was just too..intimidating. Everyone compliments me and I’ve even had people say “you could pull any guy at [My school]” and even tonight, my friends all said I’m going to “pull boys” at college. Yet, I haven’t had a boyfriend and I’ve only had about 1 talking stage in these two years. (I had one boyfriend my sophomore year during covid, but it was only a couple months long). 

During my sophomore year, my friend came to me and said all of the popular junior boys had a huge crush on me and this other beautiful girl in my grade, yet none of them approached me while some approached her. I’ve had players from a huge football school that my brother coaches at say that I’m “hot” (charming, I know) and telling my brother they’re going to take me out, yet only two have actually snapped me  but haven’t asked me out, or tried to make things exclusive. 

So, is it really because they’re intimidated by me and don’t want to attempt to even try to date me? Or are my family and friends just trying to make me feel better? And I’m not insecure at all, I think I’m a very beautiful person, inside and out, yet I just don’t get boys’ attention like other girls my age.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130414,public,self,Is it true that guys are intimidated by attractive girls?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3vhvn/is_it_true_that_guys_are_intimidated_by/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I think it's not the move for me (Don't care if others do it). However, it seems to me that hook-up culture is increasing more and more.

This kinda worries me because I want to be with someone who is a virgin. In college, I have no clue what to expect with this whole dating stuff. I'm expecting some responses like ""It's none of your business to worry about their sexual past"" but I think otherwise. I don't think couples should hide anything from one another.

I am 20 And as long as I can remember, I have always been attracted to women that were older than myself.

I   understand it's normal to a certain degree. But all guys around my age   crush on younger women, when all of my celebrity crushes are from  older  women: Gal Gadot, Elizabeth Olsen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, etc.

But the problem is that, I almost always hear women saying they are disgusted at men that are younger than themselves.

It really hurts my confidence when women I am attracted to, say they are not attracted to me because they see me as a child.

That there is nothing I can do to make an older woman see me in a romantic way.

People   say you can't get any further with older women than fuck buddies.   Really? The only thing that can make them interested in me is to use me   like a dildo and then throw me away?

I was devastated, winter came around he started to act really mean twords me and was just really terrible to me for months. After that he calmed down and we started to have a thing again but only on the weekends after a night out and that went on for months….That summer we talked things out and decided to get back together. We were togther for a few months and at the end of the summer he broke things off again without any explanation at a big event when he was drunk and said he had been feeling that way for a couple of days now. Again I was devasted and confused. We go about six months not really talking to eachother and sometimes bumping into eachother through mutual friends. Last week he wanted to meet up and I did. At the end of us hanging out and catching up he said he loves me and misses me. That he wants to be the perfect boyfriend for me, buy me presents and go on trips etc. He also said that he had been thinking about this for weeks and Is ready to put in the effort and commitment for our realtionship to work out. I was shocked but also happy. I gave in and we started hanging out again like we used to. Then a couple of days ago he said that this feels weird and akward being with me but he would really want us to work out but It just doesn’t feel right. Again I was devasted.

4:42am:
- he is not loving me in time. I feel like it’s overdue. I feel like he needs to come here. He needs to see me. This could play out different if we were physically together. 
- Why is the word love coming into my life??
- Why is it relating to M____? 
- How could I love him? 
I don’t know love from a man. A man you’d emotionally mentally and physically confide in. 
I fear that he will teach me the wrong version of it. I worry that I will never trust love if he does not give correctly.

I want him.
But he does not give me life. He does not fulfill me. He does not make me feel loved. When at a distance. I need to see him. Nothing else will do. I can’t do this long distance shit if this is all the fuck it is just fucking phone calls full of shit and chronic silence. He’s barely 4 hours away &amp; won’t consider coming to see me after I spent $400+ to come see him 3 weeks ago. 

But I want him. 
Any ounce of his encouraging behavior makes me feel special. But I only experience that when I get undressed for him. Once ever for a hairstyle. And a few times for some outfits he liked but seeing his smile, when it’s for me, always made me feel special. Special to him. I don’t feel that from him often.

But I want him.
He’s almost been around for 3 years. We’ve only been in talking stage since. The first night we met we connected like it was nothing. In a couple days he’s caressing my legs in the back seat, in front of his friends. Where is that same adaptation? Why are you so closed off from me? 
Why is your guard never down anymore? 

I still want him. 
A part of me won’t let up until I find out whether or not he is supposed to be mine. I want to know you. I want to witness your vulnerability and have you know I’ll always protect it. 
This time with him has meant a lot, and then nothing to me. He makes me nervous. As long as things go his way everything is fine. Any verbal confrontation we have I always lose. I lose because my communication is not top tier and I do not do well under pressure. So then I sit in silence and frustration. Short replies. “What else do you want me to do? I hear you, I will work on that.” 
He’ll go: “you don’t got nothing else to say?”
No. I say “what else am I supposed to say? All I can do is work on it.”
- work on speaking up more. 
- Work on acknowledging every point
- I communicate amazingly in my writing. 
- But in real life my mind fucks me over each time. It’s very upsetting. 

When I happen to be wrong, the matter is blown up. Usually I understand his point, it’s not usually unreasonable. No ones ever emphasized the thing so do “wrong” so much. He has made me believe that I am this shitty and mostly incompetent person who just doesn’t care. A crazy person who’s “priorities are backwards”, (emphasizing himself as one of my priorities). 🤷🏽‍♀️

I still want him
All I want is one perfect day and night with him. To show him I can be all that he wants. But I’ve never had to prove myself to anybody. Every other guy naturally saw me for me. I am convinced he feels like he could find someone more beneficial and competent than me. 
 
 Still want him
He has chosen to deal with me for this long. I 95% believe he only talks to me. Otp day and night. Could it really just be me? I don’t want to believe that but I’m always the problem and to this day I need to “get my shit together” and just do what he asks because he’s “tired of having these conversations”. But still said “that doesn’t mean to not acknowledge an issue you have”

So I want him
He says logical shit. He’s not a terrible person. Though his delivery is always direct but brutal and always ends in the point of me needing to realize what I’m doing wrong and to not let it happen again. Just the other day he told me “I asked you to be better😂”.
 I have never been good enough for him. Why do I still want to find out if I ever will be? I won’t move on until I know I can be what he wants and we could actually be happy together. At least that’s how I feel.
  To say I could be right for him if he knew me better. That Is so insane. Because he knows me enough.
I get anxiety of what you could be for me, yet your every action contradicts that and it honestly hurts.

                      But I still want him.

We met by pure coincidence and so on and so forth. Anyways in the first week we met i told her if she'd like to go out sometime, she said sure just to wait a couple of weeks because school had just started, to that I said okay as it was the same for me. So about one month in i ask once more when could we go out, we did and to be completely honest I had a blast. She was fun, we liked a lot of the same things and it was just in general quite nice to finally go out with someone for the first time for real. We held hands then (on the first date - her words), things were going really well. For two months we texted every day, i called her many times, we had our ups and downs but that was to be expected...i think. Now somewhere in that time period we went out, it was late, she just finished work and we just found a nice place near the river under some trees, we laid there and later made out as well. After we had done that she asked if things were going too fast for me, to which i replyed no and we went on with our little adventure. That same week i went to her house, to where her mom drove us and her whole family was home (her mom said they wanted to meet me, which came as a surprise to me and her - she later told me they won't be home, but i like tried to play it cool) so there i meet her family, all good right? We go to her room, watch a couple of movies and just have a good time in general. She took a few pics of us and posted them on social media. Then her (i think) grandpa needed her downstairs and when she came back she was all apologetic for not being with me, i said it was cool. Somewhere in that moment (idk what it was, its been like a good month and a half) she just became really sad and just ruined the whole mood but to me all that was important, was to be with her. In the end she just started crying and wouldn't even look me in the eyes, i tried my best to try and console her (idk if that's how you write it), then i also saw cuts on her arm. I tried asking what that was, she just wouldn't tell me. Her problem was also that i asked too much, about her past, about her (just in general ig) and she later said that i was suffocating her with all that and she just told me to go. The same day i texted her, to ask her if she was alright and stuff and she just told me like yea I'm good. So now a bit more than a month later, I'm broken, started with some bad habits and she just keeps living her life. I'm so sad that i had so much love for her, gave her all the attention and she just took that away - in the end saying it was more of a friendship.

Now I know, I'm 15, it's still early for me to do anything, but she said she just liked me for the attention i gave her. I feel like many months of my life have been a lie. What can I do in the future to prevent that? How can someone just lose interest in you? Now that i think about it, in the beginning she told me she had a same situation with another guy a year before. I don't know how i feel about this. I see the red flags now. Should i try and ""date"" in about a month I'll be 16, i think that'll give me some confidence. How can i change things? I did my best and she was just like meh f u too. Any advice? I have so many questions ;/
