Here is more context along with imposter syndrome:

Context: I am in a wheelchair due to spina bifida. 21 year old male.
I’m really struggling with imposter syndrome lately, past, present and future. 
I feel like many people were kind and friendly to me when I was in high school because they felt bad for me or pitied me. This period was when I had the most attention from girls and had several relationships. It all seemed real with them until my first real girlfriend cheated on me right after I graduated. My penis size wasn’t enough and she didn’t like that I was wheelchair bound. It really salted my wounds that I didn’t know existed. 
Present day I struggle immensely with finding friends and any semblance of love. I feel alone and I struggle even reaching out because I don’t want to repeat what happened in the past with friends and a partner.
I’m trying to hard to get past my past but I can’t help thinking I’m stuck in this vicious cycle for life. Dating and friend finder apps suck and it seems like COVID is never going away.

Well. god how do I even start this. I’m one of two females in an all male friendgroup and lets just say I’ve garnered attention I didn’t expect from them. I tend to get swept up by emotions and not think things through properly and thats biting me in the butt now. 

woooo context time: I liked homie A and suspected he liked me back for a couple years before covid hit and I assumed he lost interest in me. Then B popped up and apparently he liked me during that time too, then confessed to me. It may have been the wrong decision but I felt kind of bad and said yes- it wasn’t a complete lie though we were close I just tried to force my feelings for his sake and in the end I didn’t want to lead him on anymore and ended things with him as gently as I could. 

Things were a bit awkward in the group after that but but we’d only dated for a month and nobody really said anything so after some time it was fine. 

Eventually the other girl in the group (my best friend) brought it to my attention that C (who’s one of the guys I was closest to) was starting to show signs of liking me. I didn’t think much of it but eventually we got closer and closer and I caught feelings for him. I really didn’t mean to and tried to push them down, but we’d literally talk everyday and flirt sometimes. Still I didn’t act on the crush I didn’t want to be “that girl” yk. 
This went on for almost a year

woohoooo new schoolyear’s almost starting and now D is getting really close to me. And call me a “not-very-nice-person” but I liked both C and D at the same time. Listen man Ive never had to deal with romantic conflict Im just- ugh anyways. 

I told myself I wasn’t ready for a relationship. Clearly. Im still really young and stupid and obviously don’t know what Im doing I just wanted time to sort my feelings out. 
THEN E asks me out to eat and I like an IDIOT I really thought it was friendly. He’d confessed to me a year and a bit before but I genuinely thought he was over those feelings now. Anyways. E told D about this and that just made D act faster. He asked me out to the movies and we had a nice time but he didn’t try any moves so I just idk thought I misunderstood???

Ive been second guessing myself the entire time about any of these guys actually liking me, and well. I wont pull up the whole wah wah sob story but I’m insecure as fuck and clearly cant handle attention well 

Now D asks me to hangout really frequently and yeah I like him but I’m conflicted. I liked C for much longer but went along anyways because I like D too right??? [I am a fucking idiot.]

At this point everyone already assumes we’re dating and then boom. He asks me to be his girlfriend. 

and i
say 
yes. 

:| 


Something Ive now realized is I have MASSIVE FUCKING COMMITMENT ISSUES 
and just like B a month has now passed and I am rethinking me and D’s relationship. 

Thing is these are all my friends and I care about them alot and it scares the fuck out of me that I’m responsible for so many people’s feelings. 

I would never cheat on him. That is just a despicable thing to do. But i’m going to be be completely honest I still have feelings for A and C. moreso than my own boyfriend. and that makes me feel soso awful

he’s so sweet and tells me how in love he is with me- I cant breakup with him it just hurts so much and I feel guilty all day because theres nothing I can do. and its all my fault so I really have no right to complain. 

I don’t know what to do I can’t break up with him and even if I do theres no way in hell I’ll try and pursue anyone else. I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want to lose my friends (I’m scared they’ll kick me out - understandably so)

Why’d I have to get ahead of myself and only realize now I am just not ready for a relationship. 

fuck.

TL;DR: Potential interest got turned off by me not being/wanting to be vaccinated.


There's this person that I've been talking to for a few months on snapchat.  We had an instant attraction, and the only drawback was, we lived on opposite ends of the east coast (or so I thought).  Everything about this person was/is sexy to me, and the same goes for them with me.

Fast forward a few months after exchanging snaps, good conversations and flirting with each other, we agreed that I should come visit them upstate for winter break.  In anticipation, I began to look for travel packages, as they had promised to show me around and arrange an itinerary for us to spend time together. 

Then tonight - I don't know why, but - something in me just felt unsettled and I got this nudge to ask them if they were vaccinated, which they are.  The question was returned to me, and as you may have guessed it, my answer was ""no.""  They asked, ""how come?"" 

My reply, ""I'm not exactly anti-vax, however I'm a bit apprehensive about the potential effects it may have on my body.""  To which they retorted, ""That's kind of a turnoff ngl.""  I asked if I should just not bother with the trip anymore, so as to not make them uncomfortable.  They said, ""probably not... unless you want to get vaccinated.""  I made it clear that it was not something I ""want"" to do, but if I had to, I would.  They then left me on read.



The question begs:

 Is being unvaccinated going to consistently be a problem for me when it comes to dating/hookups/new friendships?  Also, why does someone's vaccination status hold that much power?

I'm seeking for suggestions as I can't proceess what should I do.

So I (26M) work in a store and a couple of weeks ago a marketing/sales girl (23) comes in. We were talking about the business and at one point I asked her to add in me her facebook and she did. I text her like 3 days later to see if she wanted to hangout, she agreed. I went to meet her, she comes, we had lunch, took a stroll and spent about 2 hour talking to each other. She did mention her ex who she said used to gaslight her with lots of bullshit so she had been single for a while now. After the date I gave her a teddy which i brought from target to gift her a gesture to show appreciation for seeing me. She said she really liked it. I asked if she would like to see me again and she said maybe after her finals. Now I have been trying to communicate with her via text and call, first she does not respond in time, which I understand since her job keeps her occpuied. I called her one time and she said she was in the middle of a show and told me she would call me later when the show is over. So I waited and she didn't call me. She texted me a day later that she got busy later on. 3 days after this incident I tried to follow up on her so I texted her goodluck for the finals and blah blah...she texted me about 45 minutes later saying she will call me in a while but as expected she never did. 

Now I haven't texted her since then and I can see her in facebook that she is busy with her friends since she posted a lot picture from her night out with her friends. It's been few days none of us have tried to communicate, I don't know what should I do. I want to initiate but she takes time to reply and wont try to call back or hold a conversation when I call. I was just wondering if it would be best to ask her honestly one more time or not bother her at all.

She told me after having had multiple dates and hang outs that she was seeing someone else, and that she wanted to break things off w/ that person. She mentioned there was a component to their relationship that involved financial dependence / lowkey sugar baby vibe and that also made it harder for her to end it. This was a major red flag to me, seeing that she claimed the relationship was open but most people I've dated in open relationships have disclosed their partner from the start, even before me leaving to go on a date with them. I was pretty bummed out because I did and still do feel a strong connection to her, but I realized that it triggered my own trust issues from childhood (my father cheated on my mother, severely gaslit my whole family, never to this day has admitted that he did anything wrong smh).

After this, we went no contact for a couple of weeks but decided to meet up to talk. She told me that she wanted to try being exclusive with me and working towards being in a long term committed relationship. She also told me that she wanted to be good to me and communicate openly with me. I told her we can try dating again and see how it goes. Then two days later, she texts me saying she wasn't going to out to a specific place we had discussed going to that night, and that we would meet up the next day. But when I woke up in the morning, my good friend told me he saw her out at a rave, with another woman of the same race of mine (fetishization?) and saw them holding hands in the crowd. I was super triggered when he told me this and knew I had to ask her later that day when I saw her. I did ask her, and when I did she started laughing very hard and saying it was the wrong person. I felt like the laughing could have been to mask a lie. And it's also not like I don't want her to go out or whatever or change her mind, it just did seem a little bit sus when she said she wanted to work towards ""being good to me and being open and honest"" a couple of days before.

I still am not sure if I should give her the benefit of the doubt. I like her a lot, but I also don't really want the stress in my life. I know that I can be a bit avoidant though and wonder if I'm just afraid to actually work on trusting her. Fwiw, my tarot reader also has sent me warnings about this person and has said she has the capacity to deceive me and holds a lot of secrets, which also makes me feel worried. I obviously want to protect myself, but I'm not sure if I should ask to keep dating casually and slowly and be open to dating other people, or to fully just end things for good this time around and not look back.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134448,public,self,Dealing with trust issues or is it all intuition?,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rbi8uz/dealing_with_trust_issues_or_is_it_all_intuition/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

We don’t live together, but we spend most weekends together and I want to enjoy it as much as I can. If we don’t go out he plays his video games, which I don’t mind at all. After that I want to be intimate and most times he’s up for it. But then in the mornings I usually want to have sex again and then the evening again. I feel like I hold myself back from wanting it three times a day… There were a few times he said he’s just not feeling it and does it because he wants to make me happy. Now I don’t want to make the first move, because I don’t want him to feel pressured into having sex with me. I also worry that there might be something wrong with me and when I started taking birth control and saw that a possible side effect is decreased libido, I was kinda happy, but it doesn’t seem to affect me in that way. Before you say that I just need to keep busy, I work and go to school and I’m often exhausted when the weekend rolls around. Is there something wrong with how often I want to have sex with my boyfriend? What can I do to stop feeling so turned on around him?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he used to be on antidepressants. That might be a contributing factor.

EDIT: I wanted to wait until this weekend, we ended up talking about it this morning. He mentioned age difference and stuff. Anyways he’s gonna get me a toy to use wherever he can’t be there in that capacity. I’m good with that. We’re good together and I’m glad we found a solution.

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134449,public,self,Does she find me attractive?

One night he texted me and was like ""I just got off work let me scoop you and I'll drop you back off and yk I'll smoke you out"" and I couldn’t leave cs it was like 12 am so I told him some excuse I can’t remember anymore but after that, we stopped texting until I accidentally showed up at his job but he just ended up texting me and asking if I was the one at his job and I was like yea and that was that. 

But this year at school we make eye contact so much and yk how you can tell the vibes someone is giving from their eyes idk I feel like he’s giving me those vibes. 

Once when he was walking past my class we made eye contact and then he walked past the door but then came back and waved to me but I asked our mutual (N) if he was talking to someone and when she asked him he said ""no oh wait yea I am"" and like how you forget your talking to someone yk? 

Anyways he ignores me cs one time we walked past each other to the bathrooms and I said hi and he didn’t say it back and I admit it was a bit quiet but still and then this morning in the breakfast line he was in front of me and I accidentally hit his shoulder so I apologized and he didn’t say anything but a few mins he turned around and said hi to my friend that was standing next to us. 

But then he was like excuse me to me in the line at lunch but that’s a normal human interaction but as the way, he looks at me, and idk he must’ve liked me or thought I was attractive if he asked for my snap right? I feel like me saying no to going to smoke made him feel like I’m not interested in him and I’m too nervous to make a move but I really like him and I want to make a move without looking stupid.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134455,public,self,HELP PLS this keeps getting buried,0,[],0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rbl4d5/help_pls_this_keeps_getting_buried/,no_ads,0,1638947912.0,,,,,

This girl I work with (21F) and I very quickly become close friends. She had a boyfriend (40M) of 3 years when we met. They broke up pretty soon after we met. After having a good time outside of work on many occasions with her I thought I’d ask her out, unfortunately I asked as her and her bf got back together. She said she was wanting us to stay friends. 

They broke up again and for over a month or two while they were broken up we were getting closer and closer. We were spending almost all day everyday together. Work all day than hanging at her house and mine after work. We would go to events together and plan stuff together. 
We were practically acting like a couple. 
During this time there were a couple of moments where we got more intermit. Cuddling on the couch and later making out in a club together. 
We even organised a dinner party with our friends and she was calling me babe and hun all day while preparing everything. 

Find out through mutual friends she's initiated conversation with her ex and wants to get back with him and she loves him. Through the same friends she has told them she thinks I'm amazing but doesn't see me in that way. 

Interestinly she pretty much tells me everything but rarely speaks about him to me. Also she told our friends he doesn't know about me and it would make things complicated. 

I've grown to really like this girl and can see having a future with her.

I am male.
When I was in grade 12, I met this girl on online chat and then we exchanged numbers and started chatting on WhatsApp. She lived too far from me and I did not have enough money to travel to her. We would chat day and night in the initial phase.. when we got bored.. we used to have phone sex on call or on video.. Our talks are mostly naughty and sexual and the truth is we have never ever met each other in person in these 7 years. She is beautiful and says she loves me and wants to get married to me. In the past we have broken up multiple times just because of the distance but got together because we both get highly horny and she only has me to trust and help her get off. All because of this we are not getting chance of real dating like meeting in person kind of dating.. 
The reason we are not able to meet for this long is because we both cant afford an international plane ticket and I had promised to buy it once I am earning well enough but I dont know when will that day will come and I am not liking it to keep her waiting for this long..

idk what to do in such situation..

It not only provides valuable social experiences, but also allows you to voice your interests and have a chance of moving things forward.

But I have been wondering: is there any alternative to asking someone who I like out on a date/hangout?

Maybe on dating sites I basically have to ask the other person out, but I'm talking about situations in which I see the other person regularly (school, work).

I am asking because I rarely ever asked anyone out in high school, and instead tried as hard as possible to pursue the other person (not a good idea, in hindsight) and keep all the relationship-forming stuff in actual class time when I saw the other person. I thought I could singlehandedly form a relationship entirely on our way out of class, or passing in the hallways, or lunch break, or anytime I could socialize in high school, but none of these attempts resulted in a relationship.

For example, let's say I see a girl in one of my classes. I like her, but I decide not to ask her out. Could I talk to her naturally and casually whenever I see her in the class without asking her out? Would there be a chance of a relationship forming entirely within the context of the class?

So after the call was over she gave me her number without me even asking saying she would love to get to know me and stuff like that. As the days went on she would show obvious signs of interest like she would text me first, use extended letters like for example instead of yes its yesssss, extra emojis, messaging in the middle of the night, etc. And on the 3rd or 4th day of us talking she wanted me to take her to this ramen place in la that i told her about  and on top of that i met her father through call a few days later and made them laugh and i asked her if she would like to go to japan with me. 

As stupid and random as that sounds if your wondering why i asked idk i just did because i was in a good mood and i didnt mean it as a date or anything. but she said that she would love to go with me and we should make it our goal to go together.

Well, since I’ve been at college, I’ve talked to a few different guys. One guy that I’ve talked to seemed to put in the effort in the beginning but has been completely ignoring my messages as of lately. He only hits me up when he’s horny :(

Another guy that I spoke with seemed to be interested in me up until the actual first date happened, to which he distanced himself after it happened. I was confused, depressed, and wondering what I had possibly done wrong for weeks after that happened. I still can’t get over it. 

The other men I talked to seemed to be much older than me and were a bit creepy. The guys my age only seem to be interested in me for sex; it’s an extremely depressing reality.

I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. I think that I’m decently attractive, can make a great conversation, but I can’t seem to find a guy that genuinely wants to be with me. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I see other girls my age being able to find guys that like them so easily, but for some reason, I’m the only one having these problems :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134463,public,self,How do I stop feeling undesirable as an 18 year old woman?,0,[],0.14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rbnvrz/how_do_i_stop_feeling_undesirable_as_an_18_year/,no_ads,0,1638958092.0,,,,,

I (26M) met this girl (25) on Tinder last Friday. I chatted her up and we *really* hit it off. After two days if almost non-stop chatting we decided we’d go for some drinks on Sunday.

Sunday rolled around, she stepped out of the bus and I immediately thought “shit this girl is WAY too pretty lol”. Anyway we went to the location and somehow I was funny enough to make her squirt out wine through her nose three times in a couple of hours.

A friend of mine was at the same place and when the date and when the girl went to pee, the friend came over and said something along the lines of “I think your date is going real well since I can hear you both all across the bar”.

Date finished, dropped her at the bus, told each other how much fun we had a few times and made out.

Textbook successful first date right?

She texted me about two hours after the date and we set up a next one for upcoming Saturday. 

**However**.. texting game on both sides has dropped quite a bit since that Sunday. Especially it has dropped on her side.

I want to say it “doesn’t really matter” since we’ve got a second date coming up and the first one went so well. But I can’t feel but worry about the heavy dip in conversation-making on text.

She texted me yesterday if it’s cool she comes in sweatpants so it’s not completely doomed yet I think…

I overanalyze everything extremely and literally cannot stop thinking about it. It’s now affecting my workouts. I cannot stop checking my phone.

That would be true in an ideal world where we all have our bogeymen resolved, tamed and caged. And I wanted to share my experience in this area beyond a single comment because there is a lot of people dealing with similar issues and the pandemics does not help.

Firstly - no psychological issue should be used as an excuse to hurt people, mistreat them and to behave like a ... I don't wanna get banned again, so let's just say behave badly. It can serve as an explanation, though, and there might be some ""translation"" needed.

Personally, I fight with anxious personality disorder. And I have a huge imagination, which can be a deadly combination. I am constantly working on my therapy, using mainly the approach of the transpersonal psychology, and without any medication I am so far that I can ignore the most of what other people may think of me. I am able to give public speeches, I am excellent in small-talks and I can be very charmant; that is also the reason why people around me would not even consider me having an issue. I have absolutely no problem approaching a man I like.

The problem (and the interesting part) begins though when I start to love them. My mechanisms are suddenly not functioning. My imagination works beyond every limit. On the one hand I imagine we are going to spend the rest of our lives together, all those romantic trips we may have, waking up next to him... and on the other hand I imagine the worst.

Like - he hasn't written me today? Surely he must hate me. Does he seem tired? I am the reason why he wants to go to sleep so early so he does not have to think about me. He didn't kiss me? Surely he wants to break up with me.

And I know it's not true. That is the worst part of it - my reasoning is totally fine, rationally I see no threat, he behaves me nicely, objectively he is consistent, he clearly thinks highly of me, I am the first person he calls when he wants and needs to share something, he trusts me with correcting his English, he suggests future plans for us... And still I live in constant fear that he wants to break up with me. 

That I will make some stupid little mistake and he would get annoyed by that. And that happens even though I know that only a total ... would break up with me. I am totally great in every aspect (not meaning to brag about it but it's just like that). And still I live in such a terrible fear.

So if you have someone like that, just take this extra step and say them you like them, buy them a piece of chocolate, or call them even if you don't feel like it's necessary and you think you do everything right. You are most probably doing everything right, it's just the mind - the feeling part - that works against reality and can make the hell out of every little thing.

Which should not mean that you would have to do that like every ten minutes, I would just like to suggest to spare some extra ten minutes in the evening.

So... I used the perks of the internet anonymity and now I can post it and feel bad about what a piece of emo-stuff have I just produced... :D  And if you have some other psychological issue you would like to comment on, feel free to do so.

I need help with having other people's perspective at my problem. There will be a lot of text, but i will very appreciate anyone who will read it. 

I think that i know most of the things that might make me unattractive for girls.

First, i do not have a behavior that are excepted from men - dominance, taking all the initiative, and especially having a desire to ""win"" the woman, as she would be some kind of a prize, and not a person. I always wanted to build a connection based on equality, mutual interests or just physical attraction instead of performing ""mating rituals"". Also i lack many masculine qualities that are valued in man - strength, power, ambitions. 

Second - I have a problem with communication. That might be because of aspergers - i am not sure since there no way to confirm this diagnosis, but raads test gives 150 score. I am mostly interested in good fiction (usually sci-fi) and writing for video games, and somewhat - music, nature and animals). It's very hard for me to start and keep the conversation with someone who does not share those interests since i have no idea what to say. I never been good at what people call ""small talk"", and also perfer text chat when most people i met want to talk in voice or at least with voice recordings. 

Thrid - i am a homebody, not by choice, but my physical disability causes pain even when i just sit or walk. I can do that, but perfer not to. Also i have no money to use transport for travelling. Luckily, i have a great interest in fictional worlds, so i travel and explore there, keeping myself busy. But a lot of other people are active irl and want to explore the world - and i want them to find a partner with whom they can share this passion, that is why i do not try to establish contact with such people. They won't have fun from life with me. 

Additional thing might be me not having any... i don't know what's the proper term for it in english - traditions, social norms, religions various made-up rules of behavior. In my judgements i use rational thinking and empathy, instead of caring for how to look normal in the eyes of society. I am also not interested in having kids (there is enough poor people in the world) or traditional family where man provides resourses and woman plays the role of some kind of a housekeeping slave. If i would ever be in any kind of relationship, i would want for us both to live our lives as we want to, not as how society says we should. 

I am not sure if all of those things making me undatable. People rarely telling me what is wrong with me so they decide not to answer. Maybe you can tell? 

So what do i want? 

Honestly, even just a hug would be nice. I love cuddling with my cats and always dreamed to do it with real human - just sit there and enjoy each other's warmth, without caring about complicated things. Meeting a girl just to hug and nothing else would be something that i would like to do. 

Having a soulmate would be amazing. Not nessesary for romantic relationship, but that, of course, would make things better. Just a person who has simillar interests, way of life, and enjoys complete honesty, so we will always have things to discuss and maybe do together - like playing games or writing stories for them. 

But if that's not possible, i would want to be at least physically desired. I am not that much ugly (would post a pic but sub not allows personal information), so having such very basic form of intimacy that existed long before we were able to speak would make me feel like an actual human being. Just a pure desire without any social elements. 

But i could never found any of those things. Since i rarely being outside, internet is my only way of connecting with people, and since my country (Ukraine) does not have any kind of forums, etc where people would communicate, dating websites are only thing that remains. 

Common interests is what filters out very fast. Most profiles are just empty, and i have to ask them about interests they have. Most of them never reply. The only person who did that in last few months were only interested in shopping and driving a car, not a thing i enjoy. If i find a profile that seem to have some of those interests, it's usually abandoned and not comes back online. I tried even very specific sites, like dating for childfree or gamers, but there is less than one page of girls per entire country, and all of them are offline for a very long time. 

Also, in 17 years that i spent on such sites i never saw a girl interested in cuddling or sex. At least for free. Every sex offer from a female user here comes with a price, it's an offer of sexual service. I have nothing against that (and actually have sympathy towards girls who do no care for social opinion and using current situation to earn easy money), but i just can't help but lose all interest in person when i understand that that person will not desire me without money (or any other things i might provide). It's probably some kind of psychological issue, but feeling like people would only want me for money makes me feel as a miserable sub-human and i can't do anything about it. I really envy girls and gay men who can be desired so much that people are ready to pay to have sex with them. Another thing i noticed randomly - is that most men leaving comments on girl's pages are offering them money for intimacy, so maybe it's a social norm for my country? 

After not finding anyone i was looking for i started making detailed profiles, listing most of the things i mentioned above, hoping that person that would have same interests or desires would contact me. But that didn't happen as well. 

Then i decided to use foregin services (not to date, because with my 60$ monthly income i have no hope of ever moving away from my city, but just to try talking with people from different places). 

And... i instantly found almost anything i was ever looking for. For example, just on dating\meeting subreddits i saw girls looking for cuddling, looking to watch anime together, girls that into sci-fi and metal music, i saw a girl who only spends her time playing games and watching movies and searching for guy who would be the same. 

Then i went to dirtyr2r and were amazed by what i saw there. Girls openly discussing their kinks and searching for someone who would share them, with possibility of meeting irl. The amount of girls who were into violent stuff kinda shocked me (since i am very opposite of those desires), but there were plenty of offers for my tastes as well. Girl who love cosplay, girl who likes gentle sex, girl who likes walking naked in the nature, even girl in wheelchair who wants  to be pleasured. Just people who want to fufill their desires and openly saying about it - someone i always dreamed of meeting. 

So many of them. But... they are all so far away. I haven't found there a single post from my entire country, let alone city (that are quite small). And in 17 years of searching on local online dating sites NOT A SINGLE time i saw anything of what i saw in those subreddits over a month (and i supose there are a lot more places to meet with people in western internet except for those subs). And i honestly don't understand why. How can it be that girls in my country are so much uninterested in my hobbies, sex, and even just hugs, when girls around the world do? I am not exactly sure yet, maybe problem still lies within me and i am just a mistake of nature that should not have existed, as i always thought, but maybe, just maybe the hellhole i was born in and bound to for entire life plays a part of it? And maybe if i was born somwhere else, i would have at least a chance for human contact? 

I even tried writing my own posts and contacting some of the people in those subs with hope to talk a bit, yet got no responces. Recently i tried asking why, and were explained that girls are getting way too many messages, so they pick the ones that stand out or are from people who are near, so they could meet irl. I don't know how to stand out, but if i was living somewhere near them, i probably would have a chance to get their attention? 

I even was lucky enough to meet a really amazing person from different country. She lives in the forest, and are very tough, yet kind, intelligent, open and understanding. We don't have a lot of common interests, yet somehow it's always nice to speak with her, i am really happy to find such connection. I probably spent more time talking with her than with all other people in my life combined. 

But she already has a guy she is interested in, and even if she didn't, i still would never get any means to move to another country, not to mention that i would not suit her dream about family. So we will be friends. 

And i still want to meet someone in my life that i could toch, at least for a friendly hug, or maybe someone who would have a physical attraction to me. Just to feel the warmth of a human body and geniune affection at least once before i will be gone forever from this world. But i can't see the way how to make it possible with so many obstacles in my way - my place of birth, my broken body and mind... The metaphorical hole in my chest hurts way more than a physical one, i could fill the void with fiction before, but now even it's power are not enough. I was advised by my doctor to start taking anti-depressants, and i am doing that for a month, but i do not see any visible result yet. Void still consumes everything, even my will to wake up. Right now i live only because i don't want to abandon my cats. Maybe that's how it's suposed to be? Evolution getting rid of it's mistake. 

The last, but not least of my problem is aging. My body becomes weaker and weaker, i already doubt that i will be able to perform active role in sex for long, and it will become only worse as time goes on. And for me there is not much point in trying sex if i can't also satisfy my partner - if i wanted pleasure only for myself, i would stick to masturbation instead. Also i am not even sure if i will live past 40 with my health issues. Or if i will want to. 

Another age-related problem is finding the common ground with people of my age. They usually have very different life, problems and goals than me. I am not sure why they would want a teenager locked in a 33yo body, if they could chose an actual teenager with young and healthy body instead. Also girls in this age are probably already tried everything and looking for expirienced partner, and not the guy who has no idea even how to kiss. 

And it becomes even worse, because recently i noticed another psychological issue i have. Since i do not feel my age, i have problem with relating to people of my age physically. It feels like just yesterday i was dreaming about first kiss with cute classmate, but now i should dream about doing it with someone who looks like a milf to me? How does that work for other people? I have a guess that people need to age together so the attraction will shift (i figured that out because i did not notice how much my cats aged before looking at old pictures), but i am not sure. I totally understand that my current body will probably not be attractive to 20yo, for example, and since i know that age gap matters to many people i mostly try writing to someone around my age, and luckily some people my age are still looking very hot to me, but... 3-7 more years and even that will be gone. Woman in my country age early, and there is hardly a difference between 40 and 60y. Soon i will become even more old and unattractive as well, and will lose a last chance to attract physically someone that i find attractive as well. 

Is there anything i can do? It seems like i tried everything already, but maybe there is something i missed? Maybe i was just unlucky to be born in a wrong place, with wrong body or\and mind, gender or sexual orientation, and nothing can be done about it? Or maybe i am just a terrible human who deserves all of this. I can't know, because no villain in history ever realized that he was a villain. So i need other people to look at my life and say what they thing.

I’m not sure how to make heads or tails on this one. I met a girl online last week and we had our first date this past Saturday. From what I felt the first date went well, we share a lot of similar beliefs and had a great fluent conversation. We ended things on a hug and when I told her let’s do this again sometime she said definitely. 

A couple of hours later, she texted me to make sure I got home alright and we continue to text late into the evening joking around about getting lost traveling the world together. She says for the next date she would drive closer to me as I had a bit of a commute for the first date. At this point, I felt confident that she enjoyed the first date enough to want to see me again. 

The next day we continue to text and I bring up an idea for a second date and she still seems very interested saying that we should definitely meet up again. We continue to make some small talk as the day goes on and by the evening I sent a text to her and never heard back. 

I’m at the 48 hour mark now of no response and I’m not sure if she got busy or lost interest. I know her work schedule is fairly demanding during the week, as she told me her schedule when we were on our first date. 

My initial thought would be is if she was interested enough she would find the time to reach out to me regardless of her schedule. Our last conversation we talked about the gym and our families, nothing that really would’ve sent her any mixed messages. 

What I can’t deny is that I felt potential with this girl and would hate to just give up on her. At the same time, I don’t want to come across as desperate by any means.
