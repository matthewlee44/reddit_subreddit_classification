It's been about a year since I've started working at my job but I've only been having convos with him for the past few months. When the day is slow, I'll visit other departments and socialize, his department happens to be one of them. I'm very quiet and shy but even he admitted recently that I'm starting to open up. Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person. He even commented that my parents did a good job raising me.

After a few dates, he told me his mood changed to the better and felt more calmer ever since meeting me and he told me his wife noticed he was happier.

Now, we're friendly enough, and it's not saying much, but we were the most committed dancers in that little piece of the venue. No touching or sexy moves btw, just jamming out. But without fail, each of these girls had come there with a guy who would join after about 10 seconds and physically separate them back to the group (dance between us facing only her, etc).

I don't want to make too many assumptions, but it became obvious after like the 5th time that there was a gender dynamic at play here.

To the guys, cut it out! Don't be controlling of your partner; I'm like 99% sure my bro and I aren't so attractive that your girls would encourage any moves if they were already with ya and either of us made any. And if they did encourage those moves, why would you want to stay with them anyway? Relax and have a good time! We probably would've all walked away friends if you did.

To the girls... If you came with a partner, be mindful of their feelings. I know it's sometimes hard to believe, but guys have them too hehe. If you haven't had an explicit talk about boundaries, tread lightly until you do. I doubt any of these dudes felt too great about what happened given they felt the need to intervene like that.

We hung out a lot the first month before he left in the end of September to go back to where he lives to finish clinicals. Before he left we‚Äôd been seeing each other for about 7 wks. We talked about us and he kept telling me to go on dates so that I can ‚Äúexplore what I like vs don‚Äôt like‚Äù. I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested but he kept pushing. It made me feel uncomfortable, so I began to think he wasn‚Äôt interested. Decided to catch up and hang out with an old friend (guy #2) who considered it a date which okay fair. I told the other guy(guy #1) about it cause he asked if I was dating around and I will be honest. Honestly, I feel nothing for guy #2 and really wanted it to work with guy #1 so after 3 times of seeing guy #2 I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested. Cause it wasn‚Äôt fair to him when all I can think about is guy #1. We‚Äôll fast forward to December, me and guy #1 get back from a trip and he tells me that his last gf cheated on him a few times while he was in med school. I felt soooo bad and realized maybe that‚Äôs why he was so pushy with me dating :/ now I feel really guilty for previously hanging out with another guy back in September (nothing happened between us tho as I wasn‚Äôt really interested in him :/) Should I feel this way or  I overreacting? Also he told me him and his ex gf still talk here and there bc they have a dog they got together and she occasionally checks in on his apartment when he‚Äôs away (he lives in another state than me, we met while he was doing clinical rotations). I found this kind of strange.. but she‚Äôs currently engaged to someone. Also me and guy #1 aren‚Äôt officially dating or I guess exclusive either.. and it‚Äôs been 6 months. I really like him but when I talk to him about dating he wants to see where things go and that he‚Äôs just not ready to date me or anyone even though we already act like a couple. I really really like him but getting some weird vibe. I feel like by now we should be dating. Any advice or anything would be really great ü•∫

Every new year I think, ""it's all good, this will be the year!,"" but it never happens. I'm fine with continuing to be patient, but having a family one day is a top priority of mine (if not the top priority of mine), so please do let me know if you all would suggest that I do anything that I'm not currently.

**DETAILS:**

* I'm pretty friendly/talkative, but it takes a lot for me to be attracted to a potential partner. It doesn't happen often. I can recall only a handful of times over the past 10 years or so where I have been (a couple times in high school, once in college, once at my first job out of college, and once now to my 42 FM friend who is married so I would never attempt to act on those feelings).
* There were a couple of times/opportunities to date in high school but I was too nervous. I left college early to begin working, so one clear opportunity there got short-circuited. For 5 years I worked in a very small company with folks who were 50+ and did little outside of work to meet others. Right before that job, I worked somewhere else with more folks my age. I was in what I considered to be the early stages of a relationship with someone until the job (a political campaign) ended out of nowhere and we all moved back to our regular homes.

**CURRENT POTENTIAL PLATFORMS TO MEET PEOPLE:**

* Since last January (a full year), I go to the gym (CrossFit) every day. I don't do this as a mechanism to meet new people but it's an avenue.
* Dating apps (Bumble, Hinge). I've gone on a few dates but I haven't had  much luck with these apps. I rarely (if ever) feel attracted to someone just from looking at their profile. Most of the profiles seem rather cookie cutter to me; I'm not into the usual drinking type scene that people in their mid 20s typically are and I don't normally feel attracted to someone just by looking at pictures of them in bikinis and such. And I don't get a ton of swipe-backs to boot.

**WHY I REALLY WANT TO FINALLY FIND SOMEONE NOW:**

* It's just time!
* I have feelings for my 42 FM friend, the mother of my 5 year-old godson, who I have known for 5-6 years. She is married. She is having marriage problems now because her husband is controlling and an overall bad person; nevertheless, she is married and I would never even think about doing anything there. But since it's so rare for me to be attracted to someone, I find myself thinking of her very often/predicting when she'll call/text, etc. I know this isn't healthy and I know the only way I can break these intrusive thoughts  in my head is if I find someone else that I can actually potentially start a relationship with.

**ABOUT ME:**

* 27M
* Live in a big city
* Friendly/talkative, the guy that everyone tends to know at the gym; got the ""everyone's friend"" superlative in high school
* Short (5'5), in shape/work out every day
* Do well professionally/financially (but no one knows that, I wear cheap clothes/drive a beater car and don't show it off in any way, shape, or form, and don't intend to)

**QUESTIONS:** 

* I thought about trying EHarmony/Match as I believe those apps are more personality driven than the Bumble/Hinges of the world, but I've heard they're a waste of time now. If you think differently, please let me know.
* Any other thoughts you may have are appreciated.

I made various efforts, followed all advices I received, I tried everything I possibly could, I even made a large investment, but the result is, I never even had a chance to have sex in my life

The advices I received are

Go Talk To Her / Be Confident / Try Online Dating / Join Clubs / Be Patient and Positive / Pay For Sex

I tried cold approach, even if I heard multiple times that cold approach is futile 99.9% of the time

If you try cold approach, women will simply say "" I have a boyfriend "" and quickly walk away, which is a quick easy way to make the man stop hitting on her, 

or give a very spiteful rejection

An example of a painful rejection - here it goes

Guy : "" Hi my name is....""

Girl : "" GT FO you disgusting animal you have 3 seconds before I call cops on you ""

**PROOF** https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mxKH3fn

The next advice "" Just Be Confident ""

How can you be confident if girls tell you to fxck off even before you finish the sentence "" Hi my name is...."" My confidence was shattered years ago

And if that was not cruel enough, in Toronto, women walk away as soon as they see a man approaching where they are

I went to a bus stop because that is where my bus was coming

There was a young woman, and when she saw me walking towards the bus stop, she walked away.

I did not have any micro intention to talk to her.  She looked in her early 20s ( too many years of age gap )  I had nothing to say to a woman I didn't have any information about, and if I had any question, I could always use my phone.

A few minutes later the bus arrived, and inside the bus, I saw the young woman who walked away

It broke my heart.  It made me realize women will feel upset even before I say a word, and they won't even let me be near her.  Women won't even let me say a word.

I talked about it and other men told me

""I notice similar patterns but that is what it is, Toronto is a big city and women often suffer inappropriate advances and harrassment""

Women told me

""Better safe than sorry""

""We are not mind readers""

""We would rather hurt men's feelings than suffer any negative experiences""

How can I gain a lover if women won't even let me say a word?

Next advice - Try Online Dating 

Two friends repeatedly told me to try online dating

I finally followed their advice, I spent hours and hours to polish my Tinder profile, I also asked others to view and fix my profile

I spent a large amount of money to upgrade my membership

I sent a like to about 70% but I never ever received any like back

I googled and read, ""Don't be picky"" 

I sent a like to 90% of all women ( if I send a like to 100% I will be penalized ) I still never ever received a like back

The dating app finally told me, "" No more available users in your area "" 

I asked on Reddit "" Why am I not getting any like back?"" and a girl told me she received 30 likes even before she completed her profile

And I remember sending a like to a girl who said in her profile

"" If I am slow to respond my apologies, I have 2000 likes from men ""

Next Advice - "" Join clubs in your area ""

Well all gatherings have been notified to stop in my area because of the pandemic

"" Be patient and Positive""

I was patient and positive for the past 4 decades.  I honestly believed, if I am patient and positive, I will have my share of happiness.  And here I am still a virgin after 4 decades

"" Pay For Sex ""

I was like ok and kept texting him, but conversation was rusty (from his side). So in the end he says he's not looking for anything more than this blah blah. I said ok is fine no worries (but secretly I was fed up because I deleted his number).

At NYE I was at his/my friend's house and he only got there after 12. I was just acting normal since he said he was not interested anyway. He ran into me on the dance floor and went to apologize again for being arrogant and insecure blah blah.

He said is alright. BUT I noticed he was quite drunk. So idk if he meant it, plus his friend group was also there, and maybe he wanted to impress them??

My question is, should I wait for him to message me and otherwise send him a DM via Instagram for some clarity/ask my friend for his number. Or wait for him to text and if not just let it go because he has too many issues?

He was just out of a long relationship he'd been in pretty much his entire adult life so we agreed casual only from the outset. We got really close really quickly, talked every single day for hours about pretty much everything. He'd never done FWB before and only had LTRs so he brought quite a caring/boyfriend-y energy to the arrangement, which I encouraged against my better judgement. Looking back it was pretty intense, but this was the first time in a long time that someone I was seeing was matching my energy and it felt really good. 

We spent a whole weekend together and afterwards I realised I was in pretty deep and had to come clean before it got worse.

He said he respected me for being honest but that he's still going through shit and can't date right now, which I knew. He said he cares about me, that he really valued our time together and that being with me was really easy and comfortable. I have a tendency to be a little intense with dating so I was worried I'd freaked him out, but he said he was happy to still text if I felt able to. After some back and forth I decided we needed a clean break, so we're no contact at the moment.

It was really shitty because we were both having a great time and didn't really wanna stop. It's not like anything I've had before where one person lost interest. I know I made the right decision out of self preservation, but it hurts more knowing I willingly gave up an amazing person. If I'd kept my mouth shut we'd still be seeing each other. 

We left it that we might catch up in a couple of months, just to talk, but I don't have any expectation that he will reach out first, or that anything will have changed.

Now in 2022, huge butts and an hour-glass figure are what's ""in."" 

Before any of us were even alive, women who were overweight were considered the most attractive, because it signified they had wealth and could afford to eat a decent amount. 

My point is, people on Reddit constantly say they simply can't ""help"" who they're attracted to. While I think this can be true to a certain extent, the ""standard"" of beauty is constantly changing, and to think we're not influenced by culture is naive at best. 

I'm not saying you have to pursue someone you're physically repulsed by, but social media has given many people the illusion of an abundance of options (or even ""perception of options""). When you're a man/woman and you constantly see the ""upper echelon"" of attractive people of your opposite sex, you begin to develop an appetite for a certain type of ""look"" that truthfully only a small % are.

This doesn't just apply to women either. Men on here will constantly tell me they find most women attractive, then when I tell them the average woman in the US is 5'4 and 170lbs, they don't believe me. This is because often, for both men and women, people they're not attracted to are not registering on their radar. And while the US has a significant obesity problem (for both men and women) and I'm not saying you must be attracted to the ""average person"" here, having the 'ideal' body type in the US is around 5% of both men/women.

If you want that 5% (or 10%, or whatever...) that's fine. Do the work required to be attractive to that small pool of people. But realize it's not that ""nobody"" finds you attractive.

On top of that, I think if people actually got what they wanted, they'd often realize they didn't even want it that bad in the first place. Our hedonistic culture now prioritizes instant gratification, lust, and the tingles‚Ñ¢ over delayed gratification, love, and sustainability. 

These thoughts have been on my mind so wanted to vocalize them, even though I know some % are going to misinterpret this to think I'm saying to bang people you find ugly. That's not what I'm saying. But you'd be surprised how many more people you actually could find sexy if you gave more people a chance.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1145261,public,self,"Culture influences our perception of who we find ""attractive"" more than we realize.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruegun/culture_influences_our_perception_of_who_we_find/,no_ads,0.0,,,

We've been on three dates. He texts me every day, and on Monday while he was still out of state he asked me if I wanted to go out on Friday. We had talked about it several times since then but didn't have any real plans in place. He asked me if I wanted to go out Thursday night too, so we did, and that was our third date. Friday comes around and we're talking all day once again, and he lets me know his friend wants to go have dinner and he feels like keeping it low-key because he thinks I'm in more of a party mood than him (this makes no sense because I let him know several times I'm down to do anything.... we were going to go sit on the beach. that's pretty low-key already). I tried to give him an out when he said this because it seemed like he didn't want to go anymore - I'm like ""If you're not up for it tonight then I understand!!"" he responds with ""Noo I do want to hang out, I just feel like keeping it low-key tonight. Maybe I'll Uber to wherever you are after dinner with my friend"".

I'm thinking his """"""friend"""""" that hes going to dinner with is probably another girl he met and he was just keeping me on the back burner in case his better plan fell through.

So, the whole night goes by. I'm hanging out with coworkers. Don't hear anything from him whatsoever.

The day after NYE I text him saying ""You blew me off on NYE :/ not cool""

He apologizes several times for being an asshole.... says he wasn't feeling well and he's not sure if he's sick or just hasn't been sleeping enough because he has been working so much.... I'm thinking ""ehhh I'm not buying it."" He says he knows he looks like an asshole right now and I'm like ""Yes, you do""

He clarifies that he does like me and he should've communicated what was going on and he didn't mean to let me down blah blah blah.

I didn't say much and he kept apologizing and explaining himself.

I'm convinced that he just made other plans and totally blew me off. Idk what to think. I'm sad because I really liked him and we make eachother laugh a lot.

Another fuck up I did, was when she approached me, she asked if I want to come back to hers spoon and just be intimate. I said sure, as long as there is no strings attached. Low and behold 2 mins into spooning I was giving head and we had sex.

It‚Äôs been 5 days since we had the ONS, we have kept in contact over text but it was very formal like she asked if she could come to drop off my tee shirt I left at hers, to which I said wait until we are training again (we go to the same club). 

Since I‚Äôm new to wanting a relationship, how do I show I‚Äôm interested in her. I‚Äôm not one to text just to text, I prefer to have a reason. Also, I want to squash this impression I left which is I‚Äôm a player and not looking for anything serious. Also, I don‚Äôt want to go on a date just yet. I‚Äôd rather do a group activity, like house party we are both apart of, or meet at a bar with others. Just get to know her while enjoying the atmosphere with mutual friends.

I could quite easily organise something, but in the meantime over text. How do I peak her interest, baring in mind we‚Äôve already broken the physical barrier.

I am male 30/yo

Last year I dated 3 times and all of those relationships were a mess

First: Independent academics women, who used to do drugs (pot) I use occasionally but this girl did it daily!, had no ambitions in life only showed up clean and ready on the first date, the other where like she didn't care at all, said she wanted to compromise with me 3 weeks into dating, I said that it seems a little bit rushed and she freaked the hell out screamed at the bar we were at: IF THIS ISN'T FOR REAL THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING!! she broke with me and tried to call me back but I blocked her from all media.

Second: Pretty successful woman but she frequently canceled me at the last minute, and called me after telling me: ""well it's not like you have other plans though"" , 4 weeks into dating she told me that she was feeling in love like those of those Korean dramas, when I spoke about how I felt that I was feeling used by her and she not being serious when setting a date with me she told me to man up and act like a real men, ended her by text that night.

Third and the worse: Women had her own business which used to commit academic fraud by doing the homework of college and uni students who had much money or didn‚Äôt had the money to do so, she lives alone with her dog (a golden retriever) in a mini studio, dog hair everywhere, seems like she threated the dog well until a date in the park where she kicked and lost the shit with her dog when it chewed some bubblegum on the floor, secondly she had a really weird idea of compromise like 4 weeks into dating she told me I was only from hers and that in three months we should be living together because that's how you really met a partner, ended her by text when she sent me fliers of high schools for our future kids to attend to, I was like WTF??

TLDR: Dated 3 women who were rushed into compromise and acted immature and a bit of crazy too.

When I told this story to my coworker, she said this:

""Well, you attract what you are, don't you?""

I can't stop thinking about this as if there is something wrong with me or just bad luck, met these girls in dating apps and now I am afraid to use them again.

I (25M) became single after my 5yr relationship ended in August. Since then I‚Äôve been engaging in casual things here and there and exploring sexually, which is something I‚Äôve never been able to do before as my ex was my first sexual partner. I‚Äôve been consciously avoiding getting into anything serious. One of the reasons for this is my poor mental health; I had a bit of a breakdown around a month before I decided I should be alone, and I went back to seeing a counsellor and had my antidepressants increased.

So, last month I was nominated for an award in my field (yay me tysm), and as the scene I work in is so close-knit I knew 2/3 of the other nominees. The only one I didn‚Äôt know personally (24F) followed me on Instagram after the nominees were announced. We had some basic friendly interactions on there, and I realised that aside from her being massively talented, I found her really attractive too. One of my best pals (25F) has been joking with me since I‚Äôve been single that I should loosen up and basically play the field, which I‚Äôve been doing and having a lot of fun with. So, I jokingly said to her that I was going to *put the moves* on this girl, which I didn‚Äôt think I actually would seeing as I‚Äôd mostly been experimenting with people that I didn‚Äôt know already.

So, FF to the awards ceremony, I meet her and she‚Äôs super nice and we chat for a little bit between the awards, but the ceremony was quite overwhelming and I decided to stick with people that I already knew. Everyone ended up at a bar for the after party and I ended up hooking up with an old friend.

A while after the ceremony we started chatting on Instagram (I‚Äôm not sure who initiated) and the conversation kept going. We were literally chatting pretty much incessantly every day. One of the first things she asked was whether I lived with my girlfriend/wife, which I took as her trying to gauge if I was single, and I decided that she must be keen. So we made plans to meet up over Christmas, which I was really excited about. 

So, we saw each other last week for drinks, and it was great. We chatted for hours and I really had a good time and so did she. It definitely felt like we clicked and that we had lots in common, and there were no awkward silences or anything like that. I walked her home and we had a bit of a kiss before I left. We were texting immediately after about what a nice time it was and we decided to meet up again the morning after, as she was going back to her home city (2hrs away). We had coffee the next morning and again, great time was had by all. Again afterwards we were texting and we made plans for me to visit her on the 2nd. It seemed to be going so well and it felt as though we were on the same page. 

So, I get a text from her on the 1st saying that she had to cancel our plans as she was going to spend some more time with her friends before they went home again - I said that was totally fine and that I‚Äôd be pretty free to visit for a while yet. Then I follow up to say that I don‚Äôt want to come across to ‚Äòcool‚Äô about it, and that I am really keen and excited to see her again.

Then she texts me saying thanks for the nice message but she isn‚Äôt ready to be dating somebody. I was shocked and totally bummed. I told her that I understood and that I had thought I‚Äôd be the same having just come out of a relationship, but I was having a really nice time and trying not to have expectations or to put too much pressure on things. After that she thanked me for being so understanding and said she‚Äôs sure she‚Äôll see me around and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since. It was really weird because in those last interactions she seemed almost cold or as if she was holding something back. 

I feel totally sad about it, and I spent most of the day in bed yesterday feeling empty. This is weird because is not as though we were together or anything; we had two dates over two days. So why do I feel like I‚Äôve just been dumped? I‚Äôve experienced some rejections while I‚Äôve been single but none have them have affected me at all. 

I feel like I want to reach out to her again and ask some questions but I don‚Äôt know if any good will come of that.
