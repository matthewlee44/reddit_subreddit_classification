0,rz2k54,1641656386,Good person with rough past or a manipulator?,"So, I have posted this yesterday and was told to make more paragraphs and give more examples so everything is clear.
(22M) started texting this (21F) a year ago, texted for 4 months then decided it was best to break things off since I was going to another country because of work and she did not want to. 
While we were texting, it just felt perfect, learned everything about each other in a matter of months, just had a connection, we opened up to each other almost completely.
As things went on, she started getting less interested in me and things I like to talk about, which are history, deep subjects etc, which I do understand, she might not just care about such topics. 
But she mostly talked about herself, somehow every subject we talked about was mostly about her life or some side topic we both like talking about, for example animals, marketing etc, even we I tried talking about my day, my life, plans etc, she brushed it off after 1 or 2 sentences, while if she said ""I am going to get some wood for a fire"" I made the effort to find 10 questions about that sentence and keep chat going.
 My point is, she seemed to stop caring about my life and had not invested as much as effort in chat as I did.
 Felt like I was just someone she can talk to to spend her time, who would always be there for her, send her cute messages, ask her about her day, be romantic, go out of my way to please her, etc, while she did not do such things. 
Was just not getting back what I invested. Now, she knew that, because we spoke about it many times, and she does change it for a few days but eventually goes back to her old self. 
Thing that is bothering me, she can really sometimes be awful, and she knows it. But then again, rarely, she cries in my arms for hours, saying how she doesn't deserve me ( she went out mostly with deadbeats before me ) how I am too good to her and for her, that I should leave, because she is aware she is such a person, but just ""can't control it"", and that she does not know what she would do or what kind of person would she end up with if it wasn't for me. Now, this bothers me because if she does understand her issues, why does she not work on them?
I feel torn apart, I do believe she is deep down a good person, she went through a lot, poverty, physical abuse, alcohol abuse in high school, isolation from her friends as a result.. 
I am now trying hard to make her stop drinking, and I do see some results in that, she did start working out but quit after a week. 
To end this, I am not sure is she a bad, manipulative person, or just a sad person with rough past who has a good heart and needs love and guidance to become who I believe she really is when she opens up and is emotional?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rz2k54/good_person_with_rough_past_or_a_manipulator/

I’ve come to realize that basically every single one of my friends or basically every woman I know has been cheated on by their spouses. It’s gotten me thinking of how logically this is possible  (literally every woman I know) and whether this is just something that everyone eventually has to deal with. So for those who have cheated on their spouses, help me understand: were you happy with your spouse when you cheated? Did you genuinely love and respect them if you cheated? Was it just a one time thing?

He is a drug addict that tries to stay sober but gets mean when he is wanting the drug. Some days, everything is wonderful and I see the man that I fell in love with. And then others, all I get is the man that calls me names, tears me down and makes me feel like I am nothing. I know I am better than this and deserve better, but I can’t make myself leave. Before you guys tell me to just let go, let me tell you how stupid I am. He was arrested a few weeks ago for something that happened a couple of years ago. Of course I come to the rescue as I always do. I bonded him out and co-signed on the bond. It’s for $30k. He has some issues with mental illness and has threatened to kill himself multiple times. If I leave, he will have nothing. He will go on a drug bender and then kill Himself. How am I supposed to deal with that. Not only will I be responsible for that, he will be gone and on top of that, I will have to pay the bail too. Today is one of the bad days. We both are home sick with Covid. He wants to go out with his friends tonight and I told him no bc he doesn’t need to expose anyone. Now I am several choice words that doesn’t care about him and what he wants and he wants to take everything from me and leave. He wants to leave me with nothing.

5,rz2x4r,1641657384,Just some advice,"Hi
I am 22(F). I have always been single, never been on a date, never kissed anyone. I am not someone who is into casual stuff just for the sake of it or just to pass time. I long for a real connection. I even got it (or atleast I think so). I wouldn't say it was love but it was a lot like it. The guy also lead me on but he is such a mystery that I could never guess. We only talked a few times in a span of 6 months and while I knew nothing would happen, my feelings kept growing. We also didn't meet because of the pandemic and lack of an effort from his end. This was really the first time ever I confessed that I liked him (in 2020). He also said it (not just once). He is such a sweet person that I can't even hate him. I didn't talk to him since last 10-11 months. Now I feel like that these feelings have caused so much pain that I should let it go because one thing is for sure that he could have my heart man. But he is just an ignorant guy (still don't blame him). 
It also made me realise that I am capable of feeling this way for someone. And now I want to step out. I am not for online dating or blind dates. Fyi i am an extrovert just don't know anything about dating. I want some real connection. I am moving to Europe and would love to know how can I be more out going and be out there and make a move when I like someone.
I don't know but it's just I feel that I would really like to be someone and be loved.
I might sound weird and this might just look like I am venting out. But just looking for advice on how to start.

6,rz367u,1641658029,Do you believe the chances of online dating success is slim for a young bald guy?,"To keep it short I started balding at 16 and have just recently (23) shaved it all off.

If he did, should girl offer to pay him back? 2) Should the girl initiate the hug at the beginning of the first date? 3) What topics should we talk about or avoid? 4) At the end of first date, should girl say “Call Me” or trust that he will call? 5) Do guys like full face of makeup more or the confident natural makeup look?

11,rz3rsi,1641659655,I (M23) am hopelessly infatuated with a 27 year old 10/10. She text's me every day and keeps inviting me over. She also has a boyfriend.,"Honestly I have no idea what is happening right now. We go to trade school together and around 4 weeks ago we started chatting a bit and i invited her several times to sit on a bench and smoke a joint after school. It was always very chill and we can talk without a single pause for hours on end. Lots and lots of laughs. She also started texting me pretty much every single day, telling me what she does but also asking me how and what I'm doing.
3 days ago she spontaneously invited me over  in the middle of the day to get drunk and so we did. We watched some Youtube/ Netflix and sat around on her couch, it mostly ran in the background though. We talked and laughed hard (got pretty blitzed) and after like 5 hours she had to go to work and I left. Yesterday we did pretty much the same thing again. (Oh and it's not like we're getting wasted on beer, she just keeps popping serious champagne bottles)


I don't particularly like the word ""chemistry"" but it really applies here, it genuinely feels just so good to be with her. We share enough to have common ground, but her life is also so full of interesting stories that it doesn't get mundane, ever. I feel like the luckiest guy on earth just being next to her. The fact that she looks like a complete supermodel, body and face is just the cherry on top.

Now here comes the catch: Without inflating my ego too much, I know from a lot of people that keep telling me this, I am genuinenly funny. I can make people laugh easily and am very empathetic. I am able to listen for hours if you just talk about your life and struggles and I will remember all of it. People open up about themselves to me VERY quickly after they get to know me just a little bit. Why do I mention all this?

I just think she likes to hang around with me because she likes me as somebody to be around and not much else. She already briefly mentioned that she doesn't think her current relationship will last much longer, but from what I understood all her boyfriends are tall, lanky blonde guys, all older than her. Meanwhile I'm currently in the process of moving out and don't have much to show. She likes the music and art i make so thats cool but how on earth am i going to compete with good looking DJs in their early 30s with some serious money. I am below average in size, shave my head and am definitely too hairy and broad to fit her type.

I guess all of this was more for me than anybody that would read this, but still: Should I just give up? Because if I open up to her and this doesn't work out i will be forced to still see her every day. I feel like I already very well know what stance she has on me, I just feel like complete shit getting all this attention from her knowing nothing will come off it.

13,rz3uvf,1641659903,An ‘FWB’ might like me too much,"So, interesting one here. 

I’m a 20M, and this girl likes me, and I mean REALLY likes me. She’s decent looking, but I’m not attracted to her. Maybe because she’s so clingy, I don’t know. I don’t want to speak down on her or anything, she’s a lovely girl. 

However, I personally think that she wants a relationship with me. From some of the Snapchat stories she posts directed at me, wanting to go on dates and just wanting to talk to me like every day, that’s what I gather. 

Now I move around a lot these days, from city to city, country to country for business and pleasure. I don’t stay here often, so I won’t give her a relationship. I don’t think I would want to anyway. 

Moving on, she told me recently that she wants to be FWB, and I was like okay, if that’s what you want. I was hoping that I could drift away from her a bit, message maybe once or twice a week, or even just message when we have a day we want to meet up. I guess I was hoping for no strings attached, but now she’s talking about going out again. 

I don’t know what to do here. I want to spend less time texting, no dates or maybe just occasionally and no strings attached. If not, then I don’t even care about the sex, I’d be okay with breaking it off entirely. 

I want this year to be a year of self improvement, getting businesses off the ground and what not.

A fair number of people seem just to not engage on dates anymore.

Met someone on a dating site.

We went to a local dive for dinner.

I had studied her dating profile for her interest and researched some facts about her hobbies. So when she talked about herself , I could actually add to the conversation.

We get there and she just seems completely disinterested and cold.

She did goodish online , chatting. 

We get to the table and we are both staring at each other.

I asked "" what are you gonna order?"". "" Eh idk"".

I am a person, when I get nervous I babble.

So I am throwing every conversation I can at her.

"" Ah""

""Ok""

"" cool ""

""Yep""

By this time, I am thinking "" Ok she is hoping I choke on my spaghetti, so she as a reason to leave"". Not woman thinks I am as great, as my mommy does.  I am a big boy, I will rally. 

We basically sit there staring at each other. I just wait for the clock to run out.

We walked back to our cars. I said something like "" thank you for coming.""  She kind of nodded and smiled. She sort of just turned and went to her car.

I was thinking "" I bombed that like Hiromasa"".  

Got a text "" I had a great time , we should do it again. "" 

In my head : THAT WAS FUN FOR YOU! I DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT TIME. ARE YOU INSANE.

I just never texted her back.

Comes over and it escalated to her like getting on top of me aggressively making out and etc I'll leave out the details. I didn't progress cause I stipulated and didn't want to go against my word. 


But over Christmas break she gets super distance almost instantly, I sort of try to engage by any attempt is shut down. Eventually I just say ""what's up I thought we had a good start"" and she explains she didn't feel a romantic spark. 


Not sure if this is enough information? But I'm fairly new to this and it was probably the best start to any *relationship* I've had (yeah longest relationship was two dates). 


Idk I'm just confused. Her advances were really strong, I'm in stupid good shape honestly (8+ years lifting experience), I'm short but still.

We went to a bingo club thing where you can dance on the tables and play bingo but mostly just music and drinking! It was a really fun night with everyone and the girl and I were hitting it off, started dancing together and then towards the end, we kissed and were dancing up against each other, cuddling and all that jazz. We then left to go onto another place and her and I were walking in front of the rest of the group and ended up unintentionally losing them before meeting up with some of her work friends at the next place. 

We continued the night in a quieter bar having fun with her work friends and stuff (we played darts and they put my name down as ""*girls name's* bf"" which was funny) and we again were sitting together, cuddling, kissing, holding hands and what not. We then left that place, grabbed some McDonald's before I suggested she come back to my place which she agreed to. 

Obviously up until this point I'm thinking this is going great, we get on and are obviously into each other and she's back at my place drunk so sex is on the table.

Come back out and she's like half sleeping so I say, go brush your teeth and whatever then you can get into bed as it's more comfortable (I'm now not expecting sex since she's clearly tired and still drunk which is fine!) which she does but as she's cold, she gets into bed with her jeans, socks and everything so I suggest getting into a pair of my more comfortable joggers etc. But she said she was fine. She lays down facing me and I kiss her and put my arm over her but she's not like holding me back. It's 3.30am at this point so I think okay fine, let's sleep and then I'll see how she is in the morning. 5.30am she wakes me up, grabs her phone and books a cab to get home coz apparently she had to go and help her sister move some stuff into her place (I'm certain she said to the group earlier in the night she had no plans the next day) so she gets her shoes on and kisses me goodbye and leaves! I didn't even get her number coz I thought I'd get it in the morning and obviously didn't need it when I was with her! 

Anyway, as she's a friend of a friend I found her on Instagram and have sent her a little message saying I hope she's okay bla bla but yea, I'm not sure what happened? It was going perfectly for a solid 7 hours and then it just seemed the script flipped!

As we were leaving, he said he’d be happy to meet up again if I wanted, but we didn’t make any plans - he said something about texting me an article he was talking about and I planned in any case just to send a polite thank you later on so I thought I’d see if he asked to see me again. He sent me the article but said nothing more about another date so I wonder if he’s leaving the ball in my court. 

I’m unsure what to do.

She has expressed that she is very into me and how she wants me to be her date for some upcoming events.

A couple of days back she went skiing with a male “friend” and today posted an IG story out to eat with the guy mentioning the ski trip.

Is it my place to ask about him? I tend to really overthink things but I don’t know if I’m getting played. Doesn’t help that the guy is very good looking. I did asked her during our talk about being exclusive if she was seeing other dudes, and she said that she wasn’t. Plus I think she would have to be really stupid to openly post that she is with another guy on social media.  

We are going on a date tonight.  I was planning on lighting probing (i.e., ""How was the trip? Who did you go with again?  ""How did you know him?"") about it and if she acts weird I think I know my answer.  I feel like really questioning her about it might make her think I have trust issues.

We work together, so I have been careful about asking her to hang out until I knew it was time so I didn't put her in an awkward position. 

Conversations in person and text/calls are great. She says she has alot of trust in me, she appreciates my understanding of her, and she even said the other day that talking to me was ""her favorite thing.""

I felt the time was right to make a move but on the day that I felt it was time to ask, she mentioned that she went to hang out with another guy from work last night. The two of them and another couple (who also work with us) went out for drinks. Nothing special. Sounds like a casual work outing but with a definite double date kind of insinuation

Now, I'm 100% convinced they are just good friends. She has told me as much, as well as the fact that she is very single. 

But just to be sure, before I escalate the relationship and ask her on a date or to hang, would it be a terrible idea to maybe ask some mutual friends if they are ""talking"" or interested in each other? I'm not really trying to mess anything up with her, purely from a friend perspective and definitely not trying to appear like I am trying to compete with someone else for a girl. If they got a thing going on, I'd back off respectfully. I'd rather focus on someone who has their full attention on me 

But I also fear it may weaken my position if I ask around and it gets back to her.

Okay but seriously, I [M19] completely put off dating in high school and even up to now in college (I’m a sophomore). It’s not that I didn’t have any interest in any girls, and I know I’m not gay or ace or anything, and I often fantasized about having a loving relationship. For the longest time though, I never thought of myself as being a good boyfriend. I know that I have a bad attention span, and I’m apathetic, so I could always see myself dating a girl but then neglecting her, then she leaves me (which she would be right to do in that scenario). 

Another thing is that whenever someone brings up my dating life, or asks me if I have a girlfriend or whatever, or talks to me about getting one, I always shut it down. Like, my very first instinct is to say “No”, and that’s it. I don’t know if it’s a defense mechanism or something, but if it is what on earth am I defending myself against?

What started as random story replies soon turned into weekly and then almost daily texts. We learned that we had a lot in common and we started opening up to one another. On New Year's eve, she told me that meeting me again was the best thing to happen to her in a while, and that she was glad we reconnected. While discussing our New Year's Resolutions, one thing we had in common was our wish to learn Guitar. I asked her if she was interested in learning together with me and she said she was. I figured that was my chance to ask her out and I did, a day later. I took into consideration that she was introverted like I was so I didn't specify it as a date.

So we kind of half had ‘the talk’ but didn’t actually say we were exclusive. 
He is kind of new to my city and I know he has a really good friend that he met through Tinder. He told me he was super happy to have been able to create such friendship etc. I don’t have a problem with this.

So as we were cuddling and getting into it the other day she drops a bomb on me, saying that she was thinking about us and about how she wants to save herself for marriage. I was kind of stunned by it all because it came out of nowhere. I just said it was fine and I understand that its totally up to her, but that i dont know if I could wait, especially because theres no guarantees ill marry this girl (different life paths). Things have been weird ever since.

Im considering ending things because although shes getting what she wants, I dont think im getting what I want out of the relationship. While I feel like it could be selfish, I think I need to do it.

I send a text saying sorry, coz I know he caught me lol. I also admit to him that I visit his profile. He replied right away saying it's okay.. I wanna point out that he barely open fb and before I send him the text he was not active for days..or months... Hopium for me... so I ask him if he was just being friendly and reply fast to everyone. He said idk but it's to be polite Needless to say I've embarrassed myself enough and I told him okay, thanks blah blah and that I'm taking my leave coz I'm embarrassing.

He's a huge nerd and is into cosplaying which is not a problem to me at all even when more than half of the people he follow on ig are girls (very pretty, cute, sexy and in skimpy clothing).

I get it that most guys find them nice to look at, that's normal. I'm fine with him liking their pictures or leaving comments like sexy, hot, cute, pretty because those girls do look hot and cute as he stated. It's just like how I find Geralt of Rivia really hot. My looks is probably average but I am pretty confident in myself because we should love ourselves right. :) 

Until this picture, which is posted before christmas of this model with just a big bows 🎀 covering her nipples and her venis fly trap. He left a comment saying ""best gifts have a bow"". That comment makes me feel like I'm not enough for him and kinda makes me uncomfortable. The girl is asian and I'm asian too.

He's the one who first asked me to be his gf, did say that he really likes me and despite LDR being hard that he's willing to put the effort in because I'm worth it. We do sometime have a naughty talk but it was very mild. Never had any kinky moment being completely exposed nor talk about anything sex related. I'd say it's pretty pg13. Oh and we are almost 15000miles apart and he bought a ticket to come visit me this year on my birthday and it would be the first time we meet.

So question is..... Is it possible that all that pent up ""heat"" is the one making him write that comment? Is it actually okay for him to say that? I have alot of questions running in my mind but I couldn't write it all out.

Please tell me what your opinion on this is and maybr some advice?

I’ve just started using some dating apps but I’m unsure how to progress conversations in terms of topic as I’m not really aware of the etiquette surrounding these types of situation. I feel hesitant to talk about general kind of personal small talky things such as work/university/friends/family because idk if this is appropriate for this type of relationship. But I can’t really think of anything else to talk about and I don’t want a serious relationship. What kind of things do other people talk about in their fwb relationships especially early on (before meeting up).

I’ve resorted to online dating because I don’t really get many chances to actually get out anymore and I already hate it. I have typically been more successful in person in the past but a lockdown in conjunction with a long term relationship has left me out the loop when it comes to all this and my social skills seem to be lacking haha.

84,rzbhmm,1641679878,How soon is too soon to become an exclusive couple?,"I (28m) met this amazing woman (26f) on Bumble and we really connected over the past month or so. The week leading up to the new year, she asked me if I wanted to be exclusive with her—if I wanted to be her boyfriend. I hesitated, and ended up not going for it. The main reasons being that I felt it was too soon, and the other being that she was the first woman I've been with—she was my first kiss, and I lost my virginity to her. 

I want to make a note here: we actually talked about the fact that she was my first, and how we were both worried about me being curious about other women in the future. We also talked about the pace of it all. This talk was done a couple of days before she first asked me to be her boyfriend. Furthermore, she actually came up with the idea of not being exclusive, but continuing dating because of our worries related to my inexperience. Even though this was her idea, she became jealous about the idea of me seeing other women; and hence, the aforementioned call.

After the new year when I was back in the area and we could get together again, I called her and asked if she wanted to hangout. At first she said yes; however, she added the stipulation that she would only see me if I was going to be exclusive with her (this was because she could feel herself falling for me, and that she didn't want to get hurt, so I understood). Again I hesitated, but came up with what I thought was decent middle ground to address the issue of it being too soon: I said I'd be exclusive with her if we went on a couple of actual dates (up until now, it was mostly just us hanging out with things leading towards sex). She agreed, and we did go on a date.. and still had sex every time we met. 

I'm not sure if I'm remembering everything correctly here, but I'm pretty sure that she just started calling me her boyfriend and was asking me to say out loud that she was my girlfriend during these times we met. So of course when those things sorta come out of nowhere I hesitate and eventually say what she wanted me to say. When I went over to her house, she went around telling everyone in her family amd her friends that we were now boyfriend/girlfriend. As another note: she has already told most of her friends and family that we were boyfriend/girlfriend—my friends and family have no idea about her.

So of course, I'm going to be uncomfortable with the whole label thing (even though I really like her and could definitely see us together for a while) because no one in my circle knows about her and I've never had a girlfriend before. 

I played along and actually put in effort into being her boyfriend. When I went to the store, I saw something that made me think of her, and then bought it for her for valentines day. I felt so happy. Even though it was a little new and uncomfortable, I was warming up to the idea and felt happy about it.

Later that evening, she called again. She said that she saw my hesitation when she was asking me to say that I was her boyfriend. She felt that I wasn't serious about it, and that it was her fault for pushing it (which she kinda did, though because of my lack of experience, I had no clue if I should've pushed back). We both agreed, said we still wanted to see each other though, and she mentioned just being friends with benefits. I wasn't totally opposed to that, and felt the call went well. After the call, I broke down. I felt like I made the wrong decision, and had no idea what to think. I thought of the gift I bought her and how happy I was to buy it. 

That call was Wednesday, and she mentioned she still wanted to meetup today, but barely any contact had happened between that call and today. I was going nuts, sensing something was off and I really wanted to see her, so I decided to call her just now—she doesn't want to see me in no way unless it's because I've decided I wanted to be exclusive with her. 

I feel so lost. The thought of being exclusive with her makes me feel happy and comfortable. All I know is, right now, being alone without her sucks. Should I worry about my lack of experience with other women at all? Should I worry about how quickly this is happening, without any of my family or friends even knowing about her? I wish I would've gotten the chance to tell some family and friends about this amazing woman I'm dating, rather than just suddenly revealing to them that we're boyfriend amd girlfriend. I really just wanna call her up and tell her that I want her in my life. Would it be unreasonable to suggest that we be exclusive, but just without the label on it for a little bit? There doesn't have to be any difference between just dating exclusively and actually being labeled boyfriend/girlfriend right? 

Sorry this is pretty lengthy, but hopefully someone can chime in and give me some advice. If you didn't feel like reading, then what do you think a reasonable amount of time is to date before becoming exclusive and putting the boyfriend/girlfriend label on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzbhmm/how_soon_is_too_soon_to_become_an_exclusive_couple/

90,rzbw1c,1641680937,Improving my dating life after changing myself,"The last 2,5 years have been pretty hard for me: coronavirus joined our lives, got into medical school, studied a lot, struggled with anxiety, lost some friends and made new ones, had some life changing experiences, lost +30 kg of weight, got pretty attractive, social skills also are at a higher level, I'm not that shy anymore etc. Ok, end with this little introduction or my post will get banned hahaha

So, for now my career is going pretty good, I'm talking about med school. I'm proud of myself, I achieved a lot with many ups and downs, but the road is long, so there are many years to finish school.  

My mental health improved drastically. Months ago my anxiety was tremendously invalidating, I cried a lot, couldn't talk with people, didn't want to socialize. Now it's not like that anymore. 

Talking about my external appearance, people tell me that I'm 8/10, 6.4 ft (194 cm), 182 lbs (82 kg), I'm thin but not too much, got a v-shaped body, long dark hairs, I always wear black or white clothes, because I love minimalism. 

So, the point is that I'm not happy about my relationships with girls and in general about my dating life. There aren't many girls in my life, but when one ""appears"", I can quickly escalate to something more. Still I don't like these girls at 100% because of some character incompatibility, but I date them because of some hidden desperation inside me. This is caused because I'm a little scared to approach a girl in public and have the possibility to choose them. How do you let yourself go and approach a beautiful girl? It seems a little hard for me, because probably I never did it. And it's so frustrating, I'm so young, have almost everything what I want from life, but dating is such a mess for me...

I am 25 and haven't been in a relationship since high school, so everything feels new and different for me at every new stage I reach with someone. That makes me really excited, but I also find that I get super stuck in my own head and overthink everything and just one little thing can convince me that the person I'm talking to has no interest in me, despite the fact that there are so many more reasons to believe they ARE interested. I know I also lack a lot of self-confidence in many aspects of my life and am working to gain more generally, but I was just wondering if anyone here has dealt with anything similar with regards to dating and what has worked for you and what helped you stop overthinking or being anxious over every little detail.

95,rzcbor,1641682086,"Am I nitpicking, or understandably disappointed? (it's a little deal)","I started using Tinder again today, some hours ago.   
Then, when I started swiping I noticed a lot of girls had only their instagram on their bios, or even blank bios. When I noticed this I felt a little disappointed, like:

""Girls, why exactly (some of) you have blank bios? This is so low-effort, come on.  
How am I supposed to build a nice convo with you if I don't know anything about you in your bio?  
I thought blank bios were a thing that straight men pulled, not straight women.  
Having a blank bio makes you seem like a lazy and uninteresting person. Put some effort!""  


I know I'm probably making too much of a big deal about this, but I'm genuinely surprised (in a negative way) about the amount of girls with blank (or almost blank) bios.

Went on a first date with a guy I've been talking to online for a few weeks this Monday. We talked on the phone for hours every night just find; but the first irl date was INCREDIBLY awkward to the point we were in the restaurant just giggling at each other. In the end, he kissed me on the forehead and made sure to say we should do this again. We've still been talking &amp; texting regularly after that.   


However, I just want to know if there's much potential for our in-person dates to get better over time.  


I \*really, really\* do like the guy; but as a severely shy person who doesn't just hit it off with anyone, I feel we are kind of incompatible in our lifestyle and interests (he's a rural farmer, I'm a city girl), though we have identical values. I look forward to his calls every day and love hearing about his days. Is there potential for this to get better?

97,rzccg4,1641682143,Mixed signals from a guy in a relationship,"So earlier this year, I met this guy when I kept having to go into his workplace for my work. We hit it off really well and I feel like we have a lot of chemistry. I could tell by the get go he was intrigued by me and we started to flirt. I developed a crush on him. He mentioned in passing in the beginning stages that he had a girlfriend, not as a defense mechanism — just came up organically in conversation. So I was like okay, maybe he just likes to flirt. But then I would catch him like lingering so he got the chance to talk to me or time things so we’d end up somewhere in the office at the same time. I catch him looking at me from across the office all the time. I can’t help but feel like he has a crush on me too. So then, after a couple months, a close friend of mine died and he found out. I was visibly upset the next time I went into his office and he saw me from afar. We didn’t talk that day. I think he was nervous because I was upset. So then, I left the office when I was finished and went out to the parking lot to my car and he ran out to me. He said he was so so sorry for what happened and if I needed anything to let him know — like take me out for a drink. I said you know what that sounds great. So we planned to get drinks at a later date. Drinks happen. Great conversation. We flirt and there is some major sexual tension. But nothing physical happens and we don’t acknowledge our feelings for eachother. Just innocent flirting. He mentions his girlfriend during drinks and proceeds to tell me she’s very jealous of other girls — which leads me to believe she did NOT know he had taken me out to drink or even know I exist. But while he was complaining about their aspect of her, I don’t get the jist that they’re an unhappy couple.Our friendship gets stronger after the drinks and I still notice him going out of his way to get in front of me and have conversation every time I’m in his office. He still playfully flirts and will walk me out to my car when I have a lot of stuff to carry. He covered drinks when we went last time and I wanted a follow up, so one day when he walked me out, I asked him if he wanted to get another round of drinks, my treat. And he kind of got a panicked look on his face and said yeah I’ll let you know, I really want you to meet my girlfriend. And so I was like okay, that was a shut down if I ever saw one. I was obviously upset but knew it was a long shot — more embarassed than anything. I was more worried that he was going to get weird and our dynamic would be over because I just really enjoy being around him. So the next time I saw him, I was nervous what to expect but he acted the same as always and we’ve even gotten closer from that point. I have curbed my flirting with him because when he turned me down for drinks, I just felt like he was establishing a boundary and I wanted to respect it. He still finds a way to flirt with me. Still goes out of his way to talk to me, still walks me to my car sometimes if I have heavy stuff, and I catch him looking at me from the across the office all the time. So basically, I just need some insight from an independent third party. I’m getting somewhat attached to his friendship. And I believe he’s going to be promoted soon and he will be moved to another location that I don’t go to for work. I have so much anxiety about this happening. I just feel like we’re on borrowed time and our friendship only exists inside the four walls of that office. I understand he’s in a relationship and I want to respect that but I also just love being his friend. I just worry we’re not going to be able to keep in touch because of his girlfriend for obvious reasons. I am sad thinking about how he might not be in my life at all in a matter of months. Everyone that I’m close to says they think he definitely likes me but they’re not sure what his end game is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzccg4/mixed_signals_from_a_guy_in_a_relationship/
98,rzcj74,1641682633,Is this ghosting or not? How do I deal with this situation,"Dear everybody,

This is my first time on Reddit, and kind of hate that I admitted to writing a post. I have just been really unsuccesful in my dating life and kind of don't get it anymore. Sorry for the long story, I just also feel like venting a bit.

Here is the situation. I live in the Netherlands, and back in November I was invited to a neighbor's party in my student building. There I met a girl from Finland who I seemed to click with. At one point I noticed her sitting on the hallway, seemingly in pain. I asked what was up and turned out she got in a car accident a while ago, got a whiplash and was in pain. I offered her to take her to my apartment downstairs, to allow her a quiet place. We watched a movie that night and I let her sleep on the couch. Next day I proposed to take her home, but she said ""I would actually like to stay"". So I proposed to watch Netflix and at one point I decided to push my luck and ask if she wanted to come sit with me. She didn't hesitate a second and we cuddled the rest of night. She even slept in my bed with me and even though no sex happened we cuddled the rest of the night. Next day she had to go back to Finland for three months for her internship, but she said ""So I guess I will be seeing you again then?"". Of course I said ""Yes we will."".

But with all the bad experiences I've had with people, I learned not to have any expectations. I decided to keep focusing on myself, and while still wanting to reach out to her here and there, remain at the background a bit until she would back by the end of January. Every day though, she would text me on her initiative. Showing me stuff of her life, and asking how I was doing. I already know some of the advice dating coaches give and decided not to text too much, not to initiate it, and not to be too available. I prioritized my studying and only replied in the evenings or otherwise the next day. This was also not lose myself in this girl too soon while things are so unknown because of the distance.

We talked every day, mostly some boring small talk. Sometimes though, we did have more personal conversations and we both told each other some really personal things and our connection grew over text. Very often she would hint on seeing me again, saying stuff like ""I think we both feel the same way"", ""I wish I could see you now"", ""I actually miss you"", ""If you are gonna make that trip I would love to join"", ""If this thing goes the way I hope ..."", ""We will make it happen"". And much more. Slowly I fell into the trap of trusting this girl and got a bit of feelings.

This all continued without change for two months. This Christmas break she went to Switzerland for a ski trip with her family. She still kept talking to me every day, but slightly less (of course because she was skiing). Still, every single day she would ask me how my day was, until December 31. Nothing had happened between us but I got no reply back to my last message (she didn't even read it either). I thought she was with family as it was New Year's Eve. But when it became midnight and the year 2022 came around and I sent her happy new year wishes, I did not get a reply back. Last time I had heard from her was December 30. I started feeling a bit uneasy and convinced myself I was feeling like that because of my relationship traumas and insecurities, and that probably nothing was up. But I also knew this girl tends to get into accidents (she really does, besides her car crash) so I was worried she got into a skiing accident. I texted her again at 6 am when I left my friend's house after a new year's eve party, asking her if she could confirm she was okay. No reply. I went to sleep and decided to call her at 10 am, nothing. Called at 2 pm, nothing. Noticed she was online on Whatsapp, but had not read my messages. Sent two more texts saying ""Could you please text me you're fine, I am really worried right now, please. I feel really shitty now"". Maybe coming on a bit too strong there (first time I ever did that btw), but again I was really worried as she tends to get into accidents and it's nothing for her not to wish me a happy new year. Something in my gut told me this was off. Well I finally got a reply a 3 pm at new year's day. She said ""I had some semi shitty days and I need some time away from people."". I said I would support her if she needed, but to take her time.

That same evening I got a long text saying that not her, but her dad, got into a skiing accident and ended up in hospital with a broken eye socket. He was awake and not in a life threatening situation. They also managed to get him back to Finland. She said the accident had already happened December 28 (when we were still talking fine), that she got into a lot of fights with her grandmother over there in the aftermath of the accident, who called her ""selfish for wanting to go out on New year's eve."" She ended the message with ""I just need time away from people right now, especially my grandmother. I just need another vacation far away from anybody I know."" I again said I would support her if she needed. I asked if she managed to get back to Finland, to which she replied ""Yea"" on January 2nd. This would be the last time we talked.

I did not respond to that message because, apparently, she communicated she needed space. I wasn't sure if that meant space from me as well, but she said ""time away from people"" so I assumed yes. I thought if I would just wait a few days she would come around talk to me again. But it's been a week now and she still didn't. My gut is slowly starting to tell me something is up which has got something to do with me too, and not just her dad.

I get that this is a shitty situation for her, but would it make sense for her to need space from me too? But why three days after the accident and not right away? And would it make sense for her to stop talking to me too, while the situation is in her family and has nothing to do with me?

How do I deal with this situation? Do I ask her how she is doing? Or do I keep quiet, like I'm doing now, because she ""needs time away from people""? 

I know this is ""technically"" not ghosting, as she was the last one sending a message, but I cannot respond much to ""Yea"", plus she is the one saying she needed space. I have respected that so far, and not made any stupid moves yet. But I really don't know how to interpret this situation. I feel really confused and it makes me question my every move, but I really couldn't think of something I might have done. Our communication just changed out of nowhere, and I don't get it.

Is this ghosting, and does it seem like she is pushing me away? If not, how I deal with this?

If it is, it would really suck to have yet another shitty experience, and to have fallen into that trap of a girl making you believe they are trustworthy and that you are important to them. Happened to me so many times before (also with people in general), that I really don't know what to believe anymore from people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzcj74/is_this_ghosting_or_not_how_do_i_deal_with_this/
