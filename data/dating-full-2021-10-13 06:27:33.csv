Until few days ago she said that sometimes she felt awkward feeling that she had feeling that she had to pay sometimes and that in her culture it's always man who pays, and this is what makes man manly. If man doesn't do that, in her culture (and in her eyes) is seen as not-real-man.

Not sure if this is the right subred, but here goes.

So, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this. So, I’m a guy (33) and in a relationship with a guy (42). I don’t live in my hometown, so don’t have lots of friends. About 3 years ago, I met this guy (hetero 32) through a friend we have in common. We immediately clicked and started meeting at least once a week, and have done loads of road trips and days out just the two of us. We’d just have an amazing time and have so much in common. I feel like I just have such a good time when I’m with him and he brings out the best in me and makes me really happy (way more than my boyfriend). He’s always really kind, interesting and sensitive. Then, this weekend, I went on a long-weekend getaway with him and 4 other friends (he was only straight guy, if that makes any difference to the story). My boyfriend didn’t come, as he’s got an exam coming up. On the journey back, it was just the two of us in the car, and he said he’s moving away next month because he’s got a job offer. I just felt really sad and couldn’t stop thinking about what a great couple we’d make (if he were gay, of course). Today, I woke up really sad as well and couldn’t stop thinking about him. I think I’m developing feelings for him, which of course I can never act on. Anyway, should I distance myself from him to protect myself, or just keep on meeting like we’ve always done until he leaves? Any advice would be very welcome.

P.s. he is definitely hetero because, although he’s not a steady girlfriend for years, does date women and talks about his dates with me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1063042,public,self,Say something to friend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q75wjv/say_something_to_friend/,all_ads,6,,,

My girlfriend has had no relationship before. The most she has had before are distant crushes she has never spoken to. Her introverted nature combined with strict parents didn't really give her an opportunity to even be in a situation where she could meet new people.

My question is, obviously I know there will be differences based on our experiences but what should I be expecting? 
A follow up to that, how to resolve any particular difference. Like if she has no experience in relationship, is it fine if I sometimes tell her certain things which people ""usually do"" in a relationship (not physical, but more of emotional and expressing) or should I let it free flow.

Because she has told me in the past how she feels for me, and I know it comes naturally. However, since she has never been in a relationship, she doesn't know whether it needs to be done. One example would be dirty talking. She enjoys it a lot. Yet, she only realized she enjoys both listening and talking dirty because I showed it to her. She didn't know that was something she could even enjoy.

I (21F) am great friends with J (21M). We went to the same high school, although we only grew close at 18 years old. He would be flirtatious towards me but I would always take it with a pinch of salt. At 19, we became frequent presences within each other's lives. Unfortunately at 20, he moved two and a half hours away. We still kept in touch though and visited one another if we weren't in video calls together. We try and make each other's lives better, if you know what I mean. So this past Friday, he had been visiting two mutual friends elsewhere when I video called him. They were getting drunk that side and I was also getting drunk this side. He started to declare in front of them that I'm his soulmate, which is fair. I get it, don't have to be together for that. Then at the end of the call (we were both stupidly and happily drunk), he shouted “I love you” and I returned the sentiment, “I love you too”. Didn't speak to each other until Monday. Didn't know what to make of what was said. Monday, I call and try to assuage any awkwardness with our normal exchange of dad jokes and it was all fine until he started wanting to exchange the dirtiest pick up lines we can think of. Had two or three calls with him since then and he’s come up with at least five each time. I want to know whether or not I'm reading too much into this. Should I assume he's interested in me or not?

this is my first ever post, hope i'm doing this right and typing this in the right place.

so, straight on. i (F18) am dating one of my closest friends ever (m18). we've been friends for a while, but we've been going out for just almost 6 months now.

i have a chronic illness (dont really want to disclose it here) that i've been battling since i was around 11 years old. although my parents obviously know, i have had a real issue talking about it to people my whole life. 

even my closest friends i've had for over 9, 10 years have no idea.  it's always been something i've kept private. im naturally quite a secretive person and i also dont want anyone seeing my any differently after.

**JUST** to clarify- its not a transmissible illness or anything like that! i would keep something like that from my partner. but i'm just looking for help in how to tell him about it.

The conversation was okay. Honestly my gut says nothing will happen, not so much based on the conversation just based on the past, it wasn't so horrible on my end but there were some misunderstandings which I have mostly cleared up although somewhat late. 

Here's the thing though, the breakup with me has so upset her she has remained single. She did say that to me at the time, but I took that as a sure you will. Now that doesn't necessarily mean she wants me back, but ""You're saying there's a chance"" She may honestly just prefer a cat lady life with no chance of heartbreak.

You also hear countless women say the don't want to be approached in public, don't approach them at their work place, don't approach them at the gym, don't just join hobby clubs to meet women because that's creepy etc. How can I compliment a woman if shes gonna think I'm just trying to get into her pants? How can I try to flirt when there's a very high chance she will be creeped out?

Nowadays I avoid making eye contact with women because I'd hate to make them feel uncomfortable. I guess dating apps are the only safe way to date but unfortunately I never get any matches. I've been clubbing many times too and have creeped out countless women by dancing near them, they either walk off or their friends come and take them away.

Is the solution to just not care about being a creep? Also, women say desperation is creepy but how do you not be at least slightly desperate when you're 24 and never met a woman who was interested in you?

The date is just us going round drinking at some nice bars in the centre of town and I’m really excited for this date because I love the bar scene and night life where we’re going, but I’m really cautious about travelling up there alone.

Usually when I go into central town, it’s either in broad daylight or I’m always with a group of friends if we’re going at night. City centre is only a 30 minute walk from my uni house and I’ll happily walk that distance with some music on but, as with most cities, it’s not safe to travel alone at night (we’re planning to meet up at around 8pm). Every other day I hear stories of kidnappings and rape, especially in the park I walk through to reach city centre. Even just yesterday I was travelling home from shopping in the early evening and a stranger started to follow me and walk next to me, asking me where I’m headed. When I sped up and cut corners to escape him, he would do his best to keep up. I’m still a bit shaken from this experience and I know it could be so much worse at night. I could call an Uber but, being a student, it’s really expensive for my kind of budget. I’ll probably still end up calling an Uber if I can’t find any other way to reach the city centre safely, it’s just my backup plan for now. I’m also scared for when I get out of the Uber if I can’t find my date straight away, and I’m just stranded in the middle of the city for a while until I find him.

Would it be out of order for me to ask this guy to come and meet me at my house beforehand so we can travel down together? I’ve met him a couple times before and feel safe around him.

As you can tell, I had zero passion about our work. While on the job I had a temp representative that would check on me at the start of every shift, just to make sure everything is going smoothly and if I have any questions. This “check-up” would take about thirty minutes because we would small talk about a lot of different things. The whole time we talk she is smiling, giggling, looking into my eyes, flipping her hair, and one time she even started helping me do my work. Most representative would never do the job of their workers because it’s their reasonability to make sure we have work. So, at this point I figure this women probably has a crush on me and is helping with my work load just to continue talking to me (witnesses to our interactions also think she has a crush on me).

Well, I got accepted to another job that pays better and is in my field of IT. So, I left her a voice mail on her work phone that says I’m not coming back to work, that I found a job that pays better and is in my field, and that it would be silly for me to give a two week notice for a job I've been at for a month. She called me back two hours later congratulating me on the new job and asked if I could give her some feedback on her job performance (which I did). After I give her the feedback things got a little weird. She started talking about how she feels the need to tell me that I have a great personality and that she enjoys every moment speaking with me, that she will miss me, and that I’m an overall awesome person and that if I need anything to give her call even if it has nothing to do with work. I told her she can call me also if she ever wanted to shoot the shit. She says “Thank you, \[my name\] I appreciate that”. I then told her to take care and that’s that.

I’m going travelling in a month (for probably 3-6 months but no set length) and he knew that from the start.

In real life he was very affectionate and thoughtful and caring but it’s become clear since we got back that words of affirmation are not his thing. I don’t really know how he feels. He says he’s going to come and see me but it’s starting to feel like empty promises.

I had a brief relationship with a woman in my early 20’s and I have worked out that I am very much into my Men.
I was a Daddy’s girl from the second I was born and I looked up to my father,I still do even though he passed away two years ago.
My “Old man” was extremely unconventional and got me into trouble all the time..but he was my first true love and we had a wild adventure.
My old man was very intelligent and stone cold sober, he was very Creative and his main skill was photography, that he won awards for. He got into a specialist form of gardening later in life and managed to complete his best grow only a few weeks before he passed away. I took him to Amsterdam for our fair well and it was one of my best memories.
He made sure his family always benefitted from him in some way and looked after his women and all of his wives..He was a sucker for love.

I do have a couple of really good girls in my life that I love dearly and they look out and after me, as I do them, they are very important to me and I follow a strict girl code.We have fun..
But even at primary school I played mainly with the boys and was always the first person to instigate the game “Kiss chase”, though I was an ugly duckling and the boys often chased after the pretty and popular girls, I was an inbetweener and I’m still a massive geek.
I find my male friend’s are a little more chill to be honest and find it very easy to weed out the assholes and creeps these days.

I read a post on r/dating and  a guy was complaining that he basically had too much competition and didn’t stand a chance with any woman due to Facebook and social media and an over population of men that are also playing the game,I am guessing he is still young, and is yet to learn the score.

I am 40 years old in November and I am the happiest and most content I have ever been in my life and have worked out a little secret that I am going to let you guys into..
It’s not about looks, money or how successful you are, I have dated stock brokers and cleaners and all sorts in between..
The secret for me is your style and how you can carry yourself, I’m into shy and creative men that have self confidence and good morals, I don’t give a shit how big there dick is or even what they look like. Nothing puts me off more than a “Good looking Asshole”.
I am looking for a Gentleman and a man that will stand strong by my side and look out for me, an old soul and best friend.
I’m often in some sort trouble about something and have been described as “Controversial” in the past by a Solicitor (long story), but my point is that I like a reliable man that can put up with my antics, play along with me and stand strong against the bully’s…Because I have come across a few of those in my time.
Trust is the key to my perfect relationship and mutual respect.
I love ambition in a man, but not Arrogance because that really turns me off.

I have come off  Facebook and wouldn’t even contemplate a dating site (though I don’t knock them and have witnessed success story’s), it is not my preferred method.
I am not actively seeking a relationship right now, although I did cross somebody special.. But we are on different paths and are not walking in the same direction, it was a shame but I got a lot from the experience and that virtual stranger changed my perspective and perhaps even life,,
So my gut feeling about him was right and he did turn out to be very special.
He made an impression.

I spend a hell of a lot of time on my own studying and working on my career at the moment, I have been creating a better future since the end of my 10 year relationship a couple of years ago with “The love of my Life”..That also tuned out to be a priceless lesson that I no longer regret.
My hard work is starting to pay off and it’s time to hit the town and find a new play mate.

My perfect man also has to be into his music because my music is playing from the second I wake up until I hit the sheets at Night/early morning.I like a man that can teach me new tricks and will have no problem with me waking up at a random time in the middle of the night to work or create.. It would be Amazing if he could join me!

I’ve decided to hit a cool club on Friday and see what the score is, I need to Dance and chill with a bit of atmosphere and life.
I’m not out to “pull a bloke”..
And I have realised that I don’t have to settle for second best, especially when it comes to something as vital as a partnership.
It’s time for me to have some fun and always remember one of my Brothers quotes that he used..
“Don’t hate the player, hate the game”.  
And it’s true that dating is just a game..
A game that requires patience, effort and skill.
I’m going to stay patient and work hard on my future and I have faith that the perfect one is out there for me in what ever shape or form.
All the best things take time and I am in no rush.
Take it easy peeps and try to enjoy yourselves and perhaps figure out exactly what you are looking for in a relationship and don’t forget to set your Boundaries..
Trust me it will save a lot of time and grief.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we are all special and unique.
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure and there is somebody customised especially for you out there.
Have faith and have fun and keep me posted on all of your cool story’s and experiences weather good, bad or even funny.
I love hearing other people’s views and experiences weather you are 18 or 80.

People describe me as chill, kind, and disciplined.

I'm not attracted to most women who show interest in me and it makes me feel like my standards are too high. I genuinely want a relationship but when I finally find a woman I want to pursue it ends up failing because she's not interested in a real relationship or just wanted something physical or wanted attention.

Standards:
1. Fit (I like staying active and doing fun things. I'm not the get drunk and party all night type. Holds me back a lot at 22.)
2. 5'9-6'0 (This isn't a deal breaker. Women I have dated or pursued have often been much shorter. I sometimes like to avoid awkward height differences).
3. In college, college graduate, or in graduate school.
4. I really don't care if she has had sex before or how many partners she has had. I have never cared about that.
5. Feminine.
6. Kind (I spend some of my free time doing charity work and would love to have someone I like tag along).
7. No alcohol or drug use (this seems to be hard for my age group).
8. Age appropriate, 20-22(I don't relate well with 18 year olds because some of them are too young mentally for me. I have dated and I often attract older women because they notice things about me that women in my age group and younger typically look past. Oldest woman I dated was 25 when I was 18. I'd prefer to stay away from that.)
9. Black or Brown women (I'm black and have dated white women in the past but I'm far more attracted to black and brown women).

Nothing else comes to mind. I feel like my standards are normal but I just keep failing to find women who genuinely want a relationship even when I'm clear on how I feel/what I want. I think I should just fully focus on graduating, working, and dating someone age appropriate when I'm older (around 30).

Great third date, we ended up having fun at bowling then watched a movie at the cinema where I put my arm around her and we cuddled. She reacted positively to it. We ended the night near her car and made out for a good couple of minutes and she seemed to be giggling when we hugged.

She then offered to drive me home as I was close by however I didn’t want to put her out of her way given how late it was and I was a couple of stops on the tram away.

However, looking back I don’t know if this was a hint for me to invite her in and I missed it? My problem is that I live with someone so we usually plan to have the place to ourselves if we invite someone over. I prefer to ask a girl over and make arrangements beforehand rather than it happening randomly.

Now she could’ve just been acting nice and just offering me the lift home. She’s still sending me detailed texts with lots of questions and emojis and has accepted a 4th date, nothing has changed apart from a few days after she updated her profile picture on Bumble.

So I've been with my gf for 3 years and she's the type of girl who has to ask questions a lot and also has trouble with problem solving. She asks questions about almost everything or needs advice for almost everything, even when the problem is simple. Mostly I think it's because she doubts her own thoughts/answers so she needs to ask me to see if she's right or just my thoughts on almost everything. But over the years it's gotten kind if exhausting answering her questions and giving her advice. So I've been trying to push her for that last few months to try and think about her questions and not to doubt her own answers and it helps sometimes but most of the time it doesn't. And it's gotten annoying seeing how much she doubts her own thoughts and answers because she's a very smart woman but with her past and the toxic people she's had to deal with she can't really fully trust herself. 

So I don't want to give her attitude but i sometimes do, so I started to try and hide hide when I get annoyed but I don't ever want to snap at her for what she does. So I wanted to know how I could help myself get better with my attitude or how quickly I'll get annoyed when she asks me questions.

I've done a lot of self-analysis over the last  month, and I'm not in a very good place, mentally.  I see myself  spiraling towards depression, but I'm not there (yet).  Basically, I've  been shamed for being an introvert my entire life, and have developed a  huge amount of social anxiety as a result.  I'm at the stage where I'm  questioning a lot of major life choices I've made (career, where I live,  friends, etc).

So  I bring this up, because this all started by me crushing on a girl who I  reconnected with on social media.  It took me a bit to realize why I  was digging her, and she's very similar to myself (introvert, social  anxiety, etc) but I realized that she was confident about herself, which  is what made me examine myself and kind of come up with what I said  above.  I bring this up, because last weekend, after a few years of not  seeing this girl, I asked if she wanted to meet up (hang out).  And I  literally typed all of this up, including that I wanted to ask her out  on a date, and gave it to her.  She reacted very positively, understood  what I was going through, and gave me really good advice.  I told her at  the time that she did not have to respond to the dating part of it.   The whole thing was very emotional.  And I'm not going to lie, I cried  in front of her.  She could see it was taking a huge toll on me.

So  I have two stances on this.  My original one was that I should work on  myself at this point, and better myself.  I wanted to be open about my  feelings, which is why I included it.  Honestly, just a few days ago, I  think rejection would have put me into depression.

I'm  doing better now.  Not fully out of it, not even close.  But better.   And my other stance is that there is a lot of confusion and uncertainty  in my life right now.  But the one thing that I am sure of, is that I  want to date, or at least ask this girl out.  Even with all this other  stuff going on.

So  I'm not sure what the better route to take is.  Do I wait a few weeks?   The ""what if"" is killing me on a day to day basis.  I  have an  appointment to see a therapist for the first time, next Thursday.  I  think that will help me, but it doesn't help with this girl situation.

Why is it so hard to find women with similar personality traits when compared to me? I was told growing up that when I had all of these things it would be easy to find a woman. I now realize that it is very easy to find a woman. However, most of the women I find are not worth anything. They don't meet these standards.

Had a first date last Thursday night with a girl my age (I'm M23) and it seemed to go pretty well. All the vibes leading up to it were more serious dating as opposed to casually hooking up. We were at dinner for 2+ hours and only left because the restaurant closed. I invited her to have another drink at my apartment which she agreed to. I didn't end up making a move for sex but kissed her on the way out of my apartment which she accepted, though it was brief.

I text her the following day and didn't hear back for almost 4 days after and she said she's not interested. Obviously I've been rejected before but you can almost always tell in the moment when that will happen (imo), so it caught me off guard.

A friend mentioned that she was probably willing to hook up but not seriously date (despite her not seeming overly flirtatious on the date) and that inviting her back to my place was an indication that I felt the same. In retrospect, this might make sense especially since there was a point at my apartment where she was like ""alright I'm gonna head out in 20"". But again, usually when a girl wants that she'll be pretty touchy/flirty, and this girl wasn't.

He is taking me out on dates sending me texts every day, talking about meeting his family, I have met his friends, talks about the future and events we can go to and just really giving me good signs that he is wanting something real. 

About a week into us seeing eachother we both agreed to being exclusive/dating each other. We were both intoxicated though when we said that. We ended up sleeping together in the first week. 

Even though when we agreed to be exclusive/dating we were intoxicated his words and actions the past 2/3 weeks have been showing me he was being serious when he said that.He is treating me like a girlfriend and someone who he genuinely likes. He is talking about future plans even mentioning going on a vacation together at some point. He will call me out of the blue just to chat etc. 

so yesterday when we were finished having sex I mentioned our talk to him. I told him that I wasn’t seeing other people. 

He said that I was the only girl that he is seeing but that he is not looking for a relationship. He said he just got out of a relationship a few months ago and isn’t in the place to commit.
So now I am upset because I thought this guy was showing signs of interested in something more serious. He has been very consistently treating me like a girlfriend. 

Now how should I proceed? 

Yes I do know that we have only been seeing each other for about three weeks so it is super early. I would be completely OK with things moving slower if we were not sleeping together. 

I told him that in the meantime I am going to also date other people and pursue other options. 
Basically we agreed that we were not going to sleep with other people but if we do we will tell the other person. So idk how to proceed



Did I do anything wrong? What should I do now?

I am 20F on a year abroad in England (from the USA) and just met someone 22M. I was in a coffee shop looking for a place to sit down, holding a tray of piping hot coffee, dismayed by the lack of seats available. Just when I had accepted my fate of drinking my coffee standing up, a boy flagged me over and invited me to sit with him (tbh, this kind of felt like my romcom movie moment). We got to chatting and ended up talking for 2 hours until the coffee shop closed down. We exchanged contact information and became facebook friends. I messaged him a little after the event, and we had a nice exchange.

Now, I was hoping he would ask to see me again after this meeting but I did not hear from him. For background, he spent most of his life in private boarding school before heading to uni, and has not really dated.

I accepted the fact after a week that maybe he just was not into me or just wanted to be Facebook friends. I was a bit disappointed because I thought we had chemistry, but alas.

Flash forward to yesterday, I was sitting in a completely different coffee shop, and in walks the boy! He was really happy to see me and sat with me. We chatted and ended up staying in that coffee shop for two hours until it closed (again). Afterwards we spent two hours in the library together, shared stories of us growing up, etc. But I still feel mixed messages! He asked me if any English men have called me cute yet, etc, but has not called me cute himself?

Typically, I would not pour my energy into someone like this, except I felt a lot of sparks. Conversation is so easy with him. My questions are:

\- Could he be into me? If he is...could he just be afraid of asking me out? He said he would love to get coffee again and I should message him, but why wouldn't he want to message me? Could he be intimidated by me?

\- Could I be misreading this and he could just be being friendly?

\- Any tips for me to move this along? I would love to go to dinner with him or see him again, but I do not want to come off as too forward, especially if he is not into me.

Lots of finance people, attorneys, doctors, businessmen, and entrepreneurs here… I’m an engineer (30M) and women in their 20s/early 30s in the city almost get repelled (dating prospect wise) when I mention I’m an engineer. This is especially true for women with great careers. 

The hierarchy of attractive male career choices in terms of dating for an LTRs and respect in general seems to be…

Celebrity/pro athlete —&gt; MD Doctor —&gt; Business Owner or entrepreneur —&gt; Attorney —&gt; team lead at finance company —&gt; all financial/consulting jobs —&gt; all else. 

I recently started an MBA program at a prestigious school and I tell women I’m an MBA student. I don’t mention anything about engineering and if a woman at a bar or on a dating app asks about my pre-MBA job I say “project management”. This definitely changed the way women view me in a more positive way (even just saying project manager instead of engineer lol). 

I think this really comes down to perceived current and future social power and income potential. i.e. an engineer has little social power and hits an income ceiling pretty quickly. Also engineers are seen as boring people…. An MBA student has tons of future unseen potential and is viewed as a party/fun guy.

Being a close relative (her mother and my father are siblings), I got to know some of his sister's (she being my cousin too ofcourse) friends. Pretty chill people. Later during the main wedding ceremony, her other group came which had some 3-4 beautiful girls. I specifically liked her one friend a lot, and started developing so many sentences which would help me approach her. I even thought of telling my cousin to introduce me to her but  then I remembered,  she told me those 2-3 girl friends of her (which I had found attractive) doesn't have a nice rapport with her, hence I thought asking her wouldn't be a good thing. 

I started overthinking a lot. Like a lot! I always see myself as an average looking guy (6.5-7/10, maybe?), thus making ne wonder why would I be getting a positive response from such an attractive (solid 10/10) girl. Furthermore, she was always surrounded by her friends, which made me feel more anxious. I thought, how was I now supposed to approach her if she's surrounded and what if one of them is her boyfriend? 

I'm back home now, wasted 5 goddamn long hours, just after building courage, framing sentences and what not. I now, hate myself for not atleast approaching or talking to her.
