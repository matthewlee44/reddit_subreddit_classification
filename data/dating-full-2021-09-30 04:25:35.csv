He was easy to talk to, understanding, straight forward, genuine, and I felt safe enough to open up quickly and be vulnerable with him. Never once during this time did I ever felt like he was toying with my feelings and I never had to question what his intentions were because he always expressed them to me with no issues. It was reassuring and maybe I jumped the gun, but I started envisioning how life would be with him. Things however took a slight turn. For the past few days/week I felt that something was off. I had a gut feeling something was wrong and that things were going to end. Also, I‚Äôm not crazy about astrology, but Mercury being in retrograde also didn‚Äôt help ease my gut feeling. I tried to reassure myself that he was busy with work and life which I completely understand. Sometimes people just want a break from things and relax - a little social battery recharge. I thought things were looking up until he called things off as he doesn‚Äôt share the same feelings as I did. I was initially shocked, but at the same time I wasn‚Äôt because I had that gut feeling. I was overwhelmed with emotions. I started to break down and all the thoughts of ‚Äúwas it me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did I do?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat went wrong?‚Äù and anything of that sort started to flood in. I had a complete break down because I really wanted it to work out. He reassured me that he enjoyed every single minute we spent together and still hopes that we can be friends whenever I am ready.

I have had two long term girlfriends after high school, and am currently in a relationship of about 5\~6 months. My only problem is that I feel like I never been truly loved by a partner. I know my girlfriend and past girlfriend have both liked me, but it never felt like love. I always was jealous of friends who you could just tell their girlfriend was in love with them or maybe even obsessed with them but not in an unhealthy way. I know this isn't common and shouldn't be expected but I see it enough to make me want it. 

I know this will come off wrong, but I feel like it is necessary to understand my situation. I go to one of the SKY (top uni here for engineering), speak fluent english and korean, feel like I am easy going, am a little taller than average (178cm), but I guess I was lucky enough to be born with a face that is considered attractive in Korea. I guess it was never hard to get a girl to hook up with me at parties/clubs, but I try to never let it get to my head and certainly try my best to be humble. The point is, Koreans tend to be quite superficial and I guess I am considered quite high up on their superficial dating scale. I receive many compliments from men and women. So at this point in my life, I am more ""aware"" on what my ""worth"" is in the dating market, I guess? It's cringe for me to type this but it's honestly my observation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed many times where my best friends girlfriends are just straight up in love with them. These friends are typically lower on the superficial ""scale"" than I am, so I guess I am asking if there is something I am doing wrong. It's hard to explain, but I guess it's a combination of the physical touch (like putting arm around bf or hugging their bf in public), being very very committed, uploading photo of their bf, etc. stuff like that. It's really hard to explain but I can feel the genuine love and I am happy to see it. It just sucks that I feel like I've never felt that way with my girlfriend(s) in the past or present.

So I decided to take a break from dating until at least Jan 2022. For context I am a 26F and this year has been a crap show on the dating scene. I entered into a routine where I would meet a guy, get to know him, go out a few times, open up about my life, feel like maybe this is going somewhere, only for it to end and be sad for a few days before trying again. I ended a 3 month situationship on Sunday because the guy didn't know if he liked me and honestly I'm just exhausted from it all. So taking a break seems like the logical course of action. However, and this may be an unpopular opinion so apologies in advance if I accidentally offend someone (but there is a reason I am mentioning it), but being unmarried/unengaged when I'm 30 is my nightmare. I come from a culture where people get married young (early 20s) and I'm already on the older side. So I'm struggling to be okay with my decision to take a break from dating. I feel like I am wasting what little time I have by not actively looking for someone. It's stressing me out and causing me to panic slightly. I feel like maybe I should keep looking, but I just don't have the effort with everything currently going on with my life to care about some random man's life for a few months only to get disappointed later.

unfortunately i was young and stupid (still am the stupid part) so pretty much all the bridges were burnt between myself and these girls i knew and met over the course of years.

so, what can anyone give me any advice on how to improve my OLD experience, as a 27 yo man with old photos, doesn‚Äôt use social media and meeting people organically is impossible where i‚Äôm from as i live in a small village of around 1500 people, and everyone knows everyone, even in the surrounding towns and villages.

I'm wondering if even if a guy has his life and happiness on track now, would it still put you off that he took a long time to find this stability and happiness in his life?

Maybe you worry that whatever caused it could come back? (Depression, personality traits etc)

I'm 34 now and was quite anxious and depressed since able 15, due to being bullied at school and having no friends, and also then binge drinking often since 17 and also probably having a health problem which wasn't being treated optimally (underactive thyroid).

Now I've quit alcohol and p*rn (I can't spell the word fully due to a blocker lol), am taking steps to improve social anxiety and social life, have a healthy routine with exercise and gym, eating well. I also moved to a sunny country where I'm much happier (I'm from UK).

Career wise I am a software developer for 7 years and can now get lucrative contact roles. I plan to work for just 3 months of the year and spend the rest learning music production which is something I've always wanted to do, as well as spending time building mobile apps because I don't want to be working for other companies all my life.

So I feel like career wise it's becoming less stable (still good money but not stable because I'm trying out different things) but more stable in other areas. And realistically it might take another year or two to be completely happy with my social life, and maybe 3 years  by the time I feel like I'll know what I want to do career wise long term.

A friend [27F] messaged me [30M] completely out of the blue a month ago to hang out, however the thing is, we hadn't been in touch for around a year prior to COVID. We weren't that close back then, meeting a few times with mutal friends and once alone (in hindsight that one time may have been interest too as she initiated)

In the past month we've hung out 3 times (drinks, her place (with a lovely summer walk), shopping trip (with drinks after)) and each time I felt that we were vibing pretty well. The second hang out was when it actually hit me that there might be something more, but as I was unprepared, and not wanting to ruin a friendship if I was wrong, I didn't make a move nor attempt to get closer physically except for hello/parting hugs.

We went on a shopping trip today with drinks after and I was prepared to steer conversation towards me bringing up the question, but I didn't manage to find it. We seem to get along well and I see signs that she may be interested for more even during our time together today (She initiated and seems comfortable around me) plus we've talked about our next outing (movie) with me """"hinting"""" at 'We'll go alone together' instead of with mutual friends. 

Seeing that I wasn't able to ask her out properly after 3 hang outs, and to make my interest known before I'm friendzoned, I'm wondering whether it's OK to ask her out by text given we haven't been texting? (my anxiety makes me a slow responder, but I am working on it)

Personally I'm not too keen to via text, but I feel I should make my intention clear prior to the next hangout/date? If not, what's the best way to play this out without losing her interest?

 I felt very accepted where with women I felt constantly judged, rejected and disposable. I felt more judged on my status and looks rather than who I am as a person granted these men wanted to sleep with me and that's fine that's the whole point of my account. the standards that these guys had were reasonable.

it was nice to be appreciated I did not feel like I was a check box that had to for fill every requirement before someone would even consider talking to me or feel like I would be ditched as soon as someone better came along.

when I messaged a guy I would actually get messages back as well as compliments, people would actually read my profile the more I think about it the more depressed I get because I wish common decency, reasonable standards and not feeling like a check box was the same between the sexes.

there's no future where I'll ever date a man or have romantic feelings for men it's just a way to hook up, maybe my bad interactions with women and the constant rejection pushed me into experimenting this way or it's just a phase.

I‚Äôve never had a proper GF in my entire life. For the last year I had a crush on this girl but she has been incredibly rude to me and truth be told she seems like a toxic person. The past few days she's just made me feel like such a bad person and made me really upset. So instead of moping around for the next month I decided to put my head down and finally get a GF or at the very least some dating experience. I know it won't improve everything, but I just want to give it a try.

I‚Äôm currently on these dating apps = tinder, bumble, okcupid, match, plenty of fish, Hinge, happn and Tag. I'm also on a few hookup apps such as Hot and 3fun.

I should note that most of the girls at my uni are very toxic or taken, so meeting girls there is unlikely. However I do live in student accommodation with a bunch of students from different universities, they also regularly throw parties and events.

I'm outgoing and sociable so attending events and stuff is something I would be up to do. I also enjoy going out for drinks and stuff like that.

I‚Äôm looking for a fairly serious relationship, probably more on the longer side. But at this point I would take anything.

So I thought I‚Äôd pose the question to you reddit. Is there any advice you can give me?

Apps, events, situations any advice would be appreciated

Thanks in advance

We've been together for about year and a half now, also I think it's important to say that we're long distance (still manage to see each other quite often). I caught him using it maybe 5 months ago, he was showing me a video on his phone and the notification popped on his screen. I asked him about it, he got all defensive and told me he only uses it for fun. I told him it bothers me and then he said he would delete the app if it's a problem. 

So next few months, everything was fine as I was sure he deleted it. But there were a few occasions where he'd kind of disappear for a few hours at evenings. It bothered me because he wouldn't really say where he was or he would say he needed to cool off after work (which I do understand) but I kind of started having this gut feeling like something was maybe going on. But since I know I am a bit anxious in relationships and I couldn't really prove anything, I let it go and decided to believe him.

Well, he didn't delete the app and is still  regularly using it.  I found out again also by accident. I confronted him and he eventually admitted he's still using it, but only every now and then (not true, his status is 'recently active' all the time). Again he told me it's only for fun, he only messages the girls, has never met with anyone, has never cheated on me, etc.

Aaand I'm kind of torn. I think I believe him that he doesn't physically cheat, emotionally probably, which for me is still cheating, but he disagrees. Also I thought about it a lot and came to conclusion that it's very probable that he uses it only for fun - to get matches and compliments because he's insecure and it's a boost for his ego.

When I again told him that it really bothers me and I think it's cheating, he again got all defensive with his 'what's wrong with you, I'm not actually cheating', like it's my fault cause I'm just jealous ( I'm really not) and I was only hurt when I found out. Then eventually he told me he understands me, but he doesn't plan on stopping using Tinder.

So I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here. Maybe some advice or just to vent a bit. I did tell everything to some of my friends, but they don't really think it's a problem and here I am sitting and wondering if it's actually no big deal?

Ladies, I know that this isn't what you want to hear but its absolutely essential that you hear it and keep it in the back of your mind so that you can avoid making mistakes and getting your heart broken.

Most situations where two people that have a platonic relationship and then try to advance into dating mode fails. Why? Because one part was never that invested to begin with. Thats where the friend part comes in.

Heterosexual men will keep around female friends, in the hope that there is a possibility for sex. Even if he is nice, caring, and gives you glimpses about being a really nice guy, he is doing this mostly to up his chances to get you in to bed. If you're fine with casual hook ups when this isn't a problem and you can stop reading further. However if you're hoping to develop a serious relationship with a male friend, keep reading.

So who are the women men befriend? Its usually the girl that maybe already has a partner so she isn't directly available to him, or the girl that he wouldn't really hit up when there's better alternatives, or the girl he doesn't really feel chemistry to but deems her to be acceptable as a sexual partner. He will orbit around these women, build a ""friendship"" that isn't really a friendship, just to get into her pants. This can go on for years. Many women say ""oh no he isn't like that, I've known him for years!"", but in truth the amount of years you've known each other makes no impact what so ever.

And then it happens. The female friend catches feelings, feels attracted, wants to pursue something, thinks he is serious about his interest, they have sex, he ghosts or stops showing interestand then everything falls apart. The girl starts blaming herself, asking what she could have done differently, if something is wrong with her, was he really just a jerk all this time? 

No. Nothing is wrong with you. Stop blaming yourself. You could be a 10 and he could still not view you as gf material.

Men don't befriend girlfriend material types of women. They don't really waste time on building a friendship with women they can see themselves with long term. If they find a woman they want to keep around for longer, they won't bother making her a friend. They will in 9/10 cases pursue her romantically depending on the situation.

It will only lead to heartbreak and confusion and you'll find yourself in a never ending loop of questioning yourself when there's actually nothing wrong with you in the first place.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1035112,public,self,Women: don't date your male friends.

I'm not sure if it's wise to wait for someone who needs time, and essentially isn't convinced. I am also in love with him. We both spent about 4 hours crying over what we were and explained to him I felt he took me for granted and kept me at arms length by not opening up sooner. 

He was in a 7 year relationship that ended 1.5 years ago and I am his first relationship since. He's not sure if he feels scared to make a commitment because of his past or he doesn't know me well enough but we both agreed that initial spark was there and special and he explicitly said he wants to be with me. 

To add some background, he also moved cities just before we met and knows nobody here. I'm not sure if this is influencing his decision to want more time since he explained meeting me was completely unexpected. He is not using apps and we have been exclusive from day one.

The person is nearly 30 years old and I am 26 years old. We talk and they like the same music and have the similar interests in graphic design.

They said they would join but they did not. I waited for forty minutes and then told them another time aka, "" I had to go somewhere"". Of course I did not go anywhere but I had wasted 40 minutes in my day just sitting there basically like some loyal dog.

 I am just wondering if I should just quit speaking to them all together. I did not know it at the time but their name on twitter is one baked bean. I did not know they smoked weed.

We always had some problems with sex. It seemed to me that she didn't feel like she needed/wanted it. I always thought it was connected with something external or that she needed time to get into it. 

Everything else in the relationship was perfect, except we were close to breaking up from time to time because I didn't want to be in the couple without any sexual interaction at all.

Now she is fighting depression and working with a therapist. She told me yesterday that she probably, never wanted me sexually, and I'm, probably, totally not of her type. But at the same time, she says that I'm 8/10. She said that she has fantasies about other guys, which turns her up, but not me. At the same time, she doesn't want to break up (reunited after 1-month ""pause""). We feel good living together and being a couple, we plan the future together and feel inspired by such dreams.

But after all... I feel upset because of it. Half of me wants to believe that she might change after curing depression, changing birth control pills, discover herself more (she always had problems with masturbation). Another half of me thinks that I'm wasting my youth. 

The most disappointing thing to me is that she sends me ""mixed signals"" occasionally. For example, she said two days ago that ""maybe she feels something to me but very rarely."" Also, I remember our first year. We didn't have classic sex (the doctor advised her to wait 1-2 years because of some health problems), but we couldn't get enough of each other. Now she seems not to remember that time and says that, maybe, she was just interested in new experience, but not in me directly.

For now, I'm waiting for her to fix all her health problems and, first of all - depression.

When she did I mentioned jokingly it took her a while to reply. She said she had no idea what I was talking about. 

She gave me a name for messenger and it was an obvious nonsense name. She told me the name on the app is her real name, a quick google showed the name belonged to a low-rank sportswoman, all match stats and team lineups but no photos. 

I thought adding her to messenger would mean more communication. The first day had a bit of back and forth but then she said she liked me and I laughed it off when she asked if I liked her too by sending: ""I'm trying not to like anyone too much before meeting them lol""
Then onwards she routinely messaged me in a certain pattern. Wave emote in the morning, status update in the afternoon and a ""xxxx"" in the evening. At first I thought wave emote meant she was free to chat. I would reply with a question on how she was or whatever she was up to. These were seen but largely lacking in reply. If she did respond it was always short: Good. Alright. Not much.

I knew from that first day that she is unemployed and living with parents ""at the moment"" but could still be busy. At one stage she told me she goes to sleep at 8pm so that explained her not being online at night.

After she did not send any message for a day and a half I sent a message: I thought we would of talked more, you are probably busy and it seems like you are not interested.

She replied immediately that she was trying not to get too carried away by catching feelings and getting hurt. We sent some selfies back and forth, all the ones she sent I noticed were past profile photos on her fb. I think she does not know I can see them on her profile. She probably thinks they are hidden like content.

All her past profile photos have thirsty comments on them from guys with Indian or Arabic names. 
Her profile has 300+ friends, mostly foreign men.
Three of her friends are just her other profiles in the same name.


At this point, both names she has given me are fake and her behaviour seems distant. My mate suggested to invite her on a date to ask her about herself face-to-face.

I‚Äôm (24m) with absolutely no dating experience and minimal contact with any females outside of workplace colleagues ‚Äì sad I know!

Some of my sister‚Äôs friends came to visit and so we all went out for lunch together (Including me and my sister there were 4 guys and 2 girls). I then went back to work and later met them for dinner. Later that evening my sister told me that her friend said I was ‚Äòquite cute‚Äô when asked what she thought of me.

\- When I met everyone, I introduced myself and shook everybody‚Äôs hand to which she responded with a ‚ÄúHi‚Äù 

\- She was rather shy and initially didn‚Äôt speak to me ‚Äì slowly I began to initiate a conversation with her and she seemed to relax a little although I spent most of the time speaking with the 3 guys who were sat closer to me.

\- During lunch I was occasionally looking at her and on two occasions she caught me looking and we locked eyes and smiled

\- She added me on Facebook during lunch

\- When I left for work, I shook everybody‚Äôs hand and she specifically told me that she would prefer a hug ‚Äì I obliged 

\- I was late to dinner and so she was already seated hence no handshake/hug

\- After dinner my sister and the 3 guys headed to a bar ‚Äì me and the girl left. I shook everybody‚Äôs hand and I walked her to her car. It was a 20-minute walk during which she slowly opened up and we had what I felt was a good conversation ‚Äì I was initiating the conversation, asking questions which she would answer and she would occasionally ask me a question. We hugged before leaving ‚Äì she also hugged the other guys although all 3 guys were just normal friends of hers.

\- Once she got home, she messaged me on Facebook thanking me for walking her to her car and we had a little small talk which ended with a goodnight.

I think I like her but I don‚Äôt want to say/do anything that'll potentially jeopardise my sisters friendship.

**Questions**:

Is she interested in me or am I seriously overthinking things?

Does she simply view me as a friend hence why she was kind towards me?

She didn‚Äôt ask me many questions during our conversation, is that because of her shyness or rather a lack of interest?

I've met a girl back in 2018 when I was studying in Brazil - we met on Tinder and met each other in a different city. She invited me over to her place and we ended up going to a party together but only saw each other for a very short time, however, we kept in contact for three years long.

Now three years later we agreed to meet in Italy as she is studying there and honestly, it was a very nice meetup with lots of romantic moments during the three weeks I stayed. Now, I am back in my country again, we haven't talked about making anything official yet she starts posting pictures of us on her Instagram.

For the record, I have never been in a serious relationship so this is all new for me, I am not very good at texting and am a bit stressed about losing contact and interest. But so far we text each day and agreed to call on Thursdays.

Just wondering if anyone with experience has some advice on this...

I've personally not had a great experience with it: it feels like every dating app is built to take all of your money and never actually get you a date. Those few likes I have received have been from bots, people in ridiculously remote locations or people who I am incompatible with.

I've tried tons of apps: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OKCupid, Badoo, PoF, just to name a few. I've generally felt that all of these are built around a system of giving you a few likes when you first install them, which turn out to be fake in some way, and then forcing you to pay to keep interest in you up. It's literally a scam and I don't use these apps anymore.

I've also taken a look at online dating communities such as r/r4r but many of these are out of my age range (I'm 18.)

I'm genuinely convinced at this point that the entire online dating scene, apps or not, is a waste of time and I shouldn't bother. So far I've already seen more girls I'm interested in just going out and starting hobbies like horse riding, and have actually had the opportunity to speak with them without a middle man asking me to pay.

We had one night stand. (I think its a ONS as I don't expect reoccurring sex from him. ) He was slightly more caring towards me after that. He made the food that I've mentioned before and he waited for me after work and he kissed me before he left.

**\[Questionable Behavior(s)\]**  
He came to check on me and saw I was eating cold food, he touched my bowl and said food should be eaten hot. He asked why and I told him I was busy hence I missed my lunch. He questioned what I was busy with.

He want me to make coffee, but not my colleagues. He would text me or I would ask. He would text he had reached home and asked if I'm home safely. He likes to look at me while he walked past and if we make eye contact with each other, he would smile at me.

*Honestly. I don't. It just happened naturally and we are both not drunk. We had reoccurring sex.*

**\[Is he insecure?\]**  
I ignored him because he said that he was tired and want massage *(sex)* I rejected him and told him that he thinks of me when he need sex, I told him I'm going to ignore him. He came into my cafe for a drink and said ""show off already? Never reply to my text?"" I told him ""I've already said I will ignore you. Your fault for not getting the message."" He spammed my mailbox asked if I'm truly ignoring him.

**\[Post Sex Activities\]**  
We cuddle and fell asleep after sex. He seems fine with me staying over. He did question me one night what time do I planned to go home. I jokingly told him if he doesn't want me to stay, I can leave. He shook his head and said no.

He ask about my life after sex and I playfully told him that he won't be seeing me and not to miss me. He asked how many days do I plan to work with school schedule. I replied I'm not sure, if he wants coffee he can ask my colleagues. He said in the morning he will be busy and won't have time to get it. He said working and school will be tedious with my athlete life and told me to rest and take care of myself.

Im 20 and I'm in a relationship with this guy right.
We've been together for 3¬Ω years now and I have entrusted him with everything. We even plan to live together and start travelling and all that.

And we also have this rule where we don't need to go into each other's phone's and stuff cause we trust each other. 
But for some time now there's been this girl he's hanging around and I have some really bad vibes about her. 

I told him that I dont trust her, but he keeps insisting that nothing is going on. So I said okay thats fine.
Because I dont like to restrict him from making outside connections.

But recently this feeling has been worsened. So I went into his Google photos (I shouldnt have done that I know and I regret it now) and I saw him getting reaalllyyy cozy with the same girl. 

He was laying alongside her in multiple pictures. Of course there were other friends there, but it really seemed like they were a couple in those pictures.

And I also saw a p*rn video on his phone about another girl (that I have never seen) and the guy in the video seemed like him. I didn't see a face but based off of body parts it kinda does seem like him. I might be wrong but just putting it out there.

PS: I have very strict parents so im hardly allowed to go out (especially now during Corona), but he does go out often with his friends.

I want to confront him about it, but im not sure how. I might be too dense to notice something out of the ordinary, but this is my first relationship so I dont have that much knowledge about it.

I would really love some advice on this.

I matched with this guy who‚Äôs only in town for a few more days but visits bc he has family here.

So we meet up at this park and have some wine that he bought. (i‚Äôm in europe) Then we go and lay down in the grass somewhere and end up making out and going to second base.  But there‚Äôs people around so we walk around for a bit and we‚Äôre like holding hands and stopping to make out them we go back to the park to a more secluded area. Things happen (if yk what i mean) and he was very unselfish and giving xD. 

Then we get spooked and leave and he didn‚Äôt get to finish (neither did i, and i apologized) but then we sat somewhere and cuddled some and he was kissing me on the cheek and being a bit boyfriendy . he even asked me to get a selfie of us. (this is all AFTER the sex) i feel like he could‚Äôve left but he stayed, until i said i had to go. and he mentioned that we can see eachother again when he comes back to visit (which he will bc his family is here) or if i go to his city (a major city that i want to visit in the near future.) if i was down to do so. and I said ‚Äúyeah if i have an apartment‚Äù

so then i left and i kissed him bye. and went our separate ways, it was like 4 am. he didn‚Äôt walk with me to the bus station (which he‚Äôs not obligated to cuz he‚Äôs not my boyfriend)

I texted him like a day later and thanked him for a nice time and he said he enjoyed also. i liked the message then he said that he hopes we meet again when he comes back to my city. 

i told him ‚Äúyeah definitely, let me know whenever you come back‚Äù and he said ‚Äúsure‚Äù maybe i‚Äôm just overthinking but that ‚Äúsure‚Äù sounds like a ‚Äúyeah we aren‚Äôt joking up again‚Äù

I‚Äôm 21 years old and yet to have a serious relationship. I know that might be normal at my age but I‚Äôm probably one of the few women who want something serious and long term at my age. I haven‚Äôt had the best luck with the people I‚Äôve been around. I‚Äôve always attracted the wrong type of people and they have all left me a little more traumatized than I was. But recently I‚Äôve been in therapy and I have a whole new mindset. I‚Äôm trying my hardest to love myself and recognize my worth and not take anymore shit. 

For the longest time I‚Äôve been telling myself that I can‚Äôt possibly love someone else when I don‚Äôt love myself. So I‚Äôve sworn off relationships for a while, but my therapist tells me that doesn‚Äôt have to always be the case. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm deserving of love and I don‚Äôt have to close myself off completely. But everyone keeps saying to stop looking and love will find you. I don‚Äôt understand that, how do people stop looking? How do people stop longing for that meaningful connection with another person? I can‚Äôt, I want something like that, someone who will understand me and value me and treat me like I‚Äôm a person and not an object. 

I‚Äôm not in dating apps or anything so I guess I have the not looking part down. But how do you expect to meet anyone outside of that. I tried dating apps a while ago again and they have really gone to shit, I realized I don‚Äôt have the energy to keep up with talking to multiple people at a time. I became one of those people who ghost and stop talking after a while. I realized it wasn‚Äôt good for my mental health‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm in an okay space right now and didn‚Äôt want to jeopardize that. 

How do you expect to meet people, and i supped to wait till I‚Äôm completely healed before I try again. Being that is an unrealistic expectation, everyone has something going on right? Does that mean I should stop trying. Is it bad that I want this so bad, not bad enough I‚Äôm willing to just date anyone. I want something real.

So my ex and I were talking last night and he said ‚ÄúHey so listen, There was another reason i dont wanna be in a relationship. All the other stuff was right. But also it was because the ""flame"" died out. I guess. I just sorta fell outnof love i guess. Im not shitting on our friendship or anything its just how it is. I just changed and stopped caring of things. I dont know how but my love just faded away. As time passed i just stopped. My crush slowly faded. Now i just dont feel happy in general. Im not confused. Im nit stressed. I just got over you and everything else.‚Äú
We talked things out a bit more and I asked him if what he said about wanting to marry me someday and all of that was a lie. He said no, but he felt he was going too fast. He feels like he isn‚Äôt deserving of the life that I wanted us to have. 

Something I forgot to mention in my first post was that we had been on and off a few times in the past, not stuff having to do directly with the other or our behavior, but just life circumstances getting in the way. Anyways, I asked him if he ever loved me at all, and if I was ever anything more than a crush to him, he said ‚Äú Yeah. Then as a year past, with the on and off parts of the relationship it kinda wore out.‚Äù

All that‚Äôs fair I suppose. I‚Äôm not angry at him, he‚Äôs not angry at me, he didn‚Äôt say any of this in a mean way or anything like that.

I guess I just feel kind of stupid or embarrassed to myself. For the past month, I‚Äôve been telling myself that ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôll be back, he just needs some time to get stuff in order. He‚Äôs still in love with me, I just know it.‚Äù Other people were saying this too, so I figured I was right. Giving myself a bit of hope because I didn‚Äôt want to think of the worst case scenario. I never really get my hopes up for much, because if I get my hopes up and things don‚Äôt go the way I want, I just get disappointed. 

I think deep down I knew the truth, I just didn‚Äôt wanna believe it. I was in denial, I was naive, I was a lot of things. I‚Äôd heard of this kinda stuff happening to other people, but I never thought it‚Äôd happen to me. I was wrong, as usual. 

I wish he would‚Äôve said all this a month ago, but I understand why he didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not mad at him. I just wish things were different. But I know that‚Äôs impossible, I can‚Äôt change how he feels about me, about himself, no matter how much I want to. The best we can to do is be the bestest of friends, maybe that‚Äôs what we were destined to be all along.

We still love each other, just as friends though. I think a small part of me will always be in love with him, I think most people do when stuff like this happens. I can‚Äôt speak for him, but I‚Äôd like to think he feels the same. 

I asked him if he thinks he could ever be with someone else, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. He has a lot going on, and probably will for a long time, so maybe relationships just aren‚Äôt for him. At the end of the day, I just want him to be happy. He‚Äôs the best guy I‚Äôve ever met and he deserves happiness just as much as I do.

At least now I know I actually can be loved by someone. No man had ever loved me before him. I dated a guy before him, but turns out he never loved me at all and was just using me. 

I want to love again, but I don‚Äôt want to rebound right away or anything. I wanna move on eventually, but right now I don‚Äôt think I can do that just yet. I have anxiety disorder so it‚Äôs difficult for me to meet people irl. Tinder is a thing I‚Äôve considered before but as an asexual, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the hookup culture on there, not to mention I‚Äôm scared of getting murdered or something lol.

* Communication skills/game
   * This is by far the most important thing, you could just wear $10 dollar white shirt and pant and look like a decent guy and if you have good communication and game you you're willing to let go of your ego, you could be best friends with the *any* hot girl(s) you want
* dressing sense
   * You don't need to wear gucci and shit like that, just good colors and well fitting clothes would do wonder and what you wear also affects your confidence so I say its a good thing to do so.
* Height
   * I guess this is kind of like hierarchy things people, I guess most men have good height these days and if you lag this area, try to compensate by working on other areas
* long term value(permanent value indicator)
   * intro: so most men these days usually focus on short term value indicator like posting good photos on IG or creating reels about their looks and buying the latest phone and things like that and focus on this main things
   * College/Marks
      * f
   * Job/money/career
      * All this mainy mean the same thing and money is money and people always want more of it, what I am saying is the way you make money has and what it gives you like (house, cars), don't go behind money instead find a career path which you're interested in and find out how to make loads of money on it and go incrementally, dont think that starting a business is the only way to have lots of money. Make it long term and keep it realistic.

I (18,M)  am going on my first date ever. I am a high schooler, and I have had a crush on this girl for about half a year now. I didn't really approach her because if my looks was to be compared to the JV2 basketball team of some school in North Dakota, she is to be compared to the NBA. Recently, there was this big party that both her and I were invited to. We drank and had little conversations, and I thought things were going ok. Then the cops suddenly came because of the noise, and we all had to leave very abruptly. Luckily, some of her friends and I were fleeing in the same direction. We said our goodbyes as I got a taxi with my friends, and she went on a taxi with some of hers. 

This was when things turned a little awkward for me. One of my friend and one of her friend was pretty close, and they made a phone call while we were in the taxi. Then my friend told me that somehow my crush found out that I was liking her. I thought it was over and was ready to give up.

But 4 days after the party, she gave me a text, and we started texting. We texted, and I eventually asked her to hangout during Saturday to visit this studio ghibli art exhibition. I am super excited, but more than excited, nervous. I asked some of my friends for advice and all they told me was to not act stupid and don't make my bad jokes.

I‚Äôve had several bfs in the last few years, and most of them were very very nice. They let me have everything my way and went above and beyond in the relationship. I felt like I could get away with a lot (not that I‚Äôd do anything bad). They were very attentive to my feelings and needs. 

But my new bf, who I really like a LOT, are very different from those guys.
1) he‚Äôs not as ‚Äúattentive‚Äù to my feelings as my exs. If I get upset about something, he usually just lets me be instead of trying to talk/console me out of it. If I get upset about something, he‚Äôs more inclined to tell me that life isn‚Äôt perfect and that I need to control my own feelings than to console/baby me. I know it sounds stupid but I guess I almost expect my bf to really care about my feelings ? 

2) If I want to do something/ask him to do something but he doesn‚Äôt want to, he won‚Äôt do it. My exs in the past were always doing things for me. For eg, I‚Äôd ask them to bring me something/do me a favor, they‚Äôd almost always do it. But my bf doesn‚Äôt if he‚Äôs not feeling it. 

3) he doesn‚Äôt pay for everything. Most guys I‚Äôve dated have paid for 80-90% of our dates/etc, but I‚Äôd say he pays about 60-70% of the time. I always offer to pay and he lets me. He paid 100% for the first month ish of us dating. Most guys I‚Äôve dated never really let me pay for stuff. We both make good money (he makes more) so I don‚Äôt mind, but I wonder if this is an indication of him being less committed.

I guess overall, he‚Äôs more cold and less accommodating than the other guys I‚Äôve dated. I don‚Äôt know if I was just spoiled before, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs only giving me 50% when I want 100%. 

He always tells me that ‚ÄúIn the entirety of the relationship, you can‚Äôt always get what you want in that moment.‚Äù Basically tells me to look big picture and not get upset about little things.

Is it normal to be this way? I feel like our relationship is good overall. Is it a bad sign that  he‚Äôs not as accommodating? Could he still really care for me and take me seriously? 

Tldr: my bf is not as attentive and accommodating as my exs. Is this a bad sign?
