Currently I've been on OkCupid and Facebook dating. Each time every other female that message me back I find out they're just trying to get money out of me and doesn't want to date even though they have it on their profile that they're looking for a serious relationship and they're looking for this loving loyal guy but then turns around when you message him asks hey would you like my only fans account? Hey do you want to see my ass? Do you want this Do you want that?

If you want all of this stop promoting yourself on these or if you're going to at least put that you're looking for a hookup or something. I'm so sick of getting on these fucking sites and then they agree to add me on Snapchat and then they start sending me nudes and saying hey do you like these? They can be yours as well if you send me like $30. You know what's even more sad than collecting cans? Somebody selling their nudes at this point. I even pointed out to this girl when she tried to sell me her nudes that what's the point of buying that when I can literally go on to the internet and get everything I want for free?

To me honestly if you send me a nude of yourself and remember I'm a guy by the way, I find it very disrespectful. I don't like getting nudes from random women or men or anybody if I don't know you. I don't want to see your naked body I don't want to see your holes I don't want to see anything from you. Unless it's on a porn site I literally don't want to see it.

I'm getting more and more pissed off at the fact that I can't find a woman out in the wild or on the internet without them asking me for money for nudes. Sorry to tell you this but unless you're doing something worthwhile you're basically just another random chick out there. I can find about half a dozen of women that are cosplaying on PornHub who are doing the exact same thing you're doing for free. Girls who are hot as fuck dressing up like kagome from Inuyasha or girls that are dressing up like one of the girls from 2 broke girls in doing sexual stuff. I'm actually trying to keep it you know at least semi clean by not actually expressing too much.

My point is to all this is that if you're going to do this At least be open and honest. Don't you know cast a line into the water and fish us guys out. It's very hurtful and very shitty of you to do. If you don't like being fished don't fish us. That is all",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhmjqf/psa_dont_be_on_dating_sites_if_all_youre_going_to/

I park, and give Bestie an update before walking towards the right fucking hotel this time. I enter the lobby and see the table we sat at a few days ago, and I smile. I confidently walk to the elevators and get in with another person. I push 5. She gets off on 2. I realize at this point that I'm fucked. I can't get the elevator to go anywhere without a room key. Now what am I supposed to do? I didn't come all this way to NOT do it. Fuck!  My only option is to leave it at the front desk and tell him I've left a surprise for him. This is not a scenario I planned for. 

The plan was to leave the package at his door, take a selfie with the door and the package in the background and send it to him. He was to open the door and find a nude photo of me wrapped in a silk ribbon with a note attached ""Don't forget me XO Sarah"" . The note has a kiss from me and a spritz of my perfume.

I leave the package with the front desk person and send him a message. 

""I tried to sneak to your room and leave something at your door, but I can't get upstairs without a key, so I had to leave it at the front desk"" 

What??? He replies 
It's a surprise, you better go to the front desk and find out. 

He's shocked to know that I drove all the way and he's not there. I wanted it to be a surprise. He wished he has known so he could plan for it and try to make time to see me. 

I tell him to keep the ribbon for the next time he's in town and he's mind blown. He tells me he will be back in about 3 weeks and had no plans to lose contact with me. 

I'm fucking beaming with happiness! I'm fairly certain I skipped as I left the hotel to go to my car.

I pointed this out from the beginning and let him know that I'm trying to meet new people and get out of my shell. So he asked me out for next Sunday and I said yes. 

Originally I was actually excited to meet him, but then my anxiety started setting in. As the days went by, the more importance he placed on the upcoming date, the more I began to dread it. My social anxiety comes in the form where I dread situations where I have to interact with new people. 

Yes, it was really starting to weigh on me and so I told him how I felt. I told him I don't want to cancel the date but I asked him if we could postpone it so I could have more time to get comfortable with him because as it stands right now, I know I won't be able to enjoy his company because I'll be too anxious and stuck within my own head.

I expected him to be upset but the WAY he reacted put me off completely. I explained how bad my anxiety was, and for how long it had been affecting me. I've never outwardly admitted that to anyone before but I felt he was owed the truth. 

He ended up calling me ridiculous. He kept talking about how much planning he was doing, and how I had nothing to be anxious about, and how HE wasn't anxious because he had nothing to be nervous about. I sent him a link about how social anxiety works and he only repeated the same thing.

There's always a peak when it seems like you've got a couple of healthy options on the table, and things might actually turn out for the better this time around, but then -- it starts to decay. Those options fall through for one reason or another, and then the new matches you do start getting start be a little ""off"". 

For me, it started a few weeks back when I found myself coming across matches who were getting too attached too quickly (days) and the cadence of the conversation was becoming too frequent and overwhelming. Other matches were too aggressive and/or talked so much that I couldn't get a word in. Choosing not to meet these matches ultimately was the right thing to do. 

However, the new matches since then have only become even less ideal. One match I'd been interesting after talking to for a week revealed she has an STI. Another match I'd had phone calls and video dates with who I was planning on meeting just revealed she still lives with her ex, and plans to continue since they're still close friends just living separate lives at this stage. Of course, the one remaining good match I had a great video call last week and stated she wanted to keep talking and plan to see me IRL has left me on read. 

At this point, I can't help but feel like the not so great matches are getting increasingly worse and more frequent, while the good options are nowhere to be found.

Three weekends ago I went to my friend‚Äôs house warming party at their new lake house with him and his GF along with some close friends family. I get talking to this girl who turns out is his girlfriend‚Äôs younger sister. One drunken thing leads to another and we sleep together that night. No one at the party seems to notice and we go to a diner for breakfast the next day when it comes out that she is 19. I did not know she was that young the evening before, she must have known I was 26/27 (not criticizing her) as I went to school with her sister‚Äôs BF. We hung out as a group for the rest of the weekend having fun but nothing happened between me and this girl on the following day/night as I got the feeling that neither of us wanted to ‚Äòrock the boat‚Äô. 

Fast forward a few days and she messages me saying it was ‚Äòcool meeting you we should hang out again etc etc‚Äô I respond back by being pleasant but not too forward/committal.

I am unsure how to purse this as there is an age gap of 8 years. I have looked online and opinion seems completely divided on this. I would be up for something casual to see where it goes but I would be worried she would not be mature enough for it. Although we had a fun time together before I am undecided. Or on the flip side am I discounting her agency as she is an adult able to make her own decision.

Then I ask for an Instagram or a Snapchat. I swear Instagram doesn't feel as childish, that's a better move. Then we start talking on there.

I send a cat picture and luckily my cat is all white, I guess that's rare. We got a +5 in the points score!

I juggle around conversations until I start to realize who I have more interesting conversation with, then after a day or two I schedule a date, then we meet and maybe we have intense chemistry or none at all.

After every date, she‚Äôs texted me first saying she had a great time and she wants to hang out again. Even after our first date, I could tell she was super interested. She was texting me and starting conversations with me throughout the week, and she told me she was excited to see me again. I‚Äôve never had a girl directly show interest like this, and it‚Äôs kinda freaking me out.

I guess I don‚Äôt really understand why she likes me so much? She was super into me after our first date, but I don‚Äôt think our first date was went crazy well or anything. It was fun, but we just sat in a coffee shop for 2 hours. She also straight up invited me over her apartment for our third and fourth date. Im just not really sure why she‚Äôs so interested in me. We don‚Äôt have a ton in common, and we don‚Äôt really know each other super well yet. Im also just a pretty average guy, i‚Äôm not super handsome or funny or anything. I don‚Äôt know, it just makes me a little nervous.

And I guess i‚Äôm not sure if I like her as much as she likes me. I‚Äôve been having fun with her, and Im looking forward to watching movies in her apartment again this weekend, but Im not feeling a super strong connection that she seems to be feeling. There‚Äôs another girl on tinder than I‚Äôve been on 2 dates with, and I hate to say it, but I might like her more? I don‚Äôt really know.

40,qhq1e8,1635436377,"I've been making the first move as a woman, and I 100% recommend it to other women struggling wth dating! Here's why:","You can read my (26F) other post about how I've quit using dating apps and started going out to places with hobbies I'm interested in, and started being a more social person/approaching people first!

It's been so difficult, but overall much more fulfilling than swiping endlessly on dating apps with such a low ROI. I've had more genuine conversations in person in weeks than I've had online in years, and I've came to this conclusion: 

I think more women should actively put themselves in the driver's seat of their own love lives, instead of the passive recipients, and here is why: 

* Only choosing from the men who approach you generally preselects a certain personality type. 

There are exceptions to this, of course, but generally speaking men who are confident approaching a random woman have likely done it before. This isn't automatically a bad thing, but it does mean you're narrowing your IRL dating options to either your social circle, or the small % of random guys willing to approach you. 

There's a much larger % of guys who are likely shy, don't want to bother you, don't want to be labeled creepy, etc, but would be flattered to be approached by a woman. 

* Online dating apps are a bad gauge of someone, especially men. 

I met this guy at karaoke bar last night and thought he was so attractive. I find him on Facebook today and realize his photos did not do him justice at all. I would've swiped him left on a dating app, and that has been likely the case many times. 

Men are notoriously bad at taking photos, so on dating apps the small % of men who get the majority of attention aren't just the attractive guys... They're the attractive guys who are photogenic and know how to market themselves. This just isn't the vast majority of guys. 

Women who only rely on apps for dates are shooting themselves in the foot because of this reason.

* Women don't have the implied danger of being threatening. 

Many men now are scared to strike up conversations out of fear of being seen as creepy. As a woman, there's little to no threat of it. On top of that, people are generally nicer to women, more social, less on guard, it's just easier to start conversations: even ones that aren't romantic in nature.

The pushback I've often seen from women on approaching guys first is A) they don't want to be perceived as easy/desperate B) they don't want men to just go along with their interest for easy attention/sex, despite not actually being that interested, and C) they're terrified of rejection. 

These are all thoughts I had in my head when I started putting myself out there, but I realized a few things: 

* 1) That the majority of guys don't perceive starting a conversation as easy or desperate at all. The issue is, because women often have no experience approaching, their approaches often suck. 

Immediately telling a guy he's hot is a bad approach. Asking a guy out before you've even had a conversation is a bad approach. Only approaching once you've drank way too much is a bad approach. A good approach is casually approaching, giving a compliment and/or asking a question that makes sense. Talk to him the same way you'd talk to anyone else you just met. 

* 2) Some men will take this bait, but it's easy to tell after some time if a guy is just going along with a situation because it's easy. The other point I want to make, is just because a guy shows initial interest first doesn't mean he's any more likely to be serious. Approaching first just gives you more quantity of options, which eventually statistically will give you more quality eventually. 

* 3) Here's my last point I really want to drive home: Rejection is a part of life. And in my honest opinion, I think it builds character. People always talk about ""the good ol days"" without dating apps but the thing is... People are still out and about. You can still take the in-person route.

TLDR; If you're tired of your attractive qualities not getting extended interaction, then put yourself in places where they can. If you're tired of being treated like you're disposable, then try another method that isn't solely looks focused. 

The point isn't to do what is emotionally safe and always makes you feel good; the point is to do the thing that is best for you in the long run. Most men don't only want sex and most women don't only want followers; the issue is many of us are scared to be vulnerable and we're simply bad judges of people when you put a screen in-between us.

That last point could've also applied to men too, but women, I strongly suggest you consider what I'm saying if you've had trouble attracting the same types of men over and over and over. 

I know it seems daunting and hard at first, but I do think more women especially would be happier with their dating lives if they were more proactive about what, and who, they wanted. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhq1e8/ive_been_making_the_first_move_as_a_woman_and_i/

42,qhq7dy,1635436851,I can't understand what she wants,"So, this is a very long story, I will try to make it as short as possible.

I (20M) met this girl (20F) about three years ago through mutual friends. We then met a lot of times at parties, but we didn't actually bond much.

We started to hang out more frequently last Summer, we were going out almost every night with the same group of friends. We found out that we have a lot of common interests and we started to talk a lot. Often all our friends left the place and I remained lonely with her to talk until 3 am. I started to like her a lot and also my friends were saying that she seemed into me. However, I wasn't able to create much physical contact because she moved away when I tried to sit closer to her and she never looked at me in the eyes. Note that she is a very shy girl.

Finally, we kissed last year at a party after Summer. After the party she acted very weirdly to me, I was holding her hand while we were with the big group of friends and she didn't avoid that, but she was looking very thoughtful and she suddenly went away to sleep lonely. Her friend told me that maybe it was because it was her first kiss and she probably didn't think that she would have done it with me. It also seemed like also her best friend liked me and maybe she felt guilty idk.

However, a few days after the party, I invited her on a date, it went well and we kissed again. Everything felt great. It wasn't. About a week later, we met with other people, at the end we were sitting lonely, I tried to kiss her and she rejected me. After this, she started to ignore me and I did the same. We met about a month later to talk about this and she said ""Sorry I acted like a jerk, it was a bullshit to kiss you"". I never understood the meaning of this. After this talk, we never met again for almost one year.

Recently we started again to meet often with other friends to hang out or at parties. In the beginning, it was a little awkward, but then we gradually started to talk a lot and we became ""friends"" again. We met last week and everyone said she was clearly into me, she was also creating physical contacts, taking my hand, or coming very close to me. However, we met again yesterday and she was treating me like a normal friend, a little coldly.

Now, I hope this wasn't too boring, what would you do if you were in my shoes? I like her A LOT, but all of this story hurt a lot and I don't wanna start again to always be together without understanding her feelings. She is very shy, we never talked about what happened and she would feel extremely uncomfortable if I asked. Maybe I should continue to rebuild a bond when we meet with others and then invite her on a date lonely, but I don't wanna risk to getting friend-zoned.

44,qhqf0c,1635437433,Indian girl I like from grad school can‚Äôt date cuz of her strict Indian Parents,"So, I‚Äôm 10 weeks into my master‚Äôs program. Last month, my last post, I shared that I had a crush on this 27 year old woman. I (21M) talked to her, but overall she was not interested. I was cool with that, why pursue someone uninterested, right? 

Anyway, fast forward a couple weeks later, and I got put in a research team with 3 girls. As I started bonding with the group, I grew a crush to one of the girls (23F) from the group. 

Essentially, there were many green flags: 
- She would reach out to me individually to ask me questions, such as ‚Äúwhere do u work?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat music you listen to?‚Äù Etc. 
- In person, she would play around with me and make jokes, physically touching me.
- One time, after class, she and I stayed talking next to her car for a good time while everybody had left. 
- She would look at my lips whenever I would pull down my mask to talk clearer.
- She would ask me if I got home safe, cuz she knows I drive 40ish minutes to get to campus. 

These green flags made me come to the conclusion that I had a shot with her. So one night after class, I invited her out to grab coffee after class. She accepted. 
The next day however, she invites the other group members for the coffee. 

At that point I tell her I was hoping it would just be the two of us. Then we start conversing.
Turns out she was oblivious to me asking her to coffee lol, she says she is interested in me, just that her parents get in her way. 
This was a message from her when I asked if she would‚Äôve considered dating me if her parents allowed her to date:  

‚ÄúYes absolutely ‚Äî literally the first thing I thought when I saw in the beginning of the semester was that your eyes are literally so pretty omg üòÇüòÇ‚Äù

Now, I‚Äôm not really looking for advice, nor do I have any serious questions. 
It‚Äôs just that my coworker told me to keep being her friend, and it might work out, BUT to also keep your options open. 

I agree with that, as she is not the only girl I‚Äôm currently talking to, she just happened to be my favorite one from the girls I‚Äôm talking to lol. 

So, is it wise to remain friends with her? We have great conversations and we‚Äôre never dry with each other. 
It‚Äôs just, is the advice my friend told me good advice? Should I remain friends with her, and see if it leads to anything? 

Also, it‚Äôs FINE if it doesn‚Äôt, I will remain stoic and virtuous at all time, I‚Äôm just wondering what Reddit thinks. 

Lastly, she is dropping out of the program, since she told me the program is not interested to her as she thought beforehand.

Few months ago I've asked her if that was true - about the ""second try"" - and she confirmed that she had it on her mind but eventually her boyfriend contacts her and yeah... she goes back to him for another break up episode.

Currently, we're texting each other daily A LOT \[ by A LOT I mean from morning till night and we always have something to talk about\], we play video games from time to time and talk, we go out few times monthly and we have amazing time.

57,qhr5n0,1635439555,how do i get over my hangups?,"so couple days ago, i (f24) went on a date with this guy (m24). he was super sweet, super chivalrous, super interesting, (insert continuous singing of praises here) and i had an amazing time. We ended up hanging out again two days later and it was better than the first time and between those dates and messaging now, noone's made me feel so special/liked before. the trouble is, i met him right before he was leaving town (just temporarily here for work) and he's even said that he really wants to see me again, offering to fly me out to see him in the future. And that's all well and good (i know its all very quick and very much atypical but also i'm the kind of person who is generally ambivalent about 99% of people that i meet so f\*ck it, full send, it feels right). 

HOWEVER i've been hurt before with distance and have really never been in a real relationship so even though this guy's been really amazing and has given me absolutely no reason to doubt anything, i can't help but focus on every way this could go wrong; that he could just wake up one day and decide that this is all crazy and what was he thinking or that i'm crazy for going with it; that he's just saying all of this because it's some game that he does or something. The list goes on but the bottom line is i can't get over my hangups and anxieties, lowkey making me deeply distrust him, and i know it's all in my head and i know exactly why these are the conclusions i'm jumping to and it's really messing me up.

69,qhsrdu,1635444113,First Major Fight in the Relationship,"I (24M) have been dating by girlfriend (19F) for around 7 months now. We met at the workplace together, (she works to support her education). She had a crush on me, asked me out, and after a few dates, we got into a relationship. We are pretty attached to each other as of now, and have strong feelings of love.

To give you a context, this is her first real relationship. First kiss, pretty much first everything. I've been in serious as well as casual relationships. I consciously understand the lack of maturity which might come both from the age, and lack of experience, but we've handled it pretty well till now.

Usually I'm not the clingy type. I express better so have no real qualms in things like ""I miss you, Can't wait to meet you"" etc. She's not good at expressing. So 2 days back, something got to me and I told her ""I sometimes feel a little lack of attention. I don't want you to talk to me all the time or be sweet, but simple unexpected stuff which you know makes me happy will put away the small moments of anxiety since I have an anxious attachment style"".

One major fault of mine was I said this while I was drunk. I went to drink with a few friends (both male and female). I sent her pictures (not to make her jealous but because I enjoy sharing my part of life)
She stopped talking. The next day, I called her and in her mind ""Since I doubted her feelings and sent pictures with a girl, she assumed I have started liking someone else"". While she didn't break up with me, she deleted many pictures of ours, she changed my contact name from ""Babe"" to my real name etc.

We did meet yesterday, and after talking, things are back to normal and she's super lovey again.

However, it came as a shocker to me. I personally didn't find the incident ""so big"" to even consider breakup. Specially since we haven't had any other fights except for small insignificant arguments.

Further, I know it's not a lack of feelings because she literally cried her eyes out for last 2 days when she had these thoughts.

But it was a shocker to me and somewhere I'm losing the fear of ""losing her"" when I realized that even issues could lead to breakup without even so much as a discussion.

Is it due to the lack of maturity or fundamental difference? I'll personally never breakup without atleast a proper discussion (since we're in a serious relationship). Another small but unrelated fact is she always talks about our future. I figured it's also maybe due to her attachment with me being her first boyfriend. She constantly plans our future and got upset when I was trying to be sweet by saying ""I wanna be your boyfriend forever"" whereas she interpreted it as ""only boyfriend"" (she thought of marriage in future).

But yeah, even thinking of ending things at one issue was something I'll probably not be fully able to get over.

tl;dr :- Girlfriend removed our pictures from her phone, changed my contact name and considered breakup over first major fight.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhsrdu/first_major_fight_in_the_relationship/

Sorry for the long post! Can I have your opinion on my (25f) situation with a guy (25M):

So we are both two busy professional, when we first started talking on Bumble we would have a very asynchronous conversation, but since we had multiple conversations all at once and would respond to each other under 3h, we got to learn about each other quite quickly.

We went on two dates, both were like 9h long, filled with lot of conversation and laughter. First one at a restaurant: we stayed until it's closure, he drove me to my place we talked until 5 am and kissed quite passionately at the end. I invited him inside for coffee but he refused. We both had a great time and agreed to see each other another time. Couldn't meet for two weeks due to schedule conflict, frequency of texting slowed a bit (now maybe 1-3 texts a day) since we prefer to get to know the other person in person vs text.

We met at my place for the second date, he brought some sushi and we talked until midnight. We then started a movie and watched it for about 5 min. before getting physical and having sex. It was really nice and passionate, we talked until 4 am afterwards. He made a few comments that lead me to believe we would see each other another time, like I will bring you x &amp; y next time...

We both agreed that we had a great time. He sent me a texto when he got home saying thanking me to having him over and that he had fun, I responded the same but neither really wrote textually that we should do it again. I reached out Monday (date was Friday) asking him about his weekend and we have texted since then, but he is only texting me once per day, although it is pretty detailed (maybe 4 messages) and with some jokes. He still hasn't asked me on a third date. I'm wondering if he want to just keep his options open, is not that interested or is waiting for me to invite him over again (he is still living at his parents house while I live by myself). 

What do you guys think of his comportment? I'm really wondering what he want. Or I might just be overthinking. I'm gonna ask him, I just would like some external opinions from other first. Sometimes they only tell you what you want to hear :/

I thought I had completely minterpreted her signs, but still, 4 days after I texted her with a clever joke and followed up with ""I'd like to see you again"" and she accepted, we are meeting for a drink tomorrow.

I'd like to show her romantic interest again, but I feel I have double the pressure now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhuu1o/my_m26_kiss_got_rejected_but_got_a_second_date/

93,qhv1t1,1635450615,Should I ask her out or is it pointless?,"
Hello, I‚Äôm a student (M19) and I got out of a long relationship (2,5 y) 6 months ago. It‚Äôs been a month of uni and I fell for a girl from my year (F20). She seems to be an introvert or shy in general and only stays in her little group of friends most of the time. We‚Äôve talked a little and texted a few times, however she seemed like she was either too shy or not interested at all (objectively speaking). However, I did catch her looking at me a few times during lectures and I am not sure whether this means something or it‚Äôs just a pure coincidence. Despite all of this, I‚Äôm planning to ask her out tomorrow and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a good idea in spite of my friends telling me I should just shoot my shot. Could she be interested at all? Am I overthinking this? Should I just go for it or wait more? Would appreciate any kind of advice even if this seems extremely childish, thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhv1t1/should_i_ask_her_out_or_is_it_pointless/

Mind you I am not on social media often, have a small following and prefer to live in the moment and my account is private. I might have offended one guy because I didn‚Äôt ask about his social media and I did not request to follow to see his pics because honestly I don‚Äôt really care at all. Anyone can portray themselves anyway they want. And I thought he was boring with no personality so I definitely wasn‚Äôt interested in his pics.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhva0u/why_do_men_ask_for_social_media_info/

96,qhve0r,1635451596,A super long story lol,"So I never really posted before but I figure why not now also this is a long one so sorry lol . I met this girl almost 2 months ago off a dating app after about a week we really hit it off and I asked her out. She later canceled saying that she wasn‚Äôt ready for anything serious yet but that she would want something in the future, we basically then started dating but without labels, we talked about our feelings for each other a bonded a lot she even talked about falling in love with me, we FaceTimed everyday and fell asleep on the phone with each other most nights too Without going into any details I know that she has issues which didn‚Äôt bother me at all since I do too. A little over a week ago she said how she really wanted to see me then asked when I was free, after that we set up a date and it was sort of clear that like after this date we‚Äôd be like officially a couple, 2 days before the date however I was close by where she lived and we met up for the first time. I could tell if that she was nervous, we talked in her car for like 8 minutes and then she said she had to goto the store, I offered to go in with her but she said no then kinda just walked away. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was wrong as I didn‚Äôt look bad at all, and we didn‚Äôt discuss anything bad at all. The next day she canceled the date and felt overwhelmed, she the implied that I was the one making it more tense. Even tho she was the one actively pushing the relationship forward and I just fallowed her lead. She said that she still had feelings for me and that she just needed more time. At first I said that it was okay, but after this being the second time she canceled after being so weird this day before, it made me think that her feelings had changed, so after she had fallen asleep I sent her a large text saying how her canceling literally last minute hurt me and how I could tell that something was off, I said how I wanted to stay and make things work but that I needed to know that we were like exclusive and not talking to anyone else, I wanted to know that if I stayed I wouldn‚Äôt just be hurt. I also emphasized how I didn‚Äôt blame her for how she felt tho and that I wanted to stay. next day she was cold and stanoffish which wasn‚Äôt to surprising, she later told me how she saw some people at her job which was traumatic I tried helping her but she didn‚Äôt really let me. the next day she seemed more like her self. And even said how she wanted to FaceTime me that night, but sometime after seeing her therapist she disappeared for a few hours then texted me late at night breaking things off, saying how she lost feelings for me and didn‚Äôt see a future with me. Saying how she thought it was best for us to part ways, I looked on snap and she had unsaved everything and I sent her, all the pictures of me and texts and shit. That really hurt me bc she talked about how she‚Äôd save her ex‚Äôs texts to look back on and see when the times were good and how she had grown, but she didn‚Äôt do that for me. I sent at first a short response on snap and then unadded her, I also unfollowed her on Instagram on tik tok. Later that day I sent a longer text on iMessage, basically apologizing for the short response and saying that she mattered to me and that if she ever wanted to reach out for help I‚Äôd be there it was sent but she never responded to it. To this day a week later she still fallows me on Spotify and still fallows a playlist I made for her, I know that she couldn‚Äôt have forgotten about it, idk I basically wanna know if I even still have a chance with her or if I should move on, because I love her but I don‚Äôt know if the future I want is even possible.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhve0r/a_super_long_story_lol/

98,qhvtdd,1635452854,Hot and cold. Please advice,"Met this women (23, me 29M) a month and a half ago. Had 7 dates, last date she slept over for the first time (we have had sex on a few occasions before though). 

She was always available when i set a date and she was always super happy to see me (kissed me a lot, super sweet, etc...) I'm not much of a texter (so you know i don't over do it) but i make an effort and respond in a fairly acceptable time. 

How ever last date we talk a bit and she told me she was werided out about a freind of mine who mentioned me to her. I didn't understand why and she said ""i dont know why it bothered me"" and i just told her ""he knows i have been seeing you as he was there the day we met but im not going around telling people you are my girl or anything"", she replyed ""i dont care about that, never mind"".Anyways we went back to other stuff but it seemed like something there kind of changed.

She was less affectionate the rest of the night and she was kind of quite to leave in the morning. She did how ever say she had a great time after, etc, etc... and at 1 am that same day (it was a saturday) she told me she was just thinking of me and had a nice idea for us to do next time we met"". 

I proposed Tuesday to meet and she told me ""i'll let you know Sunday, but Tuesday came and went and nothing was brought up. I didn't push and made other plans."" During this week her answeres to my texts were 16 to 24 hours aparts. She wasn't cold cold but more than before and shorter answers.

She ended up saying ""work has been crazy, i dont have time for anything anymore"" ""have a lovely day &lt;3"" . I learn not to go crazy when women pull away a little so i just replied ""Better that than the alternative. Work pays off!"" ""hit me up when your schedual frees up ;)"" ""have a lovely day too"".  TO what she wrote ""weekends are ok but week days will now be complicated"".

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking something that seems to go smoothly or you feel a bit of fadding from her (or a complete non interest - which i don't see but...)? Any advice to how to proceed?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhvtdd/hot_and_cold_please_advice/
