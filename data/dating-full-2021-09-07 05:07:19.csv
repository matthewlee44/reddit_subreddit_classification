Actual constructive and both-ways engaging debates, Black Humor, Sarcasm and taboo things/dirty talk, that is everydays routine on our shifts. She was gaming a LOT back in the day, but since one event in her life with her ex + work overload led to health problems - She is ""past the hard time"" (her words), but the gluten free food and specific diet stuck to her.

She also likes to give a try to different cussinues, but the gluten-free diet is restricting ...  


The thing is, my history is quite a comedic tragedy. I got used as a mobile wallet, emotional pillow and as a thing to be used to progress in a work, the last one was literally emotional abuse that took a friend of mine to get me out... and to be honest, I once exploited a situation where one girl I knew wanted to have her 1st time - after 2 nights she started to talk how she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me quite fanatically, so I tried to be honest and put her back in reality, asking what she truly wanted out of the situation now and before starting it, she acknowledged it and we moved our ways... I really felt like a Douche and I still do to this day. But I really did not wanted to emotionally exploit her, or at least escalate it...  


All of this is my fault, I do not seek for any victim-hood, I really despise that mentality of competetive victimization.  
But I would like to ask how to proceed,  for my total lack of ""social EXP"" always led to dead ends. For the last 3 years I tried to keep to myself, lived in my bubble and now she pierced it...  


I had a rule: Workplace is no place for romantic(or any intimate) relationships for it is too easily to be abused - guess that is irrelevant now ...   
Another rule: DO NOT repeat the situation with the girl that wanted for the first time... DO NOT EMOTIONALLY EXPLOIT

I just do not want to F\* it up, like I always do, for once I try something, it will never be the same again even if we agree upon it...

So I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 1 year and 2 months now. She is my first girlfriend and my first for basically everything and we love eachother to the core. I genuinely love this girl so much and would like to have her for the rest of my life. We’re currently in a long distance due to me being in the Air Force but we are handling our relationship very well. 

Well, today we were having a regular talk and all the sudden we get to the topic of vasectomies. To shorten up the story, once we live together she wants me to get a vasectomy for the time being that we don’t a baby, she then wants me to reverse the vasectomy for when we are ready to have a kid, then once we are done having children, she wants me to get another vasectomy to close it up. I don’t think she’s asking for much right.

Yes we want kids, but I don’t want to get 3 surgeries in my lifetime on my balls. I told her I would be willing to get a vasectomy once we’re done having children but that’s it. She didn’t like that. I don’t want a reversal due to the very high cost and the potential side effects it can bring. I asked could we not just wear condoms and she said “what if it breaks” and that there is still a risk of getting an unwanted pregnancy. I tried saying that the chances of that happening were slim if we used the condom correctly but it didn’t phase her. 

I am scared of the surgery itself and personally feel uncomfortable doing it. I expressed to her that I was feeling anxious, pressured by her, and not loved by her due to the fact that she would leave me because I wouldn’t be willing to get a damn surgery. She said that it’s viable to leave the relationship for that reason because of her concern for any unwanted pregnancies. 

I really don’t want to do a vasectomy just to get it reversed but i am trying to consider for her. I don’t know what to do and am upset.

He suggested meeting on the Sunday when he was back but didn’t text me until 8pm that night when he got home asking if I wanted to do something in an hour.... at 9pm on a Sunday. I’d been out drinking the night before and was super hungover so I turned him down initially and then said okay, sure, we can do something - to which he responded he’d actually be bad company so to leave it and we’d do something a different day of the week. Since then, nothing. Radio silence. I asked him yesterday if he’d like to go for drinks today and my message came up as delivered but he hadn’t opened or responded.

We are not even a couple yet. She also said she wouldnt introduce to friends until a few months have passed (i also agree). But my thinking is why would i meet your family before ive met your friends??

 fast forward to today am in 12th grade, school opened yesterday and I hoped I'd see her again and minority of the students actually came to school not even 2/5th of the school while other prefers online and I didn't see her yesterday which just confirms that am never going to ever see her again .-.

Perhaps it’s my age, (22m), but I’ve found that there is zero trust that you can put into someone’s words when they message on dating apps.

it feels that you are LITERALLY better off just assuming that everything coming from their end is just BS so that you don’t waste time actually thinking you’ll get somewhere.

For example, met a girl on Hinge. I liked her and she matched me right away. We were talking for a bit, then I asked if she’d like to go on a date, specifically this Friday. Then I asked for her snap/number.

She said she’d “love to” and that she would let me know if she had to work Friday by the end of the day and if so, she’d try to make plans the following week with me.

So we start talking over snap and it’s a good conversation. She apologized a couple times for taking a bit to respond and I told her it was ok and that there’s no need to apologize, life is hectic (we had talked about how busy both our lives were). We discussed our pets and she had mentioned that she wished I was able to meet a couple that had passed. She even saved some of these chats.

I then texted her goodnight pretty late and asked about Friday. I got a response this morning that she couldn’t make it. Then found I was unmatched on hinge and blocked on snap.

Below I’ve written up a text conversation between a girl I dated and myself. This happened about halfway through the time we saw each other. We were seeing each other for over a month but would see each other 2-3 times a week and I really care about her. She broke up with me a month ago but I feel like I could learn from this and do better going forward. This conversation I feel like was when I realized that this was the beginning of the end. Thank you for any advice. 

Her: Hmm I guess it depends what I’m thinking. Honestly, I’ve had a lot of up and down of how I think this will turn out. It’s hard to know really. I’m glad you’re enjoying the new job.

Me: I sensed that sometimes. I appreciate you hanging in there with me and for being honest. Hate that you have an up and down feeling. How are you feeling now? Of course you know I’m willing to talk anytime about anything. If it’s right thing for both of us then I’m hoping it works out. Well I’ll ask you this as well. What are your concerns with me?

Her: friend thinks I just need to take a break from dating people, but the truth is I’ve never had anything that lasted long term. It’s always a bunch of 1-2 month things. I analyze everything wayyy too much. Always trying to figure out why I do what I do and why other people do what they do. Sometimes I’m not sure if we really click. And maybe that comes with time. I like you because you let me take my time and don’t push me further into it than I’m ready. But sometimes I think I freaked you out and you’re afraid that you’ll scare me away so you hold back. You said you dated someone for 6-7 months but never made it official that makes me wonder if things will also go that way for me. I think I’m staying because I never stay. Because I’m trying to figure out if I confuse intensity with intimacy. The extreme highs and lows of bad relationships can have an adrenaline rush to them. So what if the reason I’m not sure this is right is actually because it’s just different and maybe that’s a good thing.

Me: Truthfully that’s how most of mine have been too. Especially online dating. The longest “relationship” I had was during this past year. We dated for 6-7 months. I threw the idea around the 3-4 month mark of being gf/bf and she just brushed it off. Just kinda sucked you know. I broke off our “relationship” with her. I do want something that’s long term if it’s right for both of us.

Her: yeah it doesn’t seem like she wanted something serious.

Me: I also over analyze everything as well and it’s a terrible habit of mine. I’m trying to learn to just relax and trust the process if it’s meant to be. I do wonder if we really click sometimes. I feel like we have most of the time. I think we can and will! I’m hoping that comes with time. I try to be open and vulnerable around you but I don’t get that back sometimes. Honestly I do get frustrated because I am always initiating and I’m like I think she likes me but I’m not sure. Yes, you’re exactly right. I did get a little freaked out and I actually thought I freaked you out so of course I don’t want to ruin it over a stupid mistake on my part. Truthfully (I know I do not need to say this but I’m being brutally honest) you are the best girl I’ve dated in a long time. It’s not even close.
She was 29 so I would’ve guessed that she wanted something serious. She wasn’t sure where she wanted to be in life. She actually said idk what her purpose in life is. So I think she had a lot of stuff going on for her. At the end of the day it wasn’t the right person so I pulled the plug. I think you and I are similar in a lot of ways. I feel like I understand you and I hope you understand me.

Her: I think I just still have some walls up. I don’t like to share too much when I’m not sure how things will go because then it’ll just feel like a waste and I’ll feel raw. And I don’t know how I fell. And maybe I’m numb or maybe we just don’t fit or I don’t know. That’s just where I am. 

Me: You do but that’s ok. They’ll come down when they’re ready. I don’t want it to be a waste thought. It’s still early and it sounds like a lot of confusion. Wish it was easy. Regardless of what happens in the future I just want us both to be happy. I think we both deserve that.


Her: The last relationship I had, I did have sex with him. I felt very obligated and guilted into, but I still agreed to it. I did it with a good conscience. Before, I kinda thought he was arrogant and maybe a bit manipulative. Afterwards, I was very attached. I was do or die so quickly. He made all kinds of promises. He talked about getting married. He talked about wanting to be careful about having sex since it was my first time, but then kinda pushed me into it. In the end he ghosted me. So I guess all those promises were lies. I agree with you that it wasn’t something I lost. I learned a lot from that. It was more the creation of a connection than the loss of a piece of myself. At the time, I was certain sex before marriage was all well and good. When he ghosted, I knew I couldn’t connect on that level with someone again unless they were my forever. 

Me: I absolutely hate that happened to you. You deserve better and it sounds like that guy was a piece of shit. So many people have had a bad experience like that with sex. I had a bad experience in a different way. I don’t know how long you guys dated or how recent it was. I promise you one day you will let go from that and move on. You will be able to connect with someone like that again. I don’t know if you feel that it’s necessary but you can always talk to a therapist about that. They might be able to help you process it better. Just a thought.

Her: Yeah, I don’t know. I went to therapy a while back about something else and then stopped. I’ve thought about going back. It’s expensive. Most of my friends know about it though, so that’s helpful. The way it happened was not super cut and dry. I have described explicitly step by step what he did to one person. She said that sounds more like rape. Technically, I did agree, so I don’t think it was. I think he took advantage of the situation, but I don’t think he raped me (at least not the first time lol). I also shouldn’t have slept over and that was my first mistake. But he had a lot of issues. He also was like twice my size so that didn’t help matters. I don’t know. I’m fine really and I don’t want this to affect us. Obviously, it probably will, which is why I’d rather you know. But I would rather it not.

Me: I appreciate you sharing. Really that is terrible and I’m sorry you had to deal with that. It’s almost never clear cut and dry. I know they’re expensive but if you feel like it could be a benefit then worry about the costs later. There’s gotta be ways to help. Your health is number 1. I don’t want it to affect us either but I know it could and I’m willing to work through it if we can. Just know that I have your back and I’m willing to listen.

Her Well I appreciate it.

I get so pissed off reading that ex boyfriend portion. She is a fit 5’8 girl so this guy must’ve been massive if he was twice her size. The guy ended up ghosting her. Just hate that she had to go through a negative experience like that. I tried really hard to be patient, understanding and kind to her. 

So this was a few weeks before we ended things and I really feel like this was a critical conversation that led to us ending things. I want to be able to learn from this and do better? How can I? 

Tl;dr

Saw a girl for over a month. We had a lot of conversations and lots of dates in that timeframe. I really care about her. Above is a critical conversation we had about halfway through our time together. Really just want to learn how I can do better? I’m really bummed it didn’t work out and I kinda blame myself since I had anxiety and probably pushed her too hard. I’d love to reconnect with her but we haven’t talked since she broke up with me a month ago.

Hi guys! So I need some advice on a situation that happened to me literally just last night. A few of me and my girlfriends got wine drunk and my roommate that I dorm with in college, who I’m very close with, got a lotta too drunk. Idk if that’s a saying but I’m using it. she and my other friend B have just recently met and are becoming newer friends and B is openly bi-sexual. B always makes flirty jokes towards us but it’s never taken seriously at all. B started to be the same way towards L (my roommate) and L was liking it. Later that night B and L decided they’re sleeping upstairs in B’s bed together while me and my other friend sleep downstairs on the couches. as I was falling asleep B woke me up and told me I need to make L get out of her room because they ended up doing some stuff and L told B she was bi-sexual and wanted to experiment and B let it happen. But L has a boyfriend and she has been with him for 4 years. L told B she was doing to tell her bf about what happened but I don’t believe her and I’m not sure if I should bring up what happened to her and talk to her or if I should just let it go and maybe B will talk to her. I don’t I’m shocked and feel very bad for her bf. B told me it sounds like she’s done this before (cheated w/ a girl) keep in mind she was very drunk like slept on the stairs drunk. So I’m not sure she would remember. I don’t know I should feel so bad.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,993873,public,nsfw,best friend cheated on bf w/ girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjmp1m/best_friend_cheated_on_bf_w_girl/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,

I enjoy spending time with my partner. She spends nights over a couple of days a week and it feels so nice to be next to her in bed. We cook together, we take turns to clean. We do sports together.

Greetings, fellow redditors, i am in this sticky situation that i don't know how to get out of, so bear with me. So there's this girl(i am 19M, btw), who also happens to be the sibling of one of my buddies from highschool. We've met during the houseparty of my friend like 2+ish years ago, and it went pretty well, the next time i got her number, (sometimes i texted her, sometimes she), played some games together and that's about it. Fast forward to nowadays, where my buddy invited me to his house to hang out/play games again. My initial intention was to at the end of the day, personally ask her out to hang out with me alone(specifically not label it as ""date"" just for the reason of knowing each other well, and if that scenario went smoothly too, then ask her to date). I was getting ready for that, but personal tragedy happened, not long before leaving my house i got the text that one of my closest friends suddenly died in an accident. I was devastated by the news, my confidence went ""out of the window"" but i decided to go to their house anyway(i shouldn't have done that and go some other day, but i did anyways).

Siblings say that the day went solid, but for me personally it was an operational failure, i acted all-defensive, dodging questions and acting all shady(which never happened to me before when i'm around people). I also chickened out and never got to ask her to hang out 1-on-1, i felt terrible even more. (But also i'm so glad that this one was not the ""first impression"" i made, since she saw me twice before in her crib)

The next day, buddy friend of mine, he felt that i was not acting as my usual self, so he asked what's wrong. I told him everything, and at the end, being brutally honest person that i am, i asked him just in case that would he be okay if i did ask his sis to go out with me sometime. He agreed and said that ""he wouldn't mind either way"" but he also shared some tip that i found interesting, according to him, she is not a huge fan of going to random places, acting shy and all that, so she most of the time is asking her friends to come to her house instead. He said ""it depends on how she's feeling honestly and if you manage to ask her to hang out and she agrees, then be my guest"". Remind you that this happened like a week ago, and i decided to not ask her out until i'm done with my depression first. Right now that i feel fine, what should i do about it, i can't meet her in person right now, so the only chance i have is through texting her personally. I just don't know what to do honestly, initiate a conversation then at the end i should ask her out or else? What should i ask her out? If she doesn't agree to go to the place that i'm proposing like a **café** but instead inviting her to her house again(which is not implying what you think it is and its in a casual manner supported by the fact that her parents will also be there, should i also agree to that no matter the circumstance?)

I am so confused right now and can't think of an solid option, what should i do?

We’re both about 30 and I can’t recall having the same connection before. The attraction was instant, the excitement was constant, and I know for sure that this was mutual. Our first date was over 7 hours with no awkward pauses or forced conversation. We kept thinking of other things we wanted to do together. When I asked about doing it again, she just beamed and excitedly nodded her head. We even texted for a while after I dropped her off. To be honest, she checked off nearly all the boxes I have. Great make out session too.

Next few dates were just as great. She would hit me up all the time (I played it cool even when she double texted) we never were at a loss of things to talk about and it just felt effortless and right. I wasn’t getting ahead of myself though, I was still getting to know her and knew I needed to take that time to do so. Third date she invited me to hang out with her and a friend one night, and she was excited as ever. We came back to my place to watch a movie and at one point we started making out. Suddenly she said “Wait… I’m not ready to get married right now.” 

Of course this confused the hell out of me, it was both too intense and also pushing away. As weird as that was, after talking a lot, I found that what she meant was that she wasn’t ready for a committed relationship (I didn’t ask her) due to being in a transitional period of her life and not being ready to stop exploring the other side of her bisexuality (I told her I didn’t mind but she got visibly upset and said she didn’t want to feel like she was cheating). I calmed her down, she asked to spend the night, and we fell asleep with her holding my hand to her heart. But I felt awkward and uncomfortable as hell.

Next day she told me she wanted to slow down because she felt things were getting too intense too fast. I was ok with that, but still freaked by the marriage comment and conversation. As we talked it went to being “casual” then she asked if we could just pause and maybe pick up later. I’ve know and have had women say things like that, but this one seemed sincere to some extent at least. She was running hot and cold and just as confused as confusing. At first I said okay, but a few hours after the conversation she started to talk to me about other things and I felt like I couldn’t do it. I wanted her for real, and I don’t like being treated as Plan B and I don’t put myself on someones hook.

I tried to hold off and get space but the next day- with some egging on by a friend tbh- I told her it didn’t work for me and I wasn’t interested in playing games. She said that was fair and asked if we could be friends. I told her that wasn’t what I wanted, she said we weren’t on the same page, and something about her tone really hurt and I reactively said that I don’t do flaky so goodbye. 

I felt bad the next day. I apologized, but she had blocked my number. She took me off FB, I took her off Snapchat. A week later I felt bad enough that I sent an apology letter, figuring she could discard, read, or save it for whenever she was ready. It was just an apology, no asking to go out again, but said things I appreciate about her and that I’d like to talk and if she was willing, she knew how to reach me. 

It was a short fling, and it sucks to be over. I stand by my boundaries, but I closed a door I really wish was still open. Maybe I had to and this is for the best, or maybe I could have just been hands off and see how things unfolded. I don’t know, but the uncertainty drives me nuts if I think think about it.

A month ago, I (m38) started talking to and seeing a woman (turning 30 soon) for over a month now. We've done virtual dates and ample phone calls on the regular, and we clicked very well with chemistry and aligning on what we're seeking. Something that happened, though, is that initially, she suddenly pulled back and told me she needed to step away from dating altogether to focus on herself. I was completely understanding although disappointed since we had got the ball rolling with moving forward in building the early steps a relationship. We both left open the door to reconnect.

Before this past weekend began, she texted me after weeks of silence. She apologized for flaking on me, and stated that she would work to regain my trust. She said that as she continues working on herself, she'd like to be friends and work toward an eventual relationship. This sounded all good on my end. A day later, however, is that she began asking me questions about how serious I was in wanting children, and then laid on a pretty well defined plan on her end to either have a child within 3 years with whoever her partner is, or go at it alone if she is still single in 1.5 years. Her plans were very detailed, all the way down to how she plans on having her father who will be retiring soon provide child care, and how she is buying her own home very soon near her parents. Everything sounded like it revolved around her and her family. It was a lot to process, and while I am not against having children and this was discussed initially, I was taken aback at how there was a very short deadline to do so (especially considering she is not even 30 yet) and how it almost seems like her partner's input isn't really part of this equation.

I expressed my concerns, how my immediate relationship goals are more micro (i.e. we can agree that kids are on the table, but let's establish this relationship first before setting annual deadlines) and admitted that her presenting this information a day after rekindling our connection after our false start was just a lot to process in a short time. Plus, you can do your best to plan your life out, but it doesn't always work out that way. I am attracted to her and really was excited to spend more time with her in person, but she was not thrilled with my questions and voicing how I felt caught off guard about the timeline to the point where she ended the conversation and passive aggressively wished me the best.

There's part of me that feels like the way she went about this was not the best way, and we needed to have a few more in person dates to talk about this more comfortably after getting a better feel for each other, but then there's the part of me asking, ""Did I just blow up my last shot at my age of meeting someone who was interested in having kids with me?"" So many questions running through my head, especially with her need to work on herself to suddenly needing to plan out her pregnancy timeline with a hypothetical partner ASAP.

I've reached back out to her and asked if she'd be willing to talk over phone or facetime, because it all happened over text, which didn't help, but she declined. It is starting to sound like she was more interested in finding a guy to fulfill her main goal of becoming a mom more so than finding a partner who she would be happy with even if she could not have a baby for some reason, which I don't think is a very healthy way to enter a relationship. Her idea of how she wants it all to play out is very particular and ideal to her own specifications. There's other possible concerns as well in relation to how she seems to have pretty bad self esteem and body image despite being attractive and having a beautiful body, and I'm wondering if she thinks having a baby will fix that void in her.

I think it's totally reasonable for women who plan to have children to want to know where a guy stands on it so as not to waste time, and I did not lead her on with that, but does anyone else think that her plan was a LOT to lay on a guy very early on and basically removed my voice from the potential future of the relationship altogether?

The thing that surprised me was his reasoning. He said something along the lines of ‘I don’t necessarily use Tinder I only use it to look at the profiles. I know Tinder is casual and I am not interested in something casual’. 
But why would you have Tinder if you are not using it? 
A couple of days later I just had to ask him because it did bother me a little bit. He replied saying that he understood why I asked this and said that he likes to see the different profiles.

I deleto'd all of them this weekend. I also deleted my profiles from all of them except Hinge.   


I (27M) realized these apps were becoming very detrimental to my mental health, so I got rid of them for the time being. I know it's hard to meet people without the aid of apps these days, but it stopped being worth it to me over time as I realized that the environment of constant rejection, either through not getting matches for weeks at a time, or through getting ghosted by matches I did have, was filling me with self doubt and causing me to question my worth. I can handle rejection on an individual basis just fine, but when it's all I experience for months at a time, it starts to feel pretty awful and was making me feel like I just wasn't good enough for anyone.   


The developers behind these apps also seem to want to monetize loneliness by putting most of your potential matches behind a paywall. ""Someone likes you! But you have to pay for premium to find out who!"" It doesn't seem like these apps want users to actually find a relationship, at least not until they've paid for premium app services for a bit. The one app that didn't do this as egregiously was Hinge, which is why I only disabled my profile there instead of deleting it altogether. I may try Hinge again in a few months.   


I also realized that I hate how transactional these apps made dating feel for me. You have to market yourself like some sort of product so you can stand out among thousands of other guys, instead of just being a human being and getting to know someone naturally. It reeks of late stage capitalism.   


If apps have worked for you, awesome! Some people luck out. But if you've found yourself feeling the same way I have after using dating apps, you're not alone. Consider doing the same. Your mental health is important, and these apps might not be worth the cost in the long term. I'm taking this time to find a therapist and get some help in undoing some of the toxicity from these apps.   


That all said, I'm welcoming any advice for meeting people in your late 20's without apps!

-Using filters. This isn’t Instagram. It’s ok for your skin to have pores.

-The MySpace selfie angle taken from above so you look skinnier and have fewer wrinkles. Unless you are two feet shorter than me, this is not how you will look IRL. 


For men:

-Wearing a hat in every photo. I care less about you balding or being bald than I do about your lack of hair insecurity.

-Not listing your height or lying about your height. 


For both:

-No body shots or only body shots. I would like to see your body and I would like to see your face.


-Only using old pictures. If you are 40, please don’t post a picture of you when you were 25. You look different now; we all do.

Perhaps it happens all the time but I am recently single and rusty at dating so maybe I just don't get it yet. Curious about what people think of this situation:

Met a guy on an app. I think both of us thought the first date went well - he asked me out for a second date immediately at the end of the first and we met up again 2 days later. That date went well also albeit I let him know though I was looking for something serious, am interesting in taking things slow. Despite this, he still immediately asked me out for a third date which I agreed to - taking it slow in my head meant more on the physical / exclusive side, not from the perspective of spending time together as I feel that is important to decide IF you want to be exclusive with that person. We planned to meet up last weekend and he followed up the day before to see how my day was going etc. I responded and also asked him what he wanted to do for our date the next day. Earlier the following day, he texted me that he ""actually couldn't"" hang out that day and apologized with no explanation or attempt to reschedule. 

I don't plan to reach out to him again but was definitely curious about why someone would be so hot and cold. He was the one to initiate all the dates / follow ups and seemed genuinely excited about me and it seemed like it changed in a span of 12 hours for no reason.
