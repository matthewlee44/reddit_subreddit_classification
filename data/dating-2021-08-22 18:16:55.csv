0,p9ncnq,1629674312,I need help with the way I feel...,"I really wanted a girlfriend for a while and I met this girl on an app (I'm 16 and this was my first date). She looked really cute and humble so we talked a bit on message app and we got along pretty well. She lives a good distance of bus rides so we decided to plan a date. Today was that day and she is really nice and cute but a part of me strongly told me when the date got started and we went on the bus that I really didn't want to be here and maybe I shouldn't be in a relationship and now I'm completely lost, we planned to do something tomorrow too but idk if I should tell her that I think I don't want that or to take another shot at it. I have a couple of theories on why I feel that way, in a way my brain tells me that I don't want to force a relationship on me and should get a girlfriend just by being around people like at school, gradually building a relationship you know? She has big plans in life that I don't think we might be compatible in the long run. Anyways I really need help with this if anyone could.

Go out last night and I ask what he's looking for in a relationship and he describes everything I want without me saying a word: someone to grow with, long-term, have kids one day. I'm so happy!

We start talking about communication styles and I mentioned honesty. ""If something is wrong I want to know. I want a guy who can communicate his emotions so we can talk it out.""

Then he hits me with the ""you're so great, I love hanging out with you, we've had so much fun but I just see you as a friend and I felt like I should tell you in person and you did nothing wrong.""

That's great, glad he told me, but then he goes on to say he knew he was going to dump me before we spent the day together. He said he told his friends/parents about me and his friend grilled him about why he wasn't interested in me and he couldn't give an answer.

5,p9nogi,1629675490,Letting a new girl in after past trust issues,"I (25m) have been seeing this girl for the last 3 weeks gone on 4ish dates hooked up I slept over etc. I like her, the issue is that because of all my shitty dating history I feel a wall. I want to open up to her I want to let down my guard around her but I can’t. She’s sweet, funny, beautiful and dork in the best way. But I feel like I’m watching our interactions from a 3rd persons perspective. Sex feels like I’m running on preplanned track, I’m into it and then I get hit with fear and boom I’m watching it from the outside.

I’ve tried being more open with her but it feels like fake openness. When I was younger I had the issue of falling too hard for people, I got out of a 5 year relationship early last year where I was cheated on and yoyoed and I was an emotional mess during and after it. I developed Ed after it as well, and sex even with meds has been hard for me with new people. I think subconsciously I’ve put up my walls. Ive gone on a lot of dates since hooked up with a good number and had a 5 month relationship with another girl who was more like a fwb (I wasn’t really attracted to her but we interacted a lot but I also felt fake with her too). I guess now I’m faced with what I thought I wanted and I’m terrified and not enjoying it because I won’t let myself. 

I don’t think it’s her, I think I’m just scared to get hurt. Like she visited her family recently so hasn’t texted as much and boom I started brooding and worrying. I definitely like her but it’s just showing itself in all the wrong ways. It’s like the part of me I created to be able to move on and date new people doesn’t feel. And now that I want to be close to someone I can’t be because I’ve suppressed all my feelings for so long. I think I’m at a vulnerability stalemate with her, where we are both shitty at opening up. 

How long till I can trust again? Should I just end things since I have issues? I just want to feel the same excitement I used to for people, instead of this fear of being used and lied to. Does it get better?

6,p9nsxv,1629675931,"25 and (might aswell be) virgin, advice?","As the title says, I'm 25 and despite losing my virginity at 17, I've only had sex once in my life. It was with a prostitute whilst in a foreign country and I was absolutely hammered at the time, so I feel it doesn't really count. I've also never had a girlfriend, never dated at all, and currently have no female friends. Now just to dispell some prejudgements about me, you're probably picturing some fat ugly unhygienic basement dweller infront you, not true in the slightest. I definitely have some self worth and confidence and despite my complete lack of experience I have a alot going for me, I feel. I'm not the best looking guy out there but I'm definitely not ugly either, I'm in very good shape and physically fit and have been all my life, I started training and boxing when I was a kid and have always kept it up. I also dress well and always have, these things I've been complimented for my whole life and I'm known for it. I shower everyday and look after myself and my body, to a very strict and disciplined degree. I'll try to give you all an accurate picture of myself and why I'm in this situation.

How did it happen? I've put it down to a number of reasons, the main one would be lack of interest in my earlier years, I went to an all boys school in the UK, which obviously meant no interaction with girls there, and when I look back all i was interested back then was my own little bubble: family life, friends etc, dating sex and romance just wasn't a priority for me, despite being a straight guy with a healthy libido. Another reason is being a natural introvert which including shying away from clubs, pubs and drinking culture, which is a massive integral part of coming of age here in the UK. I like socialising with friends but I've just never been one for drinking and drugs, obvious health risks (I take my health and fitness seriously) but also trust issues, which I think is telling of a deeper reason here and could explain alot. I don't like being the centre of attention and in fact my already limited social media presence online has 0 posts, I don't like expressing myself in any kind of open and wide-reaching way and I almost never take photos or selfies. I have lived a sort of 'bubbled-off' life, I've never really been involved in much in the context of social expression, I tend to keep to my comfort zones and don't give people the time of day outside of my already long-established family and social relationships.

I understand this needs to change and despite everything I've just said I have alot of confidence, I don't put people on pedestals, I don't feel anxious or nervous around people and as good as this sounds I think it also has a drawback: I think people are generally quite weary or afraid of me. For starters I'm not a big guy (5'9-10) and only around 65kg, but like I said I train regularly and have a good amount of muscle mass (which I know isn't scary off the bat), have an incredibly deep low voice (I'm talking Vin Diesel deep) which I noticed around aged 13-14. I also have a no-nonsense personality when interacting with people I'm not close to, I'm very straightforward to the point where I always keep to the matter at hand when interacting with people, very down to business and put myself first etc, and I'll be honest I do quite like this as it gets to the point and earns you respect and for this people don't try to take the piss with me take advantage, but it comes at cost which is I'm probably viewed as boring, dry and intimidating. Despite this, I'm actually quite a quick witted and funny guy when I open up and talk for hours and it's something I need to work on. Its possible I might have some kind of intimacy disorder which I wanted to get some perspective on.

Another reason, and this is a big one, is poverty. At age 16, just after secondary school, my family situation became a single mother household with me, my mother and two younger siblings in which case my mother didn't have a job and had been abused for 20 years and was seriously depressed, we moved from one rundown shithole to another (total 3 times) and we had very little money and during this time it was incredibly hard, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with myself - working one dead end job after another to no avail and what money I earned went towards the house and my family. Even if I wanted to go clubbing with friends etc I couldn't as I simply couldn't afford it, I went into a major depression myself and I eventually went to stay with a relative abroad it was then when I lost my virginity to a prostitute on a drunken night out.

After years of living in poverty and trying to find my feet and purpose in life I decided to start university last year (yes I know it's late). I come from a very working class background were university just isn't a part of people's lives and after seeing my friends all go and have a good time in their late teens/early 20s I thought I'd give a shot. Not even so much for the social aspect but because I genuinely enjoy my course and want to pursue a career and hopefully build a decent fulfulling life for myself. At the minute I still live with my family and we're still on or near the poverty line and even if I could, I could never bring a girl back to this house as I'd be too embarrased of my situation and my home but too broke to move out. I was thinking of student accommodation or a house/flat share? Whilst I'm still in university. Also my first year of uni was pointless on the social side as it was all from home (COVID), but hopefully it'll be better this year.

I feel I've missed out on so much of my youth and much of it has been wasted on my very apathetic attitude to socialisation and laziness on that score, but also my family situation. I have noticed that my friends all have relationships and have had experiences with girls and dating. However when I looked back I was just too tied down (and still am) by economic situation. Think about it, if you're a young male and live in a stable, presentable home you wouldn't be embarrassed to a bring a girl home. A reason why I never approach women or date is due to the fact that i could never bring a girl to my home out of shame and embarrassment.

As to interest from women, recently I've been getting plenty of IOIs, almost everytime I go shopping, walking etc I get eye fucked by at least 2 women, including one case in particular where I could have approached but didn't because I just wouldn't know to even say or talk about. So at the minute I have alot of catching up to do, and to be honest I want to build my sexual experience before pursuing a relationship. If anyone has a problem with that then do me a favour and don't bother commenting. There's plenty of men and women having casual sex today and there's nothing wrong with that.

I’m feeling really conflicted right now. I’m two months separated and planning on filing for divorce end of this month. Me and stbx are amicable.

But from getting to know him he really seems like someone I could see myself in a relationship with. Has almost every quality I could want in a man. But I’m scared it’s too soon and I’m not healed enough. I’ve been in therapy for months and I do a lot of self reflection and read self help books. And I will continue my healing journey even while in a relationship. But I’m still afraid that I have not given myself enough time to be single and I really don’t want to mess this up.

13,p9ox2z,1629679959,AITA for wanting to break up with a guy after he made me pay for the date,"Background: I've been dating this guy for a couple of months - I'm in my late 20s he is 12 years older than me and very, very successful. He pursued me first and every date have been nearest to his home, which means I use the subway or pay for Ubers. We are still pretty casual, so only see each other about 1x week, but it's been less than that because we both have traveled during the summer.

Event: We were out this weekend and when the check came, the waitress held the 'tablet' in front of him for him to put his card into and pay the bill. First off, I agree that this was weird of the waitress to do and I've never been on a date where this has happened. My date then looked at me and said, ""oh well I'll let you take this one, as I know you said last time that you wanted to pick up the bill."" Of course I paid, but I was a bit flustered in the moment. The thing is, I totally did pay for the drinks we got on our last date (2 weeks ago)! And I have always offered to pay or at least split the check on all of our dates (sometimes I do pay and sometimes he pays). 

I understand that he wouldn't want a girl to only be after him for his money, but at this point I would have hoped he knows that this not the case as he even acknowledged how independent I am. Besides, it's not like he has ever bought me gifts and he is the one asking me out on the dates!

17,p9pcvp,1629681572,Should I even bother entertaining her?," 

I met this girl on Hinge &amp; we went out several times. It was always fun with her, and there seemed to be a lot of chemistry.

Skipping forward, I took her out for a last time about two months ago, &amp; we had a great time. She even went in for the kiss this time. Almost immediately after the date, she told me she had a great time &amp; really enjoyed herself.

Well a week or so after this date, she messaged me telling me that i'm a great guy, &amp; she always had a great time with me, but she doesn't see it going any further. I told her that it was fine, and that we could still be friends. I really kind of shrugged it off &amp; played it cool. She agreed, &amp; said awesome because we get along amazingly.

Fast forward again to about two or three weeks ago. I live about 45 minutes or so away from her, and I went out on a first date with a new girl. This first date was in her hometown. After this date, I go to drive home, and I get a text from the first girl telling me that her friend saw me on a date at this brewery. Well ever since this incident, she's been trying really hard to express interest for me, and has been flirting with me.

I went on a date with her again this last week, and wow, I forgot how much I liked her. It was great, &amp; we already agreed to see each other again soon, but part of me really wonders why she originally lost interest? Did I flip her jealousy switch? Did she assume something about me that she found out she was wrong about?

I realize I might never know, but is this something worth being weary about?

Edit: Without me asking, she also told me that she hasn't seen anyone else since me.

BUT: She also did tell me she went on 3 or 4 dates with another guy during the same time. I don't like being second place, so do I even bother entertaining this?

How do you know if he is interested or if he is just being nice? 

We went on our first date two weeks ago and twice he has casually invited me to hang out but we both weren’t able to because he kind of asked me at the last minute and I told him I wouldn’t be able to meet up until later in the evening and he told me that he would be asleep by then so we decided to do it another time. 
I did get intoxicated one night and I came off a little clingy and called him a couple times. But I ended up reaching out to him a few days later at night asking if he wanted to hang out last minute and he didn’t reply. So then 24 hours later I just texted him to “let me know if he wants to hang out.” He responded that he definitely does but he has just been out of town but will hit me up when he is back.

25,p9prv3,1629683073,Why do most Girls and Women Vehemently Despise the very Life and Existence of Virgins?,"I feel like my luck with Dating has had pretty much the same outcome regardless of what State, City, Region, etc, I am in. 


I’m 22, about to turn 23. I was bullied up until high school and so I grew into a very awkward and very Self-Destructive person. 

Over the years since graduation though, I’ve done everything in my power to change myself into some small Semblance of who I want to be. 

The biggest issue I still face, however, is the fact that I’ve never even kissed a girl, let alone been in a relationship. I’ve also never once in my life known a girl I genuinely felt I could consider my Friend. 


I try my hardest to be Outgoing and Confident, I try to make jokes and schedule dates but I feel that even if the unbelievably rare cases where I meet a girl who wants to talk for more than 30 seconds, it usually falls apart immediately and I’m ghosted, removed from the Match or straight up blocked once it’s made clear how little experience I’ve had in my Life when it comes to Dating. 

.

So my question is: Why is being a Virgin a literal Death Wish in the eyes of seemingly most girls and women? I don’t even get the chance to grow and become a better person because I’m ignored so fast by every girl I try and talk to. 

Why do most Girls and Women make guys feel literally worthless, like their existence is trash, the moment they hear he is a Virgin?

.


And by that I don’t mean they ridicule me, but they clearly become instantly disinterested and all their initial enthusiasm in pretending I’m a real Human goes right out the window and they start to act like I’m a Toddler.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9prv3/why_do_most_girls_and_women_vehemently_despise/
26,p9q1py,1629684091,Is he into me?,"is he into me? (advice pls!)

over this weekend i attended a dinner. my friend was trying to set me up with her friend who was also attending the dinner. when i arrived at the dinner i said hi and then i ended up having to sit on the other end of the table. when my friend arrived, she beckoned me over and sat me in front of the guy she was setting me up with.

i felt weird because it was now kind of obvious that i was trying to talk to him/being set up with him. i started up some convo with him and his friend and the guy pays attention for like 30 seconds but then he looks away. for the rest of the night he kept talking to other girls at the table but barely said more than 5 words to me. so i thought he definitely wasn't into me and kind of stopped trying to initiate any conversation with him. the weird thing is that there were about 4 different times in the night where i would feel him looking at me so i'd look at him and he'd be looking at me with a smirk/gentle smile on his face. during the dinner, our mutual friend who was setting us up asked me how i liked him and i said he was cute. she told me that he was really shy at first and gets nervous so to give him some time to open up.

but, he  seemed really into this other girl. he was talking to her a lot and pretty touchy with her. she loves male attention so she was all for it. so, i concluded that he was into her and not into me. 

the weirdest part though was towards the end of the night. i announced that i was about to leave home but he suddenly jumped up and showed a lot of interest in me staying. he said he'd walk into the club with me and all that too. he got a little touchy with me suddenly too. it really confused me cause i thought he could care less about me. so i found it odd that he cared about me making me stay when i said i would be leaving. 

the whole thing is really confusing to me and i can't tell if maybe he was just being nervous the whole night or if he wasn't into me at all. maybe he was trying to be nice to me at the end because he felt bad that he wasn't interested? really unsure about all of this and i'd love to hear some opinions on what might've happened!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9q1py/is_he_into_me/

I am heartbroken and lost with ideas of what to do, I used to travel out to study with him to keep him company, surpise him and bring him dinner or coffee. But he's incredibly burnt out and I tell him to be confident and just take little breaks here and there for his well-being. For the last year he has cut off communication with me to hardcore study he wants no distractions, it's taking a toll on me bc he tells me this but will end up procastinating other ways. I'll talk to him for 5 mins in a whole day sometimes days without a text and I'm always the one reaching out, he never asks about my day and it's always me asking how everything is going . Ive been extremely patient and he knows this and always tells me he can't believe I'm with a loser like him. It breaks my heart bc he is my best friend. I really miss someone caring about me also and I've been dealing with this for 3 years. My head tells me move on but my heart stays. I feel like a terrible person if I leave him like this but he doesn't listen to me on how to help him. 

I socially don't interact with meeting new people, I go to work and school and come home . My cousin is trying to set me up with her brother in law that lives in my area for school and I have been crushing on him more and more bc I feel so unwanted, but this brother in law has had me added on fb for 3 years and has never reach out. We saw each other once at my cousins wedding, never spoke but he added my on fb and he is good looking and  comes off as a very nice guy to everyone who knows him.

She’s absolutely gorgeous and I know she’s cool af because we have talked before years back. Anyways, we hit it off and ended up leaving the bar together and kissing, she stayed the night at my place. When we got back, we started getting intimate and she started telling me how hot she thought I was, how she had eyes for me years back, etc. Of course I’m super into it :)

I was very drunk that night and ended up not being able to get it up; obviously  I apologized profusely, assuring her that it was 100% my fault. She was cool about it, and we just ended up taking. And I she feel asleep in my arms.

We spent the next morning cuddling, kissing, and just talking to each other. At some point, she was on top of me and it started getting pretty intense, she began grinding on me and getting a bit aggressive. We had only gotten maybe 1-2 hours of sleep that night and despite my best intentions I couldn’t get it up again. I felt like opening my fucking window and jumping out. I got up and took a moment to silently vent my frustration in another room, then came back and ended up being 100% honest with her and explained to her that i don’t know  what’s wrong with me. Again, she was way cooler about it than I probably deserved but it made me feel like less of a man and she definitely noticed the impact it made on my demeanor as I was more embarrassed than I can ever remember being. She tried to make me forget about it and we ended up making each other feel good in other ways.

We had breakfast and I ended up dropping her off the next morning. We made plans to do something next Sunday but I’m so fucking nervous that I’ll have similar issues if things get heated again… She said she is just likely looking for something casual as she will be going for law school soon, but I feel like I just absolutely fucked up my chances of being with this girl…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9q6tg/how_bad_did_i_fuck_up/

Outside of casual dating the past few years and hook ups in college and one girl I dated in high school for three months, I don't have much to go on. At first, I was afraid of commitment and also had self-esteem issues. The marriages in my family all suck, and my dad is twice divorced and has had several girlfriends and none have worked out. At some point, I figured...why try?

Now I want to be in a relationship though, but throughout my life, I've very rarely felt anything toward any real person. Fictional characters? I can have crushes on those. Real people? One person every couple of years, maybe. Always women. Never men. I'm not asexual. I don't have problem GETTING dates, but I have problems actually being attracted to anyone.

It's frustrating because when I DO develop interest in someone, they're never interested in me back. The closer I get to 30, the more worried I am that my lack of previous long term relationships will concern anyone I'm actually interested in, particularly as I'm at an age where many singles have young children and have been married and divorced before.

I'm (17M) and I've been having a consistent relationship with this girl (16F) for the past 2 months. I've known her for 2 years, but really only started talking to her 2 months ago. We've talked all day everyday, both in real life and over the phone. We both sent off very heavy signals our our interest in one another, so I finally asked her out on a dinner date, which she happily agreed to. Before we could even make it to that date, she asked me if I wanted to go the schools football game with her. I didn't really want to go, but I did to spend time with her. Keep in mind we are both high schoolers, where I'm a senior and she's a junior. This might sound like an insult, but it isn't meant to be taken that way, but I go to a school of about 2,500 kids, and she is a nobody. She has 0 friends, which she has told me, which I've also observed she doesn't have any, and the few people that I know that know her say the same. On the other hand, I'm pretty well known around my school. So anyways, I get to this football game first and I told her I was waiting in the back of the bleachers for her. After sitting alone for 30 minutes and her keep saying ""I'll be there in a minute"" I finally gave up and left. She managed to find one friend that she knew and just stuck with them meanwhile avoiding me. So she was at the game, but never made an effort to approach me. I'm just confused why she would specifically ask me to go with her if she was going to pull this. I finally got home and sent her a very long message talking about how I felt, and all I wanted from her was to tell me if she felt the same. She somehow completely switched up, telling me she only wanted to be friends, but didn't want to hang out with me because that's ""weird"". I then gathered the courage to tell her I didn't want to remain friends with her and waste both of our time trying to cling onto a forced, faked friendship. Then I blocked her to never be seen again. Now I guess what advice/answers I'm looking for is if I handled this the right way? We have a class together but I plan on dropping it on Monday, but how do I act around her when I see her around school? Why would someone show so much care just to switch up in the end?

As one does after becoming single, I’ve downloaded the dating apps and have been going on some dates. One girl I’ve been texting for a few weeks along with a couple facetimes, and we had our first date planned for Saturday. Well Friday night came along, and she was out with her friends and was texting me throughout the night.

It was good, no complaints. But to be honest to myself, and hopefully I don’t sound like an asshole here, I’m really just not interested in a further romantic relationship. Nothing to do with the fact that we had sex, but I just want to continue being single, and just don’t feel that desire to continue going forward with her.

So here’s my dilemma - she apparently had a great time, and was texting me about how great it was and wanting to meet up more. How do I politely turn her down without hurting her feelings? Any advice on what to say? She seems like a good woman, and I don’t want to hurt her self esteem or anything.

Internet says no, he isn't, but the people I know in person, who also know him in person and have seen him interact with me, say it's a strong possibility. Just trying to some various views and advice.

I went out a couple of Fridays ago, and he was bartending. We've known each other for awhile, and I've been at this particular bar so often he knows what drink I like to get without even asking me. He's been flirty with me before, but I could never tell if he was serious, and when I tried messaging him, he didn't read it 'til weeks later, with no response. But this particular night, he was really more flirty than usual. I've been working out for the last few months, and will often post workout selfies in my fb stories, along with other selfies, because I am trying to be more confident in how I look (I've never really been the one described as pretty or gorgeous. Most I get is cute, and even that's rare). He will every few days look at them. So when he went to leave that night, he comes up to me and puts me in a big hug and starts rubbing my back (which I admittingly didn't mind at all lol). Then he wraps his arm around my waist, pulls me into him, and tells me I'm ""looking really good tonight"" and that he liked my necklace. He got right up into my space, so close that I realized I was totally wrong on what I thought his eye color was lol.

He also that night, before leaving:

\-used my lighter to do a particular shot called Statue of Liberty. I had shown him this lighter earlier because it has a sex joke on it and I thought it was funny

\- I got free drinks the entire time he was bartending

\-let me have his snapchat

\-had other random conversations, about music and concerts, etc

He's been really flirtatious with me on other times too, but he was going farther than usual this night. There was a stretch where he stopped, possibly due to a girlfriend he had at some point, but I don't know the exact time line on that, other than it's been close to 2 months since she dumped him. He's not really one for social media it looks like, at the very least he doesn't post a lot. Since adding him on snapchat, I've messaged him a total of 4 times. Twice he's replied back, but doesn't continue the conversation, the other 2 he's opened, but never responded. I'm told he doesn't often respond too much on fb messenger either, but this is just from one person's experience, so I'm not sure I should take it as the whole truth. Now, I know some people just aren't into social media, but he's not giving me much for options for getting a hold of him, and I'm trying to let him know I'm interested.  I am trying to reciprocate his treatment of me when we're in person, but I am also trying to avoid blowing up his phone and coming off as crazy. I do however have this bad habit as coming off as shy, since I didn't actually starting attracting the"" male gaze"" until a couple of years ago, and I am so unused to guys noticing me.

I'm not saying he wasn't possibly looking for a hook up, but  1) I currently live with my parents and 2) He lives an hour away (the bar is his dad's and he often times comes down to help) and I drove myself to the bar 3) I've never had a boyfriend and am at the age where I am not interested in the hook up culture.  I want something committed, and out of all of the (few) guys who have tried to get with me, he's the only one who has talked to me without the ulterior motive, and I often feel respected by him, more so than by the other guys who have hit on me. I can't describe it, but even if he was/is flirting with me, there also seems to be this element of being able to connect and have conversations with each other that does not revolve around treating at each other as a sexy piece of meat.

53,p9sgmg,1629693040,I am confused whether he is just being nice or he likes me,"DISCLAIMER: this will be a bit long but they are all necessary info

To start with a background info

So he used to be in my school like 2 years ago

We were good friends but he had a crush on my two other friends but never me

I had a short term crush on him but moved on pretty fast

It lasted like a few months and I moved on

When I ask about it now, he says even he doesn't know why he confessed to them

After not contacting each other for about a year, I initiated the convo first by talking about a music he had up on his profile (the music was from my favourite band)

And we followed each other on Instagram and started having convo

At first, I already had a year old crush so I ranted to him about my crush and he just gave me sincere advice

He also tried to initiate a meet up but our schedules simply didn't match for a few months

Then one day, while we were talking, he told me that he now had a girlfriend

I congratulated him and told him that we cannot meet if he had a girlfriend

Then I had a bad day with a friend and I asked him if he wanted to hang that weekend, but then he sent a screenshot of my text telling him that we can't meet (I had forgotten that I had told him that) so I just laughed over it and said okay (and that's when I realized I started to have minor feelings for him AGAIN)

He kept pursued me to tell me what was wrong with my friend but I told him I'm really fine and our convo ended

As we were just having a daily convo a few weeks later, he told me that he had broken up with his girlfriend. Like out of the blue (I think we were still talking about my crush).

Now here is where it gets important

I asked him out again in a friendly way last weekend and he said he was a bit busy this month but that he would contact me if he found some time.

After a day, he told me that he could meet up that weekend so we scheduled a hang out.

Then we met in the subway and travelled towards our destination

We weren't awkward at all and joked with each other like real well

And then I had to visit a shop to buy some stuff to decorate my room and I picked up a fake felt flower. He took it and playfully hit me on my head

Also, when we first arrived, we visited a mall and I had a shirt I wanted to buy but told him that I would get it later. But then I kept forgetting about it and he kept reminding me about it when I was about to spend the money on something else. Then when we came back to the mall, there is a lobby with several different paths to go walk down and he told me to pick one but I told him to pick. So he started walking towards a path but then suddenly turned and told me that he wanted to go that way. That's when I noticed the exact shop (which I had failed to find for like half an hour) that I wanted to buy the shirt from and bought it. But then I found it a bit suspicious and asked him if this was intended. That's when he told me ""Yeah I noticed the shop in another path while going down the first path and knew that you were going to buy from it if we pass by the shop"" So he was intending for me to find the shop.

Then we had to get on the subway again to go somewhere else, and I told him that I was a bit tired so I asked him to wake me up when we are at the destination

First, I felt my bag strap fall from my shoulder and it stayed like that for a while but then i felt it get lifted and I knew that he was trying to put the strap back on my shoulder but I think he got hesitant (idk for what reason) because he didn't lift it all the way

Second, while he was moving, he accidentally nudged me and I thought that we had arrived so I looked at him. He gently touched my hair and then told me to go back to sleep

Then the subway arrived at our destination and he was sitting on the left so he could have just nudged my left arm to wake me up but then he used his right arm to put it all around me and then gently touched my right shoulder to wake me up

We were planning to just get my ice cream and then he would go back to his house, but then he told me that he would just walk me towards the exit of the mall directed towards my house, which was a bit of a walking to do.

Other than that, he bought me some small stuff like an ice cream and a small minions truck while he was buying some miniature cars for his collection.

Our shoulders also brushed together lots of times and he was okay with me touching him and him touching me (not like holding hands but like playful hitting and etc and the things in the subway)

But then he is also not reluctant to swear in front of me or mention about di\*ks one or two time while we were just joking around. I also asked him if he wanted to go to a concert of a band I liked if they visited our region sometime later but then he said no because he doesn't like the band.

THEN he replies to my texts fast and usually tells me why when he replies late

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if this was clear enough

If you comment, I will elaborate on it more

54,p9shix,1629693142,(28 M) I've rediscovered feelings for an ex that I recently saw for the first time in almost 8 years. Bad idea to pursue?,"Context:

I went out with an ex last night. Nothing that would suggest a date, just two old friends (who happen to be single now) catching up after almost 8 years apart. During our breakup, we both kind of decided that we had some growing up to do and so we went our separate ways. She explained what she had been up to since we last saw each other and where she had been. Trials and tribulations, you know. As the night went on, I could feel the butterflies begin to materialize in the pit of my stomach and I recognized the feeling for what it was. I was completely infatuated with her all over again. I was blown away with how simple it was to fall right back into the groove we had abandoned so long ago. I sensed that maybe she felt the same, because she suggested that I come visit more often and that she would come to visit me as well. Towards the end of the night, I let slip that I really needed to go as I had a few hours of driving to do. Despite my protests, she was adamant about how late it was and how silly it would be to leave now, and so she invited me back to her house to stay over. Again, nothing sexual happened here it was just a kind gesture, I think.

Later on, we're lying in bed and the conversation sort of takes a turn. She reveals the nature of her recent breakup and just how badly it messed her up. Like a complete distrust of men and relationships sort of deal. She even goes so far as to say that she wouldn't consider dating again for a very long time. I understood and empathized with everything that she was telling me, so I believe her when she says that it will be a long time before she's ready to date again. However, it doesn't escape me that she is saying all of this as we're falling asleep together in her bed after a particularly great night out. And so on to the dilemma. 

For better or for worse, I am in her life again and vice versa. I recognize within myself a desire to get back together, but that's not something she wants right now. It may not be something she ever wants. But she's expressed an interest in seeing and hearing from me more often. While I want to be supportive during this particularly tough time, if I overplay my hand then I risk becoming *too* available. I could be completely wrong, but I think there's an opportunity here. I just worry that if I take too much time, or if I don't show enough interest, then somebody else may come along instead. And let's face it - I'm almost 30 years old. This could be my last chance to see if her and I can make something happen. I would just like some advice from someone with an outsider's perspective.

64,p9swpo,1629694861,"You know when it just clicks and you think, holy hell I have a pattern of behaviour","So, I'd been dating a M40 for 6 weeks or so, met around 8-9 times including sex, sleepovers and spending the next day together. A few dates in, I started to get some red flags, particularly around the way he spoke about his previous relationships, hugely inconsistent/uneven communication, never asking questions about me/seemingly no drive to get to know me. I started to think about breaking it off, but could never quite pull myself away from him, mostly due to the fact my city is currently in lockdown and getting some physical contact/human connection was intoxicating.

We'd seen each other every weekend since we met, but last week I text him on Wednesday and he didn't respond, I text him again on Friday and ... nada. Literal crickets.

I was SO bummed about this. Like, it totally shook me. I felt rejected, like he'd never even remotely cared about me (I knew this wasn't going to be long term, but, you know, I'm human and obviously came to care about him), my ego took a bit (ok, a lot) of a battering. I've also never been ghosted before, so harsh welcome to that brutal reality.

So, I did what I always do when I'm feeling unsure/insecure/need to process, and I scoured the internet for answers, reading other people's experiences and stories, reading articles about the psychology behind ghosting, wanted to find something, anything, that helped me make sense of this. Nothing was helping, until I found this article on Thought Catalog, about overcoming your addition to falling for and chasing after ""damaged"" cases.

And, it's not even about ghosting, it's about why we get entangled with emotionally unavailable/""damaged"" people. And this is my bloody pattern. For context, I left my husband in January 2020, after 12 years together. I didn't really start dating until December 2020, wanting to spend some time on my own, to process, to have casual sex. But every single guy (most recent makes three) that I've been involved in anything more than a few dates with (ranging from 6 weeks to 4 months, god that one stung) has shown me pretty early on that they're emotionally unavailable. They've been terrible communicators. They've been lost/depressed/getting over a breakup. And, evidently, for me, that shit is my crack. These few outtakes in particular really, really resonated with me:

*I forget how bad he is for me, I forget about the fact that he doesn’t really care about me because he doesn’t have the capacity to care about anyone in a deep way. Or maybe he does have the capacity, he just doesn’t allow himself to go there. I forget about it all and I take care of him.*

*What was I getting out of this relationship? Why was I so drawn to him even though I objectively knew he wouldn’t be a good long-term partner? What had he even given to me? I did a lot for him, but what had he ever actually done to show me he cared?*

*And the answer was nothing.*

*I was getting nothing out of this relationship except for quick shots of temporary validation whenever he seemed to reciprocate my interest.*

*I also considered what I was giving to the relationship (if you could even call it that) and why. Why was I so invested in solving his issues? Why was I so wrapped up in getting inside his head? The reason, I believe, is that getting lost in his drama was an escape from dealing with my own life and my own issues. I felt like I had a mission and a purpose and for whatever reason, that felt kind of nice.*

I am by nature a carer. I'm by no means a pushover, I'm an assertive badass in every aspect of my life, but I'm really compassionate, and I want to help people (it's also what I do for work). The irony being, I literally left my husband because I felt like I was his carer, his Mum, and after 12 years I was done. My therapist recently said to me that it's interesting I left somebody because I felt like their carer, but I keep falling back in to that caring role. And I do keep bloody falling back in to it, because it's what I know, it's how I've given love for most of my life. But I can't and won't keep blindly caring for people if they're not meeting my needs. I need to stop confusing being needed with getting my needs met (also another hard truth from my therapist).

So, because I know other people will be in similar situations to me, and I know how much Reddit always helps me during times of crisis, I wanted to share my revelation with you, in the hope it gives you the much needed clarity and relief from being ghosted that this gave me. And, as a final golden nugget, after feeling really hurt, thinking he didn't and had never cared, this paragraph has totally set my soul at ease (which is from another article by the same author, about how to recover from being ghosted):

*Realize it’s not because you were insignificant. The biggest mistake women make is assuming a guy ghosted because she meant nothing to him … because he never really cared about her … because she wasn’t even worth a breakup text or call.*

*This isn’t reality, these are your deepest fears talking. See most of us have deeply rooted fears of being unlovable or unworthy. It’s sad and unfortunate and way too common. The unconscious mind is always looking for ways to prove itself right so when something like this happens, it shouts: “See?? I told you that you were unworthy!” But it’s not true.*

*Feelings aren’t facts. Just because you feel like this has to be the case doesn’t mean it is. If you adopt the idea that he ghosted because you were meaningless and easily forgettable, you’re only dooming yourself and blocking yourself from getting the love you want.*

And, after wallowing all weekend and feeling sad, I now feel some closure, and a sense of peace. And I hope this helps somebody else, too :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9swpo/you_know_when_it_just_clicks_and_you_think_holy/

86,p9v6jh,1629705636,Reminiscing about a crush and need an outside perspective of my interactions with them,"**While  reading this, please keep in mind I have pretty severe social anxiety,  which may explain why I handled certain situations the way I did...**

So,  I'm a fresh graduate from college. During my first semester of senior  year, I was an RA and developed quite the crush on one of the other RAs.

Thoughts about her kinda have popped into my head recently and then I remembered that I had asked for some advice on this subreddit when I was first crushing on her, but I never received any responses  and quickly forgot. At the time of this post, I was really confused  regarding whether I was getting hints/signals from her...and after  reading it again over a year later, I'm still just as lost.

So below is basically the entirety of that initial post **and  I'd mainly like to see what y'all think about this situation and if I  was getting hints or if I was just overthinking her friendliness:**

So   I just got back to college and a girl I like and I are both RAs for  the first time. Let’s say her name is Sam. I’ve spent a lot of time  around her recently in the last week that I’ve known her and I would  like to know if I’m receiving signs that she likes me. It seems very  ambiguous right now and I can’t tell if she’s just really friendly or  into me. She has mentioned she is extroverted and she comes off pretty  friendly, but we’ve just been spending a lot of time together and not  necessarily all of it is planned and it seems like she just kinda  decides to reach out to me sometimes.

Here’s a list of things that have happened but I really need help interpreting them:

1. During  staff meetings I kinda catch her looking at me. At least a lot more   than anyone else. We look at each other quite a bit during hear. We’ve   never smiled at each other after holding eye contact but she always   seems to look at me when I’m looking at her.
2. On  the first day of dinner she saw me in the caf and kinda immediately  smiled and waved while talking to another RA. I was waiting up for my  friends and Sam didn’t have another chair at the table but as I was  walking by I said hello and then she briefly stopped me for a convo.   That only lasted a couple of minutes and then I ate with my friends.
3. On  the second or third day of knowing one another, we were on the topic of  her room and she texted me that if I ever need to cool off in a room  with AC, I should let her know because she just got one. Is that a hint  that she is willing to have me over or that she wants me over? I also  sorta hesitated here instead of asking if/when we could hang out in her  room and instead just thanked her. She then reiterated that I now know  where I can find an AC when I want to cool off. Was that a hint? Or is  she just being overly friendly?
4. One  time I was asking her questions about RA stuff over text and I realized  that I should just be texting my supervisor about my questions. But in  the middle of the convo Sam says that she is heading over so that she  can talk about it with me. After I say I’m just asking the supervisor  she said that she’s always available and I can talk to her whenever if I   need help. Was that just an excuse to possibly see me?
5. She  texted me at night really late to see if I could take the RA duty phone  since she was on duty but wanted to get food quickly off campus. So I  did take it and she was quickly at my door smiling and apologizing for  making me hold the phone. She then was very apologetic when she came to  pick up the phone and she came in her robe and stood at the door and we   talked for about 5-10 mins about my room and other RA stuff and the  song I was in the middle of making. She also said that she’s giving me  the phone because I seem reliable even though I’ve been the RA who has  probably missed the most meetings so far due to personal and medical  issues..so probably the least reliable 😅
6. The  next day she texted me again asking if I could hold the duty phone for  her since she was quickly going to the store with friends. She then said  she’d get me a coke or whatever if I did. She then texted me 10 mins  later that she found someone else to hold the phone. I didn’t see the  message until she found someone else to take the phone. Important to  note, I  am kinda the closest RA to her. The other ones aren’t too far  of a walk  (just down or up) but she seems to be seeing me a lot even  though we don’t plan it.
7. I   asked if she wanted to hang yesterday since I was bored and the caf  wasn’t serving dinner yet. She said she was out driving with her friends  but that she’d lmk if she got back before I’d head to the caf. About 20  mins or so later I unknowingly got a text from her saying that I could  come over. But I didn’t see that so she ended up knocking on my door and  we talked in the hallway for like 10-15 mins. It was primarily just  about RA stuff but she kept talking and touching her hair and just  looking at me. It’s difficult to tell if she’s really just being  friendly since she is extroverted to start with.
8. She  asked about my hobbies today randomly when we are on rounds and she was  talking to me a lot. Not necessarily personal stuff but just RA stuff  and some personal stuff. It seems like it’s sorta part of her  personality and there doesn’t seem to be much flirting so even though we  talk a lot I’m still not necessarily sure how she feels because it’s  mainly been not really flirty.
9. During   our first round together we shortly discussed the most efficient way  to do the rounds so we don’t have to walk as much or take as much time.    Shortly after that, I texted her my idea for the most efficient way  and it involved us each going to the ends of the building and basically   meeting each other in the middle at the end. But then when it came time  for the second round, I suggested doing this but she said she’d rather   us both do it together if I didn’t mind so we did. She said she just  generally likes being around people so that’s why.
10. She’s  always walking in front of me during rounds. It seems like she’s just  eager to do rounds tbh, but at the same time could this be an indication  that she likes having herself in my line of view?
11. Ok  so this one’s a little weird but at the end of rounds we were talking  about her sports stuff for 10 minutes or so when this other girl from  the hall comes down and quite overtly starts checking me out so much to  the point where it stops the conversation and as the girl continues  walking down the steps Sam just kinda kept on staring at her for awhile  and seemed really focused on her. I don’t really know how to gauge that  reaction and maybe they just knew each other?
12. Oh  yeah, forgot this one. The water fountains in her hallway are turned  off so she comes to mine to fill her water bottle. One time I was  outside when she did this and we had a 5 min convo or so and she  mentioned she was from a major city, I said I had never been there   before, and then she said that she could show me around there sometime.   Was that like, flirtatious at all?
13. She  asked if I sang because I had my microphone out and I told her yes and  that I already had a song out and she asked me to send it to her. So I   did and the next day she texted me saying that she thought the song was  really good. But she didn’t mention it again or say anything else about  it so I think she may have just been polite.
14. At  the end of rounds today she clearly was taking pics of herself in front  of me for Snapchat and then mentioned she wasn’t sure if she was going  out for the night or not. I told her to have fun with whatever she does  and that id probably just be chilling or sleeping. At the time I didn’t  think this was a hint, but now that I think about it, could this have  been a subtle invitation for me to ask her if she could hang that night?

I’ve  been off and on thinking about making a move, but I see her on Snapchat  a ton but she’s never asked for my snap or number. We message each  other thru GroupMe since that is how our RA groups are set up. I   followed her on insta and she followed back but I don’t think she’s been   looking at my stuff. I’m just kinda stumped. She also seems to just   have a ton of friends and be a kind person in general so maybe she’s  just like this to lots of people.. What do y’all think?

**\^So all of the above was from that initial post...here's some other stuff that went down after I made that post:**

1. My  DUMB ASS messaged her through a DM one night when I WAS STONED  basically confessing my feelings. It wasn't sexual and after reading it  again it surprisingly seemed as respectful as a DM like that could be.  She said it was sweet but that she ""still had someone from home that  she's with that I should know about"" so then I just quickly apologized  because I genuinely didn't realize she was already taken. Yeah...real  smooth I know.
2. She  had said that maybe we should talk about things another time when I'm  not fried out of my mind. I waited and then a couple days later I said  it was fine to not discuss it if she wasn't comfortable with it, she  said she didn't think it was necessary and that she already forgot.
3. So  you want to know what my college-educated brain did next? A few days  later, I send another DM basically just clarifying that I wasn't just  trying to hit on her with the initial DM, but that I developed feelings  cause I thought she had admirable traits and just had a really great way  of carrying herself. She said she was flattered and that she  appreciated the message and reiterated that everything was cool between  us.
4. The  semester goes by. Everything above happened within the first three  weeks of us being on campus. We have pretty limited  interactions...unsurprisingly.
5. Towards  the middle of the semester, I am in the middle of my 2nd LSD trip for  the day and I also downed some shrooms at the start of my second trip.  I'm hanging with another friend in my room and randomly I get a knock on  my door and guess who it is? It's Sam along with one of my residents  which makes sense since they are friends. They basically just wanted to  chill in my room and smoke a bit, and remember, I'm tripping balls but  I'm in a pretty good state of mind so we all start having a good convo  and then this is what I remember: Sam was sitting on my floor after  having taken a bong hit or two, and we hold eye contact for several  seconds and she's smiling at me and she says something along the lines  of ""after the semester is over I'm going to be back home alone for a  couple weeks before my parents come back"". The rush of that moment felt  incredible, but at the same time I realized I was heavily under the  influence so I basically didn't want to make a fool of myself by  interpreting anything wrong so I just kinda acknowledged that and didn't  say anything back. Then the convo between all of us just kinda flowed  elsewhere.
6. I  had a bunch of people in my room for a smoke session and Sam somehow  found her way into my room too. She sits right next to me and we just  have a good conversation for 15 minutes or so. I kept things strictly  friendly and not flirty, primarily due to how embarrassed I felt about  those dumbass DMs and also because I knew that wouldn't be cool since  she had a boyfriend. But she talked about some of the songs she liked in  the genre that I mainly listen and produce music within so we listened  to a couple of those songs while everyone was vibing and it was just a  good time all around.

I  took the spring semester remotely. I unfollowed virtually everyone I met  at college during the fall semester (including her) because I was going  through a really tough depression and some really bad family  situations. Several months later, I followed some people back, including  her, but she never friended me back so I just stopped following her.  And yeah, that's how that story ends.

So um yeah. I don't know how to interpret all of this. Was she just being friendly? Did I miss an opportunity here? **And  most importantly, how should I have handled this situation or similar  situations in the future where I like a girl but I'm unsure of her  feelings towards me?** Because I think it's pretty clear that some of the actions I took were....not ideal.

I met with some random people on the beach who gathered to drink and socialize. I joined then and there was a girl who seemed interested in me. We got drunk and she came near me, lots of eye and body contact. We left her friends and went on the beach where we shared our views about world, events, people, religion. I felt an instant connection to this girl and we continue doing that for the next 3 days. We met at night and spent time together for the next 15-18 hours walking on the beach, making fun of people and drinking. We maked out most of the time and even grinded on eachother when we went for a swim. I didn’t want to push things futher because i am genuinely interested in her and don’t want to fuck things up. She left her group so she can stay with me for most of the time. She didn’t say much about her life because she didn’t like to share( dunno what to say about this ) i am an overthinker and i left my 5 yr/o relationship a few months ago and didn’t want to date but i fell in love with this girl.

98,p9wrxj,1629713404,Dating with acne on face and body,"I’m a 21 year old male with some acne on my face. The main issue I have is acne scars on my butt. I used to have cystic acne on my butt a few years ago and have not had any active ones in recent year. Unfortunately I’m someone who scars easily and those acne didn’t heal nicely which led to atrophic and hypertrophic scars on my butt with some dark spots. So if u see my butt, there are quite a few (around 6-8 on each cheek) bumps. To make things worse, I’m mixed Asian with darker skin tone so I do get dark friction patches on my waist and lower butt.

I’ll say I’m quite hygienic and bathe twice a day, have a whole skincare routine for my face. I also use a cleanser and moisturize my body and butt but it doesn’t seem to help (for my butt)

I’ve consulted a few dermatologists and all of them said that it can’t really be cured. My only option is to let time TRY to “heal” those stuff. 

So my question is: do girls date guys with these defects or should I just give up on dating. If there are girls out there who would date guys like me, how do I tell her about my issue?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9wrxj/dating_with_acne_on_face_and_body/
