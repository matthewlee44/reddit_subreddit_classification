1,qkjfnk,1635788830,Medical Issue Disclosed - Dealbreaker? [M45/W42],"After meeting a woman through a dataing app, we have spent hours on the phone and had a virtual date via FaceTime that lasted a bit over six hours. Needless to say, we hit it off quite well.

We talk most days and communicate via text daily. She lives around forty minutes from me. I'm a single parent and have my son 50% of the time. We are just waiting for our schedules to align before we meet in person.

During one of our conversations, she told me that she has had a lapband procedure done and has lost over 100 pounds. She seems to have some significant side-effects related to the procedure. A corrective surgery was done around five months ago to repair something that went wrong with the initial procedure. The repair surgery involved removing some ulcers as well as part of her stomach or intestines (I can't remember which). She is still learning what she can and cannot eat and experiences nausea, headaches and sometimes goes days without being able to hold down anything but water and soup. A follow-up procedure is scheduled with her Doctor to look inside for a root cause (I can't remember the name of the procedure).

We seem to be very compatible, but I'm concerned about her health. Life happens and I understand that things that are out of our control can happen. I'm just concerned about entering into a relationship with a woman that could possibly have significant long-term medical issues. I'm wondering if I should move forward at all.

8,qkq7ga,1635807559,Am I overthinking this?,"So I (46F) met this great guy on fb dating recently and we were both shocked by our immediate connection. We have so much in common, despite that I‚Äôm 10 years his junior. He‚Äôs attractive, smart, well spoken and such a gentleman. 

1st date we went out of coffee and ended up together for 9 hours.

2nd date we go to lunch and spend 6 hours at the restaurant. 

3rd date I invite him to my place to watch a movie. We watch the movie. Nothing has happened physically at this point. He is getting ready to leave but doesn‚Äôt want to risk leaving without a kiss so he asks me. So we kissed and it was no little peck. We made out for quite some time. We didn‚Äôt have sex. Mostly over clothes. But it was hot. He got speechless at one point and said ‚Äúless talky, more‚Ä¶‚Äù (I literally asked him if was liking it). 

Anyways, he was giving me long kisses the whole way down the stairs as I walked him out. Thought we were on the same page. 

Yet I haven‚Äôt heard a peep since. 

Yes I realize it‚Äôs only been a day since contact, but that‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs happened since we matched. Even when he was insanely busy on a work project, he still reached out. 

Do you think I scared him away? It just doesn‚Äôt fit his M.O. at all! He‚Äôs usually such a gentleman and thanks me after dates etc. I‚Äôm kind of offended that he hasn‚Äôt said anything. I‚Äôm not playing games but I‚Äôm also not chasing someone. 

Am I right in questioning if he‚Äôs had second thoughts? I‚Äôm used to being ghosted by an ex of mine, so maybe it‚Äôs biased my thinking. 

I‚Äôm curious what you all think. 

My shrink tells me I give too much of myself. And has suggested that I demand better for myself. To not give romantic partners a bunch of chances to prove who they are. I‚Äôm conflicted tho. He‚Äôs clearly fine and posting on fb, but he‚Äôs not texting the woman who was grinding all over his lap.

10,qktxyr,1635819097,Dating after pause for health issues? M42/F34," 

TL;DR: Health problems caused a two month break in casual dating. How to know if it's over or to re-engage?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I (42M) met her (34F) about 6 months ago OLD. It was the first dating either of us had done since the start of the pandemic, and I suspect for her the first dating she had done in a couple years. Our first date was end of May and we went out every week or two through August. The dating was what I would consider casual (no discussions about relationships or ""us""), though we were texting daily, and there were some weeks we'd see each other more than once.

At the start of September through now, there's been a precipitous decline in the frequency of our messages. We both went through a period of ill health starting in September that went into October, so this was partly to be expected. My health problems kept me homebound, making it impossible for us to go out (though she could have visited me if she wanted), and her health problems were both physically and emotionally taxing so I didn't expect that to happen. So, I tried to continue to check in with her and see how she was doing, and how things were going, sent her some flowers, but the time between our conversations has increased.

Our last conversation (via text two weeks ago) basically entailed me asking if she was ""okay"" (such as it is nowadays), she saying that she was, but that she was really busy with work and taking care of herself. At which point I asked directly if she wanted me not to contact her. She didn't answer that question directly, but replied that she had ""no emotional energy"" and wasn't even communicating with her friends atm. I replied that I just wanted to support her in the way that she wanted and respect her space.

Normally I would have interpreted her reply, and the subsequent lack of messaging as a defacto ""I don't want to see you again"", but previous to this she had always been extremely direct about communicating things like this. (If she was too busy to go out, she would just say she was too busy; if she wanted to come over, she would just say that, instead of angling for an invitation.) I also have been criticized by past partners for not being demonstrative enough in expressing my feelings, so I worry that I might not have directly communicated clearly my desire to date again now that our respective health issues are more or less behind us.

And so, I don't know what to do. The more logical side of me thinks that everybody has been clear enough, and it's just time to move on. The other part of me would prefer a clear resolution, since I would genuinely be interested in dating again if she's up for it. I also have been ghosted/the ghoster in the past and don't really want to participate in that. What should I do?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qktxyr/dating_after_pause_for_health_issues_m42f34/

Ultimately, a date was set for us to meet up.  I expressed I wanted to be very casual and move very slowly.  I was very nervous as I had not been on a first date in 6 years.  I thought it went well, all the signs were there.   He stayed quite a bit longer than anticipated.  He pulled me in next to him at one point, to cuddle.  Held my hand some.  There was a kiss at the end of the night.  Fast forward to the next day, his communication dwindled substantially.   I feel he has closed the door and I don't know what happened.   Perhaps it is because he had set high expectations from online chat and I didn't measure up?
Since then, he had sent the odd message here and there to say how was your day...or to say happy birthday to my son...but nothing else.   No indication of interest in a future date.

We can have fun just making dinner together, going on a drive, talking about everything that comes to mind or just being quiet together. He has always wanted children but his ex-wife didn‚Äôt want them. He has been vocal about wanting kids and that he has always desired to have them. Although he is extremely intelligent, stable, very realistic, not easily ruffled,  healthy, and very active, I worry he may have a hard time adjusting if that time ever comes. So far he has been great with working with my schedule for dating (work FT, college FT, active with kiddos), if that helps. 

I have well-behaved kids who have good manners but they‚Äôre still kids (4, 7, 9, 10). I don‚Äôt plan on him having any contact with the kids for about 6 months but it‚Äôs on my mind because I would be bummed if we invest all this time and effort just to have it fall through because of the culture shock of ‚Äúinstant family.‚Äù Not planning on moving in with the guy or anything but I still worry‚Ä¶ We are both looking for something long-term.

24,qlkj1y,1635906069,Getting no attention on the apps,"I'm a tall decent looking guy. I'm 42yo. I've always been generally successful with dating in that I get attention from women, seem to have no problem finding somebody I might like that's also interested in me, and often I'm pleasantly surprised by all the quality attributes of this person, including their level of physical attractiveness. 

I'm also newly single after a 4 year relationship. 

I've never tried the apps before but I've always been curious. I figured this was my chance!

I signed up for Bumble, uploaded some nice pictures of myself, wrote a nice profile in which I did state I'd be interested in a relationship, and then started swiping. 

The first day I was pretty selective. I read each profile and swiped right on maybe 10 out of 50. Admittedly, these all seemed like pretty amazing women. 

No matches. 

I figured, maybe I'm being too picky. Let's try being a little more open to matches other than the upper echelon of women on here. The next day I probably swiped right on almost half the profiles I saw. 

Still no matches.

I took a closer look at my profile to see if there might be any red flags that I was missing or something that was turning women off. I showed it to a female friend of mine. We both agreed that there were some lines that might turn some women off, but that's what you're supposed to do right? We can't all be for everybody. 

All the while Bumble was telling me that three women had ""liked"" my profile. I could see who they were for $17.99. I figured that I had either already swiped left on them or they'd pop up in my cue eventually so I didn't bite.  

The next day I swiped right on easily more than half the profiles I saw just to see what it would take to get a match. Still no matches. 

The day after that I swiped right on every single profile just to see wtf was going on... Still no matches. 

Are these apps rigged? Certainly I'm not entitled to women's attention, but it seems reasonable that I would at least get a handful of matches. I wasn't imagining I'd be the Prince of Bumble, but I figured I'd get somewhere between 5-10 matches relatively early in the process and we'd see what happens from there. But I guess not...  

I don't have trouble meeting women IRL. I get approached when I'm out on a semi regular basis, which I know almost never happens for other guys. I have lots of female friends that drop hints my way. I'm the one in my group of guy friends to where they're usually asking me ""how do you do it?"" with regards to meeting women...

So it just seemed strange that I would be on one of the apps for close to a week and get zero matches.

On my profile I state I‚Äôm looking for a fwb with an emphasis on the friendship part, I want the spark and the attraction that makes for amazing sex, and that‚Äôs it. Well holy man‚Ä¶ my inbox is flooded with men who want the same thing. Once you take all the head games and worry of dating out of it, wowzers it‚Äôs a whole new ball game. 
For me, it was the right thing to do. I always used to get this anxious trapped feeling with dating. I don‚Äôt want to be tied down to anyone yet still want to have fun. And it doesn‚Äôt mean sleeping with a bunch of people (unless you want to). 
Guys, I highly recommend it if you want an alternative to dating. It‚Äôs pretty fun.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qlsh0u/dating_alternative/

We were interested, but held back so that it wouldn't cause issues at work.    Then we moved on and weren't connected professionally anymore and he'd check in with me occasionally.   We lived in the same city, but he was going to other cities for months at a time for construction projects.    

In 2016 we reconnected and figured out that we'd both be in San Francisco in July so we planned to meet up.   We were texting a lot and I was really excited about the date and the prospect of going out to visit him for the duration of his project.    We planned to meet on a Saturday and on Friday I texted him to confirm.   Twelve hours later, he said, ""of course.""   No explanation or apology for how long it took him to respond, which bothered me, but not enough to cancel.

I flew out with some coworkers, we got settled into our hotel, had a drink and they were going to dinner and I was excited about my date.   As of 2 he was telling me that he was working, but would finish up around 4 and take the train to the city to meet me.   I didn't get another text until 5:17 when he told me that he was stuck at work and I shouldn't wait, that I should ""go on without him.""   

I was crushed.   I was really looking forward to this and I thought he was too, and now I was alone in San Francisco on a Saturday night and too humiliated to meet up with my coworkers who'd already left for dinner.   I texted him again the next day and got no response.   I went back home days later without hearing a word.

I texted him and said, ""I can only assume you're dead.   Rest in Peace.""   

After that he'd text me every 6 months to a year, and I'd always ignore him.    I never responded.   Fast forward to Monday, Nov 1, 2021.   He texted me again, and this time I couldn't help but laugh at the irony of him coming back during Dia de Los Muertos, when the dead and alive are supposed to be able to connect.   I texted him, ""Happy Dia de Los Muertos!""

It is regarding a guy I have been speaking with now for several weeks. As you read on, you will see quite clearly why I don't believe anything will ever come of it. I am also likely posting this in the wrong place, but we are over 40 and this is a ""dating"" scenario. 

He told me once that he will deliberately disagree with a woman in an emphatic way to see how she will respond/react. Whether or not he actually disagrees is a question I failed to ask. In my opinion, I find this to be manipulative and just plain rude. In addition to this, he said there was a woman he had been talking to for awhile and he said she disagreed with him frequently and he felt she did it just to be contrary, so he basically stopped talking to her. The other day, he said to me that he felt I was always challenging things he says. I found that odd, because I tend to agree to most of his positions on things, but many with a caveat....because I am not always sure what he means....at times, he will state an extremely polarized view on something, to which I will respond ""I totally agree with you, however, I feel that there is this other thing to consider as well""(because I am not certain whether he has considered these other facets of a particular complex topic). I am not saying it to challenge him. I am merely having a conversation and I suppose I thought conversations should welcome the viewpoints of all parties involved. 

Also, he said to me once that I was ""ADD"" a bit when speaking, like I was all over the place and couldn't stay on topic. The thing is, I do take bunny trails, but those bunny trails always circle back to the topic at hand. Then when that topic seems to have been exhausted, an aspect of the talk might remind me of something else and I will perhaps begin talking about that. This is how a conversation evolves, isn't it? And oddly, he does the same exact thing. And to add something else to that, he informed me that his ex used to always say he had ADD!! So what is this??

Another thing he does: He says he essentially sizes women up to determine whether they might have some form of mental illness. I find this also to be pretty messed up. 

He claims his ex was ""crazy"" and I wasn't there. I don't know here and so I have no way of knowing.

We have chatted online for a while and are finally meeting this weekend. She is about an hour drive away and I am driving to meet in her local area I don‚Äôt expect her to drive to me for a while. We will be having drinks and something to eat at a fairly casual place.

1. Should I take her flowers ?
2. I will offer to pay for the date obviously , but if she pushes back and wants to pay half , what should I do ?
3. Should I dress casually, smart casual ?
4. Ladies in particular(others are welcome to answer) what would you expect from a date where you seem to have a connection and lots in common ? Apart from the obvious like open doors , pay attention to what she says/asks and respond in a respectful manner that shows I have been listening.
5.

64,qn1nom,1636080858,Texting Style Mismatch,"Looking for your perspective. My partner and I, both early 40s (genders intentionally removed), have very different texting styles. My phone tends to be on or near me most of the time, and I'm usually pretty quick to respond and try to carry on a conversation. They don't always have their phone nearby, and even if so, might not reply as quickly, or sometimes not at all. They are also less emotive by text, to the point of occasionally seeming ambivalent.  This is just the way they are; it's not new over time, and I don't think it's just me.

In general, I'm happy to try to give them the benefit of the doubt (work, family, other people to talk to, housework, etc).  From a logical standpoint, I'm not the only thing going on in their life at that moment.  However, this also triggers an anxious side of me, kind of feeling 'less important', I guess, or perhaps distant/ pushed away, even though that's not really happening.

To be clear, this is largely a me issue (my expectations, my anxiety), not a them issue. We get along very well in person, and I know they care a lot about me. I don't think it's fair of me to expect them to change their phone habits for me, and I think that any change would probably be impersistent, because it's simply how they use the medium. So I think I have to get used to it.

So my question for all of you is how I might be able to think about this differently or approach it differently so as to take it less personally. What's worked for you, or a partner, in analogous situations? How have you learned to let go of something like this?

I've been on and off OLD since 2012 and most recently had a relationship with someone where a mutual friend fixed us up. Then the pandemic hit as that ended, so I haven't been online in a few years.

Now I will be able to say ""Yes, I AM a librarian!"" Plus libraries now have internet.

Seriously, something about me was screaming out to me boys that were 20+ years younger or the men in their 60's, so 20+ years older than me.

It wasn't the car photos, the shirtless selfies that are from ages ago, the bathroom photos, the photos meant to accentuate the groin, or the filters. (But so nice to know things haven't changed in a few years). It was the list of demands that really got to me - I understand drinking, religion, smoking, and those other things that are actually items you pick your answer on FB dating.

Especially during a pandemic, was a little surprised to see so many of the ""If you are just going to string me along and text me keep on looking!""

My favorite was this guy that wrote *""Most of y'all that write ""No Hook Ups"" aren't desirable enough to want to hook up with anyways. Just calling a spade.""*

The past 2 days I suddenly can't contact him and I'm not sure if he just wants to be left alone (his work is pretty stressful) or if there is something wrong. I've been to his place many times and can let myself in. But if he wants to be left alone, I feel like going there would be bad. But I'm also worried?

69,qn737f,1636103408,It hit me like a ton of bricks how much I still love my ex when I was discussing starting a relationship with a friend.,"She's been a friend for a few years, attractive and we have an attraction that has never been realized. We shared house back when I was still house sharing. She's friends with my sister and some of my friends. She's 15yrs younger and just great. 

My ex (together for a year broken up for 4 months) suspected our attraction and asked about it and I shut her down. We broke up when I realized I wasn't mature enough to give her what she wanted. I'm been doing lots of work on myself since and I was bent on moving on after her super blunt reply to a text I sent her when I was missing her(...I'm selfish, immature, moody, stroppy...)

So a couple of weeks later, my friend and I caught up at a mutual friend's party and much later that night she texts wanting to make time to talk about feelings we have for each other. So we have a phone call where we admitted to being attracted to each other and what we individually saw as compatibilities. We agree to give it a shot and we make a date. 

The next night my ex calls and we have a great catch up. She was concerned how I was after our last interaction. I still love her. I took her and the relationship for granted and I regret that. I want to get back together with her, I will do the work required to make it work and her happy. I need to convince her to try again with me but I also need to let her know what went on with my friend.

Given how I feel, I can't go on the date with my friend, or be with anyone actually. I'm afraid that friendship may be gone. 

I want your opinion of me. I know the ins and out and I'm afraid I'm as much of a prick as I sound, despite just trying to move on with my life.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qn737f/it_hit_me_like_a_ton_of_bricks_how_much_i_still/
70,qn73ny,1636103471,43m still looking for his first love,"I‚Äôm a 43m and live in a big city. I‚Äôve never had sex or dated. I‚Äôve only had crushes and unrequited love. I‚Äôve anguished about my circumstances a lot over the years. 

I recently tried dating apps for the first time. I don‚Äôt get many matches or likes. I think 99.9% of the women I have swiped right on have swiped left on me. The few matches I‚Äôve had go nowhere. I matched with one woman I found fairly attractive. She quickly ghosted me. I guess that‚Äôs progress.

I can‚Äôt help but think my looks are a problem. I know I‚Äôm not Channing Tatum, but is the bar that high? I work out a lot and look put together. Is being average height a big problem? Am I swiping right on women who are out of my league? How do I know who‚Äôs in my league?

I don‚Äôt have pics of me doing stuff. How much does that hurt me? The problem is I don‚Äôt have any exciting hobbies (waterskiing, snowboarding, rock climbing, etc.). I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd take a picture of myself doing that would interest anyone. 

I don‚Äôt have many ways of meeting age-appropriate women. I work from home and don‚Äôt have many friends. The networking events I used to attend no longer exist. I go to bars once or twice a week, but I don‚Äôt see too many women in my age range there. I imagine many are busy with their kids.

I really wish I could experience the things I see people discuss here. I can‚Äôt relate to any of the posts about sexual relationships. I have no clue how people even meet. I often worry I am too weird and too inexperienced for anyone.

If anyone is curious, I fell behind socially at a young age and never made many friends. I was unemployed and depressed for much of my 30s. My mom would ask me if she could give me money. I started my own business several years ago as a Hail Mary pass.

After some weeks of texting constantly,  sharing, getting to know each other a bit,  we met for a date (Saturday). The date went well.  Since the date (it's been 6 days), the communication dropped significantly.  I fretted over this and then assumed he must not be that into me. I was going to just let it go.  Still the odd text would come through from him.  Asking about my day, or small talk as such.  My responses wouldnt be read for hours.  I'm definitely feeling breadcrumbed at this point, pretty certain of it.  Plot twist: on Tuesday he sends a message to say that he hasn't been chatty because a childhood friend passed away and he has been unplugging. I sent condolences.  Said I noticed he had been quiet and figured he just wasn't interested.  He said that wasn't the reason. I respond to let him know if he wanted to talk, or go for a walk/drive I would be there.  He said that he might take me up on that (he hasnt). The next day (wed) was the funeral.  He texted to say he wouldn't be online much but would message me later (he didn't) .  On Wed eve, I sent him a nice photo i had taken of a sunrise because I know sunrises make him happy.  He replied ""thanks :)"" .  I did not text any further, leaving it in his court. He texted the next morning (Thurs) I received a message from him to say he was still feeling off and sent a lake photograph he had taken that morning.  I didn't reply until late afternoon. And i sent brief words of understanding. I'm still feeling things aren't quite right,  but I feel empathetic and Thurs eve I ask him if there's anything I can do to cheer him up and I attached a subset photo I had taken that eve.  He said thanks and that he had gone for a long walk that evening. I responded with a heart emoji, to show I care. ( if even as a friend because at this point I certainly don't feel I have much of a place in his life)

First of all, I want to say that this is not the first time I have posted. I met many people here, but many people did not leave by accident. Don't know why, communication is always short. I even met some rude men, that was not what I needed. If you are busy or just want to flirt. Please don't message me. I am looking for people who can send messages in meaningful daily conversations and want to make friends. Don't want to communicate for now.

&amp;#x200B;

About me: I have been divorced for almost six years. Damn, although I like children very much, I regret not having children. After the divorce, I moved to the United States to concentrate on work. I have some hobbies: I exercise 3-5 times a week. I like to read books at home at night and check some information. I don't like going out at night. On weekends, I sometimes learn golf or go for coffee with my clients or some friends. I like shopping and eating in my free time. Before the epidemic, I like to travel and have been to many countries. This is me.

&amp;#x200B;

English is not my first language. Not very good but not bad. I will not come into contact with dangerous people, and hope that my circle of life is not limited to women. I hope to get to know more friends from the United States and Canada, so that we can have a friendly meeting in this city after the epidemic is over. I also hope to meet some European friends and share the beauty and culture of some European countries.

78,qnf0ve,1636130209,Not disclosing vs concealing,"I'm a guy. I have a female friend who was dating a guy longer term and got into a committed relationship with him. The question of previous marriages came up at some point. Both were divorced, both had kids from their marriage, his kid was still pretty young, hers were teens. What he didn't tell her is that he had another marriage, prior to the one his child came from.

An acquaintance of hers googled his name and found a public court record of his divorce in the county they live in, he was the one who left. The timelines didn't quite make sense with his kid's age and he had told her that his ex left him. When she confronted him about it, he said that his first wife was an alcoholic who he couldn't help and lost track of after being married for a few years, so he couldn't divorce her. During that time he met someone else and got her pregnant, then he suddenly managed to locate his wife, divorced her, and married the soon to be mother of his child. That marriage lasted like a year, then she left him. Then he moved across the country (away from his kid) because he didn't have any family or friends where they lived.

His response was like: I'm sorry you found out like this. Like he was just waiting for the right time to tell her, but it had been a year already, maybe longer, she said she loved him.

She eventually stopped seeing him but felt conflicted about it, like it could have been him just not trying to over disclose or dump things (he was leaning into that). She was also saying it could be normal for someone to lose all contact with their alcoholic spouse. I was like yeah, no there are lots of red flags here. If I was in his shoes, at some point I would have had a conversation like look, I've done some things I'm not proud of that I feel like I need to tell you about - like at any hint of things getting serious.

97,qnyhkt,1636198704,Is it time?,"[60M] Came out of a LTR several years back in which my SO not only had an PA, but called me on the phone to inform me she was flying to meet up with a guy (at his expense) that she had just met at a Comic-Con type convention earlier that week and didn‚Äôt much care how I felt about it. Needless to say I was devastated by her betrayal and coldness (I‚Äôve since discovered his was just a voice in the choir), but I immediately dropped her like the POS she is and moved on. It‚Äôs taken me 10+ years to finally get to a point where I‚Äôm willing to risk letting someone new into my life‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve quite literally been out of the dating scene longer than a lot of you have even been an adult (40+ years) and I haven‚Äôt a single clue how to proceed. I‚Äôm not interested in ONS. I can get them anytime and have. They only leave me feeling empty and worthless inside. I don‚Äôt drink so singles bars are out, online dating apps are just a money scam, I‚Äôm not particularly religious so forget about church socials, and I prefer to work on things rather than attend festivals, art shows, etc‚Ä¶ so I kinda priced myself out of the neighborhood so to speak before I even got started. Any advice would be welcome.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qnyhkt/is_it_time/

I hate lies above everything else.            
I love Rick &amp; Morty.         
I have a messed up &amp; hilarious sense of humor so if your sensitivity is high tell yourself I'm sorry but know I'm not.                
I enjoy intimacy and sex with my person so if don't enjoy practicing making babies move on and buy some puzzles.                
I'm a single full time dad.                     
When I'm not working I'm with them so little time to date and I hate dating sites.                   
If your an ultra feminist just know that you suck and a bachelor's in liberal arts makes good toilet paper. It'll cut your ass up because it's... well paper, but it's satisfying. Lol.                     
I'm 5'11"", 170lbs, Green Eyes &amp; Brown Hair when I grow it.                        I'm good looking and have a good job.                        
If I interest you in some way and you want to get to know me then we'll have to have a phone call so I know your real and not a scam.                             
Also if I interest you then you are probably as fucked up as me which means your awesome and you should see a therapist soon. 

If you respond to this post send me a message and tell me if you prefer big spoon or little spoon. 


Michelle, I really clicked with you but when you accidentally dialed me and I heard you asking him if he was gonna pound your puss that kind of made me rethink some things. Lol",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qnzy8p/39_m4f_idaho_looking_for_my_person/
