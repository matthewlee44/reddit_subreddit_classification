We probably text each other about 5 times a day, sometimes with general stuff but often with questions about activities and how they feel about deeper issues. 

I feel like this is not a lot of contact. However, in my former marriage, my ex would text me upwards of a 100 times a day and we went from being friends to being together literally every day as a couple. I can’t say that either is right or wrong (although my ex has been diagnosed with narcissistic tendencies).

He was very nice about it and claimed that I was out of his league to which I wrote back that he should really try to let go of feelings like that (not the easiest thing I know and I am not out of his league btw)

He wrote back asking if I had any feedback on the dates and I did not, he is a very nice guy but just not for me.  
There is one thing that bothered me and that’s the fact that he is balding (not an issue) but he sort of kept the hair a bit too long and it would have looked so much better if he shaved his head. This is not the reason for not wanting to see him again, I must stress.

I obviously didn’t say that in the “feedback” or should I have done it?

30,of8px5,1625620915,Ready to Settle Down,"I figured I would invoke the collective wisdom of this subreddit.

I am 40, and lately I have been feeling dread that I will never find the person I will spend my life with. 

I gave up on online dating several months ago, hoping to meet someone in the real world. But it is more difficult than I imagined. Here is why. 

I am finding that even when I find people I am interested in, it requires such a perfect set of circumstances to open dialogue, that I can’t seem to find a way to take that next step. 

Right now there are two women who have caught my eye, and I would like to know better, but I haven’t figured out a way to engage them in such a way that it will not be taken in a bad way

The first is a neighbor who lives several doors down from me. She sometimes walks her dog, or checks the mail, but it is very rare that I catch her in time to chat. In the year I have lived here, I have had maybe three conversations with her, but nothing in the last several months. I don’t want to knock on her door, because if it turns out she is not interested, that could make living in such close proximity very awkward very fast. 

The second woman is at a place where I am working. I took a summer job, and I will only be there for a month longer. The thing is, she is technically my supervisor, so trying to approach her with romantic intentions can turn very bad if it turns out she is not interested. 

So here is the dilemma. Yes, there are plenty of fish in the sea, but what does it matter if even those swimming in your pond, you can’t find a way to approach them?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/of8px5/ready_to_settle_down/

It’s always later in the date after the conversation and laughs have been flowing a bit.  They stare intensely at me for an uncomfortably long time.  No talking, just staring.  It happened again tonight, hence the reason for this post.

My go-to move is usually to avoid eye contact and laugh awkwardly.  I have to do this 2 or 3 times before they stop.  I’m 92% sure that is not the reaction they are looking for.

These are first or second dates and many times, there are things going on afterwards (need to pick up kids, babysitter is only there until 9, etc.).  So, there is no chance for me to stare back and say, “want to get out of here?”

It’s either a good thing where they are showing interest or a bad thing where they are imagining drugging me and stealing my kidney.

My semi-serious question is not on the motivation behind it, but what reaction they might be hoping for.  

If we were a few dates in, had already kissed on prior dates and neither of us had plans after the date, it would be pretty clear to reciprocate and ask her back to my place.  It happening on the first or second date has me at a bit of a loss.  

So far I have tried staring back until it got weird, asking “what?”, and saying “I have degenerative kidney disease” (just in case), in addition to my aforementioned awkward response.

This is a person (42M) on a co-ed sports league with me since last September. I am pretty sure we can keep going on being friends, but will update you all if there's anything interesting to update. I basically got tired of having a crush on him and figured there was nothing to lose.

From what I understand, nothing usually comes out of these things (crushes and their declarations), but I figured I'd go for it. I had made the decision earlier that day to tell him and we had a few drinks, but drinks are not what made me say it. 

I feel so weird being a woman, thinking or being led to think that men need to make the first move. Sure, maybe I could have been more slick and asked him out on a cool date or whatever, but I had a fantastic time last night - and I'm not that slick of a person. I've already asked him out to enough fun things before. He's agreed to a few.

Here's what I said - I have something awkward to say. I have a crush on you. I don't expect you to have anything to say right now, but if you don't feel the same way, we can just keep going down this trajectory of being friends because being friends is awesome. 

He was beyond shocked - and said I had had some drinks. That he was flattered and that we could text about this some time later. I'm not hurt and I hope he's not too embarrassed.

At this stage of our friendship, I honestly can say that I'd be happy to be just friends. He's awesome and if he wants to date someone else, I'd be happy for him. However, he'd make a fun, reliable partner, I think. I don't want to live with regret.

44,ofnc0k,1625677882,Advice: Breaking bad relationship habits,"Me again. 
 
I have found that I have dated essentially the same person over and over again my entire life. It’s always people who go from meeting to boyfriend in about five minutes, who tell me they’re in love with me by the fourth date, and who want to lock down a very serious relationship as fast as possible. I get into this pattern again and again and again. While this is happening, I find it offputting because I am actually not a super-emotional person. I’ve never had my heart broken, never been dumped, and I’m not sure I’ve ever really been in love. 
 
I’d like to say that I am really awesome and that’s why these guys feel this way. I know that’s not the case. I know what’s happening is there some sort of weird dynamic that I’m attracted to that brings me to the same kind of guy. 
 
So here’s what I’m here to ask: do any of you have any relationship advice or recommendations for books on this particular topic? I’ve come to really respect this community. I would actually like to have lasting relationship that is healthy and meaningful to me one day – though not soon. I’m a big reader and would love book recommendations or anything else you have to throw at me regarding this. I have been to therapy. I have been told that it’s hard for me to be in touch with my own emotions and I own that.
 
Thank you so much! Happy over -40 dating.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ofnc0k/advice_breaking_bad_relationship_habits/

49,ofqguz,1625686981,The “L” word,"So, I use the love word a lot. I love tacos. I love people watching. I love this. I love that. Thankfully, I say this word so much that I wouldn’t think it was a big deal, but it slipped out when I was talking to the guy who isn’t my boyfriend because we haven’t labeled it, but he basically is my boyfriend (we are exclusive and have had that talk, we just aren’t labeling it yet).

It was on the 4th of July and I can’t stop feeling weird about it. He doesn’t particularly like fireworks, but I LOVE them. He doesn’t like going to the lake because there are a lot of pretentious people at this particular lake, but I LOVE going to any lake. So to make me happy, because that’s just the kind of awesome guy he is, he took me to meet his daughter and her boyfriend and their children, at the lake, to see fireworks. 

We went to another lake neighbor’s house. They had food. Tacos and hot dogs and potato salad. He was eating potato salad, and he is so particular about how he eats - which most people would probably find odd and be annoyed by, but I also eat in a particular way and his habits are fine with me, I actually find them quite funny. We were talking and joking and I was watching him take his fork and do his thing with it, and I said, in a string of other things that we were talking about “I love you.” Meaning I love the way you eat, but that is NOT what came out! He heard it and whipped his head and just looked at me. Stared!!

Panic sets in! I just said “what?!” He said “what?” And I just restated that I love the way he eats. Oh my gosh, dying!!!! We both heard what I said.

Neither of us has mentioned it since, but I cringe still thinking about it. Thing is, I do have love for him. I’m just not IN love with him...yet. I can feel it on the horizon. I can tell he also has strong feelings for me. Who takes a girl to meet his daughter/grandson and see fireworks on a lake when they don’t care for either of those things (he loves and adores his daughter and grandson)? 

We are going to visit other family in his hometown this weekend. I have been before when we were “just hanging out” so this isn’t really a big deal.

66,og9pl4,1625758617,Dating and relationships when you thrive on routine,"I'm recently out of a four-year relationship. While I miss my old partner a lot and miss many aspects of being in a relationship, my single life is SO MUCH BETTER. I feel so much more whole, comfortable with myself, and in control of my world. I'm eating healthy, doing yoga, meditating, exercising, spending time with friends... 

It's not that my ex kept me from these things or was necessarily a bad influence. It's more that I've come to realize that I THRIVE on structure and routine. I know that I'm going to bed at 10, getting up at 6, going for a run, doing meditation, eating breakfast, going to work... All that structure and routine helps my life to feel proper and directed. It frees up energy to be loose and present on evenings and weekends, which are basically my unstructured times. 

I've always known this about myself on some level, but it's become even more pronounced as I've gotten older. I'm positive I have ADHD and pretty sure I'm a little bit on the spectrum too. 

So while it's wonderful to really fully understand this about myself now... It also has me worried about my future. I want to find love. I would like to be in a comfortable long-term relationship. My trend is very much that I do well at dating but once a relationship starts to set in, I really struggle. Spending more time with the other person throws off my routines. I get agitated. I get easily exhausted. I gain weight and don't get enough sleep. All my healthy habits fall apart. I don't feel like myself... 

I've had people tell me I need better boundaries, but I've never felt like my partners were unreasonable in their expectations. They just wanted to spend time with me. It's just that I only have a limited number of unstructured hours I can give without falling apart.

77,ogglj5,1625778720,Re-framing what it means to be in a healthy relationship: how do you all define a healthy LTR for yourselves?,"Long story short, I'm on a deep dive journey into looking at my relationship patterns, beliefs, fears, etc.  
I realize that I have really forgotten (or did I ever know?) what a truly healthy relationship looks like.  

The men in my life that I've spent the most time with ( Dad, husband and last bf) were all somewhat or highly dysfunctional.  My dad was an alcoholic who treated me well but my mom like crap and basically didn't do shit to take care of our family and was very, VERY selfish. He would also go MIA frequently drinking. Mom was the classic co-dependent enabler. She was our rock, but basically taught me to deny my feelings and always look for how to make things look/feel better for everyone else, despite what I felt inside.  I am literally just now figuring out how I feel about certain things that many people would know immediately, esp if it was a negative feeling.  


My ex husband is a self-proclaimed selfish man who has no desire for family (this was proclaimed AFTER we had a kid and were married but I should have seen it coming).  We have been having some interesting talks lately, as we both realize we have some limiting beliefs/messed up ideas about relationships and also discussing how our issues played out in our marriage. It's been incredibly healing and we can speak candidly.  This is helping me see my part in our marriage/divorce and also how wrong he was for me. Had we only known that when we were in our 20's......  


My ex boyfriend was not nearly as dramatically dysfunctional as my dad and my ex husband, but he lacked an emotional availability that was always confusing to me and also lacked any desire/skills to ""work"" on the relationship to overcome issues.   He also could NOT own any mistakes or things he did to hurt me. So once again I was swallowing my pain, which is so familiar to me.  

My biggest issues/pattern is that I try really hard to make something that is 'good' (or not good sometimes) be really great by accepting unacceptable behavior (lying, verbal abuse, disintrest), I do all the emotional heavy lifting b/c I choose partners who are not interested in true intimacy. Some of this shit is really subtle and even not clear to me when I'm doing it. I used to think that love and compatibility were the same thing, and love could conquer anything. They are different things and love does not solve everything.  


So here I am at 44 trying to redefine what 'good' is (and working on myself in a big way)'.  As one of my therapist once put it for me 'I have a high tolerance for bullshit due to my childhood'. I don't want this to be my M.O.  But on the other hand ,the idea of a LTR where there is still love, sex, laughter, trust, common interests and yet ability to be independent, almost seems like a unicorn.    


I recently wrote about how I realized what I wanted in a relationship. But now I'm realizing I actually need to be ready for it in order to recognize it.  Sometimes I think back to men that I dated or knew that had romantic potential and I looked past them possibly b/c they were too ""normal"" and I was used to high-conflict/infatuation/chasing/feeling like something was missing and I just needed to fix it, etc. 

So, good people of Reddit- how do you define a good relationship (thinking about LTR), and in your experience, how did you know the difference between a good ol' infatuation/idealization, and something really healthy and lasting?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ogglj5/reframing_what_it_means_to_be_in_a_healthy/

I decided to let it die on the vine. I figured it was mutual. Wednesday rolls around and he texts me for dinner this weekend.

90,ogq1sp,1625813285,Navigating friendship first,"Hello fellow lovvies. I am hoping to get clarity on (if not settle) a disagreement between myself (a lady) and a male friend (""Nigel""). 

Context: he has recently met a lady who he is smitten with and they have been dating. Her boss move was to mention that she has a ""friendship first"" policy. They did that for 2 weeks and are now ""more than friends,"" if you get me.

I've kind of been afraid to express a need/wish/boundary of forming a friendship with a potential partner (recovering people-pleaser here, seeking eventual partnership rather than something sugary that will leave me hungry again in 20 minutes). I tend to be anxious and would rather slow things down and see how I feel. I realized that the current ""hook-up game"" apps don't work for me (because they weren't meant to).

I've also been quite heartened to read on several guys' profiles that they are seeking a platonic connection first, friendship, slow dating, you name it. 

So, I mention to Nigel that I dropped a ""friends first"" request into the convo of a first date recently (for other reasons there won't be a second date: he wants kids, I do not). Nigel reacted, but in an outsize way which made me think he had been triggered by his lady's boundary-setting or something (he thought I should massage my phrasing more to make it more palatable, 'nonsense' I thought). My date seemed unbothered by my request.

TL;DR: I am super wondering: (1) how have you successfully navigated the ""friendship first"" boundary (on your profile, on your dates?) regardless of your stance pro/against, and (2) have we fully euthanized the friend zone yet? 

Please be kind - real person here.

94,ogvgm1,1625836986,Confidence in Males is also Sexy,"Since my last post, I have seen guys commenting on various posts about how confidence in woman increases the sexy factor.  As a woman, I want to speak up and say that this holds true for woman about men as well.  If a man is expecting a woman to demonstrate self confidence both in and out of bed, so should a man.  We all have areas of weakness and self doubt.  When you love someone, you should support your partner in the things they feel good about, and boost them up where they may struggle.  I’ve seen confident men that when times get difficult, they simply run away.  Especially when it comes to sex. As we age, sex may not happen as easily, and stress is a huge factor.  Learn to communicate your needs and desires, and if your partner has difficulty here, open the door.  Learn to talk about sexual desires, dysfunctions, or dissatisfaction. Be open with your partner about what’s bothering you, even if it IS about them.  They can’t improve in areas if they don’t know it’s a problem. That is confidence, and that increases the sexy factor in my mind.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ogvgm1/confidence_in_males_is_also_sexy/
95,ogw3mx,1625839060,Hi it's about difference,"I'm having a newish but steady relationship, and I'm seeing someone in their late 30s, our relationship has different dynamics 
1. Our age which isnt a big gap but is still by 5 years, I'm 42
2. Our race we are in a mixed race relationship I'm black and he is white
3. Our nationality I'm from UK and he is European 
4. He has a child aged 9 and me my son is grown at 22!🤣 as I had him at 19 years old with some additions to the family, we haven't introduced everyone yet but maybe if things go well we want to do this at some point.

Has anyone experienced many differences.  For me I'm okay with everything and I'm always lightly and gently opening up conversation about these things and he to is asking questions about race and certain things he sees at work, which is really good that we are open.

I asked him if he is okay with my age difference because if he wants more kids could come up in the future?, but I'm trying to be realistic as well about my age and having a family and that potentially this may not be easy, anyway cut a story short he just sort if explained his take on things perfectly reasonable.

On the whole we enjoy our company and just enjoy and no pressure is felt and we feel free, so this issues is defo not on our minds all the time,but facing friends, family and the outside world could be a challenge.

99,oh08qb,1625851291,Online Dating Solutions?,"I've recently become aware of how many complaints there are against online dating in this group. So, I thought this might be interesting: what would you change (if you could change anything) that would make online dating better for you, enjoyable for you, or even successful for you?

I wish I could make people stop with the assumptions. I have mostly female friends, and the most common one I hear is if a guy doesn't have a job, they assume the worst. I usually respond with ""so.... you've never been unemployed before?"" As far as I'm concerned, if a person is unemployed yet has a very recent career, and is clearly taking steps to somehow ensure they are not reliant on anyone, then it shouldn't be a problem. 

Same with profiles. ""Oh, look at his profile, he's boring."" Maybe he just doesn't know how to write a profile... much like the rest of humanity.

When I go out to pick flowers out of a tree, I don't tell the tree ""oh, your flowers are not purple enough. Grow a flower that's more purple."" If I truly *want* freshly pick flowers, I go outside, I see what's there, and just select the one I like the most. 

This is what I think is missing from people these days. Everyone has their laundry list of qualities they *think* someone must need so they can have a successful relationship. They no longer seem to be looking at the other person and considering ""can I have fun with this person?"" The interesting thing is the same people with these laundry lists are the same ones failing at relationships, but they don't seem to notice the connection.

My summary: What would you change to make online dating better specifically for you? For me, I want people to be more accepting of others, not to be so judgemental and get out of this mindset that they have the exact formula for how to get a great relationship. Because the data is showing, they really don't know what they are doing. They need to calm down, relax, and give people a shot.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oh08qb/online_dating_solutions/
