I want to send something so badly. But I haven’t been able to send anything. I don’t even know if he has my number blocked. It’s not that I want to get back together because that will never happen. He already came back and ruined it (I’ll explain below). I just want him to know how much I’m suffering. I’m losing weight harder eating and my friends are concerned, I’ve gotten severely depressed, and live in fear now with my walls up. I haven’t felt the same, haven felt like myself. I feel tied to him even though our relationship was short. I gave him the best of me, I was 100% loyal, committed and invested. I accepted him even for the baggage he had (two children with two different women, one was a high school gf long term and the other is his ex wife, both whom are married to someone else. He has split custody). I think after finally 10 years of dating (I’ll be 30 next summer) with no long term relationships in my awful dating history I had finally found “the one”, I truly did. Just like everyone says you’ll find it when you stop looking. I had stopped looking and we randomly met. It was fireworks and I was happier than ever. All my friends were so happy for me I had finally found someone. Well our random breakup in June was destructive to me. He ended it out of nowhere. I tried so hard to try to move on the rest of the summer, feeling depressed and each day moved slowly, hoping and praying he would come back... 

2.5 months later he did come back. He texted and we had a phone call that night asked me to give him another chance, gave me promises and reassurances for several weeks. He came to visit me (we are long distance 3 hours) and spent 3 amazing days with me (we didn’t hookup). Then suddenly at the end of September, he did a 180 and acted like I didn’t exist. He gaslit me and made me cry just for wanting to talk to him. Then ghosted me. Dumping me like garbage and in the dark without a word. I cannot stop thinking about him everyday and the whole situation. Who come back asking to date again and then leaves again?? It’s kind blowing! I’m suffering so hard and just want him to know how much he hurt me. My friends say not to say anything but I feel inclined to. The friend I met him through who doesn’t know him a ton said he heard he’s manipulative and controlling. But said his ex wife was also manipulative and controlling too so idk. My ex never went into detail about his past. I never pressured him to tell me, I was waiting for him to open up. 

Like I said he may have my number blocked I’m not sure. I haven’t reached out for over a month since it all went downhill. But I’m utterly confused by this and feel I cannot move on. I have a piece of him in my mind and heart, I don’t believe I’ll ever heal. I’m broken. No one has ever proved to be worthy or stick around. Everything with him was special and different, I fell in love and imagined our future together like he talked about both previously and when he came back. I wish he never came back because it was like seeing a ghost. All the promises he told me, staring into my eyes that he would never leave me again. Him saying that things would be different. He even said he would go back to personal therapy to help with his communication skills and be a better person for me. Him coming back and leaving has ruined me to the core.

Hey guys,  male here who is pretty content with life and have been dating a girl for about over a year now. It’s been pretty solid with a stretch lately that’s been up and down. I have to admit I have reacted wrongly on a couple occasions, context is that she does have a couple exes on social media , but rarely talks to them which was a concern at first but eventually I got over it. My issue is I react wrongly to
These things  from the get go. Don’t get me wrong she also acknowledged she has some issues too that needs to be worked on such as communication as she rarely is able to tell me or formulate words when she’s heated . she is on antidepressants so the sex drive has been a bit of a slow burn. We usually see each other 2- days a week or so as we both work, which is fine, lately she’s been hanging out with her friends more on those days which is fine I guess as she barely sees her friend in a one on one level. My issue is I constantly think these moves are to not see me and try to distance herself from me. I’m trying to change my destructive way of thinking but for example if she says we need to discuss some things and work on things I take it as she wants out. I’m actively working on this and she constantly reiterated she loves me etc and I’ve communicated that my reactions sometimes are not the best way to approach scenarios. But from the beginning it was an issue of telling her to stop the communication with some of her thirsty ex boyfriends which were always in the picture and she finally did end the communication. We were out once and she was messaging a guy she went on a date with years ago and I have learned they keep in contact maybe once a year or so. Another example was she without a discussion wanted to go back to a gym where her ex works , I communicated that I have no issue with this but I wish you discussed this with me prior to going as I would have done that . It just seems she acts never jealous (although in the beginning she was upset another friend who’s a girl would constantly contact me )

It just seems a bit off lately I’m not sure what to do , she still communicate that we love each other and we’re working on it but I don’t know the lack of any sexual intimacy with the minor bickering has me thinking. 

She did want to get married but now has put a pause on it as she says she was being pressured by her mother and she wants to do it on our time. She also asked me to move in before which I had to have things lined up prior to that and she took it as I did not want to and has admitted recently that she was hurt by that and she is being stubborn now when I asked to move in as my lease ends in March. 


Just needed to vent sorry guys

Whenever A and I speak we struggle to stay on topic and digress into pretty much anything else. I'm super attracted to his voice and personality. We spend most of the time laughing. We've ended up chatting for over an hour at a time. He has to fly over for this project and only needs to be here for 5 days but after a group video meeting (first time we saw eachother outside of our what'sapp pic) he actually said that he would fly over a month earlier to help with prep stuff which made me wonder if he wanted to come sooner because of me, but that's a big assumption.

But then I find out his age. He's 23. I'm 30. I'm embarrassed to even type this lol. And then it's kind of awkward. I got the vibe he liked me too because he always keeps me on the phone for ages and seems curious about me so finding out his age was... disappointing. He's genuinely one of the most engaging guys I've spoken to, he has this vast knowledge of art/culture etc., great vocabulary, he's super intelligent and has interesting insights and opinions, has me laughing the whole time and a really sexy voice. So I'm like whyyyy is he so young. 

So I'm like okay. Maybe need to draw a line under that. But attraction is a curious thing and cannot be switched off, so I've discovered lol. I try to keep convos a bit shorter and back away from embarrassing myself.

But he has now flown over and we meet for some work prep stuff with the rest of the team. I have to pick him up to drive to location and a couple more people. It's super weird seeing him in the flesh because I feel like I know him quite well and he just has these beautiful blue eyes and I'm like ahhh. Again we are just laughing constantly. By now A and I have all these private jokes about the rest of the team so when we meet up with everyone, A and I spend a lot of the day exchanging glances and sniggering at the others (we arent a-holes btw, lots of funny things just happened lol) 

A couple of times I catch A staring at me, either being silly or when I look back at him he just holds my gaze and it's... hot lol. When it's just the two of us he playfully pushes me, and even lifts a couple of really heavy things (they technically needed to be moved but not in that moment) which I felt was to show off lol. 

The thing is. This guy is like the class clown. He banters with everyone. He comments on this woman that is like 50 being hot. Regularly talks about a hot actress or singer or whatever. You know, he's 23. When we're on our way home he asks me and this other girl on the team to go for drinks. She says no and then he is practically begging me to go 'binge drinking' with him. And I'm like no thanks lol wasn't exactly depicted in the romantic way I had hoped. Its 10.30pm and we're starving so we go to mc ds drive thru and he buys my dinner (I know it's like £6 but i thought it was still sweet). He suggests we meet for drinks another time before the project and suggests a weekday if we want to keep it professional or a weekend if I want to have a proper night out. And then he says he needs to get home to poo because he hasn't been all day. Like, WHAT. Urgh. 

This long day with him left me with some complicated feelings. Based on a playlist I had on when I first picked him up he started playing a bunch of songs that he thought I'd like and they were spot on. It's like he has this great intuition and I feel sort of 'seen' by him. He perfectly summed up the kind of films and music I like in a few words. And he has this expansive taste of music and films, zero inhibitions, just a pure ball of energy. And I find him a little exhausting. I had to drive for 9 hours that day so I was feeling pretty wired. 

I just don't know how to navigate this now because I can't help being attracted to him and he's a kid that is probably just flirting with me for fun. When the project begins we will be staying on location for 3 nights and I can see myself getting jealous if he flirts with other girls who are actually his age. 

I spoke to him on the phone earlier today and when I had finished everything work related I was like 'that's it from me' and he was like 'oh that's it from you? You have nothing else you want to say to me then' because I think he wanted to carry on having a chat. But I'm thinking nooo I can't speak to you because I like you. He asks about my weekend and I try to keep it short. 

He called me again later about work stuff and then hes asking where I am because of the noise and asking about my day. I just. I don't know. I wish I could just see him as a friend because I think thats how he sees me.

We hung out a few times in groups and since then we’ve seen each other one-on-one about once a week, occasionally more, for the past two months. He’s never made a move (and obviously neither have I). He’ll usually give me a hug when I see him, and I’ll occasionally touch his arm while talking.

Usually we’re talking for 3 hours or so at our neighborhood pub, or a walk and drinks. We’ve gone to dinner a couple of times. We’re also working on a passion project together; most of our texts during the week are about that but we don’t talk about it the majority of the time when we’re together in person. 

Things that make me feel like maybe there’s something more? He’s complimented my appearance a couple times, commented on our chemistry, pays most of the time despite my offering, and has initiated the majority of our outings. When in public, people commonly assume we’re on a date. On the other hand, he’ll occasionally reschedule or not take a chance to hang out, which is fine, but maybe is reflective of him not being all that interested. 

He’s self-described socially anxious and introverted (whereas, I’d describe him as very personable and handsome :)). I’d love for my interest to be reciprocated, but more importantly, I only want to be involved with someone that has a similar interest/investment level. I adore him and value his friendship either way. I’m okay with the ambiguity/letting things play out naturally for the next two or three months – not in a rush to get in a relationship with anyone else – but would probably move on if nothing physical has happened by that point. I go on casual dates with other people now.

Because we are friends, neighbors, and working on this project, I’m hesitant to be more overt unless I’m pretty sure he’s interested.

I had already broken up with my boyfriend 1 month ago (but for different reasons, he cheated, i found out, i did cheat too but he never found out), however was just very perplexed and wondered if the failed proposals were indications of our failing relationship for 9 years (hoping such things would not repeat in future). 

Context: we went window shopping for rings in Feb 2019, bought a ring because it was the right fit and design, he kept it.

June 2019 - went on a diving trip with ex and another friend. 3rd day of trip, saw a water tap running free and i went over to try to stop it from running (environmentally conscious lol) but the tap fell out and more water spurted. Both ex and friend was laughing at me (i laughed too), but after awhile friend came over to help. Ex stood there, friend told him “hey can u help?” Ex replied “well she busted it she should fix it”.

I was super angry and it showed on my face before he knew he F Up, i refused to speak to him the next day (no apology yet too) until end of the day, he came over and asked if he could speak to me.
Ex “hey im sorry for making u angry last night. And i wished that didn’t happen as i was planning something special this trip.”

Me “what do u mean?”

Ex *takes out ring box* “i wanted to give u this.”

Me “no, take it back. Why did u choose to even give me this when we are not ok and im not in a good mood?”

Ex *silence*

Fast forward to Aug 2019 on my birthday:
We were both eating birthday lunch and he suddenly reached out into his bag and went “i have something to give u” *passes ring box*

And he even ASKED if he should go down on 1 knee?

I’m so sad. It just felt like it was a task and he wanted to get it over and done with, there is no personalization nor sincerity.

I’m an introvert, ive always told him i wanted smth intimate and small, my friends/family even reached out to him over the years saying that he could ask them for help if he needs since they knew me for a longer time and intimately. Found out from them that he never once asked. Ive even gave him some ideas on how i would like it.

I’m just looking for others’ perspectives and thoughts here to understand men better? Lol

It took me so kind to break the trauma bonds and to heal, get to the point in therapy where I could talk about it, and about 8 months to a year for me to feel completely normalish again.  To this point I still feel on guard about protecting myself. So it’s hard to feel emotions still and let someone in even just a little. 

Besides that, I’ve always been horrible talking to girls. I can’t hold a conversation for the life of me. On and off between the relationship and now I have tried to use dating apps but have been failing big. I think something is wrong with me. Of course I barely get likes and when I do get matches, they’ll unmatch after a few messages sometimes less. I never can say the right things or maybe the fact too that I think I’m unattractive.   I feel the older I get  I am missing out on a part of my life I’ll never get back. I counted the numbers 18,19,20,21,22.. and it’s like I sit here and watch people I know find love and happiness or sex if u wanna include that. I get none of it. 

I think the only way for me to have a shot is in person. But even then I am still socially awkward and can’t make conversation well. When people want to talk and we can talk about similarities than I seem to be normal, but it seems like most Girls look for the men to innovate everything, constant entertainment and I just don’t feel like I’ll ever fill the roles of “the perfect guy”. I know that isn’t real but I feel I’m far from that ego. 

From reading this post I know someone is gonna think I’m really insecure and down, I am. I know this, but it’s been a combination of letdowns for years and the blow of my last toxic relationship. I try to keep an open mind but it’s like I never get the chance because every door that opens slams shut, ghosted After another.

Now, to fill you in on our status’s, she and I are both going through divorces. She just got out of an 8 year marriage and I just got out of a 1.5 year marriage. Both of us have daughters from our previous relationships. So…

I met a girl, close to my age group, we start talking. After a few days of talking we decide to meet up. Casual dinner and a drink, nothing too crazy. Right? End of the night we end up kissing. We continue talking, we go out on our second date, I thought it would be fun to do something different so, I take her in door go karting. Sounded fun, and it was. By the end of the night, things escalated and before you know it, we are jumping each other’s bones. Everything is going great. Continuous talking, texting all day, everyday. We go out again for food, mid day lunch, we are having a good time. Then the subject of our daughters comes up, she asks to meet my daughter(who is barely 1). I agree, not sure what to expect. Turns out my daughter and her hit it off. I couldn’t believe it. Before you know it, her daughter (4 ) is asking to meet my daughter, so again I agree. Before you know it, her daughter is in love with my daughter, things continue to escalate and before you know it, a few trips to Downtown Disney, a few home made dinners together, and a lot of voice messaging each other, her daughter is wanting to see me, asking for me, asking to spend time with me.

Now keep in mind, all this has happened in the span of maybe 1.5 months. (Fast…I know)

Then mom tells me she doesn’t want a serious relationship. She still wants to date around, see other people and wants to keep this “casual.” Am I wrong for not being able to keep this as a casual thing? I mean, if our daughters weren’t brought into this, I could easily just keep it casual, I mean cmon, the sex is great, we get along, I have a good time with her. But since our girls are involved, her daughter being old enough to ask for me and my daughter, it makes it hard. I almost feel misled because I thought this was going in a relationship type way. I mean, we call each other babe, we talk everyday, about almost everything, we can vent to each other about everyday life. 

Now it seems like all we do is argue. She tells me she can’t give me what I want, and I have told her I think we are too deep, and I can’t just be a friend with benefits at this point now that our girls are involved. I have tried cutting her off, took her off social media, texting, everything, and she kept trying to reach out to me, saying she doesn’t want to lose me….I told her I’m not trying to rush her into anything, all I am asking for is some sense of exclusivity and to delete the dating app. She made a big deal of both, not willing to give me either of the two. A few arguments later, she deletes the app and tells me she has no interest in dating/seeing anyone else. But still has no interest in “being someone’s girlfriend”.

I don’t want to lose her, but I don’t want her to change too much that she ends up resenting me….but I can’t just have half of her…I can’t just be a friend and then watch her date other people at this point…

So confused.

We hung out almost every day and would go out to eat all the time. We would do that with other coworkers too but if they couldn’t make it we would still go out and enjoy the night. 

Some of our coworkers would make little comments (jokingly) to me saying that we were 👀 since we’d go into work together both happy and with coffee in our hands BUT that was not the case. 

Then another instance was in our group chat (it’s a bunch of the cool coworkers, one being his long time best friend) we were “arguing” but it was just me and him talking so then finally his bud texts “Get a room”. No one said anything but I know we both acknowledged it. 

Or the one time it was me, him, and the same bud from above going to a friends but we (me and him) had just gotten food and neither of us had any gum so we asked the bud for some but for some reason he was being selfish about it so we kept begging for some and he goes “Why? Are you guys making out later??”.

Eventually summer ended and he needed to go back to school which is a little far from where we live but that doesn’t mean we stopped talking. In fact, we video chat almost everyday and if not that then we text ALL the time. 

One day we were talking through video and he suggested I come and visit him so I said of course and did just that. I went on the trip and it was great BUT when we would go out people would think we were dating and we would both just awkwardly laugh it off. I mean, we were doing couples activities but still. Oh like how one night (and a few times in the summer) he let me play with his hair. 

Just confused bc we both complain on how we are single ALL THE TIME, send each other videos of cute couples and say damn(wishing that we each had something like that) AND we pretty much have the same views and humor. 
He’s attractive looking and a sweet person like he really couldn’t be more of my type?! 

I’ve never ever had a crush on guy best friend bc I’ve only ever seen them as that but this guy is different. I just really don’t want to ruin a good friendship if I confess my feelings but I also don’t want it to eat me alive. I’ve tried to do dating apps and I truly cannot because all I think about is him and in a way it feels wrong, (as if I was cheating???) and it’s not fair for the person on the app to deal with my nonsense.

We booked a hotel room where we would stay the night and pregame at before we hit the town. The girls had all taken a small dose of molly and me and Ethan drank some before we got an Uber. At the first club/bar we had fun in the environment and had a couple drinks and hung out. Now In the past my friends including Ethan know I have had a crush on Rachel and I was told she wanted me to come. At the first club she gives a guy her number which is nothing to me since I don’t even know if she likes me. At the second place we danced on a rooftop and had fun hanging out. The last place we went to was a karaoke bar. The place was packed so I had sat down with not much room on the bench and she had asked if she could sit in my lap, I agreed and we watched the people perform and I was put on her story with her in my lap. I had put my arm around the back of the chair to get out of the way. When the bench cleared up next to me we scooted down and she was now sitting next to me. She than laid her head on my shoulder and I took my arm down-from the back of bench and put it around her. We laughed and sang with the lyrics on the screen and it was one of the most meaningful things I’ve had happen. But when we left I’ve never felt so alone and confused, we got back to the hotel and we just all went to sleep and I just pondered what that meant and if she felt the same as I. The next morning she was gone before I woke up because she had to leave early for work and I haven’t heard anything since, should I say anything ? I just can’t stop thinking about it.

TLDR; girl I have a crush on put her head on my shoulder and I’m confused and catching feelings.

He isnt active on the dating app anymore, idk if that helps and he seemed really shy.

We met on dating app. After 2 months of texting (he did ask me out but i was busy writing my master’s dissertation and delayed the date), we finally went on our first date. I have to admit i did fall for him when we we’re texting and we clicked so well. Not long after, we made it official but the reason why we broke up is because i have to go back to my country as my visa expires (I’m international student). We did talk about our future and it seems like we don’t have the same future plan. I was willing to move to this country (where we met) but im not sure when it’s the time as looking for a job that can sponsor a work visa is so hard and it takes uncertain amount of time. He said if we didn’t know when we could close the gap, its better to end here and i agreed because i understand the situation too. Briefly we broke up on a good terms.

It was hard to not care about him first few months after breakup. I cried so much and couldn’t stop stalking him. Recently i’ve started to stalk him again and i found out it seems like he is seeing this girl and she reciprocates him too….

Tbh i know what i should do to completely move on but my heart doesn’t listen to my brain. 2021 is a stressful year for me and whenever i feel stressed out my mind keeps looking for him, thinking if we were together he would comfort me like he used to.

Hindsight is a great thing. I look back and think to myself how the fuck did I not see the signs that this guy was a narcissist? I've never come across one before but now I think I know!

His virtual persona and real life persona were very different. I liked his virtual persona. His real life persona though? Charming at the beginning, but only talked about himself. When I talked about myself, he'd make it about him and the topic would go back to him.. Sometimes I'd say something but he wouldn't acknowledge that I said something and go back to talking about what he wanted to talk about. He'd talk about all the stuff we could do together but never followed through. We only did what he wanted to do. When we spent time together it would be him doing his own thing (listening to his music, watching the movies he wanted to watch, running his errands) and I was just ""there"". When I suggested something to watch/do he'd push back. He expected we be exclusive from date one.. A big one was that his ex was ""absolutely psycho"" and when I said that it takes two to tango, that yes his ex did x y z, but he also let his ex do it or he did it himself.. he flipped. Said nope, he KNOWS he's not a bad person because if he was someone would have told him already at work. I liked him at the beginning because he was charming and direct, no games, refreshing from the usual dating I'm used to. But I feel like part of this was a manipulation technique to say the things I wanted to hear...  Towards the end of our 3 months of dating, when I stayed round he'd complain about me in the bed, complain I'd eat all his food in his flat, and make food for himself but not me (and flipped shit when I asked him how come he didn't ask me if I wanted food either). When I asked for more foreplay in bed he said no I could get it another time....

Then when I ended things, he said ""ok thats cool"" and hung up (I had to do it over the phone as we were partly long distance, either I do it over the phone or wait 2 weeks). I sent him a nice message to end things positively, and his response was ""great thanks good luck bye"". 

I'm face palming myself as I write all the above. How was I so stupid?! I gave him so much benefit of the doubt because I thought he was stressed, thought he was maybe a bit on the autistic spectrum, thought things would get better.

There’s a guy. 
I caught him staring at me and he looked away immediately. But sometimes he just makes prolonged eye contact, keeps looking into my eyes, for so long until I look away. We are not friends nor close to each other. But he seems to be interested. He seems to have studied me, studied my behaviour and personality. He also gave me Christmas card. It’s weird because we aren’t even friends. Once I got fed up with it all, so I ignored him and acted cold, but he still tried to talk to me. 🤷‍♀️

After all these years i got over it, Ive had a few friends w/ benefits and one night stands throughout the time but I’m at a point where i can’t stand this anymore. Just recently I’ve met someone on a dating app a girl that i didn’t see irl since this day, we chatted for a while, got along very well. We exchanged everything and even went on to sexting and stuff, i had real big hope that shes going to be the one. Until she revealed that the reason why she didn’t had the time to meet me yet was because of her anxiety, she broke out of a toxic relationship at the start of this year and has a hard time trusting someone new, she then went on to apologize to me for wasting my time and says she hopes we see each other again when the time is right. By then it was kinda late cause she had feelings for me as well as I did, letting go was hard but she made it easier for herself by slowly but surely blocking me everywhere except for keeping the pictures up on snapchat. So now I’m back where I was before alone and lost and losing faith but still having a little hope, to be honest im very picky and i do also care about looks as well as for a personality that fits me. Recently life got even harder, I’ve started to have anxiety and panicattacks at work and in private too sometimes, turns out my work and life situation is stressing me out and has taken a toll on me, i got an anxiety disorder, need to seek therapy and due to rona its extremely hard to get a appointment. I know alot of people gonna say you’re young dont worry everything gonna work out one day. I don’t think that way, being 25 is stressing me out too, the older i get the less woman there are that fit my wants, i dont wanna be rude but i realy dont wanna be together with a single mom or anything alike, anyways maybe this post is nothing but some venting but if not i do appreciate every other person who may has a advice or two or just some uplifting words.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126952,public,self,(M/25) Been single for 5 years and starting to lose hope to find my S/O,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qv56m9/m25_been_single_for_5_years_and_starting_to_lose/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I matched with a girl on Bumble the other day.  Yesterday her and I were talking in the app throughout the day.  As it seemed to be going well, I asked her if we could meet up for drinks and her number which she agreed.  

We started texted and she said that she would like to do something other than get drinks.  Since she is new to the area, I sent her 3 places that I really like locally (i.e., a casual restaurant, a coffee shop, and a desert place) and told her to let me know what she was feeling.  She has not responded since.

I know that these things are going to make me objetively hot if they go well. 

Anyways, my issue is that this is going to take some years, and I would like to get some dating experiences; I don't wanna be a 28-9 years old adult with 0 dating experience. I have zero dating options right now, and I know that I'd have more dating options if I'd go for ugly women, but I'm not attracted at all to ugly women. I can be attracted to someone that's conventionally unattractive, but it's not gonna be genuine, as I'll have to know her for months, if not years, so that personality could mask uglyness, and I'll still be aware that she's below-average. 

I feel bad for being like this, because as an ugly person I should have low standards on the physical side of things, but I can't. It's something I've tried and I couldn't be attracted to someone with an ugly face, not matter how good their body were. 

Should I wait to get the surgeries and have options with women I'm physically attracted to, or should I start a relationship with someone on my league? One of my fears is starting a relationship with someone on my looks level and think that, if I get this and that surgery, I could do better. I don't want to resent my partner and make her feel bad. Most people want their partner think than they're beautiful or a 10 out of 10, but c'mon, beauty is objetive on both sides: on beauty and uglyness. With average people I can understand these thoughts, but with ugly people? Not something that's going to happen to me, honestly. 

PD: I don't expect average women to date me now, not without settling. I don't want any of the old ""you're entitled"" bullshit. If I were entitled, I would be asking why average to attractive women go often for average to attractive guys, or why women don't go for nice guys.

My situations always start off really well and we have no fights, no arguments, or anything because the people I’m involved with (and I) are communicative, understanding and I’m pretty independent, so although I love spending time with them and love being with them physically, I don’t rely on them to do things for me all the time or expect them to pay all the time (I always either pay or at least offer to pay for my half of whatever we’re doing or if he pays, I try to pay for both of us the next time we go out). I also don’t expect them to always be texting me/spending time with me because we have our own lives and even though we’re “together” I understand their world doesn’t revolve around me. I always try to be the best partner that I can be and adjust to their needs/think of my partner when I do things and many times, these guys have said I’m “exactly” what they’re looking for, that I’m their “dream girl,” the “best” girl they’ve ever been with, that they love me, etc. we’ve shared similar goals/values and overall just get along great. In my situations, we’re also really physically attracted to each other so that aspect is good as well. I’ve met many of their friends and even parents and they’ve all liked me too. 

Things usually go really well and I start thinking like wow this person could be my person and then they literally wake up one day and just don’t like me anymore in that way apparently. I’ve had this happen multiple times where the guy will start acting a little different one day randomly and I ask if they’re okay or if there’s anything on their mind and then they just say they woke up that morning and felt different about us. No matter what else I ask, that’s all they say about it. I’ve had guys literally sobbing as they’re telling me this. I’ll ask why or what I can do or even tell them that we can take it slow/take a break and I just get shot down. It hurts when I’m so willing to try to make it work and they just want to throw it away. I’ve heard “you deserve better” so many times and it honestly hurts because it just seems like they’re just saying it to be nice because they’re breaking my heart and they know it. I’ve also heard “it’s not you, it’s me” multiple times and it sucks. 

Now, I get so anxious even just thinking about talking to someone new, it literally makes me nauseous. Has anyone ever gone through this/felt like this or have any advice? Is there something wrong with me? Do guys not actually like girls like me? 


TLDR: apparently guys just wake up one day and don’t like me anymore, even after telling me how much they love me or how much of their ideal type I am. Is there something wrong with me? It makes me anxious/nauseous even just THINKING about talking to someone new now. Any thoughts/advice/support is appreciated.
