1,s5j9kx,1642360982,How’s the quarantine been for y’all?,"Well, this might be long… but I have for so long have repressed these feelings. I just want to let these out.

I have always been a fat introvert kid but kinda got a glow up during my college. I have been hit on, went out on dates and a few have made advances to start a relationship as well.

However, on the inside, I am still the fat insecure kid. I have terrible back acne which I am extremely insecure about. All these things led me to not actively pursue any kind of relationships.  

Now, I have finally graduated and the quarantine has forced me to remote work with zero socialisation. I put on weight and am just one slippery slope away to being the fat kid again. All those girls who were interested in me have moved on and post pics of their bfs on Insta.

Idk.. this seems like very trivial shit in the grand scheme of things but I have this feeling that I’ll be forever alone lmao. Kinda funny how I have nothing but myself to blame.

Being 28 is seems some people younger want to chat more. I just think I might do myself a favor by not initiating conversation over text unless a women does it first. Unless its about setting up a date.   


And even calling. I feel like I should just let a women ask. Its almost never gone in my favor to try to setup a phone chat.

However, it seems like because of this, they tend to turn their nose up to me until I reveal to them that I am a college graduate with a career in IT.

Im in my mid 20’s and my gf is 18 - 20 
So my girlfriend and i have been in a long distance thing since before the covid era began i.e early 2020. 

We mainly talk online and are very obsessed with one another. Also though we have the usual disagreement and tussles we sort it out quickly cause tbh we can’t get enough of one another. 

A little backdrop on her she stays in a rural sector if the country and i stay in a very urbanised area. So our perceptions towards what’s hurtful may differ. 

Anyway she told her close friends about me and i chatted with a few of them nothing much just hey happy new year yada yada. 

The problem came when one of her friends started a baking page where she makes a new cake every couple of days tbh they look good and she followed me with that page and I followed her back i left a comment on one of her posts saying the cake design resembled a sunflower nd her friend replied with a reply completing my observation and texted me thanks with a blushing emoji this one 😊. 

Now a while later my gf texts me saying wtf have u done ur a fuckin idiot 
And telling me to unfollow her friend and immediately delete my comments 
I did well cause I don’t like fights and tried to defuse the whole situation.  

She’s already forgotten the whole thing it seems and even when i tried to hint at it she was like eh forget it nothing big. Any other day I would have been equally lenient 

But today it feels just bad. Any help as to how do i work on this little situation.

My profile hasn’t changed at all and it was getting matches before (I use bumble and hinge). I also haven’t changed my messaging strategy either which was working well.  For some reason tho I’m getting less matches and most people I do match with will respond to like one message and then stop responding.  Any advice?  At one point I deleted my bumble and redownloaded it which allowed to have a fresh account and get matches again so not sure if I need to do that again?  Any advice will help!

153 with a success rate of 0%. Different approaches, all women at or below my league, doing whatever I can to increase my chances and still 0.

I've  started to like her one year ago, but, because of Covid, and because  of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I  believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy from another class. Of course I respect her  choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her, hence I would never want to end our friendship. We see each other almost every day, if not more. **I don't really know what to do**.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like  her; big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was  going, and now I feel so hollow.

I regret not taking matters into my own hands instead of over-analyzing every sign she may have sent me.  **I waited too long and fumbled the bag**; also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has  been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about  relationships.

Although I've seen some signs that made me think she might like me, now **I'm getting into a skeptical vibe**. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more  people at the same time. She probably doesn't  know her friend told me, am I completely out of the game?

What do you think? Even though I've looked on the internet, **many were the conflicting answers, resulting in 3 main ideas:**

**A)** Should I go all-in, risk everything and avoid making the same mistakes?**B)** Should I handle this with discretion and try to develop a stronger friendship?**C)** Should I just accept the fact that I've missed my chance forever? If so, how?(Points **A** and **B** imply that I might still have some possibilities, while point **C** says otherwise)

I should also keep in mind that I'd better make a decision as soon as possible, because I will have to study hard in order to pass all my classes

Everything was great before the pandemic. Ever since, he works at home for the time being because he is a teacher, so all his classes are online for now. I am at home too because of my pregnancy and because my job is so physical, they couldn't accomodate to me until after I come back from my leave. 
We are both at home 24/7. We thought nothing of it first but slowly...it has gotten bad.
I love to paint. It is a hobby of mine that I have been doing at an early age. I haven't painted in over a year because of the move, work and also the pandemic has made it difficult.
Recently, my husband was off from school for 3 weeks as a vacation because of Christmas and was going to bed very late. When I say late , it means 6am. His whole schedual got screwed up. He woke up late and went to sleep late. 
One night, he came to bed around 4am, I just turnefld around to look at him and just smiled. All of a sudden, he got so mad saying I am selfish and that he was not in the mood. I didn't want sex, I just smiled because I love looking at him when he changes his clothes and gets into his pjs. His screaming and calling me names and saying things like "" you are so selfish"", "" I need to sleep and you HAD to turn around"", and "" your dad was right, you just think about yourself"", "" why didn't you keep sleeping"". I wouldn't be so sensitive if I was not pregnant, but this whole thing got to me. Why was he being so rude and calling me out just because I turned around to look. So I got up to go to the bathroom and cried. Honestly it felt good but I just kept replaying the whole scene in my head. It hurt. I don't feel good anymore, I feel unwanted and not attractive. 
A couple days passed by, and my dad called me saying he has some of my paints and if he can bring them with him when he visits next time. I said sure. My husband overheard and got mad AGAIN! This time he told me he did not want the paints in the house because it is a stupid hobby and not worth it because no one would want them and he finds them ugly. He said that I should find another hobby like working out or reading. I told him no. That I wanted to continue my hobby eventually and that I wont be painting everyday because of the baby, but it helps me relax. He did not understand and started yelling at me saying I am being selfish and that there is no place for any of my paints. I walked off. 
I don't know what to do because I tried talking to him, but he does not listen, he always cuts me off and just tells me no.

26,s5lu4f,1642367820,Too Up &amp; Down,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for a month. On Friday, we went out and I probably had too much wine. I think the conversation escalated over the topic of sharing: I like to share, wanted him to share, he thought it was too soon. The tipping point was when he blurted out ‘if I had had a better feeling it would have shown by now’. Straaaaaaange grammar, but ok. I was upset and a bit drunk so assumed that was the end of it (my expectations are very low with dating based on past experiences). Blocked him on everything but then woke up with a hangover and my mind full of questions, namely, if he was having doubts, why was he so nice to me and why were we on a date in the first place? He proceeded to say he didn’t mean it, did have feelings etc. We went to make a plan to meet, yesterday, but were both a bit too scarred. He wanted to meet today... I was a bit weary (all my walls are back up now) and once I’d kind of got my head round it he said he didn’t want to meet after all as this weekend had been ‘too up and down’. 

I think it had only been up and down because I’m kind of surfing his mood changes.

Deeply in love w someone I thought was my bsf for 3.5 years. Crushed me and we’ll you know the rest but I’m doing much better now and feel like maybe giving it another shot to hopefully find someone for the long run. But yea a little about me. Most of my family and friends have always said I’m one of the kindest people I know, and I commit to friends and relationships in a way that most people don’t or atleast none that I know of. I know I actually try to make things work cause all my relationships have always lasted a long time and yea there will be downfalls and hard days but I never ever give up. I’ve been pushed away, hurt and broken a lot for giving it my all and getting nada in return. But I’m not abandoning hope on trying to find my true soulmate, or more that one person I want to spend my life with.also kinda gave up on OLD but we’ll see 
But yeah so here I am asking the ladies! And guys can chime in too but this is primarily for y’all. So a couple things:
-if I were to approach a lady in say the line at a store or a coffe joint how should I go about starting a convo. Off the top of my head I feel like I’d say “Hi I’m marcos, how’s your day going today? Can I grab u a cup of coffee or something off the menu” but then again idk I feel like whatever I say it’ll come off as creepy😓
-If you were in my shoes how would you like to be approached?
-If things go well and we end up talking do I ask for  phone number or is an Instagram weird?

Long story short, I (19F) started college in September, and met this amazing guy (20M). I liked him the moment I saw him, and I invited him to hang out and we ended up becoming close friends. I confessed recently, but he told me he didn’t feel the same way. I’m not too sad about it, I genuinely believe things worked out the way they were supposed to, but it got me thinking if eventually my time will run out. I mean, so many people have found their significant other in college, and while I did get to know a lot of new people since September, I don’t know what other opportunites I’m going to have to meet new people.

Realistically speaking I KNOW that I’m waaay too young to be worried about this, but so many people around me are getting into new relationships and I’m worried I won’t find anyone who likes me back romantically.

38,s5mn69,1642369978,Advice/Opinions on splitting expenses with GF?,"Currently debating on how to split expenses for my girlfriend moving in with me and could use some advice/opinions on how I should handle the situation with splitting expenses??

For a little background, I am a VP at a large financial services company and earn around $410k per year while she is working as a medical assistant studying to go back to Med School to become a doctor earning approx. $30k per year. It’s both of our first time living with a SO so not quite sure how we should handle splitting living expenses. 

She’s actually quite frugal compared to myself and am tempted to let her stay at my house rent free since I already pay the mortgage anyway and it runs more than her annual salary. The dilemma I run into is I don’t want to feel like a sugar daddy or ATM by covering expenses 100% when I realize that’s not typically the case for most couples. She NEVER makes me feel that way but it’s something I’m guarded against. She knows I do well for myself but am not sure if she knows exactly how well. 

I’d really appreciate any advice or opinions on how we should handle splitting expenses moving  forward???

She is obviously already covering things like her car, med insurance, car insurance, fuel but I am specifically looking for advice on how I should handle expenses like the mortgage, groceries, utilities, cable, water, miscellaneous incidentals?

46,s5mv9j,1642370585,Should i cut her off?,"So this girl I work with would always run her fingers down my arm or back, she would always sit right next to me or stand up under me, stare at me and wouldn't look away would just smile if I looked back at her. So I started to flirt back with her she gave me her number and she would hardly text me and if I sent her a text it was almost as if I was bothering her. Then when we got back to work things were good. I would leave in the middle of my shift drive down the street buy her food and come back in time for lunch. Majority of the time I didn't even get myself food I did it simply because I care about her and I like her.

So after she ate we were walking g and talking g and I asked her what she thinks about these different hairstyles because I was about to get a haircut and she just says why would I care. That threw me off because she has never been that rude to me before and I didn't think she would be rude to me for asking her opinion. So later that week I had sent her a text saying I miss her and  asking if she wanted to go out and she was very rude  again. She said no and didn't try to reschedule. So the next day at work she comes up to me and my friends and says why did you say you miss me. I tried not to seem embarrassed and I told her because I haven't seen her in awhile.

I gave her space and only talked to her if she spoke to me. Then I found out she went to hang out with this older lady who knows I have a crush on this girl which kinda hurt. She came up to me asking me what I was doing on my days off and if she could hang with me I said yes. I was really excited to be hanging with her I spent my first day off getting ready for us to hang out I sent shopping bout a new outfit and shoes.

48,s5mzf6,1642370893,Trying to date in Minneapolis,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, feel free to re-direct me as needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved from the east coast to Minneapolis about a year and a half ago - in the middle of the pandemic and everything, I know, great timing. I'm vaccinated and boosted, but I'm also at very high risk of complications and other problems, so I've mostly been staying inside and avoiding people... Always great for meeting someone, I know. But, I've run into a couple of problems with trying to date here. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Minneapolis"" - people will say they live in Minneapolis when they're an hour away. I get the whole ""MSP metropolitan area"" thing, but I mean, shouldn't someone put that somewhere for clarification? I'm unable to drive due to disability, which is part of the reason why I moved to an area with good public transportation (trust me, it's not bad here). But when someone lives out in the middle of nowhere, it's not much help. I literally live in the center of Downtown west. I know there are a bunch of people here... would be nice if I could find someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the fact that I'm working remotely. It doesn't exactly make it easy to meet people. I have piles of free time, more money than I need, looking to buy a condo in the near future (staying in MSP) etc. But none of that is much good when my daily life involves little interaction with other people. I've tried online events, and they haven't been any help. I've been on dating websites for years, not much luck there either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 39, and concerned I'm going to hit that ""creepy old man"" category, if I haven't yet. I'm divorced (5 years), no children (either here or anywhere else). I'm originally from the east coast, so I tend to be fairly straightforward and to the point - which apparently weirds some people out, but whatever, life is too short.

&amp;#x200B;

So, like, what exactly do I do here? Just hunker down for another year or so, build up a small pile of money, and wait to cash in on it when things are better? This kind of sucks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5mzf6/trying_to_date_in_minneapolis/

Date went well, took her to an art gallery n a restaurant she's rlly into, it was super fun n we had a blast cracking jokes n looking at paintings n stuff n just enjoying each others company. Near the end I asked her as a joke if she'd be okay with me kissing her just to gauge her reaction n see if she was comfortable with it, she seemed pretty receptive n said to go for it, although I hesitated n didn't do it right then

Fast forward a little bit later n we're eating food n she brings up the prior conversation n tells me she's cool with physical contact n stuff but would prefer not to kiss on the first date because of some superstition she has that it always ruins the relationship if you kiss on the first date, n she doesn't want to wreck things with me

We both had alot of fun and she texted me afterwards saying she'd like to go on a second date n keep hanging out n stuff n see where it goes so I took it as a green flag as well

I didn't really mind or think much about it, but my friends have been roasting me saying I'm wasting my time n she's not even into me if she wasn't comfortable with kissing on the first date, am I overthinking, are my friends busting my balls, or are they onto smthn?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5n09a/didnt_want_to_kiss_on_first_date/

These guys just seem happier and more fulfilled idk why. Even when they joke about their ball and chain or how gf drives them crazy, you know they would never have it another way. 

Next comes the guys who are able to have sex regularly, but can’t form a bond or don’t want to for some reason ( emotionally unavailable) these men attempt to replace intimacy and validation that is fulfilled with love with sex and it works for awhile and they temporarily feel less lonely, it seems like they just aren’t as happy they don’t have that regular partner who loves and needs them 



Lastly the loneliest are the guys with nothing at all; but it’s too sad to talk about here and enough posts have been made on that 

This is just something I’ve observed and it’s been through friends , family , strangers, messages boards, celebrities etc. it seems like even the most successful men in the world with so many options still settle down fall and in love because they feel healthier and happier and to love and be loved is truly the best feeling in the world.

56,s5nd8f,1642371947,Tired of getting told sorry no spark.,"I'm definitely getting pretty tired of hearing sorry I didn't feel a spark from women on dates. 

My dates come from online dating and in the past six months I've really broaden my horizons for people I would date. I mean I literally will go on a date with just about anyone that I match with. This includes women 30+ years older then me, women that I have no shared interests with, women I'm not attracted to liltery just about anyone. I keep getting the same hey I had fun but I felt no spark. Some of these dates have been with people I could see myself with and was super excited and still same answer. It turned into alot of dates with people 10 years older then me and thats not helping my excitement much either.  

I guess this is more a rant than anything else but this is getting old and sucked all the fun out of dating. I'm tired of doing the same small talk over and over again. Or finding someone that I go into deep conversation just for them to reject me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5nd8f/tired_of_getting_told_sorry_no_spark/
57,s5nmhj,1642372649,"My perspectives on missing an ex who may well be a chronic void-filler/user/covertnarc/manipulator/selfish person. Your pure, loving heart did not deserve that mistreatment, disrespect &amp; to be discarded like it meant nothing. Do not blame yourself, friend. &amp; do not shame yourself for staying long💔❤","It's okay to miss someone but know you cannot be with them anymore. That you deserve better anyway.
When things were good, you were able to melt in their arms and feel safe and loved. You were able to just be. It was sweet &amp; peaceful.

Yet the reality is people and relationships unfold. People show you who they really are. It's hard to reconcile a huge difference in who they were then vs. who they became in the last part of the relationship. Its painful to accept that you enter a state of cognitive dissonance - having two opposing &amp; contradictory aspects of the same person exist in your mind.
Your emotions are always stronger when this happens - meaning you will struggle to let go of what was &amp; to accept what is cos it's just so painful. So you will be patient &amp; keep loving &amp; giving, waiting &amp; neglecting yourself for that version of them at the start to come back (that version was not gunna come back). 

While you remained consistent in how you showed up &amp; loved them, they weren't. This is most likely due to them using you to fill a void &amp; take what they can get &amp; need from you at a certain point in their life. Once you've served that purpose, they rationalised their lack of effort &amp; investment, excused their mistreatment, blamed you for it &amp; took you for granted. That version of them at the start, while so soft, gentle &amp; lovely, no longer exists. Was it even real? 

This is a painful reality for us to accept. Our pure, loving hearts get shattered while they, on a high from the validation, ego-stroking, love &amp; support they received from you move on like it was nothing. Fxck. It hurts when that happens. 

Become aware of the signs of people who use others to fill a void, to leach off them &amp; essentially use them to build themselves up only to discard them when no longer needed. You will save yourself energy, time &amp; investment better spent. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5nmhj/my_perspectives_on_missing_an_ex_who_may_well_be/
58,s5nner,1642372727,I don't know if I should accept my ex back... maybe I overreacted when I broke up,"Me (24f) and B (24m) were best friends for 6 years, like brothers but he started dating 7 months ago. One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother (???)

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him.

I tried to make it obvious that I was looking at him but we never made eye contact. 
I saw him deadlift twice last week and he faces the opposite direction as everyone else. I was thinking maybe I could start a convo by commenting like aren’t you facing the wrong way!? Haha. Or something like “I’m sure you already know this, but you are very strong” he is and his form is always perfect. Are those weird ways to start a conversation?

At noon, she messaged asking if I would be upset if she cancelled, because she'd rather lounge around the house and do nothing.   

At first I played it off and said no problem, hoping that she'd still up for doing something more chill but no, she would have rather stayed home alone.  

Anyway... I didnt communicate that I was hurt bc I didn't want to seem like I wasn't confident or controlling... but I was hurt.  Besides not getting to see her now, anyone else who i could have made other plans with was already busy.  So now I'm stuck at home doing nothing.  

Is there a better way that I should have handled this?  Should I have said yes, it would bother me when she asked about canceling, and been more communicative?  I would want her to go if she wasn't feeling it, but I'm pissed i this came about last minute for no reason other than to have a lazy day at home.

We were mainly communicating on Snapchat but we never really had big conversations or one of us we leave each other on red and eventually then we hung out again in December like towards Christmas and you know it wasn’t overly flirty or anything she just told me you know that it was pretty and I hate myself melody and stuff but nothing too bad that would like to get into my head. Anyway start time we also hooked up also just saw his house the whole time third time was just two days ago and we hung out at his house and got dinner and then went back and we hooked up but this time he was just telling me that he really liked me and that he cared about me and stuff like that. He’s also moving out of state for his job but he said that he can fly in and out usually on the weekends or whenever he gets time off and when we were just talking I said that my birthday was coming up it’s next month in February and he was saying that he wanted to take me out for my birthday and stuff. Anyways I was out past curfew that last time we hung out and I got in a lot of trouble when I got home. My parents had locked me out. He had texted me the next morning saying “are you ok” we had been drinking so I guess just to make sure I was home safe. I’m (20) he’s (26). I had texted back “yeah I’m ok, they locked me out like changed the garage code and everything” and he hasn’t texted me back since then. I’m not mad I guess just upset that I kind of believed into what he said just bc that’s happened in the past and they end up jusg saying stuff to get in my head or in my pants lol. I know he probably doesn’t want anything serious with me also he’s literally moving for his job and idk I just have been kind of sappy.

The conversation moved along quickly and got to a point where she said she wanted to use me for my c….   This was all a huge turn on for me.  Much more so than I am used to or really could handle without relieving myself.  We agreed to meet up for 2 nights to have sex but something just didn’t seem right to me.  

In her pictures she had physical features of a guy.  Body shape things and I couldn’t shake the suspicion that she might be a transsexual woman.

Just seemed a bit odd with her getting aggressive sexually through text messages and willing to have me come to her place just for sex.  

In life I am generally wanting more than sex.  I’m looking for friends also.  I probably could’ve handled the situation better but I felt like I was purposely being blinded by sexual aggression.  And there wasn’t enough other substance to convince me it was a good idea.  

She got upset when I asked her if she had been a female her whole life and she got a bit upset about that.  I told her why and since I couldn’t shake the suspicion that she could easily be lying to me through texts and hiding it by keeping me blindly horny.

We went on many dates, and slept together many times, but he ultimately said he wasn’t interested in an actual relationship. Just a friends (with benefits) situation. So I decided to stop talking to him in December. Soon after that, I started seeing another Hinge man (23M), “guy 2”. We’ve been on 1 zoom date and two in person dates. He says he really likes me. We have not had sex. And we are not exclusive yet.

Last night, guy 1 asked if he could come over and drop off a (belated) Christmas gift he got for me. I hadn’t seen him since I ended things in December. I said ok. This was around 1am, by the way. Once he got there, he started touching me and telling me how much he enjoys spending time with me. So it turned out he didn’t just want to drop off a gift. We ended up sleeping together.

Today, I’ve been feeling guilty about sleeping with guy 1 when I’ve started going on dates with guy 2. I felt bad enough that I felt the need to confess all this to guy 2. (He had told me before that he’d be uncomfortable with me being friends with a guy I’ve slept with if we were in a relationship, so I knew he might disapprove of this, and therefore thought it important to let him know). He said that hearing this made him uncomfortable and that he has to think about whether or not he’d like to continue seeing me. 

That is fair, I mean, he can choose to end things for whatever reason he wants. I’m just wondering if it’s common for people to react in this way to hearing you slept with someone else before you were exclusive with them. How bad it is that I did this? I’m afraid that I did something morally wrong or obviously hurtful. I shouldn’t have been stupid enough to allow guy 1 to visit me. I’m questioning whether or not I am actually a good person, given that I did this. Does this make it seem like I’m not ready for a relationship? Or that I’m not over guy 1?

74,s5oy5u,1642376230,Girl told me she doesn’t want anything serious.,"There’s this girl that I’ve been seeing, and long story short we were going out consistently, but l went on vacation and I guess things sort of became dry or something. Like she cancelled a date we had today bc she was feeling kind of sad and introverted I guess, which there’s nothing I can do about it. 

It just seems shitty to make plans with somebody a week in advance and I was looking forward to it, and then for her to cancel a couple hours before basically bc she’s not feeling it. And so I kind of like said like I’m not gonna chase you, then she told me she really didn’t want anything serious, and I guess she is just feeling sad or something, and we established that from now on we’ll be fuckbuddies.

The thing is like I’m kind of sad myself. Like I realized I don’t even like this girl that much, I known her for a long time and had a crush on her when I was younger, but I’m just bummed out that she doesn’t see me as anything long term. I genuinely put effort into my dates, she’s been surprised I remember stuff about her, and I was kind of hoping I could share my life with someone in a way. 

I also don’t get why she wants to fuck, cuddle, she told me she’s not seeing anyone else, but no commitment is what she wants. This is the second girl that I’ve liked and they like me (want to fuck, go on dates) but don’t want a relationship with me. I’m college aged so maybe people my age are like that, but my friends are all in relationships and I kind of just feel alone. 

I’m feeling a little teary eyed, not necessarily bc of her, but because I was hoping I had something with someone, but I don’t. I put myself out there, I feel like I’m a good guy, I have friends, I feel like I’m a normal person, and I can’t seem to have what other people my age have, I feel like I’m doing something wrong (who knows maybe I am). 

It makes me doubt myself and like fuck I just want a genuine connection with someone, and not feel like someone is using me I guess.

I just feel like crying not bc of that girl but bc I feel alone and incomplete, and I thought I had a chance at a cool relationship with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5oy5u/girl_told_me_she_doesnt_want_anything_serious/

So his break up was probably nearly 3 years ago now, and if he's still not moved on it's been a long time.

The way he was acting with me, the more it went on the more I stupidly thought maybe I was maybe helping him forget about her. He acted crazy about me, finding all these interests in common, getting emotional, even he said we were leaning on each other through this pandemic.

It's ended now because he reminded me. 1.5 years of my life wasted. I feel so stupid, I feel used. Day 13 No Contact and it's killing me. Although I deactivated my IG now, so he cant message anyway.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5p6du/i_was_the_rebound/

2 years ago we hung out twice, had sex once, and honestly I fell for him (we had been texting heavily every day during lockdown) I had an amazing time with him and was lovestruck (doesn't happen to me that often) he left and then he didn't communicate with me for a month so I thought I got ghosted, I was really hurt cus nothing like that ever happened to me. 

We continued to chat on and off for the two years after that and secretly my feelings never really went away for him but he lives in a different city so honestly what can we do so I just tried to shrug it off

So yeah then he texted me today, I was surprised. He's already apologized to me before for not communicating much, as he's been genuinely going through a lot of bullshit (I understand)

I'm cool at this point w just being friends, as a lot of time has passed, but do you guys think I should tell him I had really strong feelings for him and still kind of do?

79,s5plsn,1642378019,Help-Bf gets angry often,"
Ok so my bf (25M) and I (24F) have been dating 6 years. I love him so much and our relationship is generally pretty great. We talk about marriage a lot and I think that is where we’re headed, but I want to work out a few of the communication issues we have before then. 

My bf comes from a family where there is a lot of yelling. Everyday tasks (driving and needing to give directions, ordering take-out, packing and unpacking the car) can easily result in screaming matches between the whole family. I typically just keep quiet during these situations when we are visiting with his family, and while it does bother me I never really have to get involved. Also I know his parents are amazing and love him to death. This is just their way of communication and they’ve been doing it this way for 25+ years. They are all type A people, so there is bound to be some clashing.

However I come from a very laid back family, where there’s barely ever yelling. I can’t remember my parents screaming at me like that since maybe freshman year of HS. We just talk and use our words to communicate any issues we are having. So naturally this kind of yelling really bothers me and stresses me out. When it is between him and his mom, it’s annoying but I can deal with it because it’s not directed at me. But when he snaps at me I get very anxious and upset and typically end up crying and he knows that. So usually he is able to calm himself down enough before he comes to me with issues. 

However, I would say about 3-4x a week he does still snap at me. And it’s for small inconveniences (today for example: we had TP that was supposed to be delivered today but it got stolen from our front steps, and I had used the last of the toilet paper still in the bathroom. But I figured it wasn’t emergent as we still had wet wipes and I told him I would go to the store this afternoon. But he ended up screaming at me when he had to go to the bathroom before I got a chance to go to the store.) I explained to him that I am not his emotional punching bag, and he doesn’t get to speak to me like that just because he’s frustrated about the delivery. He apologized to me about it about 30 mins after, but I am still upset because we had this exact conversation about another small thing only 2 days ago. He said that he knows and he’s sorry, and that he’s working on it. But clearly it’s still happening.

I love him so much but I am not okay with communicating with me like he does with his mom. He knows this and is ok for the most part, but it still really sucks being screamed at over toilet paper or a phone charger that I didn’t return to the right spot. And don’t get me wrong- I am by no means perfect. I am very laid back and I often lose things and can be a bit messy at times compared to him. I’m totally okay with him coming to me with issues, it’s the initial screaming I have an issue with. I’m also ok with his type A personality, I think that’s actually a good balance for me. I just hate the yelling.

I really want to be with him but I’m worried that if one day we ended up having kids together, he would be even more frustrated and the snapping would get worse. I want to ask him to go to anger management or some kind of therapy with me so we can work on communication together, but I think he would get really sad/offended if I asked like I’m not acknowledging the work he’s already put in. He also sees his behavior as normal because this is how he grew up, so he doesn’t see why it’s such an issue to me. 

TLDR: my bf is generally amazing but gets frustrated and snaps/yells at me over little things. Can this be fixed with therapy or do I need to just get over it?

Also sorry in advanced for grammar errors and general wordiness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5plsn/helpbf_gets_angry_often/

82,s5q5sg,1642379607,"I don't know if I should get back to my ex boyfriend, maybe I overreacted when I broke up","Me (24f) and B (24m) were best friends for 6 years, like brothers but he started dating 7 months ago. One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother 

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him. Maybe I'm wrong and overreacting.. maybe the love comes back now that he is changed...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5q5sg/i_dont_know_if_i_should_get_back_to_my_ex/

So long story short I started seeing this girl and we started seeing each other often she would always come over and it was honestly going good I really liked it but then all of a sudden one night I was picking her up and keep in mind that she did Live across I live in a border town in Laredo Texas so I would always pick her up at the border and she lived in Nuevo Laredo basically one night she was crossing and what happened was she brought me some food and some ingredients to make hotdogs the people working on the bridge basically threw it in front of her face and she felt very humiliated during the car ride she did not wanna speak to me at all I try my best to engage in a conversation but she just wasn’t in the mood to talk anyways moving forward we finally came to my house and we were watching a movie well it felt like I was watching the movie because she was still distant and kept looking at her phone H I tried to make conversation again but she still doesn’t want to talk but anyways before heading to bed she had told me hey can you please drop me off tomorrow in the morning I don’t think I want to be here all day so we had actually planned to watch a show the following day but you know I respected her space and I wanna head and dropped her off in the morning after that she still seemed a little bum and I noticed she was being very distant I noticed after that day when I dropped her off she stopped telling me I love you as well as her pet names I wanted reassurance and I told her that I love her and then she told me that she wanted to talk about something she went ahead and told me that she felt like I wasn’t being completely honest with her and that it made her feel uncomfortable and as if I was a stranger to her I was really confused and I told her that I didn’t want her to feel like that so anyways she ended up saying that she couldn’t change her mind about how she felt about it and that she did not want to go out with me anymore after that happened I did feel sad however I didn’t want to cry but then again I didn’t because at the same time I was also working I work from home so I take calls so I don’t really have time for that but anyways that’s been already more than a week ago and today I’ve been at home all day and I still think about it I still feel sad about it and I’m not sure if I should cry I still haven’t cried over what happen and I’m not sure if I should cry I know that we were together longer this probably would’ve ended even worse and I probably would’ve hit me even harder but I’m just not sure how to deal with it I’m not sure of me holding in my tears would be best showing me that I can with stand this type of situation but I do try to keep myself distracted which is also what helps so today I’m still home alone and I sorta feel like crying but I’m not sure if that’s right for me. Moving back to the break up I did go ahead and tell her I’m really sorry about how you feel and I wish that we could go ahead and talk more about this but I can’t change the way you think about me but I do wish you the best I still see her online on my Facebook messenger and she still looks at my stories every single day I actually get notifications for the people that look at my story on Facebook and on Instagram and she still appears she does have all of my contact information so by any chance if she still wants to talk about it she can go ahead and reach out to me I’m not sure if that something I should look forward to because at the same time I don’t but I’m not sure how to go about it if that were to happen but I’m also not thinking about that.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5rj3m/handling_first_break_up_after_a_while_not_sure/
97,s5rnsh,1642383966,"Best free Online dating website, scam free","Hi hi,


So yeah,m 24 yrs old, I'm looking for an online dating website since I am shy to ask someone out in real life. I'm so timid that several times, girls have asking me out or sent me hint like being treated specially(sharing food, paying attention to my clothes, asking to go out or teasing me/grabing my cheeks/arms/chests....) I just ghost them when they go too far, it feels weird to have feelings for someone. I'm not into dating in public..... And I'm picky.

For my higher school education, I went to a school only for boys and was there for like 8 years, barely talking to any girl outside. And my parents have been gicing me tips on ""how to choose the perfect girl."" So I guess these are the root of my problem.


That's why I'm into online dating. Tried Tinder no success, tried an online website but it was just a scam dating web, had to pay to send every messages.


Since then I don't trust online dating that much. But if a dating website requires one of the user to upgrade to a membership(15 USD a month) so that he/she may send or read messages. Is it a scam? One that comes to my mind Korean Cupid, a friend is on it and tells le he interact with many people......",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5rnsh/best_free_online_dating_website_scam_free/

We haven’t set a date/time for a reschedule because of school, but I feel like I’m leading her on. Should I break things off now or go on the second date and do it after? I really don’t want to hurt her anymore than it’s guaranteed to, I can tell she’s a little bit insecure about herself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5roh7/how_do_i_break_things_off/

I know I haven’t been talking to him as frequently or as enthusiastically as I had been and now he’s texting me asking “if we’re okay?”. How do I let him know in a kind way that there is no “we” after 2 dates?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5rp2g/how_to_let_this_guy_down/
