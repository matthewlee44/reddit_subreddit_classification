0,s3v2d9,1642174269,Should I Delete it,"21F I've tried dating apps to find someone to date, and I've been on them for awhile. I feel like deleting it because I don't get any matches or messages on them I have like 3 of them. Like I don't know rather to pay for it.or not, I feel like it's a waste of money to try and get someone normal. Or I won't get anything if I pay for it like a gamble and like proving myself that I'll be alone. 

I don't know what else to do, I've done lots of things to keep myself distracted and my loneliness is pretty loud and not helping much even when I do my job or my regular hobbies it's always in the back of my mind. I don't have many friends either they moved away or busy, and it's hard making a few 

Online dating was my out to meet someone and have fun with, but that doesn't seem to work. I don't like going out by myself cause it's not fun and I would like to hear others opinions on certain things, so I'm usually at home or at work. 
I do my own things, but it's really starting to bother me that I can't get someone like even if I do try it's always crickets in my inbox and I can't see likes because the apps blur it unless I pay, idk if it's worth it paying for, it has worked for some but I don't think I'm that lucky that I'll get a date if I pay and would rather use that money to something else 

Like I've never dated anyone, or been in a relationship I feel very left behind that I don't even know the basic of it. 
I feel like quiting all together and just go back and try to accept my loneliness since that seems easier, that I won't be held or see someones face or have a conversation with someone.

We have worked together last couple years and have gotten close. We have always flirted on and off and even shared nude photos with each other recently. We both have kids so to hangout we both have to find babysitters.  

This girl and I are hanging out next Monday and going to get food and drinks, but both of our homes will not be available to invite one another back to‚Ä¶kids will be at both of our homes.  

What should my main objective be on this hangout besides of course having a good time? Do I try to kiss her if the hangout goes well and she is giving the right signs?  Goal is always if the vine is right get back to her place or my ace, but this can‚Äôt happen this time.

She has stated recently she isn‚Äôt looking for a boyfriend and wants to focus on herself and her child, she got out of a relationship 3 months ago.  I would obviously be open to FWB.

6,s3vfov,1642175267,An open letter from a heartbroken man to the woman who chose her ex,"Dear K,

It's still hurting me how you broke my heart. For awhile we talked about our families, our hobbies, our jobs and our passions. It seemed like everything was beginning to click. Those times we were hanging out in person you were even more beautiful than in your pictures, there was a sweetness in your voice and your laugh brightened the room.
You talked about how this seemed too good to be true, but you were enjoying every moment of it. We didn't plan out every detail, but we talked of a future together. For the first time in a long time, I had hope. The chemistry was undeniable, and the fire in your eyes drove me wild.
In the heat of the moment, we had sex. But it was not just a hookup. It was two people with genuine feelings. There was conversation and a heartwarming backstory. It was passionate, and felt like the first of many trysts in a loving relationship.
But then it happened, your ex came back into the picture. You said despite how much you were into me you had to ""hear him out."" You apologized profusely and said you meant it when you said you had feelings for me, but that his arrival changed things. You were with him for so long and never expected to hear back. You needed time to gather your thoughts.
I was respectful. I told you that I was hurt, that I had truly hoped we could be together. But wished you the best and hoped no matter what you end up happy. I meant that.
It's been weeks, I have matched with others. I have tried to push forward. I have had decent conversations. But my mind always goes back to you. I know I shouldn't think this way, but you left a mark on me. How can I be grieving so much over someone I wasn't in an official relationship with?
I miss you, but I know in my heart if I text you it'll make things worse. You wanted space and anything less would be disrespectful. I stay strong in the hopes that eventually I'll find the person that is meant for me and forget this pain. Or that if somehow it is you, that you come back and we can talk it out.
I've had plenty of women say they want to be in a relationship, plenty who say they want a future with me. They all disappeared, none were honest. But the thing that hurts the most...when you looked in my eyes, told me you were glad you met me, said you wouldn't let me go, and said you wanted to be with me...I believed you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s3vfov/an_open_letter_from_a_heartbroken_man_to_the/

Three years ago I met a cute French girl online we had alot of things in common, music, art &amp; we are both so socially awkward so we decided to be texting buddies, we texted everyday for a whole year long story short she fell in love with me and I completely freaked out since I never questioned me sexuality, my education was always my priority and love was something not really on my mind atm.
She didn‚Äôt really ask me for anything she just started casually mentioning that she might have feelings for me more than friends and I tried to pretend cluelessness but to no vail since I actually started having feelings for her too.
At first I was trying to be distant out of fear of my family and the society I live in and I even tried to leave her but she held on to me and I didn‚Äôt resist because tbh she was my everything, I never felt as happy as when I had her, anyway at the end I confessed my feelings to her but she ended up not forgiving me for trying to leave her and she basically dumped me without even starting a relationship.
This thing had been tormenting me for 3 years now, I am afraid of never finding love again after I lost the love of my life whom I couldn‚Äôt even meet irl once, I don‚Äôt know how to find love again after I was forced to face my sexuality in a society that doesn‚Äôt condone it and never will, I am afraid of my parents whom I am very dependent on financially for my education which I need to continue on pursuing and tbh I don‚Äôt want them to be hurt because of me since they got only me, this would kill them if they knew, I even don‚Äôt know how would I be in the right place and time or meet people to fall in love again with when I even can‚Äôt come out and probably won‚Äôt for the rest of my life, not mentioning how socially awkward I am. my parents started setting me up with blind dates and arranged marriages and I don‚Äôt know for how long can I refuse and persist.

10,s3vzxt,1642176684,"30, F situation with my FWB 28, M","So, I've known a guy in the next town since last August. We met off Reddit. He was just coming out of a long term relationship and while we were single we had a few wild meets: we'd go out and eat or go on drives. The conversation was usually casual, flirty and polite but over time he'd revealed things about himself. He doesn't know me much though. He seemed to pull away whenever I started sharing things. We've had our fights and misunderstandings over the months but always patched up. We called it friends with benefits and were always looking to try new things in bed. The last time we met for just a few hours he took me to his home- a crazy risk I thought (he has some debt so I assumed that may have been part of why he chose there over a hotel as usual). A neighbor saw us leaving too. He said he'll deal with whatever. When we'd spoken about our dating lives he'd told me he's enjoying his single phase. I saw him as fun company back then, not really ""dating material"".

September to December I was seriously dating someone else and told the FWB I'd need to cut ties and he was ok with it. It was a wasted 3 months. When I broke up I called the FWB up and he wanted to meet soon- but unexpected circumstances stopped us. We continued flirting instensely- way more than we ever did before. He told me he's been on dating apps and has gone on a few dates, asked about someone I might know whom he right swiped. I was getting jealous talking about other girls, I'll admit. Then he suddenly didn't reply to texts for a week. He owed me some cash too- I was upset and decided he was ghosting. I posted on Reddit looking for new people to date. A day later he texted that he had seen the new post and said ""I guess you don't want to see me any more.. I don't know.."" I said I'd been upset that he vanished. He said that he'd been on a trip and had distanced himself from everything, not just me. We resumed flirting, hoping to meet soon. I had moved into a new place and he wanted to come over. I liked the new intense flirting and thought about it- we have similar vices, the sex n chemistry are good, I feel safe with him- I've even been home- wouldn't it be good to get to know each other better and maybe date? I wondered if all that was enough to springboard dating. I asked him to please not say yes just to keep the sex going.

So I sent him a long message asking if he'd be open to getting to know each other better and to date.. and that though I'm recently single this wouldn't be a rebound for me.. that I knew he's dating now but I didn't know his intentions. But I was worried about gossip if my neighbors noticed me having guy(s) over- and it spilling over to work (this is institutional accommodation and all of us work here). I was also worried he'd get mad and never speak to me again for asking and so I asked him to please not talk to that colleague on the dating app about me or share our private media if they matched- my vices and sex life aren't her business.

He took a few days to read n finally reply to the long texts though we'd otherwise continued to text n flirt. He first asked if the long texts were asking him out. He said he's sorry, not looking for anything serious and that my messages were all only looking from my pov. He was very upset that he had me home where he lived 26 years and I was hesitant to have him over here. He said I shouldn't mislead people like that and called me a defensive fuck when I tried to explain my fears. He said he was only meeting me and his ex and I shouldn't assume I was one of many girls. And that he's NOT different from other guys looking to get laid on dating apps. He thought it'd be fun coz he's single to get back on the apps. He said he's not looking for anything serious, just playing around with his dick. He was also mad that I randomly mentioned the other girl. He said if I didn't think of him as a rebound I wouldn't have had second thoughts about having him over and that he felt worse that I specifically mentioned rebounding at all.
I said I'm sorry that he's upset about me hesitating to have him over and that by dating I had meant hanging out more- not jumping into something serious coz we actually don't know each other all that much. He's not replied yet. He said he's out and has plans today, will get back to me.

I'm guessing we could have dated without a label and saw where things go organically but I was impatient to wait and ask him in person.. and now my questioning has made things messy. I guess I put him on the spot. I can't tell if he is interested in me or not. Whether he's just disappointed that I changed my mind about hosting him or he's hurt about more than that. I'm confused but not emotionally invested enough to feel too hurt. It's rare that I get along with guys or trust them like him- so losing him as a FWB will suck too if it comes to that. I guess I wanted to call it dating to have license to have him over.

16,s3x186,1642179411,Advice on how to ask why the sudden change in behaviour?," So I'm not entirely certain if this is the right sub to be asking, but I'm desperate for some advice.

I've been seeing this guy for 2 months now, (well we've been talking for 2 months.) Things have been going really well, texting all day, having phone calls once every other day. We met on Tinder and he deleted his profile last week which I took as a good sign. He made his intentions clear from the start, that he was looking for something long-term which is what I want too.

He is very complimentary and showed great interest in me, which is something I'm not typically used to. We went out for our 3rd date this week, he took me mini-golfing. The date went well and I had fun. At the end of the date, he went to hug me goodbye. At this point, we were yet to kiss, so I just went for it. I barely got a peck back so was obviously mortified and ran off to catch my train.

After this, I sent a text apologising for the unwarranted kiss. He replied back that a kiss shouldn't happen like that and that it should ""happen naturally, but I still enjoyed it."" Obviously by this point I was just so mortified, how on earth is a kiss meant to 'happen naturally?' After some back-and-forth, he finally said that he was 'happy to see me again.' This gave me a little glimmer of hope, and I agreed that I felt the same way.

It has been 2 days since this interaction and things have gone completely stale. He is taking 2/3 hours to reply to a message, whereas previously would be within 30 minutes. The way he texts has also changed, no use of emojis anymore and the phrasing has turned quite matter-of-fact. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's really been playing on my mind and has been distracting me at work.

I really like this guy, things were going so well and now they're not. I need to confront this soon as I am really overthinking things. I just wouldn't know where to start with how I phrase this. I understand that guys can get quite spooked from these things, and I don't want to come off too keen. But it is important I understand why the sudden change. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

There‚Äôs this girl I meet like 6 months ago from my friend and I got her Instagram but I never followed up on her because I was in a situation-ship 

I slide in her story  like a week ago with the intention of asking for a hangout at the end of it (since I got to build something up first since we are strangers) , it‚Äôs been 7 days and we have exchanged a total of 28 messages. Her energy was really good in text and she wrote long messages for a girl but she posted on her story herself yesterday and I complimented her curly hair and after that it seems like her energy is off like she wants to end the chat quick or I could be overreacting. The chat is pretty much dead at this point I was thinking of asking for a hangout right now. Do you guys think it‚Äôs too soon or not? 


Also if I do hangout with her, this is my main concern how do I tell her at the end of the hangout that I‚Äôm  interested in her I‚Äôm more then a friend and I want to explore dating with her etc. I don‚Äôt want to ask for a date over text straight away cuz I went her to get a feel of my personality through the hangout especially because we are strangers at the moment.

28,s3y0pl,1642181946,How would you feel in this situation?,"This is all hypothetical. Nothing like this happened to me 

How would you feel if your SO had a close friend of the opposite gender who they were friends with for about ten years. The friend was interested and they even slept together about a year or two PRIOR to meeting you but the relationship didn't progress beyond friendship because your wasn't interested in them like that. However, that friend still had feelings for your SO but your SO met you and wanted to be with you. 

What would you do?

For me, it depends on the circumstances:

If the girl who liked him did nothing to interfere in my relationship and my hypothetical bf didn't give me any reason to believe that he liked her or preferred her company over mine, I would be fine with it and let continue being friend. After all, if my bf never took the friendship to the next level when he had a chance to then that should be strong indicator that I have nothing to worry about. Friendship is so important and I hate to come between that. In fact, I would probably reach out to the girl to try and comfort her since I know how badly it can hurt to see someone you love fall in love with someone else. I probably even try to help her find someone else of she would let me.

But at the same time, if the girl was actively coming on to my bf and going out of her way to sabotage what I have with him, then I would hope my bf would end the friendship. Because if he just put up with her crap and made no effort to assert boundaries or cut her off then I would question if I have a future with him.

29,s3y1lf,1642182012,Assuming my friend just is comfortable being really close to the opposite gender without going past friends? 28m,"I get a bit confused by my relationship with a 25f. Several months back. Like 6-8 months back I started to run into her more in social circles. We would end up pulled away from others chatting several times and I really started to like her. This one time we went rock climbing with some of my friends and we kept on goofing off and I wanted to ask her out and lost the courage. I did end up later asking her out  and she told me that she ""wasnt looking to date right now"". That made things awkward and I took that as a clear sign that she really liked me as just a friend. I needed space and she kept giving me mixed vibes. I took her comment as a nice way to say ""no Im not into to you""  


Then recently she asked some of us if anyone would like to join her for morning rock climbing. At this point Im chill with things staying friends I think so I said I would. But again im not sure how much alone time I can spend with her though.   


She was super nice and kept on hinting for me to climb more with her. Brought up some other things outside of gym to do to like a trapeze class. I agreed to certain days we could climb in the morning and she signed us both up for a belay class. We are encouraging others to join us in the morning for climbing, but she seems completely happy talking and climbing with me.   


Basically Im very positive she just enjoys talking to me and thats it, but im trying to figure out how close I cant get to her until I need to vocalize a boundary since even after this morning my brain was trying to play tricks on me. Trying to come up with reasons why she might be into me now, but I'm 90% sure that Id be completely wrong. For one she didnt ask me directly she asked a group of us if we would climb with her, but I was the only one who agreed. 

and the fact I did ask her out and so she knows I was and could still be interested is weird. She shows no sign of discomfort with hang out.   


I just dont know. If I knew a girl potentially liked me and I didnt like them back, I would not be inviting them to spend time with me alone.  


We never really had a discussion on defining the relationship. I just feel like at some point I'm going to need to bring it up, because I am worried im going to catch feelings again if I spend to much time with her and I might need to let her know I need boundaries if things wont go beyond friendship.

32,s3y8kv,1642182546,"Am I screwing myself over by trying to not come off as ""sleazy""?","My approach to dating so far has always been with the mentality that women will get offended if they get the impression that I am looking to get physical with them on the first date. So, for example, I will always be very hesitant to suggest going back to my place on a first date. However, this is just what I've internalized growing up from the media and the internet and I've realized over time that many women are not like that and actually *expect* to get physical on the first date and I am pretty certain I have been ghosted by women for not trying anything. I've even had girl invite themselves to my place on the first date and I didn't make any moves just to be on the safe side. I've missed out on some great opportunities because of having this mentality.

However the problem is, there are many women who *are* like that and it is usually not possible to know which type you are dealing with before setting up the date. Like for example, I set up a date with a girl tonight at a bar but I definitely picked one that is closer her place. This is definitely not conducive to the possibility if going back to my place and making out or something, but I can't help but feel like if I picked a bar closer to where I live, and she wasn't that type of girl, she would see that as a sleazy move. Truth be told, making out on the first date is ideal for me. Hell I wouldn't even mind having sex on the first date. But I don't want some girl labeling me as a sleazy perv because she isn't on the same page.

35,s3yjo3,1642183328,I've just been used and ghosted,"I'm not sure where else to write this, so here it is.
These last few months have been hell for me relationship wise and with regards to my mental health. I'll just share my most recent experience. This will be a bit long so please bare with me.

I met a guy playing games online. Things were friendly at first but then we ended up being in call for 6-8 hours every second day together. Voice calls and video calls. My feelings grew each time we would call each other. His personality and sense of humour really pulled me in, he and I even agreed at one point that we are like the same person, just different genders. 

Now this goes on for roughly 2 months, these long calls, us playing games together. He even invited me to join his friends discord server so I met all his friends and played games with them too. Things were going pretty well I thought and everyday I looked forward to a message from him. Now, we lived in different states but he lived in the state that I'm from before I moved out and where my family is. So, with Christmas coming up I decide I'm going to go and catch up with my family in that state and while I'm there I could meet up with him for the first time in person instead of these video calls and phone calls. He agrees to meet up and acts super excited about it. So things continue as they are until I get to my home state and drive an hour and 20 minutes to see him. 

Initially, things were fine, they were really good actually. It was just like being in video call except it was in person. We were laughing and flirting and then one thing led to another and we ended up having sex that night. I realize how strong my feelings are for him and the next day I start to feel anxious about it because I'm very used to being treated like shit in my past relationships, and very used to people just ghosting me. He knows this and has reassured me he wouldn't do this. So the next day I ask him what this situation is. He tells me he doesn't know, I then say that I'm bad at flings (I catch feelings) and he responds ""I'm bad at flings too"". So I saw this as a positive but I tell him that I hate feeling like I'm the one that cares more, because I had noticed especially closer to when I was coming to meet him, that I was the one messaging first most of the time and asking to play games or hang out. He then told me that ""that's how it always is in any relationship, there's always one person that cares more."" Which to me sounded very wrong. He also told me that he does care he just ""doesn't know how to show it"". He tells me he will come up to see me for new years and not to worry. 

So I leave that next night and there's a period of 4 days between then and new years. Each day goes by and no message from him, not even a ""did you get home safe"" message the night I drove back, in the rain, at night, on 3 hours sleep. So me being the dumb ass I am that cares more once again, I message him the night before new years asking if he's still coming. He responds telling me he has some family drama and that he probably can't come, sorry. I respond saying I hope everything's all good. But deep down I felt like it was an excuse. The next few days he didn't message me either, I reached out asking what was going on and I also stated that I wish he could have just been up front about not coming to see me. He responds a whole day later saying sorry and agreeing that he should have and that he's just been busy but he is keen to play games with me soon. This brings me some relief, so I respond saying thats okay, I just ask that you communicate because you know how I can overthink these situations. He then never responds to that message, a few days go by and I see hes online but no response. So at this point I'm getting tired of trying. 

In this time I also heard from an old friend of his that in his last relationship he knocked up his ex and left her. So I felt sick to my stomach, and remembered that when we had sex he literally slipped it in with no condom on, no lube, and came inside me without really talking about it or asking. When I mentioned it he said ""yeah well you had time to say something if you didn't want it"" ... I brushed it off in the moment because of my feelings and I just thought maybe he's right. But now I felt sick about it all. I proceeded to send a message to him saying ""I've just heard about something you've done. I feel sick, I really cared about you and valued you, but I was just an object to you. Thanks, I guess."" He was online, so I knew he would see it. His old friend then elaborated and said they broke up two weeks later after discussion and after he made her not have the baby, so it didn't sound as bad as the initial statement I was told, but still. I really just felt like an object. I felt extremely used and the fact that he is just brushing me off now made me very hurt. He proceeded to unfriend me on everything. This made me even more anxious and sick, I sent a message on Facebook asking if we could just talk about it, and then asking if he really only intended to just sleep with me all along. 

Aaanndd he left those two messages on read. I was devastated. Why did he spend so much time getting to know me for 2 months, letting me meet his friends and play games with them too, video and voice calling me for 6-8 hours every other day, letting me drive an hour and 20 minutes to meet him. Just for this? Like what the fuck? What a waste of my time? If he just wanted a fling why didn't he just say so? I've heard that he's told his friends that I was ""crazy"" and ""went off"" at him in ""all caps messages"" (literally never happened) just because he didn't respond for a bit. So he's lying to make himself not seem like a piece of shit. More so why do I even still care, why do I want him to message me even though he treated me like dirt and used me. I really feel like shit ever since this all happened just over a week ago. These last few months have been very hard on me and he knew that, I would vent to him and he would reassure me, only to treat me just as shitty as all the guys in my past have. I've never been as depressed as I am now, and I don't know if I can ever really trust someone again at this point.

43,s3zkha,1642186152,Guy I'm dating may go to prison over gun charge,"The guy I have been dating for some months now told me last night that he will most likely go to jail for getting caught with a gun. I did not speak to him for almost 2 days which is odd because we do speak everyday either via phone or FaceTime (he lives 2 hours away). We also split weekends to visit each other. He told me that he was pulled over last night, but it still doesn't justify why we didn't speak the day before. At 3:30am this morning he sends a picture of him in the back of a cop car. Apparently (and I understand how crazy this sounds) he was caught with a gun after deciding he was going to go to a girls house to retaliate. 

This is the story. He's out with a friend and his friends girlfriend and they went to a party. He starts saying some stuff about how the girl was trying to introduce him to another girl and he rejected (not sure if I believe it) and both girls became angry. One of the girls got kicked out of the party and they all left and one was very disrespectful to him in the car. He was driving. He drops them off at home and one of the girls is saying she's going to get him jumped or beat up by some other guys. He and the guy go back to his place so he can get his gun. The guy I'm dating has a DUI...he shouldn't be caught with a gun. He also doesn't have a license. They leave and now the other guy is driving. Cops pull them over and he's found with a gun underneath the seat. He has a court date next week and will probably do some time. 

So many issues with this. He said that he went back and forth with the girl calling her all kinds of names. Then he makes this wonderful decision to go home and get his gun because she's saying she's going to get some guys on him. He calls me saying he doesn't want to feel like a burden and he's scared of what might happen. I've seen him lose his temper before. He's also shown many narcissistic tendencies. To top it all off he has a great career as a software engineer and may lose his job. Now with this on his record I fear he may not be able to get another one. This story seems ridiculous and part of me thinks this guy just doesn't want a relationship anymore so he's making up some kind of story, but part of me knows that he has anger issues and does dumb shit. I don't want to stick around as I've already dated men like this and it has never ended well, but I care about him greatly. We've discussed what our future would look like and it is serious.

I've been chatting up a girl for a bit and about a week ago asked her if she wanted to come over for drinks and board games. She replied with 'ouu that sounds fun, what day ya thinking?' and I suggested Saturday.

Fast forward a few days, i tested positive for covid and told her. My quarantine ends today and I brought it back up, and she said she'd let me know tomorrow (Saturday, the day we were planning on seeing each other) if she's still up to come over.

Is she just trying to let me down lightly? I don't want to get my hopes up and be let down hard. I know everyone is different, but what's your take on it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s40l1u/girl_said_shed_let_me_know_tomorrow/

I'm the only single one in my core group of friends so my opinion sometimes will vary from theres. I said that when that fabled day of 2/14 approaches, when I was in a relationship, I'd ask my SO if they'd like to do something special because I myself place no value on that day. They asked me why I don't and I responded with the fact that it's not a birthday, anniversary, or Christmas, kind of the trinity of important days in a relationship. I also ask because I'm big on communication in relationships and I don't want there to be unnecessary expectations. If you show you're SO that you love/care for them every other day of the year, make them feel wanted and things of that nature, why does this one day matter so much?

If you're SO gets upset/angry because you didn't do anything for Valentine's Day, then to me, that says something isn't just quite in said relationship. I know that there are those who for some reason place unnecessary value on Valentine's Day.

56,s41m4z,1642191666,My eharmony Experience So Far,"Let's start at the initial sign-up. Easy enough, I enjoyed the long personality deep-dive questions. Got my results, fairly fascinating information. Apparently, I am one of those who can find love with just about anyone. Which I believe is true. 

^(my eharmony result summary at the end for the curious at heart.)

About Me: **Body**: I am fat, but I am tall with hips and lots of boobs. I fly under the fat radar cause men go, I can work with that. Yeah she a little fat, but I can work with that. **Face**: average, nothing special, but I have nice eyes and plump lips. Again, probably more closely aligned with almost ugly, cause my smile is a hot mess, but the eyes and the lips pushes me over to the average line. **Personality**: Off the charts awesome!! But I am bias so take that with a grain of sand. 

**FYI**: I am using the desktop browser version not the mobile app. Just a tip, desktop version gives you the reason why you're compatible with possible relationship potential alerts with the charts while the app version only gives you the charts.

Matches arrive and I am a little overwhelmed. I have 200 pages of matches, and because I am on the free version, no way to sort by compatibility or view images. I know those results aren't typical, but my criteria is broad, only thing I am looking for is be within the same state, be single/divorced, age was 10 years plus/minus. Everything else, I don't really care, just be compatible. 

So I start the process, click on profiles, read them, and I am clicking on those even without photos, cause compatibility is the goal not looks. I am sending smiles &amp; icebreakers cause these guys are super cute (meaning cute from their personality cause I still can't see photos) and I am like, Yeah Baby, I am about to snag a man in no time. 

of course eharmony starts sending me updates in my email about how this match is so very interested. Go ahead and look at their profile, blah blah. So I go to the Visitors section to look at the profiles interested in me and they are all in orange. Eharmony has blocked me, is the first thing that comes to mind. It says, when I click on the profiles, you need to become a premium member. 

So I reach out to eharmony customer service. Why are the profiles in orange, why am I blocked, and of course the most important question, are these people actually interested in me?

3 days later, eharmony responds like at 3am in the morning. The response, Your profile was blocked by accident, so all those people you sent smiles to, didn't actually get them. (2) You only get to see 3 profiles on the free version, the rest are blocked from viewing until you become a premium member (3) We are sorry, here is 65% off premium membership so you can see those profiles that are interested. 

Okay, not too bad. 3 days is a long time for a response from customer service, but at least I get 65% off. So I head on over enter in my code, I select the 6 months, more than enough time to find love with so many candidates. So it doesn't take my card the first time, refreshed the page, takes it the second time. Welcome page and all that jazz, and I am off to see who is interested. 

I resend all those lovely smiles &amp; icebreakers, send a few new ones to the newly interested profiles. No response. 

So I reach out to eharmony again. So am I doing this correctly, are these people getting my icebreakers and smiles? 

3 days later, eharmony responds. Oh sorry again, looks like your profile was blocked accidentally. All those icebreakers and smiles you sent, no one got them because no one saw your profile. Plus, we had an issue with your payment, and you are actually not a premium member. But here is a free month as an apology. 

Hmmm, okay. thank you eharmony. But something isn't really right about this whole situation.

 I go back, resend, most not all of the icebreakers/smiles and wow responses. Some good, some not so good.

I am getting lots of compliments on my profile. I am like wow, this is great. BUT the compliment is for what I wrote not a compliment to me, the person. Did not realize that until I got blocked. 

I am getting lots of smiles, wow, so awesome. BUT the smiles are just people bored and tossing them out like mardi gras beads. Did not realize this until I got blocked. 

Lots of lets talk off the site messages, to which I politely respond, no thank you. Mostly because the person hasn't read my profile by the way they keep asking me questions. Not really a conversation, more like an investigation. 

I feel like I have been in a meat grinder, and I still have 3 weeks left. I am just too tender and my heart is on my sleeve, which is not ideal for the cold decision making that takes place on the site. 

Yes. After the free month I am not upgrading to premium. eharmony keeps sending offers, 30%, 40% now it is up to 60% off, but this place isn't for me. I have done online dating before, had relationships, none that worked out in the long-run because we were two different people that only had sex in common. I really wanted something more this time. 

**Final thoughts**: eharmony is great, like any other dating site, but go in with the right expectations. Do the free membership, don't rush into a paid subscription. I can't say this enough, set the proper expectations because once you pay, you're not getting your money back. 

eharmony has success stories and I am rooting for everyone on the site to find their forever love. I mean who doesn't want that love story ending. Just please be careful and mindful of the good and the bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Random Tidbits Below** 

**Compatibility scores**. I have about 4 pages (premium membership you can sort by compatibility)  of what eharmony considers a true-match super super high compatibility, where scores are 116 or higher and none of those people are matches with me. I started looking at those with 100 scores and I felt they were at least more inline with me, even though so far no returned interest.

**Navigation**: No true way to discern which profile you have clicked on before so it all blurs together. I am pretty sure I clicked on a profile multiple times without meaning to. eharmony translates that into someone that is super interested, which isn't always true. 

**Marketing Game is Real**: eharmony is good at making you think you have all these interested people, but it isn't always true. So be careful in your excitement thinking just because someone clicked on your profile they are interested in something more. Not saying they don't, just be careful. ***Especially if it involves you upgrading to a premium subscription***.

**How I See the World: eharmony Style** \-- What makes you so nice from the get go is your relative balance of  intellect, feelings and instinct. But when it gets down to it, it‚Äôs  ultimately your intelligence that steers the boat. You possess emotional  warmth, however you don‚Äôt run the risk of making mistakes for  sentimental reasons. This makes you automatically adopt the roles of  planner, driver and leader in a relationship. Thanks to your strong  ability to make decisions, whoever gets to know you will find it easy to  trust you. This quality promises your partner protection and security. 

**What's My Love Groove: eharmony Style** \-- In love, you‚Äôre inspiring, entertaining and active. You‚Äôre also  reliable, which further cements these pillars of a good relationship.  You put a lot of effort into what you do, and are always friendly in  observing formalities. This combination of vitality and rationality  makes it possible for you to have a harmonious relationship with very  different types of men. People with a lower energy level give you  strength, while overly active types can help to slow you down.

My question is - if someone is interested, wouldn't they find at least an hour after work to meet? Are people really that busy that they can't find any free time within two weeks?

And so, I was talking to this really nice guy I matched with on Tinder. We moved the conversation to WhatsApp and scheduled a coffee date. But then after we scheduled the date he sent me a message saying ""Just a warning"" and that made me pause and wonder what he would say next and he said ""I'm not tall like the guys here."" I was shocked he even had to bring that up, granted I'm short(161cm) so most men are taller than me so it's never really been a thought for me. And I asked him how tall he was and he told me he was 170cm. 

Now, when we met in person, we were practically the same height, granted I wore boots that maybe gave me an extra 2-3cm but I had a feeling we were the same height so he's probably 165 or so.

Even if women were the majority demographic the apps still wouldn‚Äôt work for most men as it‚Äôs been proven that women would rather wait in line to be a seen by the hottest men than talk to a man they view as below them on a physical level.

We were good friends since the start but we become a lot closer this past semester. We spend a lot of time together studying, going to campus events, watching movies, getting food. I feel so nice and safe just to be around her. she understands me so well, and she has seen me grow and mature as a person. Things just flow when I with her. We have common interests and likings. 

I have started to develop really strong feelings for her. I am falling too hard for her.

I have no idea if she likes me romantically or not. I have been getting some mixed signals from her but nothing conclusive in either direction.

This is bothering me too much. I know that if I ask her out and she says no our friendship will not be the same. I don't want to lose her as a friend. 

What is the way to approach this??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s44iyj/catching_feelings_for_your_best_friend/

Please post books that have helped you with dating, relationships, bad breakups, etc. so we have a list of resources for each other!  

Please note the issue that made you look for help (breakup, anxiety, social awkwardness, etc.), the book and author, and how the book helped you. 

I'll go first!

ANXIETY/EMOTIONAL DISREGULATION: My therapist recommended **""Complex PTSD, From Surviving to Thriving"" by Pete Walker**.  I was experiencing regular mental breakdowns during the end of a relationship that left me actually shaking and sobbing in the corner.  This book helped me understand (a) why I was having such a profound physical and emotional response when my partner was being unkind, (b) why I couldn't stand up for myself, (c) my anxious attachment style, and (d) why I wanted to even date such a horrible person in the first place.  Then it showed me how to handle it, gave advice on calming myself down and changing my perception of the situation.  Within a few weeks I had left the relationship and gone no contact .

I consider myself attractive (granted, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I know) so I don‚Äôt have issues with attracting the opposite sex but I just don‚Äôt subscribe to the idea of having sex on the first date.

Nothing wrong with that, that‚Äôs none of my business, but damn, it kinda is my business because it makes it a hell of a lot harder to find someone who shares my values of not having sex on the first date, being monogamous, who I also find attractive/have good chemistry with, and who is within my dating range (28-40).

Am I going crazy? Is sex on the first date becoming the new norm now? Has it always been this normal and I was just out of the loop? Or does it just seem that way because I‚Äôm currently doing online dating? As in, if I start making the effort to meet people in person again (kinda difficult with the virus but still) should I expect to see more guys who are ok with waiting?
