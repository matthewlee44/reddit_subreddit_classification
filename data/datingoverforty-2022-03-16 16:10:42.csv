1,tfy6tn,1647479186,Dating again after being divorced for three years.,"Hi. I’m 42(m) and have been divorced just under 3 years. We were married for 15 years, and together for 18. I am just now to the point where I would like to start dating. 

I would like to try and find somebody outside of our mutual “circle”. 

Is OLD worth it? I am a faculty member at a community college, and due to COVID, meeting a lady would be difficult (we are still doing quite a bit of remote work).  What do ladies my age look for? Admittedly, I am not the best looking guy on the block, but I think I am a solid 6 or 7 on a good day. 

What about meeting in the wild? Is absence of a ring a good sign?

Let's circumvent age-entry mistakes and prove the ""young for your age"" people right/ wrong by creating a dating app which uses ""how old are you"" picture AI to state the approximate age of the person.

1) no real ages

2) no ages input by the user at all

3) ""I look young for my age"" can prove it

4) no way to accidentally put in the wrong DoB/ age

5) constant hilarity for people looking at the mega-filtered and pohtoshopped pic.s used to lower the determined age

3,tfz5as,1647482203,Nearly always wants to meet halfway- is this a sign of laziness to come?,"I’ve been seeing a guy roughly once a week for over 3 months now. He lives about 45 minutes away. Nearly every date we have been on he has suggested locations that are either halfway or in many cases closer to him. 
I’m wondering if this is perhaps a sign of laziness to come, I think it’s very odd he hasn’t offered to drive to me more often. Other people I’ve dated have willingly offered to drive to me on a regular basis without me asking. 

To be fair, I haven’t asked this guy to drive to me but I don’t feel like I should have to. I feel like a man that is truly interested in me and wants to progress the relationship ( he has said he wants to be exclusive) should be willing to put in a little more effort and drive to me. 

On one occasion he has driven to my house and I cooked dinner ( I’ll add that I am an excellent cook, people I’ve dated in the past were thrilled to come over for dinner) . 

I completely agree and understand that the first couple dates it’s fair to meet halfway, but at this point, I’m a little annoyed with this on going trend.

18,tghagz,1647542953,A positive 1st time OLD story,"So I am a 44 year old male divorced 3 years with 50/50 shared custody of my almost 5 year old son.

Since separating from my ex wife I have had 1 casual partner I met through a work colleague. That didn't work out because I wasn't ready for a relationship, let alone a casual one.

I spent the last 2 years working on myself and was feeling like I was ready to meet someone and share my life again. I was nervous as hell! How would I meet someone? Where would I meet someone? All my previous relationships came through friends of friends or parties/hookups turning into more. Including my marriage/relationship of 15 years. 

A reddit user from my country posted on a sub asking for OLD advice. I had never done OLD. In fact I had never even really dated.  I followed that post eagerly and jumped onto some of the sites/apps mentioned. Bumble and Findsomeone.

Almost instantly I had women who seemed interested. Holy shit that was an ego boost. Even if nothing else I felt like my working on myself and getting myself together was worth it.

I was chatting with a few women. I asked 1 out for coffee. We met and talked for 2 1/2 hours. It was refreshing and enjoyable and just felt good. We would've talked longer but I needed to collect my son. That evening we arranged another date.

We were going to go for a walk but then she suggested dinner. Aces!

She turned up at the wrong restaurant hahaha. But that was all good it gave me a chance to walk out and meet her and walk her to the right restaurant. She put her arm through mine and the goosebumps hit me.

We sat and had dinner and a wine. The conversation only stopping while we ate. It was relaxed, comfortable and most of all natural. Dinner lasted until the staff were closing up and practically pushing us out the door.

I walked her to her car. She kissed me. Then she kissed me again. Then we made out (feel like a teenager saying that) for a good 10 minutes. It was amazing. She drove me back to my car. We kissed goodnight.

When I got home, as I was texting her to say thank you, she text me to say she had a lovely night, good food and great kissing!

We are seeing each other again this weekend.

So it happens guys and girls. I feel very lucky. And hey if it doesn't go any further or work out now I feel like I can try again.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tghagz/a_positive_1st_time_old_story/

22,tgiod3,1647546773,Passing Thought RE MILF/DILF: How Much Things Have Changed In 30 Years,"52M. 

In 1990, I was a 21 year old working in a night club, and was approached by a middle aged man. ""Hey,"" he said. ""My sister is sitting at a table near the dance floor and can't stop talking about you. Would you mind going over and introducing yourself?"" So a little later when I had a free moment I ended up making my way over in that direction and stopped by the table to introduce myself to the woman. She was a well-dressed 36 year old with a noticeably athletic body (she played a lot of tennis), and she turned out to be quite nice and flirtatious. Nothing happened that night (I'm not really a casual sex person, not then, not now, since an emotional connection is important to me), but she came back to the club a few more times over the next month or two and we talked, then cornered me late one Saturday night and gave me a very wonderful and veeerrryyy sensual kiss. After we pulled apart from each other, she said, ""I have a confession to make. I'm married. But I saw you and couldn't take my eyes off you and have such a crush on you..."" Whatever she said next was irrelevant, because I was not about to get involved with a married woman and politely told her as much. She never came into the club again, of course.

I was not in the habit of kissing and telling, but I did share the story with my college roommate a few nights later, who after a few beers shared the story with our basketball buddies, who all teased me. ""Dude, she's like my mother's age?"" one of them snorted. ""What were you thinking?"" But I didn't care. (My friends' opinions were irrelevant to me when it came to matters of the heart, plus it was. pretty wonderful kiss up until I learned that she was married). 

Anyway, based on continued posts here, and feedback from women friends, the MILF thing is very real. There are no shortage of younger men seeking middle aged women. And I myself have been approached by 20 and 30 something women (not a lot, but here and there). 

What I'd like to say is this: I think it's a tribute to a generation of moms and dads who raised 20 somethings. For my friends and I in 1990, when we were 20-somethings, we were mostly latchkey kids. We'd been turned loose to fend for ourselves days and sometimes weeks at a time, and I can't say that we were ever positively encouraged by the adults in our lives (teachers, etc.). So when we were 21 and a 36 year old approached me, I think it summoned some hard repressed feelings that we had about the way we were raised. 

I feel like parents are much better in recent decades. We're better educated about parenting, are more involved, try to overcompensate for the negligence that some of us felt (two of my best friends growing up, I was at their house all the time but only ever saw their parents once or twice). But today's 20 somethings I think for the most part (with exceptions of course) felt loved and encouraged, and thus do feel some attraction and affinity for older people. Thus the whole MILF/DILF thing in recent times. This may all sound creepy, but in a weird wAy it's sweet, too. 

Here's to raising generations of fulfilled kids. Even if it means we occassionally have to fend off younger suitors :) (I learned when I was dating at 51 that 40 to 60 was my cut off and 45 to 55 my preferred ages).

This is a random passing thought. I may end up deleting it soon since I was mostly typing it as a journal like entry. Thank you for listening.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tgiod3/passing_thought_re_milfdilf_how_much_things_have/

I'm in my early 40's (male) and I have noticed that many women around my age range (that I've dated or gotten to know) fall into two categories: 

1. Not ready to date. But they think they are...at first...and then realize they are not. 
2. Ready to date, but seeking perfection. Anyone who falls short of perfection, will not work for them because they feel like they are ""settling"". 

 That's my observation, now to my question...

I immediately noticed a pattern of men who previously liked or commented on my profile. 90% of them were repeat offenders from my old profile prior to deleting, including the ones who never responded to my initial replies to them. 

I think the most hilarious was 2 different men who I actually went on a first date with and didn't really have a connection with (mutual fade on those). And this occurred within the past 6 months. Like - how do you not remember that you actually went on a date with this person you're reaching out to within the past 6 months? 

But, the lesson I've learned here is that this is a great way to weed out those people who just like every profile and then weed through the responses they get back - so you don't waste your energy bothering with them. 

Some OLD apps don't like when you delete and eventually sign back up for a profile, as they consider it gaming the system. So if you have this as a pattern that you do often, it may result in a ban.

Of course, it also can be a hack to show people that most people on OLD apps are validation seekers only and have no business on the dating apps to begin with. So, do what you will with the info.

Sept 2020 --&gt; Oct 2021, off and on Fwb...

Oct 2021 --&gt; March 2022, I date people, don't find the one. Always think about the ex gf.

March 2022, I miss her, make contact, feel I've opened her wound for me. If so, regret the contact. 



Questions...

When we had sex, as fwb.. why do I pull away for 1-2 weeks afterwards? This means going silent, avoiding conversations.

Why do I miss her?

Why do I find everyone else ""meh""?

Can me and her just be friends?

What's the solution?

46,thjhpt,1647650321,Misrepresentation of sexual desires (kinks?)… grounds for break up?,"I (52F) met his man (50M) on one of the apps about 5 months ago and we have been exclusively dating since then. It’s been awesome actually -lots of fun, shared adventures, mutual love of music and dancing, lots of shared intimacies and secrets, discussed details of past relationships, tentative sharing of plans for the future (more him then me, he’s in a crappy situation living with his mother after his divorce and really wants out). I’m quite established and financially secure, he is not. I get the sense (if it wasn’t so early), he would be making moves to at least move to the city I live in. 

Also for context, our relationship is LDR, I swiped on him on a road trip near his home, we’re about 8 hours away from each other by car. But we do. Find lots of opportunities to spend time together (mostly I pay for these trips, or he comes to stay with me).  We say ‘I love you’ to each other, starting about month 3. 

I’ve said I’m ‘established and financially secure’: I have a pretty high powered professional occupation. I’m also confident and somewhat assertive, and quite tall and athletic (I was a college athlete). Despite these, I’m pretty typically feminine and in my past  relationships was generally kind of “the princess”. I’m used to being submissive in bed (I don’t mean “submissive” in the kink way, I’m just used to the man being in charge! I want to be ravaged, you know?). Since I’ve been single and on the apps (2 yrs) I’ve run across several sexually submissive men, also a close male friend of mine is a “sub” so I’m familiar with the dynamic and I don’t like it, I can’t get into it. But I think these  guys in particular tend to be attracted to me. 

Because of this, Within the first few weeks of dating I asked him”do you want me to dominate you?” (I can’t remember specifically how it came up, something must’ve happened or was said that gave me a hint ). His response was emphatic “no, I don’t like that, I’m  not into it”. 

Turns out that’s not true though…it started with small things (“experimenting” with some anal play for him) which I went along with because I was becoming increasingly invested in him! Then it was watching some pegging videos, playing around with me mounting him from the top, with his legs up (like reverse missionary I guess?). 

The last time he was here (for a two week visit), he went out and bought a strap on for me to f**k him with. These things don’t just feel like fun experimentation between two people… They have a clear dominant/submissive dynamic. I’m pretty put off by it actually. 

On our last night together before he left, I thought we might have some romantic goodbye sex, instead he wanted me to sit on his face and then f**k him missionary. 

I will say that he is very attentive to making sure I have an orgasm, he’s sexy and fun! But I just  don’t like the vibe. And I’m pretty dismayed that he misrepresented himself to me in the beginning, before I got really invested in him. I’m super sad actually. ☹️

It's been less than 2wks and the same former fwb posted on social media videos of them at a concert together tonight. I know that he must have reached out to her after our breakup, and that there must have been negative things said about me in order to get her to agree to meet up after all this time. I feel very hurt because he knows this was a point of contention in our relationship that caused me a lot of pain. He and I had both hoped to be friends once the dust settled after the breakup.

70,tie3j5,1647754135,Hoping for some advice —-sorry for the long post,"I was in an amazing relationship for 8 months that recently got blown up. I met her at church and talked for about 4 months before we started dating. Before dating her, I was single for more than a year going on one crappy date after another. For the first time I fell for someone because of their sense of humor and intelligence and then came around to physical. Her body type wasn’t what I was attracted to prior, but that became a nonissue because of inner beauty. 

She has bad anxiety and she had some things happen that triggered her. It wasn’t me by the way. I was as supportive as I could be for her in every way I knew how. I was there to listen and hold her to try to get through it.  She started Wellbutrin on a Monday and had a first therapy appointment scheduled in a week at my suggestion. 

Last Thursday she said we should go ahead and get married instead of waiting anymore. It’s something we’ve discussed before, but I was holding off proposing until she got better emotionally. She spent Friday with her parents, which was the first night we didn’t spend together in more than 4 months. Saturday out of the blue she said she loved me, but didn’t want to be with me anymore. She said she wanted to stay friends, but that was it. I was in complete shock and told her I didn’t understand. I asked her to think about it and not be so hasty. Maybe wait to talk with the therapist in a couple days too before making such a huge move. She didn’t want to do that and just said we were done. By the way, this was 3 days before my birthday. 

There was no indication of this that I, her family or friends saw coming. They all begged her to reconsider being how well I always treated her. We’ve never had any argument or raised our voices at each other, ever. 

I waited 2 days to reach out and asked how she was doing and her reply was we shouldn’t communicate again. I was already lost and destroyed emotionally from her prior bombshell, but this hurt even more. 

At this point I’ve lost my best friend and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Has anyone gone through something like this and got back together?  

As stupid as it sounds, she really is the love of my life and I’d do anything for her. I can’t get over the abruptness and know she’s not the person that came and threw me away.  Before this, I’ve never even heard of her being so mean to anyone. Even her ex that treated her like dirt she’d still be cordial to. I can’t help but think it’s the meds, anxiety or depression that made her do something so out of character. 

I’m asking for help in others experiences so I have a better understanding of whether to hold out hope or not. It’s been a week today without her and I feel a hole in my chest and completely lost.

78,tinc6y,1647789599,Divorced (54M) and returning the dating pool via apps. I need an interpreter on what's happening with my first match,"It started out so well!

On our first date she (39F divorced) confessed to me that she decided to pay for the online membership after seeing my profile so she could message me. What was supposed to be an hour long lunch turned in 7 1/2 hour full day day of walking around city paths, parks, murals, getting drinks and more food and just enjoying each others company. We have a lot in common in terms of places we lived and geeky SciFi culture. She has ADHD is on meds for it. She has some beliefs that are a little out there but as long as it's positive I don't care.  Very attractive, we kissed about 8 or 10 times that day. In cozy corners, in the middle of walking paths, it did not matter, the 2-way chemical feedback was real.  I never had a date that went that well since before I was married. Afterwards, the communication was mainly texting and it was pretty heavy.  We can only see each other every 2 weeks because she was 2 young children that she keeps every other weekend per the custody agreement her ex-husband. Flash forward 6 weeks  and the communication has definitely been a lot less in the last 2 weeks. She has been asking to take it slow because she tired of guys just wanting just sex so nothing has been ""consummated"" yet. Just a lot of kissing, heavy petting and dry humping. She told me that she was looking for someone that would be her best friend after I finally asked what is she looking for from me and in general. 

I really like her and am willing to wait for a bit but the part that is killing me is the drop off in communication after that conversation. Part of me thinks I may be being friend-zoned while another more idealistic side of me says to wait and see what happens. She always apologizes profusely for being MIA and then tells me the list of reasons why she's dealing with which seem legit.  We've had 3 incredible dates including one where we got a cheap hotel and watched episodes of our favorite show on the TV, ate and made out a lot  with heavy petting. Lack of sex is frustrating but can be dealt with if I feel this is going somewhere. She has not yet committed on the day of the 4th date. If it ends, it will definitely hurt a bit. But my logical brain knows that is probably another person for me out there as well. I recognize that the way I got attached so soon might be symptom of my own issues and will be starting therapy to explore that.  

My questions are: 

1. Is it normal for people to impulsively come after you then rapidly fade out?
2. Am I being impatient? It's only been 6 weeks 
3. Is it needy to ask for clarification on where this is going if anywhere?
4. Is it a mistake early on to keep texting and is it better to just talk on the phone?

I’m not sad anymore and I still have to find my life’s purpose.

The hardest part is that I miss my best friend.  He just got me.  He would entertain conversations about how I “needed” another sewing machine or how I wanted an alpaca to spin my own wool yarn.  “Of course you do dear” he would say.  We loved embarrassing both our teenagers and we were making plans when they’d go off to college.

At 48 I don’t want to go through that kind of heartache again.  We didn’t break up because of a fight, he just died.  And if this is what’s happening to people in my age group I’d like to unsubscribe please.

I sort of kind of maybe might want to date possibly.  Something casual perhaps and not talking about our feelings all the freaking time.  Someone who can carry on a conversation, has good table manners, and likes to watch Big Mouth.  I don’t feel lonely in a physical sense but it would be nice to sit next to someone and just be me.

He made no effort to even kiss me on the first three dates and i finally went for it on the fourth. He is calm and not reactive. It’s hard to get a read on him. He’s very nice and he consistently stays over two times a week. I keep checking in with him to see how he feels and he says he feels like it’s good or that he thinks things are going well.

He doesn’t shower me with praise or say wonderfully sweet things. I’m not dying to see him in between visits. We text everyday but it’s not nonstop like it has been with other men. He’s just nice and calm and wants to hold my hand and watch tv.

93,tj91ny,1647860020,Should I stay or should I go?,"Context: male, early 40s, not a lot of experience in relationships. 

I recently got out of a 6 month relationship a few months ago; won’t get into that one unless I need to. 

One of the reasons I did was because I couldn’t let go of a consistent “friend/maybe someone more” who’s been in my life for a while. We’ve known each other for years and it’s mostly been platonic. She’s tried once or twice to make it more and I wasn’t really feeling it so would shoot it down. She’s always wanted me more than I wanted her. 

I ended up rebounding with her and hoping it would go somewhere. But it hasn’t been so great. 

She’s a very good person: kind hearted, successful, and persistent. And she truly cares about me. I’m kinda turned off by her being somewhat boring and I’m really not crazy about her looks. 

It’s not that she’s absolutely ugly, but she really doesn’t do anything for me. I thought I could get past it, but I dunno if I can. I look at my most of my friends who are married and i find their wives to be attractive and appealing to me. And I look at what I currently have and I’ll say I’m
just not very excited. 

But then again, I find myself to be unreliable in this regard: when I was in my previous relationship I was thinking about this one, and now that I’m in this one I’m thinking about my previous relationship.

And maybe a few years ago I still felt good about myself, but these days I feel old, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight in the last year, and honestly I just feel… off. I feel sad. I dunno if I’m going to find anyone else who I can trust and who’ll be there for me.

I just wish it was with someone whose face I could look at in the morning and smile about. Maybe not all of us are worthy enough to have that.

And I feel the walls are closing in because she wants more: don’t get me wrong she senses my hesitation and it hurts her immensely that she doesn’t feel that she’s enough for me. I’m trying to get over my insecurities and issues with myself: I’m incredibly hard on myself in general, so you can imagine how much of that spills over to someone else, even though I try to not let it. 

I’ve been agonizing over this for a while now and I don’t know what to do. If I let her go then maybe there’s a chance I find someone else: I just have a lot of work to do with my mindset, feelings, appearance, etc. i’m just deathly afraid that at my advanced age and with all of my other issues that that’ll be next to impossible. 

if I stay with her then I know I need to treat her the way I would if I was with someone who I thought was amazing, and I don’t know if I can. My head’s in it but my heart isn’t. 

Maybe I just need to let go of foolish juvenile dreams or whatever. Maybe I just need to learn to accept that this is what it is and move on with my life.

All I can tell you is that every day I just get more angry and sad at what my life has become. Please help.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tj91ny/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/
