Fast forward, my ex and I broke up.

Now I got into another LDR with this new guy (M20) and I am really starting to fall for him more and more. I do remember thinking that I wouldnt want to do another LDR as it was so tiring and sad with the distance, but then I changed up as I started to fall for this guy more and more. We connect super well and we have been talking every single day ever since we met each other online. So, we were discussing the travel times and all the practicals for when I visit (we live in the same continent, just a few countries apart). And I got a huge sudden wave of sadness as I remember how tiring it was when I had to travel to my ex and the whole part of saying good bye. I explained this to my boyfriend and he said that we can overcome it together and work on it together because as long as 2 people want to work things out, it will always work (which I do agree with). So the problem was that I was getting super worked up over the negatives with saying good bye, and the traveling and the money with that. Saying good bye always feels super sad and shitty (although I do remember at some point with my ex, we sorta got 'used' to it aka not as much crying etc). Bf tells me that he would also travel to me too, and we take turns (it was never like this with my ex and I, as I pretty much always had to travel to him).

It often leaves me feeling quite sad for us both: a traumatized partner and me, living the shadow of another woman. 

Ex 1: Was cheated on by his fiancé prior to me. Met me and fell in love with me because he could tell I was completely devoted to him and wouldn’t cheat on him. We ended up splitting because I got prettier with age and access to resources and he said he could “no longer trust me”. Found messages from college girls on that app Yik Yak when it was popular flash on his screen notifications. 

Ex 2: Was in a serious long term relationship with his girlfriend but her addiction to drinking and steroids (they are both gym rats) destroyed their relationship. I don’t drink and he loved how stable and even keel I was. Broke up with me after our first fight because I “didn’t fight hard enough” when I mentioned that I was upset with him constantly bringing her up when I was dealing with post partum. He said he could always feel the passion when him and his ex would fight and I lacked it. 

Moral of the story is, don’t use someone new to get over someone in the past. I don’t hold it against them but I don’t date anymore because of it.

I asked out a long time grocery delivery customer who I’ve admired for several years once I found out she had become separated and at first our interactions were wonderful including all four of our first dates which have lasted 20 hours in total and also many hours on phone calls.
We went on our most recent date this last Sunday and spent all day talking in Birmingham and the train there and back having fun and we both have said how turned on we are etc and seemingly it looked like we would be escalating from being very affectionate to sex probably this coming Monday for our next date.
However she’s a single Mum with two small boys 5 and nearly 3 who has been separated for 2 years and her divorce should be finalised any day now.
For the past 4 or 5 days she’s gone from saying lovely things(her children have been off for summer holidays), reciprocating things I would say like ‘looking forward to seeing you’ or ‘I enjoyed our chat last night’ to completely ignoring those comments and just saying nice things about me having a good day, or her talking about herself or her kids.
Never addresses or refers to her and me.
I did tell her I liked her very much on our most recent date and so far we’ve had great chemistry on the dates and get on like a house on fire so just wondering what do I do prior to our next date if anything at all.
I wish I wasn’t bothered by the texting but she has become almost rude in my opinion and just focuses on other things going on in my life and doesn’t respond to anything about us.

While most of that is being unchanged, one thing is and that’s dealing with other people’s shitty relationships. I met this girl on Omegle not too long ago, she’s my age. I thought she was cute and we have common interests.

She recently got out of this relationship and she’s been talking about how bad this guy was and how he told everyone personal shit about her. Today she said she still has feelings for him and he thinks he’s “changed.” I told her not to feel bad about it, it’s normal but she shouldn’t go in with it, or honestly even talk to him again after what he did. She said she didn’t know if she could cut him off again because “he’s changed.” I told her as a guy who knows other guys, they’ll go back to the same person just because that’s the easy thing to do, especially when they know the other person has feelings. She keeps making excuses for it and it annoyed me to the point I said:

“Okay, this is gonna come off as mean but if you’re gonna take him back do it.

But if you’re really gonna take him back after he told people your personal information, even though as a guy I’m telling you guys often go back to people they already dated because that’s the easy way, you do you.” She said “thank you” and I just left her on read.

I just feel like. I can't really word it. To use an analogy:

I feel like I live in a bad coal mining town in the 1800s that's dirt poor, and I accept being treated badly by my potential employer since I have absolutely no leverage. This same employer has every single man applying for the same job.

Despite her 10 month relationship falling apart in early May, she told me she liked me and that i felt the same way. I was ecstatic. After a couple of weeks of just talking on the phone, we started hanging out and it could not have gone any better. This girl was already a really close friend of mine, so we knew each other pretty well and we even had our own inside jokes. It was fun, i enjoyed every second being around her. 

After a couple of weeks, we started laying in bed together, talking about life and what we wanted. We would kiss on some occasions, it truly felt like a relationship was going to come out of this. There was never anything that made me feel we were going to fast.

One day, just before she was supposed to meet me for lunch, her ex boyfriend shows up to her work and he tried bringing her some food. She rejects, and tells him to leave. He does so but leaves a note for her as he leaves. Long story short, the note was him begging for her to give this guy another chance. I personally thought it was funny, she did too. But it took her back, and it made her realize, “oh wait, i dated this guy a couple of months ago. I think it would be best to slow it down and be friends from here on out. I just realized where my head is at. I’m sorry but i am not over him”

Now, this looks like she may run on back to this old boyfriend, but i am so very sure they aren’t seeing each other ever again. I am willing to bet anything on it. 

I give her all the space she has asked for. But now she seems so disinterested with me. Like i gross her out now. But there are times where she seems so into me. It’s the weirdest thing and also the most frustrating thing to be on the receiving end of. Also, what i have noticed is that she never answers my phone calls anymore. Like ever. But she’ll hang out with me and our friends and answer a phone call right away from a guy who she recently met. Makes no sense at all, it puts me in a huge upsetting mood. I feel she’s more interested in this guy now. I seriously don’t know what i did wrong. I feel worthless.

Some background- I’m (27f) divorced, no kids. I have been struggling in the dating game for the past 4 years. No good matches, being ghosted, not ready to commit… list goes on. 
I met a guy a year ago, he was great but it seemed like he was going through a bunch of stress with work and home and he wasn’t ready to really dive into anything. We went our separate ways amicably. 
I got a text from him a week ago, asking me out again! Normally I would say no, as it never good to go backwards and very rarely does anything good come from something that didn’t originally work. My gut however- told me to go for it. Why the hell not. He checks all my boxes- good job, home to himself, got a cute dog, good family, no baby mama, etc. 
Tonight we had our date- and Oh. My. God.  It was amazing. We laughed and teased each other the entire time; there was never a lull in conversation. We think very similarly and quietly made fun of the obnoxious table next to us. Like we already had our own inside jokes. He was polite and kind, and HANDSOME. More so than I remember him being a year ago. Maybe it was just the fact he was in a better place now, with less stress and I could really SEE him. 
He kissed me when he walked me to my car- and god what a kiss! Not to be a sap but it was straight out of a movie. Absolute perfection. 
He was a complete gentleman from beginning to end, and even text me goodnight after I got home.
Holy shit. So this is what a great date feels like.

I’m a pretty social guy, I go to a lot of parties, active on dating apps and have been with a fair number of women. 

However, one thing remains pretty constant. I seem to only attract women who are a couple years younger than me, around 18-20. For example, on Tinder I will rarely, if ever match with a girl who’s over 20, despite having my age preferences set as 18-24. At parties, the only girls who are interested in me are girls who are a few years younger as well.

If it matters, I do look young. Most people guess that I’m around 18, and I would fall into the category of a “pretty boy” and have a clean shaven face. 

It’s not necessarily that I have a problem dating girls who are a couple years younger, but it would be nice to date women closer to my own age since we have more common ground.

Any advice on how I could make myself appear as a more attractive partner to older women? Please no responses like “grow out your beard.” Ive heard this one countless times and I really dislike the way I look with facial hair.

So I have been single for over Two years now.
And before this dated a guy who,
I’m not a doctor but I feel 100% he was a Grand Narcissist.
By the way  I was married for 23 years and lost my husband. 
I just want to make sure that you know that I’ve had a great relationship. 
So I’ve tried the dating sites ,friends trying to meet a single good guy.
With not much luck. I think I had a few misses.
Wrong timing. Should have would have could have . I just gave up.
So I just wanted to stop dating but I would like to have a man in my life.
So I’m from the the old school, but I’m also the type of woman to say what I mean and men what I say.
So with dating sites, Reddit, utube you see everything. And I know I’ve seen and heard about Friends W/Benefits.
Looked it up to see what it meant. 
Two adults having sex with no  commitment what so ever. Live our separate lives. And meet up when we want.
So I thought about it. And decided  I would do it. Men do it why not me.So I thought of who I  would give this  gift too.
Thats what itt is. What  guy wouldn’t want a good looking woman in great shape to call and ask for a FWB relationship.. 
I met him when I started dating he took me out a couple times.  But no romance at all. And I knew he like me and he was really a nice guy just not my guy. And we remained friends.
So I got the courage and asked him
His answer was he’ll ya! When!
And that’s how it began. And we still are seeing each other . 
We have had a few glitches but other than that its been good. 
Except for the last couple times he doesn’t finished. I mentioned it. 
He says age. I say it bothers  me a little. Because I’m not sure what it means. We are not in a relationship but it’ make me question why.
Maybe it shouldn’t matter I should get mine and keep it moving. 
That’s the problem it bothers me it o fun if your partner doesn’t finish for me anyway. It could be a deal breaker. So guys tell me what does it mean.

Wanted to make this post, because I see a lot of people complaining about Tinder(and other apps) so I wanted to share my experience and a few tips potentialy.

I was 21 when i first installed it, so now Im 24 years old, I dont have it installed all the time, i install it every few months, have it for a day, two max then delete it,

As far as my profile goes:  
Pictures: A selfie, me with my cat, about 2 of those, full body, a selfie of my back in the mirror, and a video of my drawings

My bio: I usualy dont write anything here apart from a few emojis, and most recently i wrote something funny that i discovered but thats it.

I get about 30 matches for that day that i have it installed, 95 percent wont say hey first, so i have to say something, i usualy send a gif or ask an interesting question so we can continue the conversation easily, small number of girls wont respond at all, some replies will be really bland and at last very low percentage will continue having the conversation with you, i realised most girls are there for attention.

The girls that say something FIRST, are usualy the ones that I dont go out with lol, they will say nice smile or im cute or that me and my cat are cute and i would have to carry the conversation from there and they are just not engaging, they are mostly boring, as far as my opinion goes.

I try to set up a date very soon, because im really not interested in talking days on tinder, and its a good way to eliminate those that dont even want to do it in the first place. I usualy take girls to get some ice cream, i do it mostly because i like it, and i know that most girls like it as well, so its a win win, we take a walk, sit in the park, you dont have to spend as much money, u can both end it soon if you dont like it, the only thing is that all my dates were at least 4-5 hours long, ALL of them, which IS weird.

Sometimes I arrange a date so fast that after 20 mins i realize i dont even wanna go, so i had to cancel a lot of times, which i am sorry for, sometimes girls invited me to their places to hook up, and when i was younger i thought thats cool but then i realized that its like making love with air, when you dont feel anything, its pretty ordinary, at least thats my opinion, if u like doing that go for it!

I didnt get a single relationship out of tinder, mostly wouldnt even go past the first date because i just didnt like the girls, maybe they didnt like me either who knows.

My advice for you guys, and this is more of a life advice then advice for girls, but take care of yourself, brush your teeth, shave that patchy beard off, that care of the unibrow, shower, deodorant, parfume, dress nicely, it doesnt have to be expensive, just make sure its clean, its ironed and it fits you well, have something to do, play sports, draw, play games, anything, get a job, excercise, u dont have to go to the gym, i dont, i do calisthenics, pull ups, dips, push ups - all sorts of those, trust me you are gonna look and feel great, take care of those nose hair, now i know most of these are some regular-ass advice but trust me, i see a lot of people/men not even doing these, so start now  


And my final word is, Tinder aint all that, most girls are there for other reasons like self promoting, didnt run into bots however, most girls there are boring even though some of them can be pretty, hot, cute whatever.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,915930,public,self,Above average looking guy ON and OFF Tinder experience of 3 years,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqnwb8/above_average_looking_guy_on_and_off_tinder/,all_ads,6,,,

Whenever a guy I’m (F20) seeing starts to either ignore me, take longer to reply or even start leaving me on read, I enter this state of constant stress and he basically lives rent free in my head. 

I hate that my mind is occupied by them. I think I start to romanticize them too early, which is bad, but I can’t stop it. 

My stress levels are up by constantly thinking of “will they reply” or “why is it taking so long”. I also hate the fact how excited I get from the notification of them sending me something.

We met online. We messaged for a year and a half before I could finally convince him to meet me. We did and we hit it off wonderfully. We both aren't fans of being on the phone, so we text.  This isn't a problem for us. The problem we are having is I'm the one who pushes for things to move forward and is always initiating. With us dating, I asked him out. I also pushed for us to meet one another. I am the one who pushes to see one another more often. I also pushed for us to be intimate with one another. 

We started having some issues with intimacy. We went camping one weekend and we used to not keep our hands off one another. Even on long car rides we would tease one another. Well, the last couple of camping trips weren't like our previous ones. I even cried during one of our trips because I told him we weren't like we had been. He said he didn't see anything wrong. A few weeks went by and I asked him if maybe we should try sexting. He said he wasn't really into that, but would try if I wanted. I said I did want to try because I wanted there to be more intimacy. Well, nothing came of it because I didn't push for it to happen. I initiate sex and if I don't initiate, nothing happens, which sucks because sometimes I want to feel like I'm someone he desires. It feels like we are kissing friends.

He won't even talk about a future with me. I bring it up and he always says he had to think about it. I'm at a loss on what to do. I've thought about us taking a break and seeing if he can figure things out without me being in the picture. I could really use some advice from anyone who's been in this situation or similar.

Don’t get me wrong, I love her a ton and I miss her so much but if I’m being completely honest, there are days where I’ve thought that it was a bit much sometimes between me and her. She’s had trust issues with me in the past over insecurities of her own and she says that she’s very moody and needs a lot of love/attention to be happy (which I’m happy to provide for as best as I can). 

But the thing is that we’ve had a few fights before about being there for one another and our relationship in general. Just today she said that I’ve changed and that why didn’t I do stuff like text her, tell her stuff, etc. She knows that my job is very physically and mentally demanding and when my job requires my attention, I’m basically chained to doing my job and won’t be able to text or anything. Before she’s also asks how she feels like we’ve grown apart and how I’ve changed/am a different person. She’s also even asked if I wanted to break up with her multiple times and I always say no because I love her, which ends up with me and her eventually making up and carrying on together. 

If I’m being honest, I love her and care so much about her but I feel like we’ve ran circles in this race already. It’s been mentally draining having her say that I don’t actually love her or if I wanna end things (when she claims that she doesn’t actually mean it). I don’t want to break up with her because I still love and care about her but I’d be lying if I said that it’s been a perfect ride this whole time. And of course relationships aren’t perfect but I feel like sometimes this is draining my energy.

I was working with her and and I made a silly mistake whilst interacting with a customer, and when I looked down and caught her eye, she smiled one of those teeth showing grins, the kind where I could see both sets of teeth in her mouth. Another time she randomly sat on the ground and complained about being tired. I wasn't paying much attention but then she said she needed my help. She wasn't injured or anything but she wanted me to take her hand and help her off the ground. She sort of made it harder for me to get her off the ground, thus leading me to hold her hand a bit longer that what would have been necessary. Keep in mind this all occured in the same day of me meeting her. 

Whenever I would accidentally make eye contact with her, she would hold my gaze and look into my eyes. This happend about three times and she did this every time.  She also rubbed her hands against my back as she way walking past me. Now that I doubt holds any significance...

I am not sure if these are signs of a possible romantic interest on her part, and if it is the feeling is mutual. However what makes me doubt as to wether she has a crush on me or not was this one time I had to stop by after work to retrieve something I forgot. She was busy with something and when she heard my voice she turned and looked at me and went back to what she was doing. I should have said hello or something but I wasn't in the mood.

She came on to me, which in my experience was a first. We went on numerous dates, but never had the chance to be fully alone because of our living situations. She would constantly say how I treated her better than her ex, how I supported her emotionally and didn't try to manipulate her. We connected very quickly sharing deep insights about ourselves, she said she felt safe with me. As things go on she became more stand-offish and saying it's not going to work, she doesn't want ""commitment"" right now, she said she needed to work on herself and figure stuff out. I obliged her request and put things on hold, but still chatting with her, we would still hang out. She would constantly say how much she adored me and how much she cared about me. She went to a wrestling show and saw her ex there. They started talking and she messaged me this morning saying that she is going to work things out with him. That things will never work between me and her. I'm now just left here feeling worthless and alone, like she was just toying with me. She chose to go back to her ex which she said time and time again would tell at her, manipulate her, make her feel like shit.
