We have been talking on and off for a few weeks, but have really been in contact, getting to know each other this past week. We planned to go to dinner and then hang out at the beach on Saturday. However, I have not heard from her since Tuesday. I have sent a good morning text on Wednesday, and yesterday I sent a funny post I saw. All went unanswered. I don’t have her in social media but I have seen her tinder bio has changed and she has added a new picture. I hate to be THAT guy and text yet again to ask if we’re still on. But I am really wondering and I don’t want to be left hanging. What shall I do?

3,pu8xdj,1632445068,Is It Rude For a Guy to FaceTime His Girlfriend When He's Out Getting Drinks With Another Girl?," I have a huge crush on my roommate.

Unfortunately he has a GF and she was even over this weekend and I heard them having sex.

But today I got home from work, the GF was gone, and my guy roommate smiled at me asking me to go get drinks.

I almost said no because he has a GF, but I like him so I thought ""hey it's just drinks"" and went with him.

While we were having drinks, the guy FACETIMED his girlfriend and put me on camera, face to face with her and told her my name. She and I awkwardly waved to each other. It was really uncomfortable, and I felt like a slimeball being caught out with him.

Why did he put me on camera with her? He seemed very focused on showing me to his GF, even zooming in and putting the camera on me twice. I am sure she is not going to be happy and I feel guilty?

4,pu8xnl,1632445100,Any advice? Should I be concerned?,"So my fiancé and I have been together for almost 4 years. I love him very much. I’ve never really been into porn as I am saving myself until marriage. We do; however, engage in other sexual activities. 

Recently I was looking on his phone and saw a picture of a girl (porn star) with a dildo on, I asked him about it jokingly (I’m aware people watch porn. No biggie) and he kinda got nervous which I understand. He said he was interested in lesbian porn. He said he saw the porn star on Twitter and screenshot her picture and link so he could
Go back to it later. He said when he clicked on the link it was a 30 second clip of her with a guy instead of a girl and she was pegging him. He said he was curious as to how it worked. He watched the whole clip but then realized that wasn’t his thing and scrolled to something else. 

The problem I’m having with this is that this happened on a Sunday and he told me at first that he didn’t watch it but then he said he watched part of it and now he’s saying he watched the whole 30 second clip. I tried to keep the conversation light because I understand talking about porn can be awkward so I asked him jokingly if he was interested in that or if he wanted me to buy a dildo. He said “absolutely not. I was curious as to how it worked but that’s not my thing, I don’t want anything near my butt and I don’t want you in a dildo”. 

I’m not upset with the porn watching but more so with the lying, like he could’ve just been honest. Maybe I’m overthinking it?

We met on a dating app and texted back and forth daily for about a week prior to the date. We had great conversation over text and a bunch of similarities so I was really excited to meet him. On his dating profile he put that he is 5 foot 10 and listed a specific job title. 

When I showed up, he looked considerably shorter than listed. I am 5 foot 7 and I’d say he was slightly shorter than me. This slightly rubbed me the wrong way, but I understand it may just be an insecurity so I ignored it. I have dated several men shorter than me so it doesn’t really bother me, but it seemed like more than a slight exaggeration. Also, the topic of work came up and he admitted he actually has a completely different job. It’s still a decent job, but during our texting I had asked him if he enjoys the job he had listed, and he said yes he does. So why not just tell me then?

So my question is, do you think these are big enough deals where I should not give him another date? Honestly the chemistry was just ok but I think it could develop.

28,puaddf,1632450346,"For the first time in my life a girl I’m into is blatantly interested in me, and I am absolutely terrified","
Basically I’ve never had romance in my life. Every crush I’ve had has been one sided, I’ve never had someone pursue me and I’ve never had sex or been on a date. I’m 23 and I feel so utterly immature and inexperienced when it comes to this shit for my age, I might as well still be 16. The most I’ve done is make out with a couple of people, but it’s always involved enough alcohol that neither person remembers it and I clearly am not thinking clearly at all.

So a few days ago I matched with a girl on tinder and, essentially, she’s the exact type of girl I’ve said to friends would be my ideal girl. She’s stunningly good looking to the point it’s like she’s out of my league, she’s really smart, she’s fun to talk to, we have a lot of common interests, etc. I’ve had all this before on girls I’ve crushed on, but here’s the thing; she is interested in me. Like, clearly into me. I’ve never had someone I’m this attracted to be attracted to me too. When she messaged me first and kicked things off I was stunned. We’ve only been talking for a couple of days and we have already thrown around first date ideas, been messaging each other daily and for hours at a time, she asked me for my number, etc. I have never in my entire life had a girl be so openly interested in me, let alone someone like her.

And I am utterly, completely, fully terrified. I think for a long time after a lot of rejection and not getting anywhere I emotionally closed myself off and kind of accepted people weren’t attracted to me. If I didn’t pursue anyone, I couldn’t get hurt anymore. It was easy and I was even kind of content, no more putting myself out there and having to face my insecurity. All I had to worry about was myself.

And now I can’t do that. It never even crossed my mind someone I’m so interested in would be the one pursuing me like this. It’s like years and years of insecurity are just boiling to the surface. Every chance I get my brain tries to tell me ‘yeah this isn’t real, she’s not fucking interested and you’re an idiot for thinking so’, and usually I’d have listened to that voice, but it’s so blatantly obvious that’s not true that I can’t just ignore it. 

But I can’t stop thinking about every little thing that could go wrong. What if my lack of experience puts her off? What if I say the wrong thing or weird her out or she just stops being interested? How the fuck could I ever maintain a relationship? How do I even flirt with her properly, or say the right thing, or whatever else? Can you even begin to imagine how bad the sex would be for her? All this is just flying around my brain constantly. I honestly feel like I’m 13 or something trying to figure out how to navigate the most basic of things in life. And the thing is, things are just going so well between us and it feels amazing, but I’m so scared of it too, and beyond that, I’m aware that the very fear could fuck me up, but I don’t know how to get over it. I honestly don’t have a fucking clue what I’m doing here lmfao.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/puaddf/for_the_first_time_in_my_life_a_girl_im_into_is/

I try not to think about them, but then I do, all the time. I tell myself I don’t like them or that the thoughts are invasive and I should just ignore them, or I explore them and see where the rabbit hole leads, or I try to process and move on, but always I return back to the same place, even if I’ve barely interacted with the person. I am obsessed without it being an active, intentional obsession. I am so tired, and I don’t want to say depressed but I have no energy or care anymore for anything. I go out and just have zero interest, zero hope. I don’t want mental health advice please, not like recommendation for therapy or meds or even meditation or anything like that; I just want to vent and hear responses directly related to feelings of heartbreak or loneliness that aren’t characterized as illness. I keep thinking about her. And the lethargy is so deep, the yearning aches in my stomach. Why?? I don’t talk to her. I don’t want to like her. It’s so dumb. I read about “twin flame” experiences because she happened to trigger/catalyze a lot in me, but none of my experience was remotely reciprocated so even if the concept was real, it’s too one-sided in my case to be anything but a pointless pain in my soul. I don’t even have the emotional energy to reach out to girls who I might actually have a chance with. And all I can think about it her and the lost opportunities and the endless cascade of mistakes and miscommunications and my own idiocy. I’ve been such an idiot, and she doesn’t love me. Maybe this is the wrong place to post, but I haven’t even touched the girl for a hug let alone gone on a date with her. I could’ve, on both accounts, but I was an idiot and missed so many chances.

35,puanmw,1632451390,"I like this guy, does he like me back or want to mentor me?","*posted this somewhere else n got no help so let’s hope 2nd time’s the charm*

For context, I'm in a relationship with (let's call the man J) J's best friend's son (let's call him A). He abused me as well as cheated and other things and J knows that, I'm only with the son because he owes me a huge sum of money and refuses to give it to me if we are not together, as well as tries to kill me lol. J considers A and his father like family to him and cares for both of them a lot. He tells me to take care of A and that A is very lucky to have me. He also told me that since I am so good to A, he includes me as part of the family too. J also told me that he is jealous that me and A are so full of life and ""happy together"" because he doesn't know the whole story. A also told me that he is jealous that J and I connect more than him and I, and that we understand each other so well and it upsets him that he had no idea what we were talking about. A, J, and I stayed up for 3-4 days straight (edit: ofc we slept in between but it wasn’t for a long time, I meant we spent the entire day of all those days talking) having long conversations and getting to know each other, relating, etc. I've realized that J is a LOT like me and he is so kind to me. J said that he wants a relationship but needs to find someone just like him and it seems like he's given up hope on finding someone. But, he said that he sees himself in me. The three of us came back inside after running an errand one time and I said it's cold, he immediately got up to give me a blanket and got onto A for not being a gentleman and getting one for me. J told me a lot of things that could mean either he likes me or the complete opposite, such as saying that I'm smarter than anyone he's ever known and that A should take care of me. He's also said things like ""I never thought the most intriguing conversation I'd ever have would be with someone your age."" and compared me to his ex wives in the process, me being the better one. He always hounds A and tells him to keep me, be a gentleman, etc. and for me to not let him fuck up again. He also laughed and said ""I like that"" when I told A to get the fuck over here next to me &amp; then later J did it to A and made sure I knew by saying ""you see I did him like you did I like that"" and laughed again. Even A's father, J's best friend, tells A to listen to me, keep me, and that he's lucky to have me. I feel like J either sees himself in me and wants to mentor me because he wants to be the person he wish he had, or that he might have taken a liking to me. I feel like it's the first one, but I really like and care for J. Keep in mind I have about 9 months until I'm age of consent, so there will definitely be some waiting involved even if I do decide to let him know. Before I even tell him, I want a lot of opinions on how he could feel and if you guys recognize anything. Overall, he's really an amazing person and we could be amazing friends, but I feel he could be my ideal partner if we tried. I feel like if I try to be with him (not dating A of course) it could ruin it if he doesn't like me too. As well as the possibility that he does, and won't try because of his almost brotherhood with A and his dad. Does he like me? What should I do to further find out? What should I do if he does like me? What should I do if he doesn't? Please help!!!

40,puavk6,1632452228,"It Took Over Two Years, But I'm Finally Going On A Date Again","I don't handle breakups very well. After my last one ended over two years ago, I knew it would be a long process for me to be ready to date again...

The twist is that it DIDNT take long for me to be ready to date again. Shortly after my last breakup I started a new job and had a nice refresh in my life. I'm relatively happier these days and I met a girl just a few months after my breakup at work that I instantly had a crush on. We hung out after work sometimes and eventually I asked her on an official ""date,"" and she revealed to me that she was gay.

It was difficult for me to handle this more than my breakup because I had and still have a strong connection with her. So over the past year and a half I haven't really worried about my breakup, but I've been trying to fight this feeling of trying to win over this other girl. It was a hopeless battle from the start, and I knew that the whole time. I knew I'd never be able to date someone who is gay, and I never ever tried to take advantage of her or disrespect her. 

However deep down I had a mental block that was preventing me from dating again. I'd talk to girls and we'd set up a date, and I'd bail because I just could not get over this other girl. I think a part of me loves her in a weird way. 

Anyways cut to two weeks ago, this girl has a new girlfriend...and I'm very happy for her. And it's sad, but I literally needed this too because of how hung up I was on her. We had been drifting apart the last few months and just not really chatting like we used to. And then she told me about her new girlfriend and it's been a huge weight off my shoulders. 

So now tomorrow I'm going on a date with a very cute girl I've been talking to online. I'm actually excited and not doubting myself at all. 

It's a bittersweet moment because I truly feel like I'm free to date again...but it also makes me question my mental health a bit. I don't know why this mental block had such an effect on me. I truly think I was convinced that I loved the girl from work, but I'm happy we are friends and am happy to be feeling this way again. 

It just worries me that she needed to start dating for me to feel like I can start dating. I knew we would never be able to date, and I still had the mental block.

45,pub6kl,1632453298,Left sad and confused after confusing mixed signals. Unsure what to do now,"Met a guy through mutual friends a few months ago and we started talking a lot recently( maybe just the past 2-3 weeks). We initially hung out a few times in person and through discord in our friend group, but then we started sending tiktok dms and he eventually asked for my phone number, snapchat etc. I feel like we had some pretty good talks, we talked about personal problems, past relationships, and NSFW/kink stuff etc  and these convos would go pretty late into the night (admittedly it was really just one night). (He mentioned wanting a girlfriend too and he would send relationship related tiktoks and memes to me, and tolde he loved my shitty sense of humor) I felt reassured because he would initiate  cooking streams and  weekly discord DM watch nights that are just the two of us (he travelled for school so it's the only way we can ""meet""), and sometimes ask me if I was down just to watch things on a random night. 

I thought things were all good but tonight he talked about how he tried talking to cute girl in his class (turned out to be a lesbian) and how he is finally able to use hinge now that he's living away from his parents, and just stuff about other girls (sex stuff, how his TA was hitting on him in undergrad). Idk just made me kind of sad and feel like I'm wasting my time now by feeling sad when we do our weekly watches (even tho I enjoy them, I'd rather not be sad lol). Not like I can blame him I know he's down bad and he lives far. Maybe I got friend zoned or he's just stringing me along which is not cool since mutual friends and all. Made me feel a little jealous and insecure idk

Idk what to do ..should I just avoid him for now so I don't keep hurting myself? Also if he's seeing other girls I feel like a side ho if Im doing private watch parties with him on a weekly basis . Maybe I should tell him how I feel but in the context of ""hey I like you more than as just a friend, so if you start dating people I'll back off especially with our NSFW tiktoks""? But we have a movie night planned with our big friend group so it'll be awkward 

Maybe I was just blowing up all the positive signals and was ignoring the negative ones and giving myself false hope or something. Now I'm just sad lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pub6kl/left_sad_and_confused_after_confusing_mixed/

I’ve been completely fine with flings and things being casual, but I cant even get myself to enjoy that anymore. Sex hasn’t been enjoyable for me like it used to, so i’ve just stopped trying.

53,puc9e4,1632457377,"This man has and is causing absolute mental damage and pain, yet I cannot block him. I don't know what to do (venting)","For context, I will paste my last 2 posts. This will be long, I apologize, but this is my only way to vent.

""About 7 months ago, I (19F) met a guy on Tinder (28M). and we decided to keep things casual (similarly to fwb's?!) but he mentioned that it can become serious. We met twice, held hands, and kissed...I told him that I won't have sex with him (due to religious reasons).

I was worried about getting COVID since he had Tinder. We had an argument about it and he deleted it. We agreed to see each other about twice a month.

However, we didn't. He said that his sister gave birth which changed his perspective on going out (due to COVID). After that, he started being distant and rarely texts me. When I asked him, he said he's busy with the baby. 

During that time we had many arguments- mostly me expressing to him I don't like feeling like an object and forcing him to ""label"" us and him saying that ""if we decide to date it will be way into the future..you're too young..I don't want to take away from your life."" I do take responsibility and feel guilty for continually arguing with him although we had met only twice. Some of his comments during arguments:

* ""it was like easy with her"" (his other fwb)
* ""I'm not good at texting""
* “I’d marry you” “I’m crazy about you” “I’m attached to you that’s why I’m telling you about her instead of lying”

Anyways, one time we had a big fight that ended in him saying “We met twice. Live your life. I’m not it.”

We stopped talking for a month, and he started texting again, and we decided to meet up.

The night before, he asked ""Why do you want to see me? Do you think we'll get married one day or do you just want to try out things (sexual reference). I replied with ""there's no way in hell I'm marrying anyone, especially you, just no."" (my ego was hurt from him saying ""live your life"" a few months earlier so I obviously lied.)

After that, he cancelled a few times due to being busy. We finally met about a week ago. He was different. No hand holding, we just made out and didn't even talk. Unlike the other times we met, he never asked when to see me again, we just hugged at the end. He did mention that he hadn’t seen anyone in the past 7 months due to being busy. He said things like “you’re mysterious, weird, don’t let people know what you think.” (which is ironic after this many arguments). He suggested we go to a restaurant and I said “we both don’t want to be seen with each other in public”, which he replied to by saying “that’s rude...and proceeded by listing the places that he doesn’t want to be seen with me.”

A few days later, I felt bad for saying that so I suggested going to a hotel to watch a movie and talk..he said “I can’t justify that”…whatever that means (this was the same day I ended things bc I felt like I was the only one putting in effort).

I tried to pretend that I’m fine without a label and  asked him how often he thinks we should see each other, and he said ""I don't know, I'm not looking for hookups right now."" So I asked if he thinks we should stop seeing each other and he replied with ""No, just, what then after seeing each other?."" I asked what do you think and he replied with ""nothing good"" so I replied with ""we should stop then if you don't see something good coming out of it"" and he replied with:

“I don’t know what you expect.” “I’m busy right now, not thinking about this.” ""don't be dramatic.""

A few days later,

Me: “I don’t wanna see you anymore. I know you don’t like labels, but I like knowing everything. And I know you don’t know and are busy, but you can always text me when you figure it out.”

Him: “ ;( Ok, sorry”

Me: “I just think you’re at the point of actually wanting to date someone and we know it can’t be me bc of age and all of these things. So it’s ok. Take care.”

Him: *sends 2 goodnight stickers* …….""

After that, he kept reaching out to me and pretending to be jealous because I hinted that I am seeing someone else. He did ask multiple times to see but he would always cancel all the time. When I confronted him about his behaviour yesterday this is what he said

\- ""because what are we, we're just making out"" (as a reply to why he cancels all the time)

\-""I've been not interested in hookups lately...sometimes I do but then I don't""

\-""I'll try to be less lazy""

I just don't know why I'm letting this kind of man continue to play with my feelings and waste my time. All he does is hurt my feelings.

So far we’ve been on 5 dates, and everything is going in the right direction. We’ve both expressed that we really like each other, and I can see us becoming exclusive within the next couple weeks (if things keep going the way they’re going). 

This past tuesday I got back from an out of town trip and everything was still going well. And she even asked when I’d be available to go on a hike with her (before I left for the trip she suggested we go on a hike when I got back). Wednesday morning I told her that I’d be available friday (aka today). But she took hours to respond to my texts and replied that night. And when she did she apologized and said that she was really busy with school. She also said that we may have to wait until next week cause she’s really busy with school and she’s going back home with her family this weekend. She apologized again and said that she really needs time with her family.  Of course I told her that’s fine and everything and I said maybe we could aim for next Tuesday. Once again she responded an hour or two later, saying “Tuesday would be great”.


Obviously she’s really busy and I don’t think she’s lying at all, I’m just wondering if I should contact her at all?

One thing is, I felt a little weary about him because he is pretty friendly with one other woman in the office &amp; I wondered if he might be attracted to her, but not able to take action since she is taken. 

It's been a few months since I last saw him, but for some annoying reason, he pops into my head fairly regularly &amp; I feel like I might want to reach out to him.

I’m so afraid of getting scammed, that every conversation I’m always on the lookout for red flags, instead of trying to enjoy their company.

I also haven't been in a relationship or anything I'm two years.

Well we've been getting a little bit closer over the last few days and we spent most of the weekend together and we ended up in the same room alone for a night. And for whatever reason my anxiety just kicked in full force. We both layed there for like 4 hours fully awake and I felt like I could not say a word to her. Then I just got up and left and slept on the couch. 

I thought my wimpiness totally would have turned her off but to my surprise she added me on Facebook the next day. I started talking to her and then I just got extremely anxious again and didn't respond to her for 6 hours, then I just sent her ""I don't want us to talk anymore"". I thought it would help me stop thinking about her and now I literally can't think of anything but her. 

I don't feel like I can come back from that. I've had things with a few people in this time that haven't really worked out and honestly I wasn't too beat up about any of them. But I'm really fucking sad about this one and I don't even know why I did it.

62,pud0xs,1632460516,Girl at Apartment Advice,"So, a few weeks ago I ran into this beautiful girl at my apartment walking her dog. She approached my by my truck and we had an okay back and forth. This happened two more times randomly running into each other. Well, the fourth time we hit it off for around an hour talking about all kinds of stuff. She mentioned she has a good amount of friends in the apartment once in the middle of the conversation. Didn't think much of it. Entire time we were getting torn up by mosquitos and I even offered to let her go more than once due to it and she kept saying she had other stories or that she was fine. Near the end of our conversation I asked for her number and she looked pretty happy to give it to me. We have had some chats running into each other and I didn't see her for a few days. Just asked if she wanted to grab dinner and drinks with me this Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

While she accepted she mentioned she is really busy this week with volunteer work and a wedding. She generally goes to sleep a little earlier. I'm more nocturnal. She said she would be getting home around 8:30 from her volunteer work on Friday and would go eat with me. I asked her this Tuesday. Well, earlier today she said she wasn't so certain about Friday because it looks like she will be getting home around 9:30 instead. In the same exact text she offered to reschedule for Sunday instead. After she texted that I ran into her again later today and she wasn't trying to avoid me or seemed different. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind she has initiated texting me a good few time even after saying she couldn't make it Friday. Problem is the fact I have a long time friend I haven't seen in years flying down Sunday to stay for the week so I would have to postpone for another week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worries:

1. Never really specified it was a date. Every male friend of mine told me I'm being stupid and it's clear to them that no girl would approach a guy at night and talk to them for an hour, give them their number, and accept a dinner invitation while assuming it's to be friends after only texting/chatting a few times over two weeks.
2. We have a VERY nice pool area at our place with nice tables. No one is there after around 9pm  ever and it's extremely quiet. I was wondering if it would be a bad idea to just throw out a proposal to get a nice bottle of wine and chat/drink a bit at the pool after she gets back for however long she sees fit. Could be 30 minutes. I don't mind. Friend of mine said to just hold off and wait a week, but that assumes she is free next weekend. He stated it MAY seem desperate to try to squeeze in a short date instead of just waiting. 

Any thoughts? First time in my life I've ever been this attracted to a woman so I'm really trying to not drop the ball here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pud0xs/girl_at_apartment_advice/

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there. my apologies if this isn't the right subreddit.

This is a bit long, so my apologies. Also, you might cringe a bit due to my stupidity I guess...

Anyway this is a bit bizarre because this happened 2 years ago. I made reddit recently and never thought of asking. But I just recalled it for whatever reason, it just happened.

As far as I know, it can be very tricky to know whether a female is into you or not, due to that whenever I met up with females I usually never pay attention to what they do because I don't want to make up theories. This one was a little different.

I was around 19 (Male) at the time. I have known this girl at university (same age as me) for a little while, I never really paid a lot of attention to how she was interacting with me and such, I guess she was flirting the whole time. (No idea)

So basically one day she came really early in the day (Maybe she sent it at 10 am or so). She asked me if I like her, I have no idea if she was debating with herself whether to ask or not, she sent the message very early. At the time, I had mixed feelings and I said that I do like her, unfortunately she came at one of the worst times in my life, my lowest point to ask me such a question. I said that I do like her and such, but due to personal reasons I am unable to date her, and I went on to talk for long times on why I can't date at the current time (definitely not smart to do but it happened and I messed up things badly.) She never exactly answered if she likes me back or not, all she was saying was stuff like ""Maybe"" and ""If we go out on a date I'll give you an answer"". Now I don't really know anything much about whether she liked me or not. She did text me often, sent memes, I'd see her at university often and we'd meet up regularly (prior to her asking how I feel about her). So I guess she was interested? I'll never know... She did ask how many times I fell in love before and said I'm attractive in a way. Anyway, she said the reason she is asking about how I feel about her is due to her deactivating her social media account, and I didn't know she deactivated it, thought she blocked me (lol) and I asked her what happened, so she said that I showed a lot of care at the time, and thought I like her. I guess I was subconsciously attracted to her through text and me seeing her at university. I messed up a lot during the talk, She stopped texting me, and noticing me really. A week or two after she asked, I did something that is probably wrong lmao, I asked her if she was still interested in a date, but the damage was already done she never really contacted me since then, its been very awkward, she was colder. Later the pandemic happened and my chat with her has been very minimal, she takes too long to respond, seemed very uninterested (even though I'd just ask how she is and how school is every couple of months).

I didn't realize what I have done, looking back at chats, I guess she was flirting? I really have no experience, I always avoided relationships and dating due to many reasons (Studying, lack of confidence and commitment, etc...) I have changed a lot during the pandemic I took a huge turn, I feel much better now and generally more confident in most things I do. Since I got back on campus I think I have only seen her once or twice, she stared at me but I felt embarrassed to look back.

Anyway, I messed up bad lol, but I have always been curious since then... Did she like me? I mean she did ask if we can do a date, and asked if I like her or not. I really don't know.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pud479/i_was_left_confused/

One thing that really bugged me was she kept asking if I was really into  her or not. She was unsure if my concise texting was a sign of being uninterested, when I learned this I communicated I was a consie texted and that I was interested.  Then she told me I was moving to fast and I was making her feel pressured this is after she wanted to come snuggle with me one morning. I then said lets take things slow I move slow emotionally anyway. 

She had to leave for a few weeks for work and we agreed to keep talking and see each other when she gets back. We have been talking the whole time however she just told me that she hooked up with a guy the other night but still wants to date me. We are not together and I expected both of us to date since we are no where near official we even talked about it. However I am upset one she told me and that also she held me to a different standard of saying I move to fast and only wanted sex and then she goes and hooks up with a guy.

67,pudff7,1632462220,Women are completely unreceptive to my flirting and it's really bringing me down... 😒 (please read description),"So, I hope this doesn't come off as self-absorbed, but I do consider myself good, or at least decent, at flirting. I got good because I had an FWB for two years whom I flirted with. She was the only woman who ever picked up on my flirting attempts, and was the only one to ever reciprocate.

EVERY other woman, however, has never liked it when I flirt with or even compliment them. I am currently talking to a woman whom I have been on two dates with so far, and I can tell she really likes me already. 

In fact, she even initiated some flirting with me over text, and we flirted for a bit throughout the day. But when I've tried to flirt with her, I get a lukewarm response or else it just goes over her head.

For example, she randomly sent me a selfie the other day. I thought she looked beautiful, so I replied with a selfie of my own, and I said, ""here's me lol. Although I'm definitely not as adorable as you are 😉"". And I got a lukewarm ""aw, thanks"". There are many more examples, but at the moment, I can't think of them off the top of my head. Sometimes I pay women a compliment and they reply by making a self-deprecating comment about themselves.

I REALLY miss flirting. I want to do it and enjoy it again. What the hell is wrong with me that I can't be successful at it? Am I being too direct? Am I not direct enough? Any tips/advice?

I am by no means a person who can't hold a conversation or has a problem with interacting with a person. My Problem is the inexperience and  introversion, and therefore the missing of big cues.   


So, I had three dates with her in a timespan of 5 days. Yes, we kissed and at the third date she invited me to sleep over. And yes, we cuddle and kissed, but I didn't made a direct move. So, the day after, I received a message where she stated that she didn't feel the spark and don't think that this will get anywhere, but also has the feeling that maybe there can be something.  I said that I feel also no spark by itself (It's something I ignore because I think other aspects are more important), but I become fond of her. She stated the same and after this, we discussed my insecurities in general :'D... But at the end, she said she prefers not to end it.

So, she used a Blu-ray I have from here to see her again. So maybe I see here on Sunday again (Maybe...). 

My Problem is that the waiting, the emotional up and down I head over a few days and the point that my insecurities won't go away with interaction like this. I, personally, need time to be confident in a new situation and a hand from others to get it started, which I wrote her. And the last bit is that this thing didn't end, but she stated that she basically don't see a future. So, I'm confused as hell...

90,pufi3w,1632472157,Weird dating experience..,"Cliffs:-Went on a date with girl from Tinder and had sex

\-She told me during date that she was emotionally unavailable (which was fine with me)

\-She stayed the night, we had a good time

\-Texted for a few days (mutually)

\-I asked to hangout again (knowing she doesn't want a relationship, neither do, I but I wouldn't mind seeing her casually)

\-She responds that I'm the first since her ex and that she's not ready for a relationship of any kind, BUT that I'd be perfect for her best friend

\-She then tells me that she's already talked to her friend about it, and I that I should message her on Instagram

My brain is pretty confused here- this is unprecedented territory. I don't think I'm really interested in firing something up with her friend who I don't know at all, especially as I am quite attracted to the first girl.

Instinct is to just say something along the lines of ""Sorry, that's not something I'm really in to, but if you ever want to get in touch again you have my info""

92,pufk4d,1632472433,Dollar general counter lady is cute and thoughtful,"So I’m a regular at my towns DG and she always works Tuesday and Thursday nights closing shift (don’t know her schedule otherwise rarely go otherwise)
 (I usually come a bit before closing after my night time class) 
and she was talking to me because it gets slow around those times in the middle of the week 
I was talking to her about not being able to get a job because of my school schedule (we’re a major college student area and during the semester it’s near impossible to find a job without Tuesday night availability) 

So here my happy ass is going to checkout I buy my stuff and start heading out and she hollers for me,
hands me a business card from someone who was looking for employees 
And she was like “it made me think of you” and I caught MAD feelings about it 
The fact that she THOUGHT about me from a short conversation in a unconnected conversation

 There have been occasions hanging out with friends and hearing there were girls that shown clear interest and tried flirting with me, but I didn't realize that and thought they were trying to be friendly and that was it.

 I am guessing I might be the kind of guy which if they want to get me to notice, they got to be upfront and tell me. It is probably embarassing for me to be that oblivious in general, but anyways, I would like to ask, are there any ways I can figure out if a girl is showing interest?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pug0f9/how_can_i_figure_out_if_a_girl_is_interested_in_me/

She seemed surprised and giddy but I'm wondering if this is considered a no-no. I left my number at the bottom btw.

Tl;dr - Wrote a poem for a girl I just met and wondering if this is a social faux pas.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pug5k2/poetry_as_an_introduction_yes_or_no/

98,pugddf,1632476619,Is this guy judging my clothes or checking me out lol,"So there’s this colleague at work called John. I’m new to this workplace so we haven’t really met/talked properly, just the brief hello in passing. The other day I was standing and talking with another colleague when John walked by and complimented the other guy’s shoes and said they were nice etc. They talked for a while (both worked together longer). Then John turns towards me and makes eye contact, but he doesn’t say anything, he breaks eye contact and slowly scans me down to my shoes and there was a slight smile on his face. For context, I was wearing normal jeans, blouse, and normal sandals. We hadn’t actually met properly till that moment, but he didn’t say hi, just did that scanning thing, so I got pretty self-conscious about what I was wearing. 

Was he judging my clothes or was he checking me out; I can’t tell. The neurotic part of me was thinking that he hated my shoes maybe? Because they were both wearing sports shoes and I was wearing sandals… Fully aware this is an overthinking kind of question but am curious. 

Then our other colleague asked if I looked familiar to him lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pugddf/is_this_guy_judging_my_clothes_or_checking_me_out/
99,pugepy,1632476812,I have fucked up my career by getting involved with a subordinate,"Essentially as the title states I have fucked up, or at least damaged my career by entering into the beginning stages of a relationship with a subordinate employee.

I am her boss and she is a regular employee under me. 

Anyway before I ultimately decided to give this a go, I knew the whole don’t eat where you shit thing, and was vaguely aware of the potential consequences. We haven’t fucked or anything but have spent serious amounts of time together outside of work, hung out, etc.  

Anyway it has been 6 days exactly and I am beginning to understand why you don’t date people in the workplace. My temporary lack of judgement (or some would say pure stupidity) is potentially career jeopardizing. I’m 27 and I manage a convenience store. So I can always start over or do something else put I make decent money here and I’ve potentially threw it all away for a relationship that may or may not work out. 

Basically I was making the schedule earlier tonight and I realized I can no longer be impartial even in something simple as making a schedule which is a conflict of interest to my employees and the company as a whole. 


So today, I guess later this morning is when I will have to tel my boss, or HR about my problem. The only 3 outcomes I see are disciplinary action, transfer, or termination. Beyond this temporary lack of judgement I am a good boss. Haven’t had any disciplinary action in my 3 years with the company. 

I feel like I’ll probably get transferred but I have to accept the real reality I could be terminated. I contemplated attempting to keep the thing a secret but the longer I hold it in, the worse outcome for me from a company standpoint I assume. 

I should add this employee was a former customer who I thought was flirting with me when she came into the store, turns out I was right, but in hindsight I should have pursued it before she applied to work here and then none of this would be an issue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pugepy/i_have_fucked_up_my_career_by_getting_involved/
