I get the strong impression from women online that a lot of guys will ask them out, flatter them, try to ""make them their girlfriend"", generally pursue them, and it doesn't seem genuine, or valuable, because the guys don't really know them. Or guys do this with every girl. And it's a lot harder to tell if a guy is actually interested in her specifically, or just looking for a warm body.

It seems that with online dating the fear of rejection is so much lower. Even for myself, I match with women, chat with them, ask them out like it's no big deal. I can hardly think of a time I've been rejected when asking for a date online, and even if I was there's always more, or at least more that will come along and say yes. But with the lack of fear comes a lack of value. I feel like in the past it was a scary thing to ask out a girl, and so I would only do it if I thought she was really special. The act of asking for a date basically communicated: ""I think you're valuable enough that I'm willing to do something scary, that I otherwise wouldn't do"". And getting a ""yes"" was worth a lot more too, like that was a real victory, so you treated the date with more value.

So, how do you communicate to a girl you've met online the same thing. That you sincerely believe she specifically, as an individual is valuable enough that you are willing to risk your ego/reputation/self-worth for her?

I‚Äôm not very good at this stuff and this is the first time I‚Äôve needed to tell someone that I‚Äôm no longer interested in them.  I‚Äôm a bit nervous and could use some help with the phrasing when I tell this guy I‚Äôve been talking to.

Him (32M) and I (25F) have been talking for about a month and went on one date last weekend.  I find him super attractive and we had great conversation.  Overall it was a great date and we had planned to go on another today.  I actually ended up canceling since I was exhausted from traveling this weekend (plus I‚Äôm planning on not continuing dating him).

I‚Äôve ultimately decided I don‚Äôt want to pursue him anymore because he‚Äôs currently in school pursuing a demanding career (law).  I really value talking to a person I‚Äôm dating daily, but he‚Äôs far too busy to do this.  If I don‚Äôt initiate, we go days without talking.  Then when we do talk it‚Äôs a 10 minute kinda awkward conversation.  I have an anxious attachment style that I‚Äôm working on improving, but I know that going days without talking will trigger my anxiety.  I‚Äôd rather not set myself up to be unhappy and unfulfilled.

He‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôs more busy right now than he usually is.  I would have given him more of a chance since we did connect quite well, but I‚Äôve been dates with someone else who checks all my boxes (and I‚Äôd like to focus my efforts there and not lead anyone on).  I just feel bad because I am into the guy and nothing really was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, the timing just wasn‚Äôt great and his life seems too busy for a relationship now.

I developed some feelings and told her but she said she wasn't feeling the same and I was okay with it because before anything she is a friend someone I care about.
We joke alot, recently I sent her a message on one of my old accounts i revived and she seemed not to recognise me. So i kept the conversation going acting like a new person or stranger, I grew into the act and we connected easily it was really fun, she was enjoying it, I was too. Then she asked for my photo ( we are from different countries and her culture is so strict with foreigners) so I got a random pic of a guy from her ethinicity or culture she also sent hers. We continued chatting and enjoying each other's company then we started a conversation about love, crushes and friends.
I asked her who she loved, she explained to me bits by bits and the story was so similar to our real story of how we connected and still stay in touch. 

She narrated it well, I got curious and asked her to send me a photo of the guy she was talking about. After some blocks of text, she agreed and sent me the photo, for a moment I thought it was me because that was our story but it turned out to be a different guy also from her country or culture which I won't mention for respect. But have lived in the same country though her tradition is too strict.

Well I loved her and hoped it would be me but that is life i accepted and now feel relieved of the feelings I had for her since I know what's on her heart.
I am very happy for her, and really happy that she loves some one deeply ( though I still wonder why she used our story or amazed how similar it was with ours)
One of the promises of getting the photo was me telling her where I got her number and I told her the truth that it was me all the time.

My parents were big on no dating in high school.  For some reason that really stuck with me and I never went for it in college either.  So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never been on a date.  The closest I‚Äôve been was having a date planned from a dating app, but they flaked.  Due to COVID circumstances I‚Äôm WFH from my parents house.

However, this past week when I downloaded the app again I actually make progress with someone and we have something scheduled for next weekend.

So, here‚Äôs my question/concern‚Ä¶ why do I feel the need to hide it from my parents?  I have a strong desire to not tell them about it, it feels like it would be embarrassing.  I‚Äôm 100% gonna make up an excuse to get out of the house on the day off and not tell them.  But it feels so pointless‚Ä¶ if this were to go anywhere I‚Äôd obviously have to reveal at some point that I was lying.

It started with her admitting she has a crush on me. Us deciding to go on a few dates and eventually kissing and getting into a relationship.

Now initially, I wasn't super into her. I didn't ""play hard to get"" deliberately but I never had the need to ""text"" or ""call her"". She had to call me one day and say ""Since we're dating, we should talk on call sometimes"".

She used to be extremely flirty and use cheesy pick up lines etc to woo me. We live nearby and have met once a week atleast.

However, since the months passed, our attachment grew. Now, we mostly talk on call daily or atleast every second day. We still meet once a day.

But, I wonder if I've started being ""too available"" and it made her lose the will to put in the reciprocal efforts. 

To give you a context, we both have busy jobs. However, at night, I pretty much have an hour free to talk to her. It ends up that I call her mostly. She sometimes refuses to talk saying she's tired which I don't really mind.

However, I mentioned it to her that sometimes I feel ""I'm the only one who calls or takes out time for you"". Her response was somewhere along the lines of ""I know you'll call that's why I didn't call because we'll talk anyway"".

Our calls and meets are still great. However, I get this slight feeling of her getting extra power. I don't usually say no to calls or meet unless I'm genuinely busy. But, there have been many occasions where I set the date to meet next, she refuses and comes up with a random date. I don't mind since we get to meet, but I've started getting the feeling of her having ""the final say on when we meet"". 

She's still sweet and tells me she thinks about me the whole day. Looks at my pictures, wants to meet me etc. But me constantly asking ""When do we meet next"" or ""let's meet this weekend"" only for her to refuse has started to irk me a bit.

I got busy for the last couple of days. She called me. I didn't pick it up and texted her ""Will talk later"". It's suddenly that a switch lit inside her and she's been constantly asking ""Let's meet"", ""I wanna talk to you on call"", ""I miss your voice etc.

I don't like playing games, however, when I did become ""less available"", she started showing all the things which we communicated. But when I was being available, I got the feeling she took it a little for granted.

So is it necessary to be a little less available, to keep the attraction with the chasing concept. Or is it just a stupid immature game I shouldn't bother playing?

I (22M) really loved this woman (F22) I've dated for nearly a year now. But, it's gotten too stressful to maintain and here's why. When I first got into a relationship with her, she'd told me about her past abuses from ex boyfriends and the molestation she received from her previous ex. I've listened to her, and comforted her as much as possible on this. We live over 100 miles apart, so it's a long distance relationship. We really liked each other when I first came over to her home back in last December after talking to her on the phone and on a dating app. We hit it off, and things are going very well. Then, when she came over to visit me and my brother over in our apartment in March, my brother immediately did not like her. He didn't say anything rude to her, but it was made obvious to her. Then, she looked through my phone the next morning while I was showering and locked me out of my own room.

When she finally opened the door, she saw a long list of acquaintances and friends who were female and started accusing me of cheating. I told her that these were people I'm friends, acquaintances to, or hardly know them at all. Then, when she left the apartment, she kept asking what my younger brother really thought about her, and I spilled the beans because I'm a brutally honest person, I guess. She gets upset and a grudge forms between the two and her insecurities start to build up from her past significantly. She'd ask me constantly if I was going to leave her, or if I was just using her for sex, which I've explained many times to her that that is not how I feel. Those are things she'd even tell me well before she met my brother. I'd sometimes travel a couple of hours just to come sleep with her and spend time with her family during the school week and during the summer, she'd come over more often. Now, at this point in time, the feud had gotten so bad between her and my brother that she started asking personal questions about my brother, (18M), like why isn't he paying more in rent, or that her car was somehow better than his because hers was brand new and that his was a used car, stupid shit like that. She started saying that I loved my brother more than her, and I felt she'd cornered me into an awful scenario. Keep in mind that I'm on the autism spectrum, and I do not react well to stress or anxiety most of the time, and she understands this very well. This made me realize that no matter the fact I'd call and text her every day, and how I'd take her on dates, tell her she's amazing, come visit her when she's over 100 miles on days where I felt comfortable doing so, no matter how many times I'd convince her to seek therapy or other professional help for her sexual and relationship abuses, she never worked on herself and used me to distract herself from her emotional baggage.

We‚Äôve been on 3 dates, have the 4th today, done phone calls, text every day, and so far its been nothing but amazing.

The 3rd date (yesterday) we basically spent the whole day together, went to get lunch, did an IKEA trip as I‚Äôm setting up my new place, hung out at my place, watched a movie, had dinner, and the night ended on a sexual note. 

During the movie, her phone notifications were on. We were cuddled up, and her phone was right in my eyesight. It buzzed and a generic Bumble notification came up (Find someone‚Ä¶). An hour later, a Hinge notification also came up. 

At this point, she knew I could see/had seen it, so I joked and said ‚ÄòLook at you go, popular on all the apps!‚Äô. She joked with me but then told me she wasn‚Äôt actively using the apps, or talking to anyone else, or seeing anyone else. 

Later on, whilst we were in bed, we started talking briefly, and we confirmed this wasn‚Äôt a casual/fun thing. 

Now she‚Äôs obviously into me (when she came over for the date yesterday, she suggested IKEA, and I said I wanted to hangout/chill with her, and propped up the idea that if we did IKEA, we could something relaxing the next day if she was free. She immediately agreed.

I‚Äôm not a serial dater and when I know I want to see someone, I put in effort. I‚Äôve wanted to delete my account on Tinder since our second date, but haven‚Äôt at the thought of coming across as too keen.

That day she asked me if I could help her with some homework and said that we could eat something together as well. 

This wednesday we hung out for the first time and we got dinner at a restaurant. 
After we were done we went back to her place and we talked for probably over 2 hours about. All of a sudden she asks me if I had a girlfriend or if liked anyone (her obviously); I said no and changed topic but she noticed that I was blushing really hard. She made it clear that she's never really liked anyone and doesn't like anyone atm.

After I went home I texted her that I loved talking to her and she said that she's had a strong bond with me ever since she met me because we have lots of things in common. Oh and I asked her if she wanted to hang out again.

We met on Thursday as well and we hung out at a bar and talked a bit. At the end I asked her if she wants to go out again this week to which she said she would love it.

At this point I'm not sure whether she likes me or not, because I'm afraid she likes someone else (even if she said she does not) and don't know what to do. Should I take her out to dinner or just hang out?

We‚Äôre both in the Military now and I‚Äôve been super excited for her because it‚Äôs been a life long dream of hers to join. Shortly after she left I hopped on her tablet to look at all the photos she had of us and herself because I was really missing her. That‚Äôs when I saw she had screenshots of guys she had ‚Äúthings‚Äù with and would have sex with before we met. I looked at the dates of the screenshots and found they were after we got serious about eachother and made it an official relationship. One particular night I was driving to see her she was on FaceTime with another guy and took screenshots of him and he was shirtless. So I got pissed off and felt really hurt and wanted to see what else I could find, so I hacked myself into her Snapchat. She was signed in on her email on her tablet and I used it to change her Snapchat password and there I found a whole lot more. After we became official, she was texting with a guy and they made plans to meet up and drink together and they sent one selfie each to eachother and were flirting with eachother a bit. T this point I went through all the dudes on her snap to see if she was doing anything else and I found another guy who was flirting with her and said they should meet up when she visits his state and she was soon because she was going down to be with family and they both said they want to meet up and that it‚Äôd be fun. I also found a screen capture she took of one of her past fling dudes off Instagram of him shooting guns.. all this happened the first few months after we started dating and it became a slight problem and we talked about it and she stopped over time but I was never made aware about these messages. She was talking to one of them at 2:30 am while I was sleeping right next to her and I assume the guy wanted to talk because she said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt it‚Äôs dark and late and don‚Äôt want to wake my bf up‚Äù it‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cheating and isn‚Äôt explicitly flirting back but she‚Äôs entertaining these guys and being too friendly.

So my point and to summarize (TL;DR) I was missing my gf since she left bootcamp and went into her kindle to look at pictures of her and us because I was missing her. Found screenshots of other boys, one I knew about too she has told me she had things with in the past (present??) and then wanted to find more so I used her kindle and open email account to reset her Snapchat and found her talking to guys and making plans to hangout, dudes that were clearly not wanting to just be friends.

I never had a woman show overt interest in me or ask me out.

I actually managed to get into long-lasting relationships that way that didn't continue for reasons outside our control.

 I've recently come to the conclusion that many women would give me a shot if I make it convenient for them to do so... on the other hand, I never had a single woman to actually ask me out or take initiative in being bold in their interest in me.. It is as if a woman wanted to be that bold, she would rather be that way with guys that are more ""desirable"" (by any definition of the word) than me... Before covid, when I was active in asking women out, I would go on date with a different person at least once a month or so  (if I was single) but since COVID I decided to stop asking out women and wait for others to take initiative.. and as you could guess I barely met any woman in a romantic way since then.

I think my question is that, is there any way for an average guy to be successful in actually receiving interests from women without always being the first person that makes the relationship or date happen.

he works and studies for his master's degree right? so he doesn't put his phone on ""do not disturb"" so he hears the phone ringing when me or someone send a message on whatsapp, he gets ""really"" mad when i send him messages, he always said he would never hurt me but i felt bad when he typed in caps lock sometimes, yesterday he said he would put his phone on ""do not disturb"" mode because me and his friends were texting and calling him so much so i thought i could text him today, i texted and he got mad lol, then i said i would uninstall whatsapp and he said i don't have to uninstall but to respect him or something like that i read the message without clicking on his chat and uninstalled the app for 1 hour, it was gloomy and rainy in my city today and his time zone is 1 hour behind mine (his time zone is eastern time zone but they're using daylight savings since march so it's only 1 hour behind, but it will be 2 hours behind in some weeks), so i laid on my bed and closed my eyes because i do that when i'm sad then i got sleepy, but i decided to reinstall the app and send a message apologizing for my petty and childish attitude, i said a lot of good things and was super polite and respectful and he didn't say nothing back lol. do you guys think i should stop caring too much or start being short with him or this will just damage our relationship? we don't date bc i don't live in his town also. also why do you guys think he's single??
so yeah im considering this bc im literally tired. it would be a loss for both of us tbh bc he's at least upper middle class and he's hot, and a loss for him because i'm 18 and look underage and have a cute voice and i'm skinny and polite/caring (if we parted ways) but like i think he should care more because i literally like him so much and my looks are appealing too (i don't find myself too much good looking but he genuinely finds i guess, or he doesn't and just chat with me because of my age and underage look?), maybe he thinks i'm only interested on his money?? or he doesn't even care about me because he could find another boy for him, guys please help me should i be short with him or not will this make him care more?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1112808,public,self,"Is the sentence ""The less I care, the more he does"" true or not?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk3g1l/is_the_sentence_the_less_i_care_the_more_he_does/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I (19M) have a friend (19F) and we've been friends since 9th grade. Although our friendship was tough at first because I kept throwing jokes about her and eventually we ignored each other for months. After that, I apologized to all of the jokes I've thrown around and we eventually became very close friends that would talk almost everyday.

When we both graduated in junior high school, we parted ways (went to different schools far from each other) but we still talked to each other through messenger. She was always the person I would go to if I want to vent/say something.

She replies to me fast but very close ended but I still kept talking to her because she's the only person I trust, I also just thought that she's busy with school which 90% of the time is the truth. I jokingly asked her if she ever wanted a boyfriend she said that it isn't her priority and she would always prioritize her studies first and would wait until she finishes college.

We are both in college now, and recently I fell in love with her. So I immediately told her that I felt such thing but she cringed at it and later just laughed it off. I just told her I love her but I didn't ask for a relationship because of her study first mentality and I just thought ""yea, atleast you confessed now and there's less to worry about"".

I haven't talked to her for almost a month because of school and a few weeks ago she recently checked and asked me if I was busy at school so I just said yes. It was also a great timing since the school gave us a break to rest. That night, I invited her to a voice chat and I told her what I did in the previous month when I haven't talked to her. During that period where I didn't talk to her she kept posting something about love in her stories and the my delusional ass thought it was for me and I thought she probably changed her mind about me.

After talking about my part, I asked her if there is something she would like to say, she just kept saying there's really nothing that she want's to talk about but I kept insisting her. So I just said okay I will say something again but you probably know what it is. She then just told me ""noooooo, we're just friends okay hahaha?"". I replied with I know that but I just wanna say it because I still do.

I didn't end up saying it but later on she said that she actually wants a boyfriend literally right now but it's just not me and repeatedly said ""just not you"". I got shocked because I always thought that she would prioritize her studies and she said it herself that she would wait until she graduates. Out of shock, I disconnected in the voice chat and didn't get to sleep.

After that, I just went to read reddit about similar experiences about getting rejected and at 3AM, I unfriended her on all social media because I was thinking that there is no point on talking to her again and I just thought that unfriending might be a great coping mechanism.

Was cutting off communications the right choice? Should I just leave her alone now and move on?

I've been chatting to this girl for about two weeks now and we went on our first date last week. I initially said just drinks at a local pub but on the day she suggested food too. It was really nice and the conversation was flowing really well, we laughed and joked and even got desert (I don't usually go for desert)

Maybe it's just me being bad at reading signals, but I wasn't sure how it ended. We said our goodbyes and said for her to let me know she got home safely. My intention was to text the next day, but she beat me to it within about 30 minutes and said she had a lovely time and would like to do it again. We then texted back and forth that night and the past few days. She even mentioned wanting to kiss but not wanting to overdo it 

We both live in a small-ish town with not much to do outside of pubs and restaurants, however the next big city (30 minute drive away), has a lot to offer but I don't want to go there just yet. 

Just wanting to get opinions on my thoughts of a second date. I'd rather not repeat the pub/restaurant just yet and I thought of a sort-of picnic instead. I'm in the UK so the weather has turned a bit. But we both talked about liking local farm shops, so my idea was to pick her up, take her to a nice farm shop near the local airport to pick up some lunch, then drive to a nice viewing area, sit on the boot of my car whilst watching planes take off with some nice lunch and a thermos of hot coco. 

Now neither of us are into plane spotting or anything like that but I thought it would just be a nice backdrop for conversation. I feel like being close sat on the boot (trunk for Americans) of the car removes the table obstacle between us, and if it goes well and opportunity presents itself we can kiss. 

Just wanted to know if this sounds like a good idea or not?

We had first met in a bar where a friend and I were celebrating my birthday. She walked in and sat down 2 seats over. My friend and I went on with our normal conversation when she decided to join us. We really hit it off and had a pretty deep conversation. She was shocked how young I was since she was 8 years older than me. I thought at that point it would be a deal breaker since I was younger, but it wasn't. We continued to talk for about 2 hours. 

At that point, she asked me to put my number in her phone. When it was time to leave, she asked me if I was going to take her home and have my way with her. I told her no, but I would walk her home. (I'm not into hookups to be honest)  

So I dropped her off and told her I would text her. That night we continued to keep texting and she asked me if I was flirting with her. I told her that she can be the judge of that and we continued to hit it off. So I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime and she said definitely. So I texted her two days later to ask her how her day went and if she wanted to go out with me for drinks and dinner at the end of the week. She said definitely. So we continued to text all week long. We had a few good conversations. There were also multiple occasions where she would put out sexual innuendos during our conversations.

Finally, the night of the date came along. I picked her up at her house and we went out for dinner and drinks. The place we went to is very casual. We had a really good conversation for hours and got to know each other. At the end of this, I asked her so what was next. She looked at me and said where should we go next. I told her unfortunately I cannot keep drinking since I had to drive home, but we could go back to my house if she felt comfortable. She said well I'm not having sex with you tonight and prefaced this by saying we wouldn't see each other again if we had sex. I told her that was not my intention at all and if it was why wouldn't I have just done that on the night we met. I just wanted to have another drink and talk since I really enjoyed our conversation.  So she agreed to come along. We went back to her house first and she picked up the things she needed to stay over. We continued to talk until 4:30 am and then decided to go to bed. I got in bed and got ready to sleep. At that same point she got in bed naked, but went to sleep.

The next morning we both woke up and she turns over and says that I can have sex with her... I asked her if that was what she wanted and she said yes. I also asked if I would see her again if we did since she said we wouldn't. She said that was last night not now. So we did, it was not good since I was nervous. She told me after to not feel bad. She still got off and it was fine. After this, we continued to talk. At that point she said to me to be clear that we are not exclusive and can see other people. I said of course since this was a first date... This caught me slightly off guard. After this she proceeded to tell me that she has another date that night. I asked her if she wanted me to bring her home on multiple occasions. She said no. We continued talking for a few hours and she then said she was cancelling her other date so she could stay. We had a good day. Went for a walk and sat by a fire outside. When we went back in the house. She walked up to me, looked me in the eye and said this is the part where you kiss me. So we did. She then said to take my pants off and get on the bed. We proceeded to have sex again. This time it was much better and felt extremely passionate. About five minutes after that round, she continued to kiss me and proceeded to go for round 3 which was also good. 

Later that night, she asked if I could come back to her place. So we went back to her place and watched a movie. She laid in my lap the whole time and told me all about her previous relationships and what she wants in a relationship. We kissed and she told me she felt safe with me and that I was going to fall in love with her. I joked saying how do you know that you're not going to fall in love with me first. After the movie, we went to sleep since we had a long night the night before.  I woke up in the morning and she was feeling sick (she was actually sick, but maybe it was an excuse to get rid of me). I asked her if she wanted me to stick around and make sure she was okay. She said she would rather be alone and I can go home. I said okay and I would text her and see how she was later.

Later, I texted her and asked how she was. She said she still was not feeling good and thank you for spending time with her. I told her that I had a good time and asked if we could go out again soon. She said let's not go from date 1 to 5 so quickly. I said I was sorry for being forward, but I felt like we had a connection. She then said okay to a second date on the following Friday.

We texted back and forth very little that week. She told me she had a few bad days that week. Then Thursday night rolls around and I asked if we were still on for Friday. She said she couldn't and was responding shortly. A few more days had passed and it was short responses or no reply. I finally asked if she was still interested in me or if I did something. If not just to be honest since I don't want to waste her time. She responded a day later saying that she could tell that I wanted a relationship but she doesn't. She is not ready.

I responded with I appreciate the honesty. It's been 3 weeks since I said this.

Sorry for a long story, but this happened about a month ago now and I just feel like it is a strange transpiring. Was I too forward? Was she attracted to me or did she just want to get off? I'm an average looking guy, but she was a very good looking woman. I just shake my head daily and don't particularly know what to make of this situation. Why would she talk about what she wants in a relationship if she doesn't want one and why would she tell me that I was going to fall in love with her and spend 36 hours with me?

Also, I explained to her that I got out of a relationship where I was lead on for about 3 years and I don't like games.

I wouldn't really mind waiting as I am taking everything very slow, I guess he does too. And I am more of like becoming friends with him first rather than dating instantly. (We are 10K miles away from each other, so this makes it worse)

Sometimes, I can't help but think if we got a chance. Though when we talk through the phone, and we talk about people on dating apps can sometimes get apathetic, he always says that if a person doesn't have a chance, just say it to his/her face and don't give em false hopes. So I am thinking that he's definitely gonna do that to me if he's not interested anymore, so since he has not said that yet, he's still interested right?

By the way, we are both adults. I'm 25 and he's 33.
I don't really know what makes him very busy. He only works for 6 hrs a day and he's a 100% introvert.

There are moments that I get slow replies, like 1 to 5 hrs üòÇ and also being left on his inbox for days (he's not checking my message. It happened once that he didn't message me for 3 days. This is when he knew that one of his family members is sick. He didn't say sorry or explain anything for being MIA I just assumed that it may be because of his family because he cried when we talked about it)

But there are also moments when he's kind of clingy. I sometimes wake up with his random cute messages.

Right now, he's still got problems with his family and I think it contributes as to why he doesn't want to talk to anyone plus he is an extreme Introvert.

I'm losing my patience, really. But I am trying to be more understanding.

He always says that he's happy that he has me in his life. That I am a blessing. And that it feels good to talk to me with what's been happening in his life, especially with his family (he just keeps it to himself all the time)

I will only accept comments from extreme Introverts or people with Introverted partners. üòä

So we start drinking and talking to the host and other people. After some time I end up in a group talking with this cute girl and one other guy I was talking to a bit earlier.  

The girl is dressed up in this kinda grey skirt with blazer jacket and she has black and white hair.

It wasn‚Äôt overly flirtatious for the most part, but we talked about a lot of different things from music, to a recent relationship she had gotten out of. 

She seemed to be really enjoying her time talking to me, but she was also very drunk.

I always had difficulty interacting with people, always have been the weird guy in class and suffered bullying throughout most of my teenage years. 

I started dating people at age 19, and always found it quite difficult. Always my acceptance/rejection ratio has been very high. 
The only 2 times I had a girlfriend officially, it lasted less than 2 times. 
Frequently I get told even by my friends that I am weird/autistic.


Well, recently I have been going through a series of many rejections, with people with whom I had created a lot of expectations. 2 girls that I was going out with decided they didn't want anymore, just to shortly later show up with boyfriends. I have always heard the ""you are very nice/good looking guy, you're gonna find someone(just not me lol) ""


I always find it difficult to get close emotionally to women, even tho I feel very attracted to them. It's like I am always scared of being myself around them. 

Anyway, after all this venting, what I mean is... Maybe my personality is just no what women want in a romantic partner? I dont really care much about marriage and children, but I don't really like the idea of being alone. I always kinda dreamed of having a partner who would truly be by my side through good and bad, but maybe it is not going to happen?

I make a lot of money, I read philosophy, play an instrument, I'm pretty athletic, take care of my appearance. I'm not boasting, it's just that these things don't really seem to give me an advantage. I imagine without these things it would have been even more hard.
