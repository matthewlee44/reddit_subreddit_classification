0,pyd0hn,1632978727,Dating in the Midwest,"Since moving to the Midwest I’ve noticed dating is not quite the same as it was for me a few years ago when I use to date back in the South. Idk if it’s because the guys here suck or the competition is more competitive. 

The problem I feel like I’m having is guys wanting cheap first dates (not all the guys but many) and I just feel like guys take me for granted or don’t pursue me as much as I was use to in the South. I’m a decently attractive fit female but the apps I’m using have me feeling like the girls I’m up against are all 10s or something. Either the Midwest guys suck or it’s the “competition”. Ugh, either way it’s so frustrating and annoying. Dating is suppose to be enjoyable.

1,pyd2up,1632979018,Why is it that I feel like I am never loved?,"Hi all, I am a 23 year old male living in South Korea. 

I have had two long term girlfriends after high school, and am currently in a relationship of about 5\~6 months. My only problem is that I feel like I never been truly loved by a partner. I know my girlfriend and past girlfriend have both liked me, but it never felt like love. I always was jealous of friends who you could just tell their girlfriend was in love with them or maybe even obsessed with them but not in an unhealthy way. I know this isn't common and shouldn't be expected but I see it enough to make me want it. 

I know this will come off wrong, but I feel like it is necessary to understand my situation. I go to one of the SKY (top uni here for engineering), speak fluent english and korean, feel like I am easy going, am a little taller than average (178cm), but I guess I was lucky enough to be born with a face that is considered attractive in Korea. I guess it was never hard to get a girl to hook up with me at parties/clubs, but I try to never let it get to my head and certainly try my best to be humble. The point is, Koreans tend to be quite superficial and I guess I am considered quite high up on their superficial dating scale. I receive many compliments from men and women. So at this point in my life, I am more ""aware"" on what my ""worth"" is in the dating market, I guess? It's cringe for me to type this but it's honestly my observation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed many times where my best friends girlfriends are just straight up in love with them. These friends are typically lower on the superficial ""scale"" than I am, so I guess I am asking if there is something I am doing wrong. It's hard to explain, but I guess it's a combination of the physical touch (like putting arm around bf or hugging their bf in public), being very very committed, uploading photo of their bf, etc. stuff like that. It's really hard to explain but I can feel the genuine love and I am happy to see it. It just sucks that I feel like I've never felt that way with my girlfriend(s) in the past or present. Is there something I am doing wrong... I really wish I was able to feel like I was truly loved.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyd2up/why_is_it_that_i_feel_like_i_am_never_loved/

Here’s the story:

To start off, I’m 25, so no this isn’t a creepy grandpa story. I drove a girl last night back to her apartment. We chatted the whole way and she seemed to be into it. I know I was. One of the giveaways that she felt comfortable was that after I mentioned that I was on the hunt for a new apartment, she suggested HER OWN APT BUILDING, going into detail about how great the place was. Anyway, as she’s walking out I asked her if I could give her my number. You see, it’s a very delicate situation. If I ask a girl for their number and they’re put off by it or feel uncomfortable, they can report that to Uber and I can lose my job in a split second. (I’ve given thousands of rides and I only asked if I could give my number about 4 times.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyd5r9/asking_a_girl_out_if_im_her_uber_driver/

For context I am a 26F and this year has been a crap show on the dating scene. I entered into a routine where I would meet a guy, get to know him, go out a few times, open up about my life, feel like maybe this is going somewhere, only for it to end and be sad for a few days before trying again. I ended a 3 month situationship on Sunday because the guy didn't know if he liked me and honestly I'm just exhausted from it all. So taking a break seems like the logical course of action. However, and this may be an unpopular opinion so apologies in advance if I accidentally offend someone (but there is a reason I am mentioning it), but being unmarried/unengaged when I'm 30 is my nightmare. I come from a culture where people get married young (early 20s) and I'm already on the older side. So I'm struggling to be okay with my decision to take a break from dating. I feel like I am wasting what little time I have by not actively looking for someone. It's stressing me out and causing me to panic slightly. I feel like maybe I should keep looking, but I just don't have the effort with everything currently going on with my life to care about some random man's life for a few months only to get disappointed later. Any advice with how to be okay with taking a break will be greatly appreciated

8,pydhpo,1632980802,as a guy with old (and few) photos what can i do to give myself a fighting chance? OLD,"unfortunately my social life over the last 7 or so years has slowly evaporated to where i practically don’t have one. so getting newer photos is an impossibility. i also don’t use social media such as facebook or more importantly instagram, so the moment im seen to not use instagram im immediately judged for it, why? i have no clue. 

i get really down over my situation because i used to be very successful on OLD, my photos were up to date, my social life was thriving, and whilst i didn’t use social media, i was still super successful. 
unfortunately i was young and stupid (still am the stupid part) so pretty much all the bridges were burnt between myself and these girls i knew and met over the course of years.

so, what can anyone give me any advice on how to improve my OLD experience, as a 27 yo man with old photos, doesn’t use social media and meeting people organically is impossible where i’m from as i live in a small village of around 1500 people, and everyone knows everyone, even in the surrounding towns and villages. 

i haven’t bothered really commuting to OLD over the last year or so now because i have had no motivation to try it. i just thought, “oh i’ll get no matches anyway what’s the point” 

i’m a pretty attractive guy but i just never did myself any favours in the photo department, it was always one of those things that would never cross my mind which sort of makes me different to everyone else of my generation and younger. 

any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

9,pydia0,1632980868,Okay so I recently started dating this guy and I’m so conflicted on his mixed messages. I would love to hear any opinions on this or any advice.,"He doesn’t talk to me during the weekdays and ONLY communicates with me when he’s 100% free. 
He’s studying to become a nurse, so he is a busy guy, (I’m studying aerospace engineering so I’m also busy) but i’m getting mixed signals from him. When we text he’s super dry. But whenever we have official “date days” he becomes all lovey dovey and makes it clear that we’re more than friends. He even teared up when I said we should simply be friends (mostly because I felt he was too busy to give me the quality time or attention that I felt I needed if we were to be in a relationship). I don’t know I just struggle to understand why he can’t fit a 10minute conversation through text where we simply make each other laugh or show each other emotional support during the day. He said he doesn’t do it because he considers himself a boring person and has nothing to say. But to me he just seems too distracted and busy to ever develop feelings for me. Yet he lets me know that he is falling for me and it takes him a while to do so. We have already had sex and that’s mainly what we do when we hang out. I don’t feel any emotional support from him. Only when we’re on a date and we’re about to have sex. I would be fine if we stayed as friends with benefits, but he seems to want more of me whenever I’m with him in person. It’s like he wants me to fall for him while he keeps his distance. I don’t know how emotionally available this guy is. I myself tend to get somewhat lost in relationships but at least I give and receive emotional support. This guy just doesn’t seem mature enough to want a relationship for what it comes with, the good and the bad. Am I making too many assumptions? Has anyone ever been in a similar position?

This is the first time in over a year for me. Our families kinda knew each other when I was growing up so there is a little familiarity but never really talked to her until recently. We both have been through bad relationships and want to try and do things better in the future, whether together or not. We have talked about taking things slow, which I am onboard with doing, I would like to break my own relationship patterns as well. 

My only issue is that I keep feeling like something is wrong. I do have an anxious attachment style, which I am working hard to heal and keep under control. 

What I am struggling with is, knowing what is a trigger or projection from a past relationship or an actual red flag. While this is still relatively new they rarely ask about me or my day. She did a little bit the first week, but then it kinda stopped. I know she is busy and we both have really crazy schedules, but I still find time to check in to see how her day is going. When we go on dates conversation flows, it’s fun and we have a good time. But all the other times it’s like I don’t exist unless I contact her. She did ask me for next date rather than me ask her, so that was nice, but in general i have to contact her. I don’t know if I am being ridiculous and it’s still too early to find this a problem. Or this is an indication that there may be emotional unavailability.

Second time I saw him, I invited him to smoke with another dude I had met on bumble (but just as a friend I guess), and he kinda freaked out n asked me to be exclusive. 

I really liked him so I said yes lol 

Then third date it was amazing like I spent a whole weekend with him and I felt we had a lot of fun and we get along super well. And that time he asked me to be his gf and I also said yes haha

And he, out of nowhere, told me that he wanted to break up

I feel very heartbroken 

He said he’s been talking to his ex

But then we text a lot too and have long calls almost every night

He also told me that he wants to be my friend n be there for me, still have sex, n all but that he doesn’t think we are a good match

After my divorce, our shared custody arrangement stuck me to this small town where we lived before. It’s been eight years since. It’s very small there yet beautiful. And it’s very far away from the metro area in our state. Like 4.5 hours away. I won’t give up my daughter and I’ve never missed a week with her. Our visitation schedule is the week on/week off scenario where I’m down there for a week and then by myself the next week. On and off like clockwork. I need to work and make money to survive so I frequent the larger metro area to sustain myself. Moving the ex and daughter are not an option. Hence, while up there, I try to date. And I’d like something long term and meaningful. I’ve had guys tell me right to my face, let your ex wife have the kid and move on. Well…my daughter needs me and I need her frankly. Those types of guys don’t tend to be friends for much longer. 

So… dating is nonexistent. I really try. I’m a good father and a good guy all around but the loneliness is starting to tear at me. My daughter is 12 now and I have seven more years left before she will likely go to college and I’ll be able to move. Once a woman finds out my situation, they’re gone. 

And I’m truly alone. I manage to overcome all of the rejection because my kiddo is awesome. No one wants to date a guy that takes off every other week to go live 4.5 hrs away with their kid. I’ve even tried to date in the other smaller towns like 2 hrs or so away. However, work brings me up to this metro area like 4.5 hours away. So I try to date women there. I’m either not stable enough for them, not something this or not something that and then they throw in some really nice words on what a a great father I am and how admirable and how lucky my daughter is. And I’m the guy that does all of the driving. Lol.

I'm wondering if even if a guy has his life and happiness on track now, would it still put you off that he took a long time to find this stability and happiness in his life?

Maybe you worry that whatever caused it could come back? (Depression, personality traits etc)

I'm 34 now and was quite anxious and depressed since able 15, due to being bullied at school and having no friends, and also then binge drinking often since 17 and also probably having a health problem which wasn't being treated optimally (underactive thyroid).

Now I've quit alcohol and p*rn (I can't spell the word fully due to a blocker lol), am taking steps to improve social anxiety and social life, have a healthy routine with exercise and gym, eating well. I also moved to a sunny country where I'm much happier (I'm from UK).

Career wise I am a software developer for 7 years and can now get lucrative contact roles. I plan to work for just 3 months of the year and spend the rest learning music production which is something I've always wanted to do, as well as spending time building mobile apps because I don't want to be working for other companies all my life.

So I feel like career wise it's becoming less stable (still good money but not stable because I'm trying out different things) but more stable in other areas. And realistically it might take another year or two to be completely happy with my social life, and maybe 3 years  by the time I feel like I'll know what I want to do career wise long term.

But at that point, would it still be off putting that I had a lot of unhappiness and instability in my past?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyexby/women_does_it_put_you_off_of_a_guy_has_an/

I recently matched with a girl on hinge and we got chatting about work and different things. We soon realised we work at the same company but in different offices and this got us messaging even more thanks to this common ground.

I eventually got her number and moved to suggesting that we go for drinks. She was very receptive to the idea but said she wouldn’t be free for 2 weeks as she was moving (and bars won’t be open for another week due to lockdown)

All good, only issue is I’ve been trying to keep light chat going every second or third day but I’m the one initiating every time. When we do chat it seems positive but I’m getting the vibe interest is fading.

Accept that the only hope is step-parentage? Online dating, especially after covid has more trouble than it's worth and the ""no/no more kids"" has been prevalent.

29,pyfpx8,1632991533,Should I [30M] make intentions clear prior to fourth hang out with friend[27F]?,"Hi all,

A friend [27F] messaged me [30M] completely out of the blue a month ago to hang out, however the thing is, we hadn't been in touch for around a year prior to COVID. We weren't that close back then, meeting a few times with mutal friends and once alone (in hindsight that one time may have been interest too as she initiated)

In the past month we've hung out 3 times (drinks, her place (with a lovely summer walk), shopping trip (with drinks after)) and each time I felt that we were vibing pretty well. The second hang out was when it actually hit me that there might be something more, but as I was unprepared, and not wanting to ruin a friendship if I was wrong, I didn't make a move nor attempt to get closer physically except for hello/parting hugs.

We went on a shopping trip today with drinks after and I was prepared to steer conversation towards me bringing up the question, but I didn't manage to find it. We seem to get along well and I see signs that she may be interested for more even during our time together today (She initiated and seems comfortable around me) plus we've talked about our next outing (movie) with me """"hinting"""" at 'We'll go alone together' instead of with mutual friends. 

Seeing that I wasn't able to ask her out properly after 3 hang outs, and to make my interest known before I'm friendzoned, I'm wondering whether it's OK to ask her out by text given we haven't been texting? (my anxiety makes me a slow responder, but I am working on it)

Personally I'm not too keen to via text, but I feel I should make my intention clear prior to the next hangout/date? If not, what's the best way to play this out without losing her interest?

anyway I feel like my self esteem is gone. I mean, when I look in the mirror and at my pictures I like what I see. If I’m another person and Someone would have shown me a picture of mine I would say “this guy can get a decent looking girlfriend pretty easily”  my male  friends tell me that I look good and when I told some of them about my situation online they said “if I’m successful there and I’m less good looking then you so you need to stop complaining” those guys getting matches and numbers from girls that I find attractive and those girls seems to have a great personality when I just can’t literally talk to a girl in my taste. and they say that I’m better looking then them and actually in my opinion I’m better looking. no offence. So why they can get attractive dates while I can’t even talk to an attractive girls? Is it because I’m bald at 21? Some of those friends are 10cm shorter then me and some are definitely in a bad shape, none is bald so idk. 

And yes you’re probably gonna tell me that online dating is bullshit and I’m fully agree with that.

31,pyfx5s,1632992576,difference in interacting with men vs women on dating apps,"so this week I've decided to step out of my comfort zone and experiment with my sexuality, I signed up for Grindr today and hooked up with another man he was 35 I am 28.

I instantly noticed I didn't have to carry the entire conversation we just talked about what we do for work, why I wanted to experiment, I had a conversation with a guy about the guy I just had sex with, we even talked about my woes with women there was no unfair judgement and I was even complimented for my bravery and looks which was nice.

 I felt very accepted where with women I felt constantly judged, rejected and disposable. I felt more judged on my status and looks rather than who I am as a person granted these men wanted to sleep with me and that's fine that's the whole point of my account. the standards that these guys had were reasonable.

it was nice to be appreciated I did not feel like I was a check box that had to for fill every requirement before someone would even consider talking to me or feel like I would be ditched as soon as someone better came along.

when I messaged a guy I would actually get messages back as well as compliments, people would actually read my profile the more I think about it the more depressed I get because I wish common decency, reasonable standards and not feeling like a check box was the same between the sexes.

there's no future where I'll ever date a man or have romantic feelings for men it's just a way to hook up, maybe my bad interactions with women and the constant rejection pushed me into experimenting this way or it's just a phase.

either way I know my impact will be minimal here I'll probably be mocked and ridiculed but hopefully this touched some women and made someone reflect on how they treat and interact with men online.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyfx5s/difference_in_interacting_with_men_vs_women_on/

38,pyggo0,1632995247,Any tips for getting a GF?,"So I am a 19 year old (male) university student (recently started second year). I’ve never had a proper GF in my entire life. For the last year I had a crush on this girl but she has been incredibly rude to me and truth be told she seems like a toxic person. The past few days she's just made me feel like such a bad person and made me really upset. So instead of moping around for the next month I decided to put my head down and finally get a GF or at the very least some dating experience. I know it won't improve everything, but I just want to give it a try.

I’m currently on these dating apps = tinder, bumble, okcupid, match, plenty of fish, Hinge, happn and Tag. I'm also on a few hookup apps such as Hot and 3fun.

I should note that most of the girls at my uni are very toxic or taken, so meeting girls there is unlikely. However I do live in student accommodation with a bunch of students from different universities, they also regularly throw parties and events.

I'm outgoing and sociable so attending events and stuff is something I would be up to do. I also enjoy going out for drinks and stuff like that.

I’m looking for a fairly serious relationship, probably more on the longer side. But at this point I would take anything.

So I thought I’d pose the question to you reddit. Is there any advice you can give me?

Apps, events, situations any advice would be appreciated

Thanks in advance

41,pyglgh,1632995902,My (28F) boyfriend (30M) still uses Tinder,"\*sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker\*

We've been together for about year and a half now, also I think it's important to say that we're long distance (still manage to see each other quite often). I caught him using it maybe 5 months ago, he was showing me a video on his phone and the notification popped on his screen. I asked him about it, he got all defensive and told me he only uses it for fun. I told him it bothers me and then he said he would delete the app if it's a problem. 

So next few months, everything was fine as I was sure he deleted it. But there were a few occasions where he'd kind of disappear for a few hours at evenings. It bothered me because he wouldn't really say where he was or he would say he needed to cool off after work (which I do understand) but I kind of started having this gut feeling like something was maybe going on. But since I know I am a bit anxious in relationships and I couldn't really prove anything, I let it go and decided to believe him.

Well, he didn't delete the app and is still  regularly using it.  I found out again also by accident. I confronted him and he eventually admitted he's still using it, but only every now and then (not true, his status is 'recently active' all the time). Again he told me it's only for fun, he only messages the girls, has never met with anyone, has never cheated on me, etc.

Aaand I'm kind of torn. I think I believe him that he doesn't physically cheat, emotionally probably, which for me is still cheating, but he disagrees. Also I thought about it a lot and came to conclusion that it's very probable that he uses it only for fun - to get matches and compliments because he's insecure and it's a boost for his ego.

When I again told him that it really bothers me and I think it's cheating, he again got all defensive with his 'what's wrong with you, I'm not actually cheating', like it's my fault cause I'm just jealous ( I'm really not) and I was only hurt when I found out. Then eventually he told me he understands me, but he doesn't plan on stopping using Tinder.

So I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here. Maybe some advice or just to vent a bit. I did tell everything to some of my friends, but they don't really think it's a problem and here I am sitting and wondering if it's actually no big deal?

44,pygy36,1632997465,Women: don't date your male friends. They don't view you as girlfriend material,"I've seen so many posts in here lately from women asking about advice on how to make a move on their male friends and asking if their male friends are interested.

Ladies, I know that this isn't what you want to hear but its absolutely essential that you hear it and keep it in the back of your mind so that you can avoid making mistakes and getting your heart broken.

Most situations where two people that have a platonic relationship and then try to advance into dating mode fails. Why? Because one part was never that invested to begin with. Thats where the friend part comes in.

Heterosexual men will keep around female friends, in the hope that there is a possibility for sex. Even if he is nice, caring, and gives you glimpses about being a really nice guy, he is doing this mostly to up his chances to get you in to bed. If you're fine with casual hook ups when this isn't a problem and you can stop reading further. However if you're hoping to develop a serious relationship with a male friend, keep reading.

So who are the women men befriend? Its usually the girl that maybe already has a partner so she isn't directly available to him, or the girl that he wouldn't really hit up when there's better alternatives, or the girl he doesn't really feel chemistry to but deems her to be acceptable as a sexual partner. He will orbit around these women, build a ""friendship"" that isn't really a friendship, just to get into her pants. This can go on for years. Many women say ""oh no he isn't like that, I've known him for years!"", but in truth the amount of years you've known each other makes no impact what so ever.

And then it happens. The female friend catches feelings, feels attracted, wants to pursue something, thinks he is serious about his interest, they have sex, he ghosts or stops showing interestand then everything falls apart. The girl starts blaming herself, asking what she could have done differently, if something is wrong with her, was he really just a jerk all this time? 

No. Nothing is wrong with you. Stop blaming yourself. You could be a 10 and he could still not view you as gf material.

Men don't befriend girlfriend material types of women. They don't really waste time on building a friendship with women they can see themselves with long term. If they find a woman they want to keep around for longer, they won't bother making her a friend. They will in 9/10 cases pursue her romantically depending on the situation.

Stop dating your male friends. It rarely ever works. It will only lead to heartbreak and confusion and you'll find yourself in a never ending loop of questioning yourself when there's actually nothing wrong with you in the first place.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pygy36/women_dont_date_your_male_friends_they_dont_view/

We talked about feelings and how he felt it was weird meeting someone during lockdown where we've been limited to just a few activities. Issue is he has fallen for me but needs more time to make a commitment. He wants us to do things together once lockdown ends but I can't help but feel this won't change how he feels. 

I'm not sure if it's wise to wait for someone who needs time, and essentially isn't convinced. I am also in love with him. We both spent about 4 hours crying over what we were and explained to him I felt he took me for granted and kept me at arms length by not opening up sooner. 

He was in a 7 year relationship that ended 1.5 years ago and I am his first relationship since. He's not sure if he feels scared to make a commitment because of his past or he doesn't know me well enough but we both agreed that initial spark was there and special and he explicitly said he wants to be with me. 

To add some background, he also moved cities just before we met and knows nobody here. I'm not sure if this is influencing his decision to want more time since he explained meeting me was completely unexpected. He is not using apps and we have been exclusive from day one.

Pretty much from Day 1 I hit it off with a girl in my flat. I'm not a particularly chatty guy having social anxiety myself but we seem to be able to talk for hours with no issue. One night we got particularly close, it's clear we're both really into each other but we both agreed that it's an awful decision to make. We're well aware this dynamic could make things in the flat very awkward very fast. The problem is that I don't think these feelings are going to go away. I need advice, I feel like my options at this point are to stay put in my accomodation, which will inevitably turn pretty awkward pretty quick, or ask my university if I can move to a different accomodation...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyhfeo/fallen_for_roommate_at_university/

53,pyhtk0,1633001254,GF told me after 6 years that she never actually wanted me,"I (24M) and my GF(24F) have already been together for 6 years, 5 of them living together. We always had some problems with sex. It seemed to me that she didn't feel like she needed/wanted it. I always thought it was connected with something external or that she needed time to get into it. 

Everything else in the relationship was perfect, except we were close to breaking up from time to time because I didn't want to be in the couple without any sexual interaction at all.

Now she is fighting depression and working with a therapist. She told me yesterday that she probably, never wanted me sexually, and I'm, probably, totally not of her type. But at the same time, she says that I'm 8/10. She said that she has fantasies about other guys, which turns her up, but not me. At the same time, she doesn't want to break up (reunited after 1-month ""pause""). We feel good living together and being a couple, we plan the future together and feel inspired by such dreams.

But after all... I feel upset because of it. Half of me wants to believe that she might change after curing depression, changing birth control pills, discover herself more (she always had problems with masturbation). Another half of me thinks that I'm wasting my youth. 

The most disappointing thing to me is that she sends me ""mixed signals"" occasionally. For example, she said two days ago that ""maybe she feels something to me but very rarely."" Also, I remember our first year. We didn't have classic sex (the doctor advised her to wait 1-2 years because of some health problems), but we couldn't get enough of each other. Now she seems not to remember that time and says that, maybe, she was just interested in new experience, but not in me directly.

For now, I'm waiting for her to fix all her health problems and, first of all - depression. Not gonna think about the future too much and will try not to lose self-confidence completely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyhtk0/gf_told_me_after_6_years_that_she_never_actually/
54,pyhvo1,1633001495,Are these pre-dating red flags?,"We matched on a dating app and we sent greeting messages then I sent ""your profile was pretty much blank, tell me more about yourself"" and she did not reply, for three months.
When she did I mentioned jokingly it took her a while to reply. She said she had no idea what I was talking about. 

She gave me a name for messenger and it was an obvious nonsense name. She told me the name on the app is her real name, a quick google showed the name belonged to a low-rank sportswoman, all match stats and team lineups but no photos. 

I thought adding her to messenger would mean more communication. The first day had a bit of back and forth but then she said she liked me and I laughed it off when she asked if I liked her too by sending: ""I'm trying not to like anyone too much before meeting them lol""
Then onwards she routinely messaged me in a certain pattern. Wave emote in the morning, status update in the afternoon and a ""xxxx"" in the evening. At first I thought wave emote meant she was free to chat. I would reply with a question on how she was or whatever she was up to. These were seen but largely lacking in reply. If she did respond it was always short: Good. Alright. Not much.

I knew from that first day that she is unemployed and living with parents ""at the moment"" but could still be busy. At one stage she told me she goes to sleep at 8pm so that explained her not being online at night.

After she did not send any message for a day and a half I sent a message: I thought we would of talked more, you are probably busy and it seems like you are not interested.

She replied immediately that she was trying not to get too carried away by catching feelings and getting hurt. We sent some selfies back and forth, all the ones she sent I noticed were past profile photos on her fb. I think she does not know I can see them on her profile. She probably thinks they are hidden like content.

All her past profile photos have thirsty comments on them from guys with Indian or Arabic names. 
Her profile has 300+ friends, mostly foreign men.
Three of her friends are just her other profiles in the same name.


At this point, both names she has given me are fake and her behaviour seems distant. My mate suggested to invite her on a date to ask her about herself face-to-face. What's the odds she is awkward or uncomfortable with messaging?

59,pyine8,1633004541,Girl told my sister that I'm 'Quite Cute' - Friendzoned or is there more to it?,"**Context**:

I’m (24m) with absolutely no dating experience and minimal contact with any females outside of workplace colleagues – sad I know!

Some of my sister’s friends came to visit and so we all went out for lunch together (Including me and my sister there were 4 guys and 2 girls). I then went back to work and later met them for dinner. Later that evening my sister told me that her friend said I was ‘quite cute’ when asked what she thought of me.

\- When I met everyone, I introduced myself and shook everybody’s hand to which she responded with a “Hi” 

\- She was rather shy and initially didn’t speak to me – slowly I began to initiate a conversation with her and she seemed to relax a little although I spent most of the time speaking with the 3 guys who were sat closer to me.

\- During lunch I was occasionally looking at her and on two occasions she caught me looking and we locked eyes and smiled

\- She added me on Facebook during lunch

\- When I left for work, I shook everybody’s hand and she specifically told me that she would prefer a hug – I obliged 

\- I was late to dinner and so she was already seated hence no handshake/hug

\- After dinner my sister and the 3 guys headed to a bar – me and the girl left. I shook everybody’s hand and I walked her to her car. It was a 20-minute walk during which she slowly opened up and we had what I felt was a good conversation – I was initiating the conversation, asking questions which she would answer and she would occasionally ask me a question. We hugged before leaving – she also hugged the other guys although all 3 guys were just normal friends of hers.

\- Once she got home, she messaged me on Facebook thanking me for walking her to her car and we had a little small talk which ended with a goodnight.

I think I like her but I don’t want to say/do anything that'll potentially jeopardise my sisters friendship.

**Questions**:

Is she interested in me or am I seriously overthinking things?

Does she simply view me as a friend hence why she was kind towards me?

She didn’t ask me many questions during our conversation, is that because of her shyness or rather a lack of interest?

I cracked a joke with a non aggressive tone and said ""you say you don't like his attention but you're looking for attention."" And I laughed not too crazy though.

71,pykfga,1633010570,Do any decent methods of online dating actually exist?,"Online dating, as many will tell you, is a mixed bag. I've personally not had a great experience with it: it feels like every dating app is built to take all of your money and never actually get you a date. Those few likes I have received have been from bots, people in ridiculously remote locations or people who I am incompatible with.

I've tried tons of apps: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OKCupid, Badoo, PoF, just to name a few. I've generally felt that all of these are built around a system of giving you a few likes when you first install them, which turn out to be fake in some way, and then forcing you to pay to keep interest in you up. It's literally a scam and I don't use these apps anymore.

I've also taken a look at online dating communities such as r/r4r but many of these are out of my age range (I'm 18.)

I'm genuinely convinced at this point that the entire online dating scene, apps or not, is a waste of time and I shouldn't bother. So far I've already seen more girls I'm interested in just going out and starting hobbies like horse riding, and have actually had the opportunity to speak with them without a middle man asking me to pay.

We had one night stand. (I think its a ONS as I don't expect reoccurring sex from him. ) He was slightly more caring towards me after that. He made the food that I've mentioned before and he waited for me after work and he kissed me before he left.

**\[Questionable Behavior(s)\]**  
He came to check on me and saw I was eating cold food, he touched my bowl and said food should be eaten hot. He asked why and I told him I was busy hence I missed my lunch. He questioned what I was busy with.

He want me to make coffee, but not my colleagues. He would text me or I would ask. He would text he had reached home and asked if I'm home safely. He likes to look at me while he walked past and if we make eye contact with each other, he would smile at me.

*Honestly. I don't. It just happened naturally and we are both not drunk. We had reoccurring sex.*

**\[Is he insecure?\]**  
I ignored him because he said that he was tired and want massage *(sex)* I rejected him and told him that he thinks of me when he need sex, I told him I'm going to ignore him. He came into my cafe for a drink and said ""show off already? Never reply to my text?"" I told him ""I've already said I will ignore you. Your fault for not getting the message."" He spammed my mailbox asked if I'm truly ignoring him.

**\[Post Sex Activities\]**  
We cuddle and fell asleep after sex. He seems fine with me staying over. He did question me one night what time do I planned to go home. I jokingly told him if he doesn't want me to stay, I can leave. He shook his head and said no.

He ask about my life after sex and I playfully told him that he won't be seeing me and not to miss me. He asked how many days do I plan to work with school schedule. I replied I'm not sure, if he wants coffee he can ask my colleagues. He said in the morning he will be busy and won't have time to get it.

Im 20 and I'm in a relationship with this guy right.
We've been together for 3½ years now and I have entrusted him with everything. We even plan to live together and start travelling and all that.

And we also have this rule where we don't need to go into each other's phone's and stuff cause we trust each other. 
But for some time now there's been this girl he's hanging around and I have some really bad vibes about her. 

I told him that I dont trust her, but he keeps insisting that nothing is going on. So I said okay thats fine.
Because I dont like to restrict him from making outside connections.

But recently this feeling has been worsened. So I went into his Google photos (I shouldnt have done that I know and I regret it now) and I saw him getting reaalllyyy cozy with the same girl. 

He was laying alongside her in multiple pictures. Of course there were other friends there, but it really seemed like they were a couple in those pictures.

And I also saw a p*rn video on his phone about another girl (that I have never seen) and the guy in the video seemed like him. I didn't see a face but based off of body parts it kinda does seem like him. I might be wrong but just putting it out there.

PS: I have very strict parents so im hardly allowed to go out (especially now during Corona), but he does go out often with his friends.

I want to confront him about it, but im not sure how. I might be too dense to notice something out of the ordinary, but this is my first relationship so I dont have that much knowledge about it.

78,pyl454,1633012674,did he mean it or just being polite (18F) (21M),"So this week I went in tinder to find someone to hook up with(my first time doing this, i was horny). I matched with this guy who’s only in town for a few more days but visits bc he has family here.

So we meet up at this park and have some wine that he bought. (i’m in europe) Then we go and lay down in the grass somewhere and end up making out and going to second base.  But there’s people around so we walk around for a bit and we’re like holding hands and stopping to make out them we go back to the park to a more secluded area. Things happen (if yk what i mean) and he was very unselfish and giving xD. 

Then we get spooked and leave and he didn’t get to finish (neither did i, and i apologized) but then we sat somewhere and cuddled some and he was kissing me on the cheek and being a bit boyfriendy . he even asked me to get a selfie of us. (this is all AFTER the sex) i feel like he could’ve left but he stayed, until i said i had to go. and he mentioned that we can see eachother again when he comes back to visit (which he will bc his family is here) or if i go to his city (a major city that i want to visit in the near future.) if i was down to do so. and I said “yeah if i have an apartment”

so then i left and i kissed him bye. and went our separate ways, it was like 4 am. he didn’t walk with me to the bus station (which he’s not obligated to cuz he’s not my boyfriend)

I texted him like a day later and thanked him for a nice time and he said he enjoyed also. i liked the message then he said that he hopes we meet again when he comes back to my city. 

i told him “yeah definitely, let me know whenever you come back” and he said “sure” maybe i’m just overthinking but that “sure” sounds like a “yeah we aren’t joking up again”

am i right or am i just overthinking

tldr; hooked up w a guy from tinder, want to make it FWB thing whenever he visits. i texted him first and told him i had fun and he said he did too and that he hopes we meet again. then i told him to lmk when he’s back in town and he said “sure” now i’m overthinking the sure",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyl454/did_he_mean_it_or_just_being_polite_18f_21m/

\- first is this a weird age gap? i just feel its two different stages of life where I've had a stable job and she is still in college hoping to go to grad school.

\- we started texting 2 days ago where it seems i am asking questions and she is responding but no leading to her asking questions back at me. I knew this was originally a bad sign but she basically asked me to go on a date with her today. Is this a bad indicator for a bad date since she doesnt asks me questions via text? Is this too fast to ask on a date? Or can this be she is bad at texting and rather have a conversation in person? Like, i barely know much about her or what or where she would want to go for the date? Is it ok to ask where she would like to go or just decide on a place myself?

(she also lives an hour from me )

\- is it weird to ask to facetime before we do our first date to decide on where to go (see her) or should i have a plan in mind and just converse over text?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyl6pi/me_m25_advice_for_first_date_f20/

82,pylb2p,1633013268,How do people stop looking for love,"
I’m 21 years old and yet to have a serious relationship. I know that might be normal at my age but I’m probably one of the few women who want something serious and long term at my age. I haven’t had the best luck with the people I’ve been around. I’ve always attracted the wrong type of people and they have all left me a little more traumatized than I was. But recently I’ve been in therapy and I have a whole new mindset. I’m trying my hardest to love myself and recognize my worth and not take anymore shit. 

For the longest time I’ve been telling myself that I can’t possibly love someone else when I don’t love myself. So I’ve sworn off relationships for a while, but my therapist tells me that doesn’t have to always be the case. That’s I’m deserving of love and I don’t have to close myself off completely. But everyone keeps saying to stop looking and love will find you. I don’t understand that, how do people stop looking? How do people stop longing for that meaningful connection with another person? I can’t, I want something like that, someone who will understand me and value me and treat me like I’m a person and not an object. 

I’m not in dating apps or anything so I guess I have the not looking part down. But how do you expect to meet anyone outside of that. I tried dating apps a while ago again and they have really gone to shit, I realized I don’t have the energy to keep up with talking to multiple people at a time. I became one of those people who ghost and stop talking after a while. I realized it wasn’t good for my mental health… and I’m in an okay space right now and didn’t want to jeopardize that. 

How do you expect to meet people, and i supped to wait till I’m completely healed before I try again. Being that is an unrealistic expectation, everyone has something going on right? Does that mean I should stop trying. Is it bad that I want this so bad, not bad enough I’m willing to just date anyone. I want something real. 

TL;DR I’m sick of people telling me to stop looking for love, when it’s something I’ve always been longing for. Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pylb2p/how_do_people_stop_looking_for_love/

84,pyldw6,1633013499,UPDATE: My bf (20M) just broke up with me (20F) and now idk what to do,"Welp, I’m back on this account a month later to give you guys an update, it’s not exactly a happy one unfortunately. 

So my ex and I were talking last night and he said “Hey so listen, There was another reason i dont wanna be in a relationship. All the other stuff was right. But also it was because the ""flame"" died out. I guess. I just sorta fell outnof love i guess. Im not shitting on our friendship or anything its just how it is. I just changed and stopped caring of things. I dont know how but my love just faded away. As time passed i just stopped. My crush slowly faded. Now i just dont feel happy in general. Im not confused. Im nit stressed. I just got over you and everything else.“
We talked things out a bit more and I asked him if what he said about wanting to marry me someday and all of that was a lie. He said no, but he felt he was going too fast. He feels like he isn’t deserving of the life that I wanted us to have. 

Something I forgot to mention in my first post was that we had been on and off a few times in the past, not stuff having to do directly with the other or our behavior, but just life circumstances getting in the way. Anyways, I asked him if he ever loved me at all, and if I was ever anything more than a crush to him, he said “ Yeah. Then as a year past, with the on and off parts of the relationship it kinda wore out.”

All that’s fair I suppose. I’m not angry at him, he’s not angry at me, he didn’t say any of this in a mean way or anything like that.

I guess I just feel kind of stupid or embarrassed to myself. For the past month, I’ve been telling myself that “Oh he’ll be back, he just needs some time to get stuff in order. He’s still in love with me, I just know it.” Other people were saying this too, so I figured I was right. Giving myself a bit of hope because I didn’t want to think of the worst case scenario. I never really get my hopes up for much, because if I get my hopes up and things don’t go the way I want, I just get disappointed. 

I think deep down I knew the truth, I just didn’t wanna believe it. I was in denial, I was naive, I was a lot of things. I’d heard of this kinda stuff happening to other people, but I never thought it’d happen to me. I was wrong, as usual. 

I wish he would’ve said all this a month ago, but I understand why he didn’t. I’m not mad at him. I just wish things were different. But I know that’s impossible, I can’t change how he feels about me, about himself, no matter how much I want to. The best we can to do is be the bestest of friends, maybe that’s what we were destined to be all along.

We still love each other, just as friends though. I think a small part of me will always be in love with him, I think most people do when stuff like this happens. I can’t speak for him, but I’d like to think he feels the same. 

I asked him if he thinks he could ever be with someone else, he said “I don’t know”. He has a lot going on, and probably will for a long time, so maybe relationships just aren’t for him. At the end of the day, I just want him to be happy. He’s the best guy I’ve ever met and he deserves happiness just as much as I do.

At least now I know I actually can be loved by someone. No man had ever loved me before him. I dated a guy before him, but turns out he never loved me at all and was just using me. 

I want to love again, but I don’t want to rebound right away or anything. I wanna move on eventually, but right now I don’t think I can do that just yet. I have anxiety disorder so it’s difficult for me to meet people irl. Tinder is a thing I’ve considered before but as an asexual, I’m not a huge fan of the hookup culture on there, not to mention I’m scared of getting murdered or something lol.

So yeah that’s the update, I’d like to hear your guys’ thoughts. You can call me an idiot for not listening to reason or to the other people in my previous posts for all I care.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pyldw6/update_my_bf_20m_just_broke_up_with_me_20f_and/

87,pylveo,1633014910,How to increase your value,"Your communication skills/game basically meaning how funny and interesting you are. Then comes your dressing sense and your height and next comes your social circle and are you already friend with high value girls/people.

I would like to expand on each of it

* Communication skills/game
   * This is by far the most important thing, you could just wear $10 dollar white shirt and pant and look like a decent guy and if you have good communication and game you you're willing to let go of your ego, you could be best friends with the *any* hot girl(s) you want
* dressing sense
   * You don't need to wear gucci and shit like that, just good colors and well fitting clothes would do wonder and what you wear also affects your confidence so I say its a good thing to do so.
* Height
   * I guess this is kind of like hierarchy things people, I guess most men have good height these days and if you lag this area, try to compensate by working on other areas
* long term value(permanent value indicator)
   * intro: so most men these days usually focus on short term value indicator like posting good photos on IG or creating reels about their looks and buying the latest phone and things like that and focus on this main things
   * College/Marks
      * f
   * Job/money/career
      * All this mainy mean the same thing and money is money and people always want more of it, what I am saying is the way you make money has and what it gives you like (house, cars), don't go behind money instead find a career path which you're interested in and find out how to make loads of money on it and go incrementally, dont think that starting a business is the only way to have lots of money. Make it long term and keep it realistic.
      * For me I want to be a software engineer
   * Overall fitness
      * Women by nature choose strong and muscular men, just reaching 23-24 bmi index mostly by  muscle and you would be good to go",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pylveo/how_to_increase_your_value/
88,pylwil,1633015001,My first date ever.,"I've read some posts on this subreddit, and things are pretty wild here compared to my story. But here it goes.

I (18,M)  am going on my first date ever. I am a high schooler, and I have had a crush on this girl for about half a year now. I didn't really approach her because if my looks was to be compared to the JV2 basketball team of some school in North Dakota, she is to be compared to the NBA. Recently, there was this big party that both her and I were invited to. We drank and had little conversations, and I thought things were going ok. Then the cops suddenly came because of the noise, and we all had to leave very abruptly. Luckily, some of her friends and I were fleeing in the same direction. We said our goodbyes as I got a taxi with my friends, and she went on a taxi with some of hers. 

This was when things turned a little awkward for me. One of my friend and one of her friend was pretty close, and they made a phone call while we were in the taxi. Then my friend told me that somehow my crush found out that I was liking her. I thought it was over and was ready to give up.

But 4 days after the party, she gave me a text, and we started texting. We texted, and I eventually asked her to hangout during Saturday to visit this studio ghibli art exhibition. I am super excited, but more than excited, nervous. I asked some of my friends for advice and all they told me was to not act stupid and don't make my bad jokes. 

I would really appreciate some more detailed advice in how to make this thing work out. But more importantly, both her and I are very introverted and shy, so I want some advice on how to make a very fluid and meaningful conversation with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pylwil/my_first_date_ever/

90,pym9mr,1633016081,My bf is not like other guys I’ve dated:/,"I’ve (24f) been dating my bf (28m) for a couple of months, and I can’t help but notice that we have a different dynamic than I’m used to.

I’ve had several bfs in the last few years, and most of them were very very nice. They let me have everything my way and went above and beyond in the relationship. I felt like I could get away with a lot (not that I’d do anything bad). They were very attentive to my feelings and needs. 

But my new bf, who I really like a LOT, are very different from those guys.
1) he’s not as “attentive” to my feelings as my exs. If I get upset about something, he usually just lets me be instead of trying to talk/console me out of it. If I get upset about something, he’s more inclined to tell me that life isn’t perfect and that I need to control my own feelings than to console/baby me. I know it sounds stupid but I guess I almost expect my bf to really care about my feelings ? 

2) If I want to do something/ask him to do something but he doesn’t want to, he won’t do it. My exs in the past were always doing things for me. For eg, I’d ask them to bring me something/do me a favor, they’d almost always do it. But my bf doesn’t if he’s not feeling it. 

3) he doesn’t pay for everything. Most guys I’ve dated have paid for 80-90% of our dates/etc, but I’d say he pays about 60-70% of the time. I always offer to pay and he lets me. He paid 100% for the first month ish of us dating. Most guys I’ve dated never really let me pay for stuff. We both make good money (he makes more) so I don’t mind, but I wonder if this is an indication of him being less committed.

I guess overall, he’s more cold and less accommodating than the other guys I’ve dated. I don’t know if I was just spoiled before, but I can’t help but feel like he’s only giving me 50% when I want 100%. 

He always tells me that “In the entirety of the relationship, you can’t always get what you want in that moment.” Basically tells me to look big picture and not get upset about little things.

Is it normal to be this way? I feel like our relationship is good overall. Is it a bad sign that  he’s not as accommodating? Could he still really care for me and take me seriously?

My goal is just to have fun, I hope it clicks coz I haven't seen her after the first time which was in the supermarket. The friendship is built online, but I got this!
