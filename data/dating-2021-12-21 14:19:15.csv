2,rlnjr7,1640118877,Guy I like cried while cuddling,"We met about 6-7 weeks ago. We’ve met up 7 times now and each time since our first date has been a 24 hr + period of spending time at apartments and going exploring. We’ve done a variety of activities together and we’ve each met at least one friend of the other’s so far. 

On our 7th time together, after sex, and right after getting ready to go to sleep which we were now in bed and cozied up, he was telling me about his dog he used to have who died a little over 5 years ago. He mentioned the dog to me before not first time I learned about her. He told me it was traumatizing to have to give his dog (a shared dog from a previous relationship with someone he doesn’t talk to anymore) back to his ex when he moved cities. And that the dog died without him being physically near her. And that his ex keeps a photo of the dog’s dog rage as some profile picture somewhere (he said that he found that traumatizing because the dog is more his  Andre was closer with the dog [is what I got from why that bothered him]) 

While cuddling and telling me about this in the dark I could tell he was tearing up and sniffling a lot. It was obvious he was crying. I had recently hit my dab pen before falling asleep and didn’t expect this depth to come out at this moment. I tried to be there for him, cuddled him more intensely and gently massaged him in a comforting way. He sincerely thanked me while cuddling me really tightly and I let him know that I knew how hard it is to lose a dog. (I do know). I wanted to make sure I didn’t make it in turn about me so I let him have the floor to share so to speak. He apologized for talking so much when we said it was bedtime but I told him that I find him really relaxing to listen to and that it’s nice to listen for a change since I usually share/talk a lot. And I thanked him for sharing something so deep with me.

I actually really like him and find his confidence intimidating at times. 

Did I handle this situation alright and to what degree does it mean he likes me if he is willing to be this vulnerable with me? 

I felt like my voice wasn’t in as calm of a mode as his was and I was in a robotic mode being post sex, post dab pen and exhausted from our adventures we did during the day- but I don’t think he noticed or minded.

4,rlnvu7,1640119856,How to stop being so smitten after a first date?,"Last week, I (23M) was set up with a girl (22F) by a mutual friend. We’d texted a fair bit before and I thought she seemed sweet, interesting and very attractive, but I didn’t have much expectation of a romantic connection. However I was blown away by her on the evening; I’m always pretty good at holding conversation but she was so much more engaging, funny and open than typical first date small-talk. We spent nearly 6 hours together and I walked her home, goodbye hugs and a bit of friendly touching but no kiss. 

Now it’s been nearly a week and I still can’t stop thinking about her. I know she’d like to meet again and I’ve received a text from our mutual friend that sort of implied that she saw at least some sort of romantic potential in me (although maybe I read too much into it). My problem is that I won’t be able to see her again for a while, she lives in the city I used to live in (3 hours away from me now) but she’s from another country and is back visiting family over Christmas. And who knows what restrictions they may put on international travel in the new year. 

I feel like if I don’t pull myself together then I’m going to end up thinking about her for weeks and weeks and go into our eventual next meet-up with way too high hopes for what would only be a second date. I need some advice on how I can calm myself down, lower my expectations and not think about her so much.

I stayed for a few hours longer after and we talked. I came over the next day too and basically the same thing happened. The conversations were pretty personal. He asked me about my dating experiences and we had a laugh about my horrible dates. We talked about our families and college. He asked me if I had any “simps”. Stuff like that.

8,rloo3p,1640122128,Walk away or sit through what is likely slow and more painful heartbreak?,"Writing this all down is probably better than starring into the fireplace feeling sorry for myself. It’s kind of unwritten rule to state this so 17M myself and 18F her. 

I somewhat recently began an entirely online relationship with a girl I’ve known for a handful of years. It kinda began over the summer. She just started messaging me every night usually between 11-2am just to simply chat or what not. Throughout the next couple months our completely normal chats would grow in frequency to the point that we were talking to each other throughout every day and every night. One of her friends at work even dubbed me her, “not boyfriend” due to how much of her free time at work was spent messaging me. 

This kinda put in our heads the idea of a relationship and we’d somewhat discuss it neither really saying much about it. I had in the past made clear my extreme prejudice towards long distance relationships due to every example I’ve witnessed in my life going down in flames (ahaha foreshadowing). Despite this one night right before one of us had convinced which ever one was being stubborn to finally sleep she asked me straight to the point how I felt about her. I told her that I didn’t know and that there was something there, but it didn’t feel like it usually did when I fell for someone, no real fire. I asked her back and she gave a similar answer of uncertainty on her feelings. I woke up the next morning and pretty much immediately realized that I liked this girl I had in the past literally scoffed at the idea of falling for. It took a week to find the courage, but similar as before when one of us was about to finally sleep I asked her if she wanted something more than a friendship. After a bit of back and forth plus a complete misunderstanding of how four square works we ended up agreeing to explore what, “more” could mean. 

Fast forward a bit and we’ve discussed it more. Agreed to keep mutuals unaware of the relationship because it would make things more fun for us, avoid making people feel like third wheels and if this immediately failed we could more easily go back to normal. I had kinda refused to use the titles of boyfriend and girlfriend until we had the opportunity to actually meet up. Eventually though after some convincing and her I guess, “officially” asking me out on a date I relented. 

Then one night as we’re discussing her looming finals she says that she’s having a bit of an identity crisis. I quickly ask what’s up and she says that she thinks she’s Aromantic. A concern she’d somewhat hinted in the past when discussing her mother asking her if she was lesbian. Immediately my mind starts racing with questions and we discuss it a bit. She’s unwilling or unable to really put her thoughts into words so I encourage her to talk to someone other than me seeing as it might be more difficult to explore those feelings honestly with me compared to someone else. She ends up deciding to ask a gay friend of our’s who had earlier on learned of the relationship. She wanted to ask him because he might offer good insight. I decide not to press it until both of us were on break and she didn’t have to worry about finals. After a couple days of waiting I finally ask the question that had been killing me. If she was what would that mean for us. She fills me in a bit on how discussion with our gay friend went and puts her feelings into words. I tell her that I want a romantic relationship with her and that if she doesn’t feel the same way I don’t want to be with someone like that. She asks if we can take a month long break so she can put her head together and we agree despite my misgivings. 

Now I sit after a couple days frustrated, angry, confused and sad unsure what to do. I feel lead on and screwed over. A part of me wants to end it now because there’s no way it ends well. Another part of me refuses to walk away from this no matter the unlikelihood of continuation.  I more just wanted to vent to the void, but thoughts are appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rloo3p/walk_away_or_sit_through_what_is_likely_slow_and/

14,rlpazm,1640123985,Why compromises are known to be important in relationships?,"I really don't understand it. It is often mentioned that boundaries are important and so are compromises in a relationship. However, when we make too many compromises, we eat away our boundaries and if we do it too much - our sense of self.

Why do I see advice everywhere regarding compromises being key to the relationship? Why can't relationship be built on respect for boundaries without the need for compromises? Why can't we do everything we truly want in relationships? Why can't we accept what the other person doesn't want to do and not give them the option of compromising (by doing)? Watching a barbie show with your girlfriend you don't like, watching a football game with your boyfriend you don't like, going to a certain concert you don't enjoy etc.

Of course this doesn't apply to things that are agreed upon to sustain a living - doing housework, payments etc. This is more regarding the communication and activities. Why can't relationship consist of two people who do what they actually want and meet in the middle where they do things for each other they both enjoy?

A relationship where both people never compromise and do what they want to do sounds perfect to me! It's based on pure honesty and can be done with love and respect for the other. You never do what you don't want to and you shouldn't feel pressured just because that would make the other party happy. You never do something with another that they don't enjoy. You do things together/for the other/for yourself that you both enjoy.

I've been trying this approach in my relationships, but I'm yet to find such person. I never insist on doing something the other party doesn't fully enjoy. However when it comes to the point where I have to compromise and respectfully refuse - I'm met with upset feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rlpazm/why_compromises_are_known_to_be_important_in/

Online dating hasn’t worked. Not that it matters much anyway because the place for people with disabilities that I live at wouldn’t let me meet them anyway.  Online dating yielded no results prior to my current living situation though.

Work would be a way to meet people but I don’t have a job at the moment (long story).

I do archery so I could meet someone through that I guess.

Inside that, we’ve seen each other multiple times a week, stayed at each other’s, even went on a short weekend away. I know I’m pretty into her &amp; I would like to think she’s quite into me, but I suffer with anxiety particularly with regards to rejection, which sometimes makes me question it but I think it’s unreasonable.

She’s headstrong and confident, I am also confident and appear very relaxed on the surface. 

On a night out, after a few drinks, we agreed exclusivity but on a separate occasion (drunk and in bed, post sex), I had outlined that I quite like her and been a bit rebuffed with a “stop talking” sort of comment but we still are seeing each other, dating &amp; even did a trip away.

This is going to sound odd from a 25 year man and probably is ultimate cringe but in previous relationships, the other person has usually brought it up after a few weeks and I have no idea how it works really…

Do you ask someone if they want to be your girlfriend? Or is that weird? Did I miss a memo?

But he has a long distance gf who he's been dating for almost 2 years. But now that he moved away from her, they are still dating. I Don't know in details about their relationship cus he never says much about it. 
What i realize now a days is It's kind of weird how much invested he is with me. Since, I'm a single girl, the kind of boundary a guy with gf should have, he doesn't have it. He texts me almost everyday, accompanies me to grocery, shops &amp; everywhere with or without the group. Sometimes he suggests hangouts just us too. &amp; 3 days ago i got very drunk &amp; felt kinda sick, so he came to my house &amp; took care of me without me asking for it. We walked around the town till 3 Am because he wanted to walk. But he never flirts with me by the definition of flirt. He just spends a lot of time with me &amp; cares for me beyond anything!

38,rlsg5h,1640133136,Why does it seem only shitty men have no problem attracting women?,"This is probably going to come off as incelly and foreveralone but I don’t care. 

I was at the gym today changing after swimming and there was a group of four guys talking about their girlfriends. All complete assholes. One was talking about how his ex would be nothing without his child support money and she gets more money from him than she does working, another was saying how he’s only with his girlfriend of two years because she’s a “consistent hole”, the third was making racist comments about him being the only white guy his girlfriend has been with, and the fourth guy just kind of sat there egging them on. 

As I was sitting there listening to this all I could think of was 1.) how are these guys not completely embarrassed to be talking about women/dating like this 2.) what would they say if their mothers heard them 3.) why does it seem men like this have no issue attracting, getting, tricking, sleeping with, whatever you want to call it, with women?  

Is having this kind of personality really what it takes? I can’t possibly believe they hide it that well from women. Maybe I’m just naive. 

I’m 26 and I’ve never had a girlfriend. I can’t possibly see myself changing into that just to get into a relationship. It isn’t wanted anymore nowadays but my mom (no I’m not a momma’s boy) raised me to treat women old school, open doors, don’t curse, always offer to pick her up, etc. so it just doesn’t make sense to me.

39,rlsnxr,1640133798,Am I screwing up kissing on a first meeting?,"So like many, I've (31M) got on the online dating train, primarily Facebook dating. I've met I think a dozen girls on there so far, after filtering through what feels like hundreds.   None of these meetups have resulted in anything relationship wise, other than it looks like I've made one new friend.  
What has happened on about half of these first time meets is, we have a great time. Good conversation. Fun activities. I try to get to know them on a deeper level than surface stuff. We stay out later than we should.  
The attraction is there so there's hand or arm holding, and inevitably we kiss.  
Then a second meeting never happens. Perhaps we get caught up in the moment, perhaps we've moved too fast, perhaps me or her are starved for affection, either of which can somehow make her turned off the next day. The excuses I've got are, you're not what I'm looking for, you remind me of my ex, the connection just fizzles, or just straight up ghosting.   
It's hard for me not to go for the kiss if I'm feeling it. Part of me thinks if I don't do it, she'll think I don't like her. But another part says hold off it's too soon. Most of my relationships started this way, albeit never from online.   
I remember a girl I went out with twice, I went for the kiss on the second date and she smiled and gave me her cheek. It was actually really cute and certainly kept my interest. Maybe I'm being too easy lol.

Now, couple of days after the date (meanwhile we continued talking and even had plans to meet again), she said that she had lot of stuff to do in her studio and she probably doesn’t want to continue our contact.
Ofc I asked her what’s going on and so on and so forth. And she said it is bcs „our good conversation is turning into something more“ and at that time she can’t respond to that.
I said that I would be okay with that, if we just continue our contact and then see what happens. And she said, it would be a good idea. But after a while she just stopped responding… 

Do you think it is worth writing her again? Maybe she really was on a lot of stress bcs of her art exhibitions?

We both noticed this and talked about how much of a bummer it was. But that didn’t really change anything. We’ve been texting all day for a week almost and yesterday began talking on the phone and FaceTiming. Today she FaceTimed me twice while on her break from work just because it was easier than texting

She called me while she was on a 10 min break. And we kinda just sat in silence while looking at each other haha. Obviously we talked a little about what I was doing. Etc.

He's the most amazing, handsome manly awesome guy I've ever met.

When he first moved in he told me he didn't have a girlfriend and he asked me out a couple times (though at the last minute) and invited me into his room to cuddle. He spent a couple WHOLE nights cuddling with me and I was wrapped in his arms and it was the best thing ever.

This guy has a room right next to mine. However, eventually I heard him on the phone talking to another woman and it turns out he's been on/off with this girl for the past 2 years. There are photos of them at the beach and going on dates on Facebook, dating back to 2019.

I guess they were fighting when he first moved in and that's why he cuddled. However, now they are back on STRONG and his girlfriend drives an hour to see him, and she is basically over our house every other night. 

In fact, she was over the WHOLE weekend (I could hear them in his room next door) and she left, but he just called her and told her to come back...so now she's over here ANOTHER night.

I want to tell him how lonely and left out and abandoned I feel, and I wish I could get him to like me again. No one knows how painful it is to just be in my room alone, looking at losers on dating apps when all I want is the guy with a room next door to me. What should I do?

This is also majorly hurting my self esteem because I'm RIGHT next door to this guy and yet he waits for this girl to drive all the way down and she has more stuff she can talk about with him because she's from his hometown, went to high school with him, etc.

69,rlvjpb,1640142761,Breaking up sucks.,"There were legitimate reasons for the break up. I couldn't be what she needed, she wasn't what I needed. I never wanted to be involved with a kid, her kid was the most important thing to her. She had been acting strange and distant the past two visits, and affection I showed was not reciprocated, it was like cuddling a brick wall. I finally called her out tonight, she said she didn't want to have this conversation until after Christmas. My anxiety being what it is that was a no go, I would have just been a nervous wreck for the next week. I pushed the issue, and we broke up. It was a good thing, it's what i wanted and what we needed. So why does it hurt so much? I kept saying I was sorry but it didn't absolve me. She left telling me to grow up and that I was only trying to get her to make me feel better, which felt uncalled for and hurt me. Probably what helped me be ok with her leaving. This is a good thing, we'll see that some day. This was the first time I've ever broken up with someone. It sucks, I hate it. I can't help but feel like I hurt her, we fell hard and fast for each other and that's probably why we overlooked these issues in the first place. But this was a good thing. Breaking up is terrible.

I’m a homebody. Not because I’m reclusive but because I enjoy my space, my corner of the world and not space from anyone. I love to create. I spend time in my garage n putter around making things out of wood. Tinkering with a dune buggy for my kids. Recently purchased a 3d printer to experiment with. Examples aside, here is my question. How do you go about inviting someone into your world when work and grocery shopping are the only reason you care to leave? I feel like going out simply for the hope I’d meet someone is a futile exercise.

It's kind of large, from top to bottom the frame is ~11 inches. It was originally planned to smaller, but then I found that frame and couldn't help myself.

For bonus fun anxiety I mentioned I was excited to give her her gift and it sounded like she was taken off guard by us exchanging gifts. That's the main driving factor for this post existing.

I’m in public health and a lot of my work focuses not on biology but interventions in health. And I wasn’t sure how it worked  cause this isn’t my area of expertise I’ll admit I don’t know the whole biological transmissibility after quarantining. And to this he said “I should be smarter than this”. I guess to imply I’m dumb for not knowing this stuff.

There hasn’t been too many times but I feel like he does these small slights when I maybe don’t know something that I guess I’m “supposed to know”. He apologized but honestly I’ve had men be constantly mean to me and I’m worried if I continue with him he might do this. I guess previous experiences have me jaded.

I’ve been on &amp; off friends with my ex since I cut it off 2 years ago to get well. I was a toxic person. He has been the one thus far to end the friendship then come back. We’ve been trying to see where it goes but he constantly tells me he’s not ready yet. He even said if his dad doesn’t accept me, he can’t be with me. I’ve made mistakes along the way but I never stopped trying. All this year until September he played mind games, then he of course came back and apologized. Trust was also broken through things I found out. I cut it off the other day bc I feel like I give more than I get back. My birthday was saturday, he had a funeral for his old coworker through suicide that morning. My ex’s brother lost his life that way years back. He also got into a car accident which lead him to only being able to drive back n forth to work(and funeral) until it was resolved. He said he wasn’t going to make it to see me but would make it up this week. I offered to get him uber rides to me. He declined, said he will still make it up. So later that night he told me he hung out with his boy which he walked to. (they live close by). His response to mine was “he’s a 10 minute walk” I understand the passing of the coworker impacted him but how would he walk over to his friend but not come to me when I offered ubers? So, that’s what drew the line for me. There was some other things involved. I’ve waited 2 years and he’s been the only person I’ve been with since I met him meanwhile he’s had 2 girlfriends in that time. I truly love him and made a lot of efforts. It’s really hard.

My family was very supportive of me when I came out as gay 7-8 years ago but they weren’t as supportive of me when my political values changed a few years back (this will be important later). Every guy I’ve gotten serious with has some issue that made me not want to bring him around my family. My most recent exes all had something about them that my family would not be accepting of. My most recent ex was two years older than me and we started dating when I was 17. My ex before that was from a low income house hold. These would be considered “red flags” to my family. Now I started talking to a guy who’s a year older than me but he’s white (which isn’t the issue at all) but he’s a far right republican and VERY open about his views. He also is VERY country. (He wears a cowboy hat,has a mullet and drives a pick up truck). He’s actually very sweet and super open minded but if I were to introduce him to my family they would freak out. One of my uncles called me a “bed wrench” when he found out I was no longer on the left so if he saw me with a guy who looks like that and has very conservative values he’d probably have a heart attack. I really like him and was thinking about inviting him over for Christmas but after thinking about all the crazy remarks my family would make I decided not to. 

I’m starting to wonder if the problem is I’m bringing and going for the wrong men or if my family is to overbearing.
