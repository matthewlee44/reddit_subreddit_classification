He told me in person right before we were to go out to a restaurant. I cried a lot and the past week has been really rough but he stayed with me and explained in further detail why he couldn’t be with me.

My dilemma right now is that for my birthday he took me to one of those cafes where you get to choose a piece of pottery and paint them. We both painted mugs for one another and it’s supposed to take 2 weeks for the place to varnish them and put them in the oven so they’ll be ready for pickup, which means as of this thursday they were ready. Because he paid for it and has the receipt, he has to be the one to go get them.

When he ended things with me I told him that I still wanted my mug and he kind of chuckled so idk if he thought i was kidding. I genuinely do want the mug he made for me and I want to know if it’s ok to text him and say something like “hey have you gotten the chance to pick up the mugs yet?”

Honestly where do I begin? I guess that it all feels so hopeless at this point, not just with this girl I’m with but just in general, going through Dating Advice there just seems to be MILLIONS and MILLIONS of reasons as to why somebody could lose interest in the span of a millisecond. It’s kinda scary to think about, and it happened to me, this girl I really did like! Everything was awesome at first, “sunshine and rainbows” you could say, there was so much emotion and passion and just all around doing the silly shit young love makes you do! Then one day…Poof! She stopped giving me that love and that emotion, I tried everything I could to understand her and hopefully relight the flame but it was out.  

I know that at this point she’s considered herself single for a couple of months but I’m still in denial about it, I still think we’re something, even though deep down I know we aren’t. I don’t understand what happened, some people say girls lose interest if things don’t move along sexually, and that’s a bit of a struggle for me since my sex drive isn’t the highest and so I’m more of a hugs, and cuddling on the couch type of guy. Then others have told me a whole list of reasons as to why she could’ve lost interest. It still caught me off guard though how things when from sweet to so cold so quickly. 

Honestly I tried talking to her about it, she usually avoids it or just tells me it wasn’t my fault and that she’s just scared of hurting me if she stayed together with me, but like she’s hurting me now by not staying?! Ugh I just don’t get it! I don’t think I was a bad bf, I  respected her decisions, I think I was fairly understanding and tried my best to make sure she was always ok, I always gave her affection and love, I feel like I’ve given her everything I could’ve offered, even when she was giving me 50%, I still gave her 110% of me! yet that still isn’t enough?

For context, I grew up middle-class in a suburb in the Midwest. I had a horrible education and ended up going to a halfway decent state school. I realized there from classmates that school could help in your success (seems obvious but…), so I worked hard that year and transferred into an Ivy. Since then, I’ve had internships with the best companies in Finance and Consulting, and will be working a six-figure job in NYC after graduation. I would also consider myself a jokester, extremely social, and very attractive. I know this all makes me sound like an asshole, but I want to try and explain things as bluntly as I can.

I’ve had two girlfriends, one the exact personification of the Midwest; a pretty, extremely sweet, simple girl. While I loved her, the relationship became strained because we couldn’t have entertaining conversation, which is important to me. My second girlfriend was from Miami; she was also gorgeous l, but additionally funny and we made great conversation. However, I felt she was almost too fiery and was downright rude to others at times, plus I realized in this relationship (now far in the progression of my career), I needed equal passion and success in my partner to motivate me, which she didn’t have.

As a result, I’ve been trying to exclusively find a partner through the filter of prestigious schooling, which I completely know isn’t full proof (I come from a shit education so I understand a school doesn’t make you), but it does heighten the bar for the qualities which seem to be hardest to find: intelligent/career driven. 

However, pairing this with also looking for someone social, funny, and gorgeous seems almost impossible. I met a singular person in the past year who fit all my criteria, but after a few dates found out she wanted something casual after a recent breakup.

What should I do? Lower the bar for one of my desired qualities? I’ve been considering not caring about looks anymore, but have found in the past that is required for me to feel fully invested in a relationship.

[ I’m on my phone so please excuse any grammatical errors ]

So about 3 months ago I (28/F) met a guy (30/M) randomly and we exchanged numbers after discussing a hobby we both like. After a few dates, he invited me over to his apartment for dinner so I went over there. 

His apartment is way to small for the amount of things he has (700sqft). I love plants so much and so does he but his plants take up HALF of his living room, there’s legit dirt from the plants everywhere. This isn’t the worst part because I have plants and know how it can be but then his kitchen ... I knowwww for a fact he hasn’t cleaned his oven in say months because I’ve gone back a few times and it’s still in the same condition. Dishes are never washed, and I noticed the same crumbs and stains everywhere every time I’ve gone back so it seems like he doesn’t clean. 

The other day, I went over for dinner again and tell me why while we were making dinner together, I found his phone inside of a pan filled with pasta and sauce?? The pasta was dry and so was the sauce but I thought it was the oddest thing ever because he was reading the ingredients from his phone, so he would pick it up and then put it back like it was normal???.. Thennn another time I went over again and I noticed while we were making dinner, we needed to make sauce so he decided to work on that part and I noticed he picked up a steel pan that had dried up sauce in it and then proceeded to make our sauce for that night inside there WITHOUT WASHING THE PAN. 

Now I don’t know, but I have my own apartment and sometimes fall back on dishes but still, I make sure I clean my oven and if I had dirty dishes that I needed to use, I would clean it before starting a new meal. 

He’s super nice, we get along, but I can’t get passed how messy he is. I’m trying my best to not judge him based off of his place because like I said, he’s great otherwise and we click which is why I continue to go hack. I get so grossed out but I still eat the food we make out of respect :( 

I noticed his breath smells like cavities (I hope you guys know what I mean by that) and he asked to kiss me and I said I wasn’t ready. I have a VERYYY sensitive sense of smell, so if I kissed him and smelled it I probably would’ve gagged in his face. I think he got the gist because his breath has been smelling better and we kissed. 

Am I overreacting by feeling like this shit is gross and might be a deal breaker?

To be honest I’ve learned quite a few things (you have to be somewhat good looking, the algorithms rank you based on activity, alot of the girls/women on the apps/sites lie about their looks for attention, they are made to keep you on the sites/apps etc).

So due to alot of those things, I just decided to delete everything and focus on other things for a while that way I’m not killing my mental health.

You see, even currently I’m still living with my parents, I’m unemployed, I’m working on getting my drivers license, and I even plan to start working out soon. I’m also trying to work towards my dream job.

And so with all of that confidence I thought to myself “you know what, I might be atleast good enough now to get matches but I can’t say for sure”. I’m also going to try meeting women in public too with online dating just being a side thing.

But I also still wonder if there is even a point in trying “online” again when I’m just going to get ranked low in the algorithm due to inactivity because of me being busy with other things.

I’m sure there is a subscription I can pay for but I just feel that would be a waste of money.

Idk what do you guys think? Should I try again?

Also just keep in mind that I don’t have many attractive pictures of myself, and idk how I’m supposed to get anymore.

This is my first.

So there is a one girl. We know each other cause she was on a ""party"" me and my friends had. We were talking and few days later i asked her to go hang out with me. She was into it and we started hanging out very often. Her friends also started hanging out with my friends and it was just like a crew getting bigger. She and i were still hanging out a lot like just two of us and i was like afraid to tell her that i really like her and eventualy i told her that but she couldn't say the same. She told me she can't fall in love but she really like me as a person. All of this was a bit weird to me cause we already made good friendship and she was still in our crew or whatever. I even tried to kiss her after that because there was some other party and that was just wrong, i know.

After that we didn't see each other a lot but still were friend and ocasionally texted. After some time things got normal and we were again hanging out together with friends and sometimes just two of us in a pub. 

So everything was great and now she actually wanted relationship. I was in as well and we were dating for like 2 weeks. We were kissing and hugging and all that but after some time i wasn't confident enough when to hug her or kiss her. It was killing me and i told her that and i knew i just had to not think about it but it was hard. It was all like forced. 

We broke up but still hang out in 'crew' ot how you call it. She told me there's no return but it's har for me to belive that. I have a feeling it is just not the right time. I habe to work on myself and be myself cause i was really puting lot of work in all of that. We texted like few days ago but she seems like she wants her peace but i don't want her to think i lost all my feeling for her and that i don't want to be just friends if we can't be in relationship.

Now i don't know if i should just get away from her or still show i care or what.

I had known this girl previously through a mutual friend.

So I went on a date with this girl back in November/early December. It is end of March now. I thought we had a great time (we went to a basketball game) - we were flirting and there was lots of physical touch, I walked her back and she had her arm around me. No kiss at the end, but she texted me later that night and we talked all the next day. In hindsight, I was kind of head over heels and was coming on too strong asking when I could see her again and not taking a break from texting her. It wasn't anything crazy (I didn't send like 10s of messages) but maybe came off as a little too much with the hourly texting. She eventually stopped responding. A week or two later I moved on, no problem.

I've been on multiple dates since that one, but the one I went on with her was just so good! Anyway, I weirdly enough, I saw her crossing the street the other day (we live on different sides of the city so that's wild) and it reminded me of the date we went on.

Would it be weird to reach out to her? Should I just be honest and say something like:

""Hey this is super random, but I was reminded of the game we went to a couple months back and how fun that was. I feel like I may have come on a little too strongly afterward. If you're interested, I'd love to get together again for a drink later this week.

Or

We actually work in the same industry/field. So I was thinking I could maybe randomly hit her up about connecting me with someone at her company and then after see if she would be receptive to further conversation after that?

The ONLY reason why I am even considering this is because times have changed and online dating is becoming more of the norm. Something that I haven't found much success with. I'm personally not a fan. I'm sure some people's opinions will be to just tell me to move on, but I've found that after college and with remote work on the rise it's been really hard to organically meet people. So I hope you understand where I'm coming from.

Let me know if you think it would even be worth it.

However, on our first date I discovered a bit about her life. I've been ignoring it since I really like being with her (and she likes being with me too!).

Mainly what concerns me is the fact that she sells photos of herself on onlyfans aaaand is addicted to cocaine.

The cherry on top is the fact that she is transgender. It was never a problem to me and I wouldn't state that in this thread, but after my brother got chocked when he met her by accident I thought it could demand a little more effort to keep her.

I really like her, but IMO it will be really hard to cope with all of it in the long run.

We’ve never even had that thing where either of us doesn't respond for like a week or even a few days, if we don't respond during the day the other one always goes like oh i’m sorry i’ve been super busy, i had so many classes or i was hanging out with my sister.

The problem is that pretty soon i know that we’re both moving pretty far away, in august he goes to the neighboring country to study and i’m also moving (not sure 100% where yet though) so i’m not sure if this is worth starting because both of us have our next 3-5 years so well planned and we know what we want to do and idk. Also, idk if he even likes me, i mean if he would be interested in anything at all and i mean more serious stuff because i do not want to be just some flirt. At the same time I feel mean for some reason, maybe because I'm nervous about asking him to meet up or not, idk. Anyway, what do you guys think i should do?

I’m 23F about to be 24 and haven’t even been close to being in a relationship. I wouldn’t even consider that the main problem. While I would like to be in one; it’s just dating in general that’s the main problem. 

I would say I’m physically average, short, dark hair with a medium build. (I’d rate myself a 6 or 7) Sometimes I’ll get glances or double takes in public but no one ever asks me out or flirts with me. If I do get asked out or flirted with it’s generally not someone I’m attracted to. It really sucks because I have never had anyone I’m attracted to like me back. It will usually just sizzle out without going anywhere past friendly flirting. No one I ever want wants me back and it just really hurts. 

I usually am not straight forward when it comes to how I feel because I have a huge fear of getting rejected. I understand this is normal however I have gotten rejected and stood up a lot in high school and in my early adult life so I’m still kind traumatized and scared of feeling ugly and unwanted. 

To add on, all my sexual experiences have also been bad and traumatizing. I also am still a virgin by society’s standards but have done just about everything. That also has an effect on me because I’m very self conscious about my body and it feels like I’m not even good enough to just have a friends with benefits. So I just feel ugly and all around rejected. I’m just really lost in what to do and how to stop feeling so crappy about it all the time.

I’m someone that has been through all the toxic stages within a relationship. And I dealt with all of these in one long relationship. Such as emotional manipulation, emotional abuse, gaslighting, exchange of insults, been cheated on, lied to and more. My past relationship was more than enough for me to know the type of relationship I wanted and also gave me better judgement of character with others so I knew who I’d want to be with. 

I finally got the girl of my dreams. Someone that always wanted to talk to me, someone that’s always there for me when I needed them to be, and also someone that resonates with me. She had been through the same traumatic relationship experiences as I am which made her understand me more. We could confide in each other when worried or afraid. I’d always give her closure when she thought I was doing such that her exes did. And she would also do the same. We would convince each other at the end of the day. 

There’s something that was just off. I had noticed that she would add me to her private story and remove me at random times. She has done this on Snapchat multiple times. About 3-4 times. Just to be clear, I had never asked to be on her story or not. She just added me. There was a time where we got into a misunderstanding and I had been completely removed and I brought it up and she told me that she had not removed me. She sent a screenrecording showing that she hadn’t and It showed I was still there but I didn’t believe because she could’ve added me when I brought it up. She then asked me “Why would she remove me?” She seemed genuinely confused. And that’s exactly what I thought too because this girl is the sweetest and best girl ever. But me being in that unknown, especially because my ex did such and hid a lot of stuff from me, made me feel so afraid of what else she was doing after cheating. But I came to realize that this is not my “ex” and I shouldn’t ruin it over some toxic person in the past. She then comforted me and we forgot about it.

I then noticed that I had been removed from her Instagram close friends story twice. It happened once, and I tried not to think about it. But the second time, which is today I just can’t help to wonder. What could she be posting that would cause her to remove me and then add me back later. Just to be clear, I had never asked to be in her close friends as well. I’m genuinely confused. Should I be worried? We spend everyday talking to each other, laughing, loving, flirting and it’s just so great.

The conversations flowed and we were laughing all night. We met around 8 and stayed at a bar until 10pm. but the one thing that got to me was her breath. It smelled really bad and I noticed when I ordered us two glass of water, she barely touched it. Then I found out she doesn’t like drinking water. She usually drinks coffee and IPAs. despite that, she’s super cute, funny and I really like her. I asked her if she likes to cook and she said no and told me she usually snacks a lot or eat shin ramen or sardines which is her favorite. hence when her breath smelled so bad. We didn’t want the night to end so we went to a park and we made out. I asked her if she wanted to come over and she did. the next morning, obviously her breath smelled worse but I thought it was because she didn’t brush her teeth and I made her coffee. Then we met up two days later and the smell was still there. It wasn’t as strong but it’s still there. 

After our 2nd date, we went back to her place and I noticed her fridge was basically empty bc she told me she usually orders take out and doesn’t cook. I love cooking so I told her we should go grocery shopping sometime and we can cook together. 

For our 3rd date, I invited her over and spent two days making her homemade ramen and I had shiitake, scallions and chili oil laid out for her to put in her ramen. I noticed she didn’t put any scallions in her Raman so I put it in for her and she made a face. I didn’t realize maybe she thought I was trying to change her or she can’t eat some things due to textures but after dating her, I told my friends my new standards for this year. 

Someone who knows how to cook, eat their fruits and vegetables, and drink water. Then my friends said, “that is a really low bar.” 

I’ve dated a lot of women who don’t like drinking water, eating fruits and vegetables so when I meet someone who does, I really like them.

**Observation 1: The loneliness and FOMO can be resolved alone, put real effort &amp; focus into everything.** 

I was surprised to see how much more content I am alone when I put effort and focus into everything. Mundane shit becomes fulfilling. Cooking goes from a pain in the ass to a fun skill. Busting ass at work feels good. Putting real effort in your workout regimen feels good. Learning guitar feels better than scrolling mindlessly. When you fill your day with useful/fulfilling shit, you don't feel the same lack and loneliness. I thought I'd just have a background level of sadness/neediness until I met someone. Fortunately, that's not the case. This is the dating pre-requisite for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 2: Working at a big company with your demographic is the easiest way to date and make friends post-college.** 

I had a date less than a week after my break up, met her at work. When work went remote and we stopped seeing eachother, it took a long time to meet another. If your primary life problem is loneliness/lack of dating options, getting an in-person office job or moonlighting at a restaurant/bar could be the fastest way out. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 3: Apps are the best way to get dates now. Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are different, but all can be effective.** 

Apps have been the most efficient way to meet women for me. Most guys I ask met their girlfriend on an app. 

Tinder is the meat market, high volume but low conversion. Many are on there for shits and giggles. 

Bumble has been the best for me in quantity of matches/conversations, definitely worth paying. But I've noticed women on Bumble are very sure of what they want and are forward from the jump. Common trend seems to be ""I'm done wasting my time, I'm here to find someone."" Pros and Cons to that. 

If I could only use one, it would be Hinge. Free works well, no need to pay. You can open with a comment, which can make the initial conversation much easier to get going. Hinge also rewards activity. I'll get no likes if I don't swipe for a few days, but if I'm more active I'll get likes within the hour. 

Pro tip: Use voice memos or send videos in the apps that allow it. Gamechanger. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 4: Going to a bar alone can be fun, but you won't meet women, until you become a regular.** 

This has been my biggest time/money waste. I moved to a new city, so I'll go out to bars alone. Most times I'll find another solo guy to shoot the shit with, I met my main friend out here this way. I've become a regular at one bar where I can go to on Saturday nights and I will definitely run into someone I know. Sometimes you need social interaction on a Saturday night, having a regular bar fulfills this need. 

side note: I hardly drink. I'll have 2 in a night, with club sodas in between. Nobody cares or notices. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 5: You can tell if she wants to be left alone or be talked to.** 

This is most apparent to me at cafes, parks, beaches. A lot of women want to meet someone ""organically"", and they don't like the bar scene. So they might bring a book or laptop to a cafe/beach/park.

If I notice all these things, I'll break the ice: They made an effort to look nice, they're doing what they could be doing at home, they're not focused on what they're doing, they look up and around often, they get up to ""do something"" a lot (water refill, go look at something, change seats,etc). 

If I notice any of these, I won't: Forward facing hat is low, intently focused on what they're doing, never or rarely look up and around, hunched over/closed body language, avoid eye contact. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 6: Get the number to continue what's already happening, not to start something at a later time.** 

I've gotten numbers with the whole ""hi, I saw you and wanted to meet you. Would you like to go out sometime?"".  Most times they'll give you the number to be polite, but it never turns into a date. It's much better to have some sort of rapport before asking to hang out again. You're already at the same place at the same time, if you can't have a conversation now, what's the point in doing it later? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 7: Trying to kill any awkward tension also kills sexual tension. Own the approach.** 

Qualifiers like ""If you're not interested feel free to say no"", ""I know this is weird but"", ""only if you want to"" seem to make it less tense, but it immediately shifts it to a friendly, non-sexual vibe. The most successful approach I've done so far was uncomfortably bold. I walked up to a waitress on my way out and said ""what time are you off?"". She said ""10"", I had my phone out with the new contact screen open and said ""Let's get a drink after"" and handed her my phone. She said ""why don't you leave me your number?"".  I said ""If you're saying no, just say no"".  She then put her number in and we went out that night. Saw her a few times. She said had I left her my number she never would've texted me. But we kept locking eyes and talked a little throughout the night, I was pretty sure she was interested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Observation 8: Assume any attraction you feel is mutual.** 

If she's attracted to you, you can talk her out of it. If she's not, you can't talk her into it. The way most guys talk her out of being attracted is by showing a lack of confidence, hesitating to approach &amp; being too sheepish. If you boldly approach a woman that's attracted to you, it will work. If she's not attracted to you, no approach would work anyway.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164704,public,self,"Observations after 2 years of actively dating (27-29M, straight).",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tpps6m/observations_after_2_years_of_actively_dating/,no_ads,0,

I’ve only ever been in very short term relationships which have left me hurt. They show initial interest, which over a few months makes me fall for them, and then they always say ‘I can’t fall in love with you.’

I’m not clingy, I’m not needy, im generous, I’m caring and kind and I like my body, I work out regularly. I take care of my hair and makeup. I have a good job, friendly and I love cooking, cooking is kinda my love language.. I’m told food is a way to the heart! Haha

When I met my boyfriend (now ex) he asked me about previous relationships. I opened up to him and told me how I’ve often felt unloved in my relationships. He told me that he understands and he’s not like that

At the start of the relationship, I put a lot of effort in, he was new to my country so I was excited about showing him around. He still was supportive and showed me he was very attracted to him. But 3 months in, I realised he hadn’t even taken me on a date or paid for a coffee. I almost felt like his mother, and I was a big source of support for him. He didn’t have much money at all and didn’t have a good job. I had seen his bank account so I didn’t mind because I was starting to love him and cared deeply. He didn’t know what to do with his career or life and had big ambitions but wasn’t doing anything about them. He always moaned all the time and just wanted to stay in and watch Netflix… I didn’t know if this was because he didn’t want to spend time and money with me?

He ended things last week after not communicating anything for two months, he had become very cold and distant with me and I felt like I was annoying him.  He told me he hasn’t fallen in love and feels he should have by now. He was crying saying that ‘you’re so lovely.’ We did have some major life differences that came up… he said he didn’t want kids but I did (a long time into the future, not any time soon!). But I know that he wanted a child with his ex who he often talks about but they broke up 4 years ago, says his life goals have changed in that time.

Now I’m worried I’m not lovable. No guy has ever chased me, I’m used to getting ghosted. Every guy I meet says they don’t know what they want in life and that they don’t want kids, so I don’t know if it’s just me they don’t want?

I know my boyfriend treated his ex and he still has photos of them up. He never put photos up of me

We've had a few moments where we're weren't sure if we were sexually compatible. He said he wanted to have sex on the second date and that we'd become boyfriends if it was good. I don't like to have sex with someone that I don't know too well, especially since I'm a virgin and always imagined my first time being with someone that I was in a relationship with and really cared about and had a connection with and knew really well, or at least with someone that I've known for more than a few weeks. I told him that I thought we might not be sexually compatible and he said that he couldn't be with someone that wasn't sure if they wanted to be with him and said that this is goodbye for now. 

I was afraid to lose this guy who might be my perfect match and I'm not proud of it, but I sent him a bunch of messages asking him to give me another chance. He said that he would, but that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that he has to have sex with me to see if he can get them back. I really like this guy and don't want to lose him, and I feel awful that I made this guy who said that he was falling for me and could see himself spending his life with me not have those feelings anymore, but I'm still a little hesitant to have sex with him so soon, after just one date and a few weeks of texting.

This is where it gets a bit silly, but he follows a lot of models on Instagram, which isn’t a problem necessarily (I just never thought I’d date a guy who does that). Majority of these models are white, a few are racially ambiguous/Middle Eastern. He follows 2 black celebrities. I called him out, saying that if he had such a strong preference for black women and distaste for white women, why are most of the models he follows white? He deflected and said “well most of them are middle eastern” which isn’t true.

I would really appreciate any kind of help. Cheers!

I would like to give as much context as possible.

I  (25M) met this girl (25F) on a dating app over half a year ago. After  we texted a bit and she responded very briefly, I sent her a voice  message asking if there was any interest. She said she couldn't meet now  as she was very busy but would get back to me in two weeks to arrange  to meet then. After 4 weeks of not getting a response from her, I texted  her again. She replied, and we arranged to meet a week later (on her  initiative). Before our first date, we almost didn't write to each other  at all, which was from her.

The **first date**  was good, we spent about 3 hours together and decided at the end that  we both wanted to meet again. We had also talked during the date about  how we both weren't actually looking for a relationship compulsively, as  we were also very happy on our own. She also mentioned that she just  installed the app because she wanted to give someone the chance to get  to know her. Anyway, after the meeting she texted me that it was very  nice to get to know me and suggested a second date in about a week.

Between the 1st and 2nd date she continued to text very little, but it was a bit better than at the beginning.

The **second date**  went very well again. We had a very good connection, laughed, talked  about superficial but also deep topics and kept intense eye contact the  whole time. At the end of the date, she wanted me to drive her home, and  she reassured me by telling me that she really liked me.

Texting had already improved, but it was always kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, she initiated the **third date**  as well. This one also went very well, except for the last third. We  were in her apartment, and it was very romantic. After being advised by  various friends and the reddit community to make a move or I would miss  my chance, I decided to go for it, which was anything but easy. However,  when I tried to approach her, I realized that she wasn't open to it. It  was a bit awkward after that, but we still had a normal conversation.  She had told me earlier that night that her **ex had cheated on her for over half a year**  and still treated her very badly after that. Although it had been over  for 2 years, she has only been over her ex for half a year because she  had repressed the whole thing for a long time and her ex kept contacting  her even after the relationship ended. In the end, she asked me if it  was okay **to take things slow**  because she was very afraid of getting hurt again. But she also assured  me that she didn't want to keep me on a long leash because that's not  her way. I told her that I was ready to do it and that I actually prefer  to take it slow, but I put a lot of pressure on myself because I really  like her which I wanted to show her. I didn't end up feeling that good,  but she suggested a fourth meeting when she gets back from vacation  with her parents. On my hint, she also said that she wanted to contact  me more if it was important to me, but that it was unusual for her to  write to someone every day, and that she hasn’t dated for a long time.

The  next day I texted her again about the “taking things slow” thing. She  told me that she really really likes me a lot and wants to get to know  me more and is also interested, but it's not easy for her mentally so  she appreciates me giving her the time. The next days she contacted me  very regularly. However, then over the next week and her vacation her  behavior changed, and she became more distant. After a few days, I said  it would be best if we talked on the phone. She called me and then we  had the conversation:

She thought  about us a lot again and talked to her parents for a long time (with  whom she has a very good relationship) about us and she just can't open  up and is too afraid of getting hurt. She tried it so much and it was  0.0% up to me and I would have done everything right, but she can't give  me what I need in terms emotional commitment, and it would be unfair  for me if we kept seeing each other. So we said goodbye to each other,  and I haven't spoken to her since.

After  that phone call, I was really devastated. I had really built up  feelings for her in a short time and liked her a lot on so many levels.  Anyway, I decided not to contact her anymore because I wanted to give  her space and didn't want any further contact to recover. Also, I never  knew if she used the whole thing as an excuse because she thought I was  nice and wanted to give me a gentle rejection.

**Fast forward 6 months:**  I moved on, had a few dates in the meantime, but nothing solid came of  it. In the last few days I've thought of her a few times and seen my  calendar entry, (it's her birthday in a few days) and thought about  writing to her again and asking her how she's doing and if we'd like to  meet for coffee and chat a bit. I think she would be worth it to me to  leave my pride behind for this.

Additional  information: She hadn't dated anyone else at the time I dated her, and  generally said on the dating app that she only dated me because she  found me very likable. Also, after she rejected me, she had deleted her  dating profile.

**Has  anyone had a similar experience before? Is a rejection because you're  ""not ready"" always just an excuse? Do you guys think I should text her  again? If yes, what should I write?**

**Tl;  dr: A girl rejected me after three dates because she wasn't  psychologically ready to move on, since her ex cheated on her for a long  time. Do you think I should text her again after 6 month?**

It was a case of right person, wrong time. She just had a lot on her plate juggling with her son, work, and me. Picking one meant the other aspect of her life would suffer. She felt pressured to be a good partner and find time for me which caused her to be stressed, because that meant she had to shift something else in her schedule. Some free time would occasionally come up, but she was not okay with just waiting for something to come up. I was always patient and understanding but she didn’t want me to constantly wait or expect her to be free. Ultimately our relationship had to end so the other aspects of her life could survive. 

Although we are no longer together with a label we haven’t exactly “broken-up”. We still text each other daily, call each other maybe twice a week. We still use each other as sounding boards, emotional support, etc. We still miss and care for each other. We both had instances where we got jealous/insecure of each other for possibly moving on. We talked about it and mentioned how we both don’t want to lose each other but also we want more than just being friends, but that can’t currently happen at this time due to circumstances and life. So feelings are still involved.

Then during this month, we found that without the pressure of the title of bf/gf things were better. She didn’t have to schedule or create time to be with me. We even had impromptu lunches or dinners when those random free time would come up. And then last week she had time again and we ended up having sex. We kind of talked about this idea and that she wished this is how things would be that we can be there for each other and have the physical intimacy without the expectations that come with being a bf/gf. 

Would this work out for us?

Some things I've learned lately. These are honest to goodness questions I have, but seems to be the case and I've been told all of these by both men and women.

*You absolutely cannot be friends with someone first. A long time ago this was encouraged and people said it was the best way to form a close bond and really get to know someone. Now, I'm not talking about being someone's ""buddy"" but basically a flirtatious friend and letting things grow slowly and naturally over time. Likewise, some people have told me you actually have to be friends sometimes for a long time, watch the person you have feelings for sleep around and choose everyone but you until someday they... Choose you. 

*You should not be attached to anyone. Don't give two flipping fucks if you lose them or not. Love YOURSELF, not someone else. Love them as much as what is convenient to. A safe love. If they decide one night randomly they're leaving you never to speak again no big deal, it happens. Do not let yourself feel secure around someone and give them your heart.

*While I see guys all day everyday with wives, girlfriends, building families, especially the guys who want to do so, it's somehow not uncommon for a guy to go many years for a relationship, even if that's what he wants. Same with sex. It's not uncommon to go many years without doing anything sexual whatsoever. For girls, they will always have a line of guys waiting. A different date every day if they want and dating multiple guys at the same time is widely accepted and almost normal now. It is a direct competition where you are trying to win someone over each time you see them. Be ready to accept that in those years no one wanted you in any way it's not uncommon for the girl you're seeing to have had a good number of sexual partners in the very least and probably several relationships. 

*You had BETTER be set financially. If you are in adulthood and a full time student, you can go ahead and stop wasting your time until you are financially set. It is a waste of your potential partner's time. Forget about having someone by your side until college is over and you're making good money.

*You must have 100% unwavering confidence. If you have been through anything traumatic and even if you are a very positive and confident person, if you have any insecurities or if you ever open up to someone about them (even if you ask) good day to you, sir! You must be fearless and completely confident in everything you are and all that you do at all times. Coming from someone who is very athletic and involved in sports and regular gym work and proud of it, if there's anything that hurts down inside you either better hide it or ""go heal"" for some years till it goes away (even though it seems to only get worse as time goes on and no one ever wants you).

*People pretty much do not meet offline due to the systems in place anymore. If they do, they always know there's another option quickly available online. People rarely if ever meet at work, through hobbies, school, sports unless you are a Olympic Level Alpha Male, then maybe.

*It's okay to have friends of the opposite gender. Well that's no big deal... It's okay to have BEST friends of the opposite gender... Okay, well... A little uncomfortable but sure. It's okay for the person you're dating to go out till 3am on a Friday night with their opposite gender best friend. Um... Sure why not. Oh, and travel abroad with them. There might even be more than one? This is totally normal and fine now. 

*It is NOT okay to be different. There are about 3-4 molds both politically and societally that are acceptable. If you are a little different than those it's not okay unless you are either extremely weird looking and don't try to take care of yourself and only play the pity card or you're superly over confident in that shell, or you are extremely overweight. Examples include : Shaved head with a bushy beard, rainbow hair, gorilla-man build, tall and super slinder with a horrible mustache and hippie hair, lifted trucks and gigantic biceps. Oh and tattoos. If you don't have tattoos you are not a real man to any type of affiliation, period. You're just a child.

*It's 100% okay to lie to people. If you don't lie, it's 100% okay to get to know someone and ditch them because you left your tea kettle on that morning. Never EVER try. Ever. If it requires any effort, understanding or patience you should immediately bail.

*DO NOT act friendly or like a ""friend"" on the first date. Be ALPHA and ""show her YOU are THE MAN"" and pour on some more confidence. If you don't have her in bed that night or wanting it you might as well friend zone yourself.

I was in a very bad relationship for a decade and reminded every day how worthless I was. I left and went out and did everything I could to get myself into good shape, change careers and follow a path I love, learned how to be outgoing and make people laugh, how to not just talk but genuinely listen, converse and understand others. Be patient and go without things like companionship and sex for years. This is totally fine too apparently. In this time I was on just about every major dating site and app (Tinder, OKcupid, Bumble, etc). I swiped right on I would guess over 100,000 people at this point over the course of a year that I've been on them. In this time I would say I can count on two hands how many girls spoke to me through text for over a week. Called two of them... Met one in person, for a date, one time. She asked me to open up about some of my insecurities. I said I was fine and didn't want to, she said it would be okay to do so. As soon as I did she bailed.

Girls give me dirty looks everywhere I go. They do not want to be approached unless they are married or taken, then apparently I'm super sweet, funny and make a great friend. I'm also apparently great at conversation, I have excellent hygiene, I'm well groomed and my place is clean and some of those things are apparently wrong.

I wish with all my heart it was okay for me to just be me. I wish people still fell madly in love and gave each other their hearts and everything they are. I wish people still believed in soul mates and that your soul mate SHOULD be your best friend truest partner. I wish sometimes I had someone to talk to and give me a hug when things were tough, with just a tiny bit of encouragement I can be insanely confident and not in a faking it way. I've made the impossible happen more than once in my life when it was incredibly difficult and did so with a smile on my face. But I know all that is silly of me and that now dating is truly a game, a sport, a convenient setup for sex and part time casual companionship.

Hey Reddit! I’ve never posted but I’m currently in a relationship with my girlfriend (21f) and I’m (23m), and recently she has been busier at work because her boss has been scheduling her more hours than usual. Her typical work schedule lately has been looking like a single weekday plus all three days on the weekend form Friday to Sunday night, meaning hanging out with her on the weekends are just out of the question. Although she only works 4 days of the week, she’s working close to 40plus hours a week, and she’s usually dead tired after her shifts.She is currently a full time student too, and it’s been difficult for me to find some spare time to spend some quality time with her. When we do find the time to spend with each other, the moments are great and I long for more moments like this. I completely understand how she is busy with her life and that I’m not gonna stop her from doing the things she needs to do, but I want to figure out a solution with her and I’m just not sure where to start without coming off as needy. I also understand the need for me to practice with my own hobbies and to stay busy, but this sudden change in routine has thrown me off a little. Although this problem just started recently, I noticed it right away, and I want to find some balance before It gets worse.

We baked cookies one night and watched a movie and he brought over dinner. The second time her came over he brought me dinner and once again we just hungout and talked and drank wine and then I went over there last night and we watched some tv and stayed up talking all night. I have slight feelings for him, but I don't mind a friends with benefits situation. The thing that is bothering me is that my best friend from back home has come up in our conversations a lot because I tell him a lot of funny stories about her and now he seems like he brings her up at least a couple times every time we hangout. Yesterday at his apartment he said he had an extra room for my friend to live in and then he also tried calling her, but she didn't answer and called me instead. He has never mentioned any weird comments like him being attracted to her, but he talks about her a lot and even follows her on twitter instead of me.. We have a twitter group together which is fine because I wanted them to be friends, but yesterday he was asking me to make a snapchat group with her too. I get really weird vibes about all of this, because although I want them to be friends because I think we all have very similar personalities I just don't know if he is like more attracted to her than me or likes her more than me. We have a slightly complicated past when we went out together I flirted with some guys in front of him and he was upset, but we talked about it and I thought we moved on from it so I don't think this has anything to do with that but I don't know. What do you guys think? Weird to be talking about her so much or is he just kind of fucking with me like I fucked with him? I never make it weird I just go along with it, but make it clear that shes MY best friend and not his.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164729,public,self,The guy I am talking to always talks about MY best friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tpt5cq/the_guy_i_am_talking_to_always_talks_about_my/,no_ads,0,

The situation around me as I've grown up has caused me to, I would say, mature quicker than others. I'm 18 now but everyone I've ever been romantically interested in has been older than me, and by quite a significant amount. This has been something that I've experienced since I was a kid. I know it's normal to have preferences, but is it normal to be completely turned off when finding out that someone is younger than me, even if it was only by a month? Also, should I continue to pursue older men/women? I've found it hard to do so in the past because nobody seems to take me seriously since I'm younger than them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164729,public,self,Dating older men/women,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tpt5v5/dating_older_menwomen/,no_ads,0,
