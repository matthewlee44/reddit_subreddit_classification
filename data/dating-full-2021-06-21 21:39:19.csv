I think the longest I was with a girl in high school was about a week or two and one date exactly after which she made the choice not to go through with it, although she changed her mind a month later and asked if I wanted to try again and I refused, salvaging some dignity. Aside from this though, no action at all except one or two times I made out with girls I basically never talked to again, and that was beginning of HS.

Recently though, (since I was 17) I started balding semi-noticeably and it's getting to the point where I'm almost sure I'd look better with a shaved head, but that's probably some mood swing because I look again and I just think wow, I'm gonna be completely unfuckable after this. So yeah. Armageddon is drawing close and I'm feeling fucking empty.

I only turned 19 a couple months ago and don't have either the money to go get a transplant, nor do I have the interest in pursuing medication that'll fuck with my hormones and body just so I can gamble my health for hair. So I think I'm gonna go through with it, but I'd be lying if I said I was optimistic and not considering ending it all if it's really such an inhibitor in modern dating as a young guy. I just don't see the point in living my whole life alone when it's already getting exhausting seeing everyone have what I can't have with ease.

What do you think? Any other young bald guys care to share their experience? Please do understand that I'm 100% gonna be skeptical as fuck if any girls say they don't care because at the end of the day, I'm still 19, I'm still alone, and I still see the shit people say online all the time.

For the record; I've met up with 3 people from dating apps. One was a woman, who was every bit as stunning and engaging as her profile suggested. The other two were men, and their pictures were much more flattering than their actual appearance. I don't want to be on the receiving end of that realization:(

I recently got out of a 6 year relationship with my ex. It ended because he cheated on me. He has been very apologetic and didn’t want to break up but I insisted we had to. This was two months ago. I had to move to a new city to live with my parents and recently got a new job here. 

A month after our break up I met a guy on tinder. I told him that I’m newly single and how I wasn’t really sure if I wanted anything too serious too soon. We went on four dates and he seems very interested in me, and I do enjoy spending time with him as well. 

I just started working at my new job a week ago so it’s been a little stressful. Also, this entire week my ex has been messaging and calling me about how he misses me and wants me back. I have no intentions of getting back with him, but at the same time it’s really been messing with me emotionally. We were together for so long and had a future planned out together and it ended so drastically that I feel I haven’t really accepted the breakup entirely. I don’t want to get back with him but I’m also having a very hard time with my emotions on the situation and just hearing from him has made me anxious and I’ve been avoiding my phone entirely. I still care about him but I also know he isn’t right for me. 

The new guy I’m seeing wants to take me on a date this week and he messaged me earlier today. I haven’t responded yet. I just feel like I’m so stressed out and emotionally exhausted from hearing from my ex and starting my new job I just am so overwhelmed. I like spending time with this new guy but I’m not sure if I’m ready fully to continue with it. We already hung out and been intimate and I feel bad if I avoid him now all the sudden but my ex has made me feel almost guilty about seeing a new guy for some twisted reason. I don’t think I want to hang out this week with the new guy because I should probably take some time for myself but I also don’t want him to think I’m ditching him for my ex (cause I’m not)

Should I tell the new guy about my ex messaging me and how it’s stressing me it and that I need time alone for a bit? Someone pleas help me.

I do the best things I can for what good human beings should do, yet woman avoid me for all sorts of reasons.. all things they claim to hate in a man.. for instance:

Woman say: I want a man in touch with his emotions &amp; will support me
Woman see a man being in touch, when he has a bad day/experience &amp; ditch him the minute he shows human emotions.

Woman say: I want a man who will protect me, love me &amp; care about me 
Woman fall for and chase men who are rude to them, abuse their emotions, and sometimes resort to physical violence

Woman say: I want a man who loves me for me and doesn't only want me for sex
Woman ignore men who talk to them like human beings &amp; spark genuine connection &amp;  fall for guys who couldn't make it more obvious they exclusively want sex &amp; ditch the women once they get it. 

Woman say: that looks dont matter to them
Woman then turn around &amp; ignore men unless they are fitness models and/or have the looks of tom cruise

I figured these qualities in womanwould dissappear as I left high school into college &amp; now the working world  but literally nothing changed. 

Seeing the way you flock to guys who are complete trash, outright lie about the things you want, in public and to my face makes me wonder why do I even bother trying to continue living a good life? Why do I even bother trying to be a decent human being. I have tried being an asshole  and I can't. My guilty conscience takes over &amp; i apologize for being a jerk instantly.

Even posting something g like this on reddit where I'm anonymous, you people refuse to take my situation &amp; mental health as a human being seriously. I Get comments like  ""your having a pity party""....""toughen up, no woman wants that""...""that's why no woman wants you""...""just be patient, you'll find her""... 

More to the point, how can you find the truth in a sea full of lies? I'm actually at the point where I don't trust women. And if they do show interest or affection to me, im skeptical because the few times it has happened, I was a last resort, or it was out of pity. But dont ever express that you were heartbroken!! That's a sign of weakness &amp; women don't like that....

How is someone supposed to get help for their situation or express their story or how they feel about their life experiences, or how to get help lifting themselves up if all you do is destroy the person when they express their hardships in their lives? If I was a woman saying all those things exept about men, you would all be kissing my ass

All I really want is someone to love me back with the same energy I give them... turns out, IT REALLY IS too much to ask!! I can't get more than 3 weeks of conversations with women before I get ghosted, 90% of the time I dont make the first date... and the other 10% maybe ill get 2 if im super lucky. And I always initiate the conversation. Its always me texting first, messaging first, calling first,  arranging dates. Put in SOME effort! Stop being so lazy!

 I'm done with talking to women. If a woman wants to talk to me, message me. I can assure you I will give the same energy back you give me.

So I've been recently getting into dating and I've been using the Hinge route, because at least it's a little less surface level than Tinder and I've never had luck there anyways. All the dates went pretty good, but I would say my performance (banter, confidence, energy) slowly declined each date, by the time I reached the last date it was probably the most quality girl I saw but I had dating fatigue and I didn't realize it. I wasn't myself I felt like I was asking the same questions twice when I really wasn't. I felt like I was tired in general and it was a breakfast date which didn't help, but she was amazing. It's tough out here dating and I know people say to keep your options open and don't put your eggs in one basket. But the flip side to that is if you spread yourself too thin then you aren't going to be your best self when you potentially meet the right person for you. So my advice is to not overload yourself, but meeting and getting to know multiple people is fine. 

Out of all four I've been on one second date so far, but hoping for a second date with another 🤞 best of luck to everyone, whatever you may be looking for just keep trying, there is going to be someone out there that you vibe with.

We chatted for a bit, then we transitioned the conversation to snapchat. We talked more and the conversation remained casual while getting to know one another. After a few days of exchanging snaps, I tried to set up a date on Friday. We talked more and she told me yesterday that her intern told her she would be scheduled until 10 that night, hence the date was not setup. Just a little background info. She's an assistant to a politician and it does seem like she's busy most of the day and tends to work most days of the week. Even on working from home, her work phone is blowing up and she's shown me. So on Sunday, things got heated between us and we started talking about sex, kinks, and how she practices safe sex since she carries condoms with her. Tbh I respect that. She also told me she wants to keep things casual and isn't looking for anything serious due to her work schedule. We both agreed on handcuffing (I'm an officer in my state) and how she's found some of my experiences hot. She actually got turned on by my dangerous encounters on the field. Anyways, she told me her next available days which were this Saturday or the Monday. Now I'm confused and definitely overthinking. Idk if I'm just another guy in her rotation and keeping me around if things don't work out with other guys or if she's genuinely wants to hook up. She sends me snaps daily but when we engage in a conversation, she doesn't really ask me questions but does comment on most things I snap her. I just got out of a 2.5 year relationship and I'm definitely rusty in terms of my game. So how should I approach this? I down to keep things casual but should I continue pursuing this girl or back off and let her come to me?

One is usually intimidated by my size and or race

We chatted for a bit, then we transitioned the conversation to snapchat. We talked more and the conversation remained casual while getting to know one another. After a few days of exchanging snaps, I tried to set up a date on Friday. We talked more and she told me yesterday that her intern told her she would be scheduled until 10 that night, hence the date was not setup. Just a little background info. She's an assistant to a politician and it does seem like she's busy most of the day and tends to work most days of the week. Even on working from home, her work phone is blowing up and she's shown me. So on Sunday, things got heated between us and we started talking about sex, kinks, and how she practices safe sex since she carries condoms with her. Tbh I respect that. She also told me she wants to keep things casual and isn't looking for anything serious due to her work schedule. We both agreed on handcuffing (I'm an officer in my state) and how she's found some of my experiences hot. She actually got turned on by my dangerous encounters on the field. Anyways, she told me her next available days which were this Saturday or the Monday. Now I'm confused and definitely overthinking. Idk if I'm just another guy in her rotation and keeping me around if things don't work out with other guys or if she's genuinely wants to hook up. She sends me snaps daily but when we engage in a conversation, she doesn't really ask me questions but does comment on most things I snap her. I just got out of a 2.5 year relationship and I'm definitely rusty in terms of my game. So how should I approach this?

I started texting a girl who I really like, like i really really like. The first 4 days it started really good, suprisingly good. In the beginning she replied quickly, then took time to reply to these texts but i did not mind(Texting on snapchat). 

So a day ago, we texted back and forth very smootly and it was a very good and long conversation and she seemed really engaged as she sended emojis and asked me some questions. I was ready to ask her out so i prepared mentaly and went to bed ready to ask her out the next day. 

Then next day morning i asked her a food related question becuase i was gonna ask her out on dinner. I was super ready. She took a long time to open the message, I waited a long time, exited ofcourse, but when she opened it she did not reply. We had such a good conversation a day ago, where nothing seemed wrong, but a simple what restuarant do you really like here, was too mutch

? I am really overeacting most likely, but I take this as a sign that she wants to stop talking to me, which is weird becuase we had such a good conversation. But maybe she took her time to answer on purpose before to get rid of me? idk. But i did not get to ask her out, and I am sad, I am a emotional guy.

Long story short he asked me to move closer to him in the car which I did... then he kissed me (I was a bit surprised as we were only 1 hour into meeting) after kissing he pulled down my romper and started sucking on my boobs..
 That led to him pulling his pants down and when he did that I let him know that I was uncomfortable and didn't want that. He still proceeded to grab my hair and push my head down to his lap. The whole time he kept looking around and asking if cars around us were empty. Eventually he grabbed me and turned me around forcefully and pulled down my romper completely... I was frozen at that moment. I didn't even feel him get into the position to try to enter inside of me but thank God I was able to feel behind me and I felt him attempting to put it inside of me. I was in a disadvantage because of how I was positioned in the small car so I started begging him not to put it inside of me. He kept saying he won't put it inside of me only rub it on my vagina which he did but I kept moving it to my leg instead. This happened for maybe 15 minutes (we were in an empty parking lot and I was terrified that if I got aggressive with him he would rape me).

Eventually he asked if I wanted to go outside for a walk which I said yes to with no hesitation as I wanted out of that car. We walked for a bit and when he looked down in my hand and saw my phone he questioned why I had it. The whole time we were walking he kept pulling my boobs out of my shirt. He even mentioned to me to walk down an ally way with him which I flat out refused. 

The whole time especially in the car he kept staring at me in the eyes. It seemed like he was contemplating fully raping me... on the walk he kept getting pissed that I wouldn't take off my jacket.

About ~2 weeks ago, met an amazing women (in the city) on Tinder, and had a great date. We met for drinks and got appetizers, it went well, and we went back to her place (I live with my folks, am 26M, can afford to move out but my mom is in poor health), and had sex. I really enjoyed it, and she said (many times) she did too.

We texted since then, she said numerous times she wanted to meet and have sex again. I commuted to the city again this week, but her roommate was home, so I got a hotel in advance.

We had a 2nd date this week. This time of year is super stressful for work (why I was in the city), so I was feeling very uptight and tired. The date was a little more awkward than the first cause of that; and after offering to pay for the dinner, she said she was sorry and needed to leave. She seemed less interested than last time. I paid for the dinner, but the hotel went to waste.

I really liked this girl and want to give it another shot, but not sure what to text her? She seemed more excited than me for the 2nd date, but, I guess it didn't go well. I don't want her to feel pressured to meet me again, but given how well the first went, I'd like to give it another go.

My date on Saturday was, well, for lack of a better term, uncharming. I wasn’t exactly my best self with her either. And while she did come over to mine (this typically doesn’t happen), the motives were such that I almost wish it didn’t happen. We didn’t do the full thing. 

The next day, I had a date with a far healthier girl. I worried that the previous day had left a bad taste in my mouth. And again I was probably not my best self. But I think I was wayy closer to it than I’ve been in a while. 

In short I liked this girl a lot. I can’t see any reason why I would want to go on the next date or two with her. I just fear that because she was great I felt the need to submit a little. And that that maybe ended up making me look weak. Haha. Ahh. 

She ended the date by saying let’s meet up Thursday, either at a bar or to do something sporty. And I just texted her saying we should do the sporty thing Thursday, just cuz.

My female friend is coming over for drinks, and I have the whole place to myself since my roommate is out of town. When we talked over text recently, she teased me about how she’s gonna out drink me and said she was looking forward to exploring the city with me since I just moved for work. She goes to college a half hour out, and we’ve been friends who’ve kept in some form of on and off contact over the past 4 years since we first met in high school but we haven’t hung out much recently due to covid.

Normally this would be great and all, but I just feel like she doesn’t match my effort in trying to text or keep in touch. For the past few months I’d try to keep in touch with her by asking her how her work has been, and how things are going in general in every day life, but it’s almost always me initiating conversation. We went almost a full month recently not talking to each other since I didn’t message first, and she often lets the conversation die out without asking about me. This with her relative inexperience with relationships and innocence (pretty sure she’s still a virgin who would not give her first time to a drunk hookup) makes me think she just views this as her visiting and hanging out with a friend. 

I’m not sure how I feel about her because I do think she’s cute and is really fun to be around, but I’m hesitant to make a move since I just don’t feel like she’s interested, and even if she was, she’d have to become a much better texter for it to work out anyway.

That  means i suffer a lot of fatigue and pain and have to rest a lot and live life at a very slow/relaxed pace. One way of looking at it is that it takes me twice as much effort to do half as much as healthy people, and that's on a good day.

Thankfully I'm able to get out a bit every other day, but it's quite hard sometimes and so approaching or getting to know women (or anyone) is kind of difficult when I'm only just about functional going about my business and typically in some pain/fatigued.

I don't drink and my pain/condition makes me noise sensitive, so bars and crowds aren't an option. Most sports are completely out of the question other than gentle and slow walking and cycling. I've tried looking for events on meetup.com but it's 95% older people on there in my area and even if i joined a cycling or walking group i'd be left way behind.

So other than attending a meditation class sometime (which i plan to do after lockdown)  I can't think of any social actives I can do where I'd meet a potential partner and it's a bit frustrating really.

On the plus side, I've hit my ideal BMI and I've managed to start driving again after struggling with that, so at least I can get around. Furthermore, one-on one communication is about as much as I can manage for any length of time, so at least a date is a possible/healthy activity for me. Also, my disability is very much hidden and you can't really tell there's anything wrong me me based on looks. Also on the plus side is that my condition improves in the evenings most days.

And yes I've tried meeting people with the same condition, but most are isolating due to covid and/or are more housebound than me usually. Furthermore, half the girls with CFS seemingly only want to date healthy guys anyway.

I've tried online dating too, but I'm very average looking and so I've never even matched with anyone after a couple of months of trying.

I supposed I'd be best off meeting people online somewhere, but I can't really figure out a good option for that either.

I'm thinking of making a move on him, but I'm taking my time and kinda feeling things out with him first, see if he shows any interest. A group of us hung out yesterday and I caught him looking at me a couple times and at one point our hands kept touching (like our hands were kinda sliding over the other's 4 or 5 times) when I was handing him some stuff. I was so awkward around him though.

I don't know why I'm not finding any of the guys on dating apps attractive/interesting. Starting to wonder if i'm in love with my friend's friend...

I play that card well.

But let's just say: it's an objective fact that my body shape is disappointing when clothes come off (really weird boob shape and belly, short torso no waist etc.) and with clothes on my figure delivers higher expectations.

I'm cool with it. I eat healthy/work out and I'm generally cute and cool. But it's a shape thing that wont change and the 'big reveal' when first seeing someone can be a bit of a tense bummer because I know I dress my body to look pretty good and it's actually quite bizarre and unfeminine once the dressing comes off.  I've never had a compliment when nude and I've literally seen the disappointment streak across faces before, which to anyone would be bothersome.

No lectures about confidence please. It is what it is and that's okay! Ive had long term partners before and it's all good. It's mostly the anxiety of first exposing ""the truth"" I suppose.

**Just curious to know: which option would you think is better, if this was your dilemma?**

1- Confidently show nudish figure to new potentials as soon as possible before anyone of us is too attached so I know if they're truly attracted to me physically or not moving forward.

However, I have never been in a relationship before, so I was listening to her and tried to give sincere responses. In short, over the past 12 months, she was in casual relationshipsssss and she found it meaningless and wanted to quit and invest time for a long term one. We also had topics in other areas and at some point, we decided to meet up. I personally think that is a good one. However, she texted and invited me to be in a casual relationship (just sex) after the date. 

Well, I am kind of happy obviously because of the invitation. But I turned her down in the end because of two main reasons. The first is she cried to tell me she wants to stop casual relations, and second, I was never in a relationship and therefore being physically linked without flows of spiritual connections has a high probability of driving me crazy and I may annoy/bother her often if we really go for it. So, I suggested if she would consider a long term one and she said she doesn't think the chemistry between us match, and she believes she is good at identifying people who can have long term relations in the first few minutes of the first date.

With this, I am very confused. To my limited understanding, people just appreciate the attractiveness of a person, while deciding whether there is a romantic attraction between two people come at a later stage. But with the casual relationship invitation, I think it is fair to say that I am sort of physically attracted to her. So I am confused why she doesn't want to try to go for a long term one with me. 

I was a very introverted person because of a number of reasons. I tried to work on myself by cutting down my weight/gym, read more and have counsellings for two years. And these have improved me from being scared the shit out of myself when I saw a crush to be able to have normal conversations with them. I think I definitely had much space to improve but I have never succeeded to get myself in a relationship using dating apps. I rarely get matches on apps but I can also see that there are people getting matches from time to time. My observation for the past year of dating apps experience is that it seems like just being nice is just the baseline and there is more to do to get oneself into a relationship. It is kind of frustrating to get rejected/ghosted all the time... It seems like I am not suitable for dating apps but given the unbalanced population in my field, I have few choices... Maybe I should try to find other interests apart from what I have now...

I've seen a lot of posts and comments about guys under like 6 feet say they like tall women, but I've never heard this from tall guys themselves. Some tall women even like to admit that a lot of tall guys don't even go for tall women. I mean I honestly feel bad because its not like its their fault for being tall and the societal standard goes against them as they aren't ""shorter."" So its kind of like tall guys that emphasize this more make tall women feel like crap and its a shitty feeling. Coming from a short guy at 5'4 I know what its like to not fit in the norm and I honestly relate more to tall women in this aspect of life because we just don't really ""fit"" in with what society says is the standard man and woman.

Props to tall women that don't care about height, but the ones that do like tall men I think theres good reason for them to want tall men, I just know why it wouldn't be the same with tall men and tall women. I literally see every tall guy I come across with a woman below 5'7 idk if thats a coincedance or not, but theres tall guys that even say shit like women that are 5'2 and under are much better than tall women and whatnot which is fucked up because then you're basically putting down tall women. I can see how this can piss tall women off because as a short guy its like the reverse with me as women find tall men much better than short men.

It’s clearly visible that there is some kind of problem. The next day I texted her, she read the message but did not reply. I called her, she picked up and said everything is fine between us, there is just some problem. She gave no further information and I offered to help but seems like she is not interested in my help. In addition - standard work schedule here is 160h/month. She works 250 and tells me how busy she is at all the time and has no time this month to go out due to some problem. Now I did like this girl and I think she likes me too but what should I do? I don’t want to be clingy and call her often to offer help but I do want this thing to be solved so that we can go out again.

He has bought private shows, bought videos, tip the girls, etc. He has commented plenty of dirty messages. I added the tokens he has spent and in 2021 alone he spent $1,171 and the website only shows the history back to the middle of 2020 and he spent $168 so a total $1,339. I really am in shock and honestly do not know what to do. 

We have been dating for 3 1/2 years, planned on getting married, and he has recently talked about buying a house in one year. I love him, but to me this is a form of cheating. Honestly, I am calm for some reason and don't know why. I know that porn addiction is serious and it is real issue for some. I have always thought he had a little porn addiction when we first started dating. He was constantly looking at naked girls on instagram and always masturbating to porn (I thought pornhub at the time but maybe chaturbate, who knows). The instagram/masturbating started becoming an issue. One time, I opened his computer to use it and left open a porn video. I know guys watch porn, everyone does but I don't want to see what my bf is watching. It was affecting our sex life as he would never want to have sex. Also, I would go on his phone and it would automatically be a naked girl that he just left her picture up. He deleted all his social media for me and told me he would stop watching porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

He actually did delete his social media, he has none. I would ask him everyone now and then if he still watches porn and he has admitted in the past year he has once after he said he stopped. I have asked him multiple times do you still watch porn and he would always laugh and say no!! I don't do that anymore, quit asking me that! how do you not trust me or believe me I really don't. I even having recent text messages him saying things like that. Then I would guilt myself for asking and blame myself for asking such questions after he has repeatedly told me no. However, that's not true at all, he has been not just watching porn but interacting and buying porn behind my back for these 3 1/2 years and lying straight to my face.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly just don't know what to do. We have talked about the situation and he has said he will stop and get help and do anything to fix this. He has expressed how he feels about this and how he is sorry etc. I believe that he feels absolutely horrible and all that. I don't know how I will be believe him or trust him in the future. Apart of me, feels sorry in a way for him because I know it's a serious addiction and I feel like that's why I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should break up with him or continue our relationship as along as he gets help. He has really changed for the better concerning other issues so I feel like he could change this issue as well. It just bother's me so much because it's not like he is just watching porn on pornhub. He is buying porn and sending nasty comments to random girls on live cams. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has explained that he doesn't know why he has been doing this or what is wrong with him and why he couldn't stop. As well as he understandings if I want to break up with him.
