We have a really great connection and luckily want the same thing: a long-distance friendship where when we do see each other, we enjoy each other’s company and hook up. Nothing more serious than that.

We live far apart, and we text and talk on the phone every couple of days. 

She drinks a lot and often. 

When she’s sober, she’s not vulnerable at all, and definitely doesn’t express much in the way of feelings, especially about me. We talk casually about our work and hobbies. 

When she’s drunk, she’s much more talkative, vulnerable, and tells me she’s really into me. She lists all the reasons I’m “perfect” in detail. She sexts assertively and writes long role plays where she calls me her girlfriend and strongly expresses her interest in me not just sexually but as a person and partner. It’s super hot and flattering, and really enjoyable. 

I’m really into her, and I love our current casual status; I’m enjoying my single life and don’t want to be in a serious relationship. She is with someone else and doesn’t have any plans to change that. Perfect - we’re on the same page about not wanting to enter into a serious relationship with each other. 

So I’m not looking for relationship advice as much as I’m looking for information: 

(1) When someone expresses these things while drunk, especially multiple times and in the same way, is that because they feel that way sober, and alcohol just lowers their inhibitions so they’re just expressing what they feel? Or can alcohol significantly exaggerate feelings that might only be mild? 

The reason it matters is because when I express affectionate things to her, if she’s sober, her responses have textbook “she’s not that into it” vibes. But if she’s drunk, SHE is the one pouring praise, affection, admiration, romance, and sexiness toward me. Lately, in our sober conversations, I’ve found myself holding back and staying platonic because I can’t tell if she enjoys me initiating that stuff. I’m getting completely opposite signals between when she’s sober vs. drunk. So, I’m asking this question to see if I should just stick with platonic conversation, and just enjoy the moments (and reply accordingly) when she initiates affection/more. 

I would normally just directly ask someone how they feel, but I’m hesitant to ask her directly, because I don’t want her to get the impression that I require an answer. Part of what we both love about our situation is the spontaneity and lack of expectations. (I know, I know… good communication is always an expectation… but help me out here 😄)

TL;DR - If someone says something whenever they’re drunk, is that likely their true feeling, or could alcohol be exaggerating the actual feeling?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124005,public,self,Does she mean what she says when drunk?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnuq3t/does_she_mean_what_she_says_when_drunk/,no_ads,0,,,

The only explanation I can think of is that most girls don't frequent Tinder, even if they have a profile. Does it take living in a multimillion population city to get multiple matches, like it's advertised for? Is Tinder really a successful tool for 90% of guys that don't live in London or NYC?

Is it a major loss to not be having promiscuous sex or being in a relationship? I try to not think about being alone but every time I see a guy and a girl holding hands/studying together I feel a loss. It makes me keep going back to Tinder in hopes of somehow beating the ridiculous odds and landing a match, resulting in only seeing the same like I got 3 months ago when I joined.

So I’ve been seeing a girl for a while now and we we’re really good friends before we started dating. She is awesome and she has the best personality and is the kindest person I know, and I am definitely attracted to her but I still am unsure whether I am entirely physically attracted to her, is this normal? I don’t care about looks really but I feel weird, is it because we were already friends? Anyway, Because we’ve both had exams and I’ve just started a new job  we haven’t seen each other much in person the last few weeks. We watch a movie role play video games or just call most if not every night, and tomorrow she asked me to stay at her place for a few days while her mum is away. Idk how I feel about it because I want to see her and I wouldn’t mind staying over, however I’m not sure if she is wanting more than just to watch a movie and cuddle on the couch. I have had girlfriends before and we’ve fooled around before, but I’ve never had Sex and Idk how I feel about it yet. I’m a pretty shy person and even around her I’m still nervous some times. I’m pretty inexperienced with dating as it’s all just been high school relationships so I don’t wanna ruin anything and if something happens it happens but how do I go about this? I am pretty insecure about my body so I just don’t know if I’m ready for everything yet both because of that and because I’m not sure how I feel about her yet.

Hey all to be honest I don't know where else to turn so I'm hoping I can get some guidance through Reddit. I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year now and have yet to visit as my country still has an active international ban due to covid. The issue here is her family is actively going out of their way to put a strain on our relationship and I'm scared that eventually, they might just succeed.  So far what her family has done but is not limited to is:

1. Her brother gained access to my partner's Facebook and live-streamed our convos to the rest of her family which they laughed at and screenshotted many things 

2. I was going through a hard time and was crying over the phone. Her brother recorded it and later blackmailed her with it.

3. They constantly say things like ""I liked your ex the most""

So this brings me to what happened recently my partner's ex-friend whom she hasn't spoken to for a year reached out to my partner's family and informed them someone made fake accounts and was posting horrible things online acting as her. This led to the mother accusing me and posting things online claiming I am sick and a bully. Her brother got physical with my partner and kept telling everyone what they assumed I did. When confronted a few days later the brother said the reason he did all that was because he had a fight with his partner and was angry. As for the mom, she said the friend that called insisted my partner was the only one that had her phone number which was posted. This was later proved to not be true and it was later found out it was the friend's ex. I have constantly tried to reach out and have a mature conversation with her family but they literally either ignore me completely or say something like it's done now move on we don't want drama. I have brought tickets and will be visiting her soon and they have told her I'm not welcomed anywhere. 

Is there anything I can do reddit family? And if not is this something that could destroy a relationship?

But here comes the problem, if a woman catches my attention, my thoughts are ""you probably are the 10th guy that tries to flirt with her tonight, she will be tired of that and she doesn't want me to approach her, etc).

I feel guilty because I feel like I will be bothering them, and that I'm not enough to try to better those ""10 guys"" that I'm competing with, so I end up not trying.

This is a man who is so kind, accepting, and open.  He doesn't seem to be the type to judge by looks.  He even has said online that he cares about the person inside- not the outside (this is my answer I guess?)  He said these things on a social media site months before we met.

I'm pretty confident. I'm wanting to be healthier.  I think sexually our kinks etc are very much a match (yay !!!).

So- how do I? OR when do I? Introduce the topic of my size. Do I throw hints around? Use the word ""plus size"" which to me is a really subjectively poor description.

If you liked someone a lot- how would you want the idea of weight to be conveyed?

It’s not even their fault, WE sent the message that it’s acceptable. But I believe the apps (paradox of choice problems) and hookup culture (spits in the face of the very real FACT that most women have trouble separating sex and emotions) have RUINED dating. 

I am 32, a certified 8.5 according to my friend John 😂(who is quite hot himself and sleeps his way through our city), make 250k/ year (I don’t disclose this but I think they can tell I do well), very in shape, educated, worldly/cultured/traveled and very fun and outgoing with a huge social group and a ton of hobbies (I ski; do handmade ceramics, play tennis, workout, cook, travel). Super long Blonde hair, brown eyes, 5’4, 118 lbs with boobs and a butt if I do say so myself.

But goddamnit, the more I’ve glowed up in life or in looks, the men who are in my ‘“league’ or the male versions of me are getting chased down the street for dates and therefore they are just too spoiled for choice and won’t commit. 

My male equals (in a romantic match sense) who ARE good men who genuinely like having gfs/wives ALREADY HAVE ONE. They are literally taken.

The only hotties on the apps get too much attention and though we may end up dating for a teeny bit, they just want to keep playing the field.

When I see hotties out in ‘the wild’, they already have a girl by their side. 

There are just so many truly beautiful women (8s and above) and not enough men that can measure up for these super women. It’s so disappointing. There is this holy grail of a man we are ALL looking for, and then we finally think we found him and that man has already let the female attention/endless choice turn him into a fuckboy.

I’m at a loss. I was with someone for five years 4 years ago. SO handsome, so wonderful to me; so funny; so successful. Just all the things. And he was all in from day One, no games. I am over him now and have been for some time (he didn’t want to marry me after all that time, this wasted my half my 20s. but I say this to point out that I just can’t go backwards from that, you know?  I know what it’s like to be truly smitten and insanely in love with a serious catch who fits the things I want.


Anyway. Just venting I guess. I feel like I will have to settle for someone that doesn’t truly light me up sexually or at all, or be alone and never have children, and I just started crying in my therapists office the other day about it.

We hung out three times. The last time we hung out on Halloween night this past Sunday. We went on a ghost tour and everything went great. Afterwards, we went back to her car and just talked and she was all over me and we made out and everything was great. I told her to hit me up when she made it home and she said that she would but she never did. The next day she didn’t message me but we ended up making plans to go to the gym that afternoon. So I texted her around 4:30pm to ask her if she still wanted to go workout. Well she didn’t message me back for like three hours but I creeped and saw that she her Snapchat score kept going up so she was clearly ignoring me. She finally messages me back 3 hours later saying “I’m so sorry, I forgot and I got called into work tonight so I worked out earlier. I apologize.” And i said that it was okay and we just asked each other how are days went and that was that.

The next day we barley text each other and of course she’s putting me on the back burner but her snap score is just steadily going up so I’m just assuming that she’s met someone else at this point and I’m honestly bummed out about it. I mean, the other day we were joking with each other saying about how we have so many tinder people that we’re talking to. Well she ended up saying “nah, I’m not that type of girl” but of course that could be bs. I ended up just not texting her back because she would take hours to respond and she would say “sorry, I’ve been busy” but yet her snap score kept going up.

We broke up approx 18 months ago after six months of dating. The relationship ended suddenly right as things were getting serious (meeting families, saying ILY, keys to apartments, etc.). I was heartbroken. She claimed it was related to a traumatic relationship she had which ended 6 months prior to meeting me. I could tell she was having a hard time.

Well recently, her and I have been reconnecting after not seeing each other for a year. We’ve hung out 4 times in the last 6 weeks. I told her early on I still had strong feelings for her and that she’s the woman I want to be with; and that dating other women felt disingenuous to me. She said it was music to her ears, but also said she had been “seeing” this older guy (42m) for a few months and felt like she should try to make it work with him, despite them having issues “weekly.” He was critical of her, flaked on plans, etc. She told me I might have to “play the long game.”

Well yesterday I sent her a text asking how she was doing and if she had plans for the weekend. She replied that her relationship with the older guy ended a few days earlier and she was reeling a bit, despite it “being for the best” and before any more time was wasted. She said she had been drinking and that she wasn’t telling me all of this because she felt like we needed to re-kindle. She said she’s glad her and I are still friends and that she’s appreciates me and asked if we could hang out at her place or mine this weekend.

The thing is, her and I are not really friends. When I’m with her, I treat her as a love interest (lots of flirting, touching, innuendo, etc.). She knows that I’m in love with her. 

I’m really not trying to be her rebound, but I absolutely do plan on seeing her ASAP. I want an LTR with her, but need some perspective here because I can already feel myself getting worked up over the possibility of getting back together. I understand there are red flags, and I’m considering those, but the heart wants what the heart wants and I can’t help that I’m crazy about her- she’s incredible. How might I proceed so that I can make sure she knows I care about her, but without manipulating the situation.

Any advice and feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

TL;DR: have been reconnecting with my ex gf who I still love. We’ve hung out a few times recently, despite her “seeing” another guy whom she complained about to me. Well they broke up a few days ago and she wants to see me, but also said she wasn’t telling me this to “re-kindle.” I should probably take that at face value, but there’s a ton of chemistry between us still (lots of flirting) and she knows exactly how I feel about her.

While I was dating someone else, he started appearing in classes I took and it was a little uncomfortable though he never said or did anything. Eventually he started dating someone else and I was relieved. 

Reconnected with him years later and he still seemed interested. I remembered his reputation from college and thought of giving him some benefit of doubt. He didn't share a thing about him while I kept talking and turned out he had a gf the whole time. There was definitely flirting between us. They were in a long distance. Had to cut him off but I was hurt. We still share social media space. He broke with his gf and came back and told me he loved me but I don't want to date someone like him. Then he reconnected with his gf and they are back together now. She moved to his country and are probably engaged. They probably never broke up properly and were still in touch. Sounds like a red flag to me. 

His only concern was we weren't in the same place which I could have easily made possible but didn't want to commit so early. He played with my feelings and kept his gf as a safe option. I didn't want to tell him that I could travel or study near wherever he is working. Now he knows that and he is trying to get in touch again and I am divided in two. I never gave it an honest chance but I know he is trouble.

I've also noticed that when you decline to share them, the assumption is  that you're hiding something. Shouldn't one share those when they're ready?

I have seen so many posts about why people can’t get dates, why the community has changed so much, why does everyone wanna sleep around instead of finding a nice long term relationship etc….

Has anyone stopped to really think about that? All the girls say it’s the guys fault. That they are the complete package and guys only want sex, but what is the complete package? Girls make it so hard these days for men to want a relationship. Most are so high maintenance, all about the looks, and think they are high and fucking mighty, but that ruins it for all of the girls who have flaws, the girls who aren’t the whole package and don’t want the whole package. Girls who just want to be loved, but men are so scared about commuting because these high maintenance girls make it IMPOSSIBLE. 

The dating field is changing because people are changing. You can’t expect to always find someone out of your league, and you can’t expect to find the whole Dam package. People have faults, they have issues, and they have flaws, but than all the high class people overlook them, and they don’t even notice the lower class people because they feel they deserve perfection. But there is. No. Perfection. 

Step the hell back and look at the bigger picture. Just because that girl not that perfection doesn’t mean she won’t be a wonderful wife. Just because she is almost perfection doesn’t mean she will be a wonderful wife. 

Just because he isn’t perfect doesn’t mean he won’t be a wonderful husband. Just because he is perfect doesn’t mean he will be the perfect husband. 

Stop letting yourself get so stuck in your head about what you want, that you overlook the one that don’t quite meet the description. Put personality before looks and see what’s really out there. If you can’t find anyone, your either looking in the wrong place, or your looking for the wrong thing.

He seems to be like a great person.

But... he doesn't seem to worry about the future which never even bothered me, to be honest, until earlier today.

He has a job and works 6 hrs a day, he barely sleeps. I assume because he's a gamer. And he's very unproductive (he's admitted and trying to work on this which truly makes me proud)

I'm very supportive when it comes to his life decisions. 2 weeks ago, he decided to stop drinking alcohol. I am so happy for him and told him to do baby steps and don't overwhelm himself.

He also decided to go to a therapist and enroll himself in a gym on his day off, but he didn't because he was lazy and that he hates himself for it. He usually misses his doctor's appointments. I didn't say anything like ""you should take actions"" because I don't want to pressure him. He just stays at home all the time.

On the other hand, I am a very ambitious woman. I work out, I got businesses, I have a lot of hobbies like hiking, travelling, drawing, playing the Ukulele, and most importantly, I work for my future.

So earlier today, I mentioned to him that I like to start another business which is a clothing line. I am a designer. And the response I got was ""Why are you so obsessed with making money?"" I told him that I am planning to buy my own house next year.

He said, house is expensive. I told him that I will need to loan it and will pay for it for 20 yrs and renting is something that I don't want to do forever. He rents an apartment, by the way.

Then he went to telling me that ""I don't know why people is so obsessed over wealth so much!""

I told him that I am not and that I grew up in a poor family, got molested by different people around me who are drug addicts and alcoholics. And I don't want that same thing to happen to my kids someday.

He said that he just wants someone to accept him for who he is... and I was like 🙄🙄 dude, you were the one who's judging me here. I didn't say a single word about how lazy you really are. I didn't, for once, call you out for his negative views in life.

I am not the type of person who can get easily mad about things like this. Because I try to understand the person first. I always tell myself, ""maybe he had a bad experience in the past."" I was super calm all throughout the argument.

And another thing, whenever I ask him ""What's your plan for today?"" (I am literally just asking what's he up to) he seems to get triggered by it. I guess by the word ""plan"" and he thinks that I am calling him out for having such a lazy ass!

But before we end the conversation, he said that he's sorry and that he went back to drinking beer again, that's why. Gosh, he just took all his frustrations out of me.

I told him that if something bothers him, he can try to ask me in a nice way because I'm happy to talk it through and I just don't want to talk to someone who's being driven by so much emotions.

She read it but hasn't given an update over the last 4 days but it looks like her mom is doing fine on social media.

So I hate playing games and I'm no player. I like serious, long-term relationships that have meaning. But to blast back to junior high for a bit, is it bad to be left on read? I know the connotations for each person is different, but in my experience, if a person really even cared or appreciated the other person they would do the decency of replying. I know the potential answers of 'oh she's probably busy' or 'she forgot and maybe she's a bad texter.' But, again, in my experience, this is never the case with girls since they seem overly attached to their phones nowadays (guys too), so there's pretty much no excuse to 'accidentally' forget to reply. I'm just peeved about this since it seems to happen often with a lot of opposite gendered friendships, and it's honestly so childish.

However, recently I started dating a friend and I KNOW they want babies and were in fact talking about having a baby this or next year with their ex partner. 

Even though it is early days, because I know their history and I know they want kids, I've made sure that they know this is out the question for me. I don't want them to have to give up on something to be with me. 

But they offered me a compromise - they'd love to adopt. They would be happy to be the primary care giver/parent and stay at home (theoretically). Surprisingly, I'm actually okay with this. I'm not somebody that typically likes kids all too much but I like them in small doses and I DO make the more money out of the two of us. 

Is this an okay foundation to work with moving forward? Don't want to waste anyone's time. They definitely want to be a dad and I think I would theoretically be okay with this compromise - but is it enough?

I went on a fourth date with a girl I quite liked yesterday, but the whole thing petered out and I don’t think I’ll see her again. Right now I’m in the process of moving on, but I’m not really looking forward to actively trying to date again for several reasons.


1. Online dating is super exhausting to me. As a 25-year-old guy who’s decently attractive but not the top of the pillar, I barely get any matches. And when I do, there is no guarantee that the quality of the conversation is going to be good.


2. I don’t really feel like I have other options. Due to rising Covid cases, public spaces are closing down again and there are no chances for a single person to join any kind of fun activity where you’d just get to meet new people. 


3. I have a hard time meeting people in general. Since my past relationship ended in 2019, I've went on dates with exactly 3 women. At this rate, I won't be able to meet someone who's a good fit for me soon.


4. I’m going to go on an exchange semester in Japan starting in April. This is exciting, but also means that it’s probably a bad idea to again try to find someone because the relationship might not have enough time to develop to survive my time abroad. I’ve had the same line of reasoning half a year before, because my exchange was supposed to start in September. I felt like quite an idiot when it got postponed to April due to Covid.



5. I feel like I’m a romantic failure. I’ve had just two relationships, both of which did not last longer than six months. I’ve been single since about February 2019 and, looking at all my friends, it looks like I’m almost the only one who doesn’t get to play in the game of romance. 



At the same time, I’m also wondering what the point of all this is. How many more years is it going to take? How many more years are the only hugs that I’m gonna get be good-bye hugs?

As someone who’s dealt with social anxiety all my life, growing up I never dated or hung out with guys much. My first kiss wasn’t until I was 21. It only happened because of tinder. I didn’t have a boyfriend or lose my virginity until I was almost 22. Again tinder. My only relationship was very toxic. The feeling of finally being in love kept me in an emotionally abusive relationship for almost 4 years. It’s been 2 years since I broke it off and I haven’t been on a single date. Online dating apps are just not for dating. They’re hookup apps. Either that or you text someone and suddenly communication stops or you never meet up. There’s just too many options.

Unfortunately I don’t go out much because I don’t have many friends (thanks social anxiety) That makes it hard to meet people. It’s usually just me and my best friend. So last night we went out and a guy I matched with was there. It was dark inside and he was with a couple friends. Maybe he didn’t see me. But because of my anxiety I avoided eye contact. I got a drink to relax a bit but by the time I was relaxed he was gone.

This guy has hinted at hanging out a couple times but nothing has been planned. He’s followed me on IG probably a year now. Last time he brought up hanging out I was sick and I haven’t heard from him since. We don’t talk often. Usually just reply to our stories. Anyways, after that encounter I’m like “this is why I’m gonna die alone” lol we were finally in the same room and I expected him to read my mind and come up to me. I just didn’t know what to say or do. My go to is avoiding eye contact and that’s why no one comes up to me. I know it makes me unapproachable. I feel like I’m too old to have this much anxiety around meeting men. Even being asked out online makes me incredibly nervous.

He's actually a really awesome guy and a close friend. 
I don't think I ever had genuine feelings for him, more of a schoolgirl crush. I don't hold anything that happend during our relationship against him, he never pressured me into doing anything.  
He was the first boy to ever show interest in me and the first boy I ever dated. So, one night I was staying at his house along with one of my (at the time) very close female friends and throughout the night we were drinking. My female friend constantly pressured us to have sex and make out etc. So eventually, once I was quite intoxicated I agreed to give him head. 
My friend did not leave the room while this happened and due to nervousness from both me and the guy it didn't go very well. He didn't finish, I didn't stop because I felt like he had to finish or else I was doing something wrong but he never did. 
I don't remember much of what happened after this point but when I woke up my underwear was halfway down my legs. They told me what happened (we did not have sex, I know this for a fact) I went to take a shower, washed my mouth out with water multiple times and started shaking and crying. I felt like I had done something horrible.
 I have never told anyone about this.

We're both aren't into casual and I believe we want to take things slowly. There wasn't any intimacy such as touching other than hugging when saying hello and goodbye.

I've asked her if she fancied doing somethign again and awaiting a response, although that was a few hours ago so my hunch may be no second date. I hope if it is rejection it is rejection with an answer rather than ghosting.

They even talk about spending their parent's money freely and only wanting to go on vacation if their parents or someone else is paying, even as grown adults. There seems to be no shame. Personally, I feel extremely uncomfortable if someone (anyone, male or female) is paying for me - I won't stop them if they offered but I'll be more likely to want to repay the favor and quickly. 

For the girls I've gone out with, not only have the majority never offered to pay, even for themselves, some have even said ""I want this but you'll have to pay for it"". Granted, when that happened, the item itself wasn't too pricy, but it was the action itself that was strange. 

Another girl recently basically said that she's only coming out for a date (that she suggested and picked the location) that I pick her up from her place (1 hour drive) then take her to the location (40 minutes from my house / 1hr40min from hers, with my house in the middle between hers and the date location), and then drive her back home. I suggested other options like taking a cab, or taking the train and she asked why I was making it such an issue and that her suggestion was ""more convenient"". Of course, she didn't say that it was only 'more convenient for **her**'. 

Lastly, a friend of mine (girl) told me about a dinner date she had with her friends (all girls). Apparently, they wanted to split the bill evenly and my friend refused, saying ""why should I pay for drinks I didn't drink or food that I didn't eat?"" I suggested she keep that same energy when the next guy takes her on a date and she laughed and said ""no way, the guy is paying for everything"".

TLDR, I'm just wondering how and why there are so many girls out there that would spend guy's time and money freely, but won't do the same themselves.

Anyway, I didn’t want to pry or anything and so I just told her I was sorry to hear and said to call if she needed someone to talk to.

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, she texted me about hanging out in our friend group last night. She told me that the rest of the girls knew about her break up (I’m the only guy in this group fwiw) so I at least knew everyone knew about it when we got together. She called me about two hours before we were all expected to hang out and told me that she would talk more about it when she saw me in person and were together. 

Anyway, I went over to one of the girls houses prior to us all hanging out and this particular girl (Katie) is one that I’m interested in courting and so her and I were together. The others ended up canceling due to other commitments that came up last minute so it ended up just being me and Katie so it was kind of like an unofficial date. I called the girl who had the break up and told them everyone else canceled but that me and Katie were still planning to go out and so I invited her to come with us. She initially said that even though Katie and I are not actually a couple, she would feel awkward being around us because she’d feel like a third wheel. I told her I understood but still encouraged her to come with us so she could clear her head a bit. 

Long story short, she decided to come along, so Katie and I went over to her place to pick her up. Shortly after, I asked ‘so tell me what happened’… I assumed it was safe to ask since the other girls already knew and she had told me we’d talk once we got together. Anyway, she became uncomfortable after that and later told me she was taken back that I’d ask about her breakup in front of Katie and said the whole night was uncomfortable for her and that she felt awkward. I heavily apologized and said I didn’t mean to make her feel uncomfortable, as I thought it was safe to ask considering Katie knew and she also told me we’d talk once her and I were together in person. 

Do you think Katie would’ve thought I was a jerk for asking about our friends breakup? And was I in the wrong to ask about it? Bear in mind we’re all close friends, so I didn’t think it was the wrong time to ask. I told Katie afterward that I felt bad bringing that up but thought it was safe and she didn’t seem like it was a big deal and kind of brushed it off.

TLDR; I brought up a break up with one of our mutual friends and it made the whole night out feel awkward.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124152,public,self,Did I 25M screw up badly?
