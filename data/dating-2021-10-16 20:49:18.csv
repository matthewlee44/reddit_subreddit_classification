We did talk everyday though (with good morning and good night texts). We did only go on 2 dates between July - now. 

I didn‚Äôt think the infrequency of our dates was a red flag, because we are almost 30 and we‚Äôre pretty clear each other we are also prioritizing building our social relationships and careers, make extra $ on the side etc. 

So it wasn‚Äôt really a big deal to me. We also never agreed to exclusivity. She‚Äôs in her right choice who she chooses to date, I‚Äôm just sad it didn‚Äôt end up being me. 

I want to use this hurt as a learning experience because I did really like texting her everyday and it kind of sucks that won‚Äôt continue. I did feel we were progressing naturally but our own pace in the relationship as we also both communicated early on that we are looking for serious partners. I personally would rather gradually get to know the person (like if you fell for a friend or mutual acquaintance) because of helps me get to know a little who they are before I decide to be romantic or intimate. 

The fact that I met her on a dating app, I was totally fine with the pace of things. But in the future should I pay more attention to where things are landing on a timeline to remind myself to hold my feelings?

Anyway, when I get a match, and its someone I actually find attractive, I'll legit message ""Ayy what do u like to do for fun?""

I can't imagine sending some ""clever"" pickup line, or something about their profile unless it has something that I know about it (if they have a cat, maybe I'll say ""that's a cute fucking cat""). 

I get messages back doing this. I'll talk for a bit, then if its going smoothly I'll ask for their snap, then ask em on a date.

My view on first messages is if they don't even want to start a convo about what they, themselves, enjoy doing, what the hell *do* they want to talk about? 

I honestly think its the best thing to say apart from asking about something I know in their profile. 

Do people actually get success sending copy/paste pickup lines? I feel like I hear about that a lot, and it sounds pretty lame.

I seriously do not remember this being much of a problem when I was younger. I've been in three relationships before but they were never from online dating. Anyways, the problem I'm currently experiencing (if it's even a problem) is that I've gone on dates with roughly 10 people and when they find out I still live with family, they start acting cold with me. I take it that there may be better alternatives and guys out there who do have their own place.

For context, I am an individual who comes from a lower socioeconomic class but I currently make $75K, I own a car and I've completed a Bachelor's degree in commerce. I have plans to move out and buy my own condo in the future, but as it's still COVID, I do not see a need to move out until I find a relationship and a girl worth staying with. I'm often met with expressions like ""how come you still live with family?"" or ""when will you move out"" with which I'll answer with the aforementioned - COVID and there is no ""need"" to move out yet. I work from home and so having a nicer condo would not add any material benefit for me.

Being a demisexual, its hard for me to physically connect with someone without forming an emotional connection first. Anyway, so I met this guy on a dating app. We hit it off really well and he asked me out for a second and a third date. We connected so well on our first and the second date that at the end of the second date we made out and all. By the third date, I figured since he was vulnerable enough to kiss me, it was okay for me to share something incredibly personal with him. This was me trying to establish an emotional connection and maybe trying to see if he can be a safe space for me to discuss my past trauma/issues etc (which is incredibly important for me if we were to continue dating).

I was literally in his arms when I told him that I was molested as a child and that had left me pretty scarred. His response was, ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù. Yes, he just blurted that out. Immediately afterwards he was like, too soon but I am sorry that happened. I was so embarrassed about the whole thing. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I decided to share something so incredibly personal with him and he just brushed it off like that. It seemed incredibly insensitive. Needless to say, I was quiet throughout the rest of the date and left as soon as it ended. He obviously understood that his reaction affected me, however he did not bring it up/did not apologize for being so insensitive. 

I have not heard from him ever since. At first I felt like I might have overreacted, so I sent him a meme over text to initiate communication. He just left a one word response lol. Clearly, I scared him away. 

I was wondering if I was over-sharing considering it was our third date? Or was he just emotionally unavailable and just wanted to hook up? The way he spoke about things made it seem like he genuinely wanted something more than a hookup. Anyway, that was me ranting. Why the heck on earth does dating have to be so complicated?

Hello everyone, my name is Niji, and I'm seventeen years old and in my senior year of high school. I'm curious as to how I should go about  maintaining a relationship. I've read articles where most of them mention meeting others in public places, but I wouldn't consider myself a social butterfly, and that might be harder to do with the virus in the picture. 

Not to mention the fact that I don't have that many friends in school, so I don't think what I say or do would make a difference even if I tried putting myself out there. 

It may seem like something out of a teen movie, but there are those of us who spend our free time playing video games, the gorgeous girls who gossip, apply their makeup, or browse tiktok, and the students who are just plain crazy who scream bizarre things in the hallway as we walk to our next class xD

I don't see myself becoming apart of any of these groups. 

When the kids in my class talk about their boyfriends /girlfriends and how happy they are with them, I can't help but feel like something is missing for myself. So precious. And I want that as well, but I always seem to mess up. Relationships only lasting for a few days, and when we've had enough of each other, we pretend that the other doesn't exist, passing by wherever we are without even saying ""Hello"" or ""Goodbye."" 

It's very frustrating, and it makes me feel like I'm not deserving of love because I'm not as attractive as the girls in magazines; I'm short, pudgy, and not very bright, and to top it off, the boys who message me on social media start their messages with ""You're cute, but you'd look even better if...""

We started talking again, and then over labor day weekend he came to visit me, and has come to see me every weekend since (he loves almost 2 hours away). We would kiss and cuddle and do all kinds of coupley stuff but never got around to talking about where this was going. But we would make future plans and everything. 

So yesterday, he randomly blocked me on Facebook and stopped texting me back in the middle of the day.

MOVE ON!! I get it, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to why women do this. So‚Ä¶

Known her since high school but we almost never talked. I never desired her but something happened this week when I ran into her and she totally ignored me, I didn‚Äôt care cause she‚Äôs basically a Snapchat friend and nothing else, later she hit me up saying she was stoned out of her mind and she was sorry for being rude, I said it was all good and she should slide me some (just to make convo). And she texted back saying that we should smoke together someday. I said I was down, and so that same day we had a mutual friend send out an invite to each of us (how convenient) to a house party and I said I‚Äôd see her there. So we‚Äôre both there but we‚Äôre hanging with different circles and I leave without making a move since I‚Äôm not really intrested and also was pretty buzzed, But she hmu later saying that I left her hanging and I told her she should‚Äôve left her friends and come to talk to me. She responded and said we should really get together sometime and smoke, but also says how she prefers to drink and how she‚Äôs game for both and that I don‚Äôt know her when she‚Äôs drunk ( she includes all types of flirty emojis) 
And so now I‚Äôm intrigued and I‚Äôm thinking all I gotta do is give her a date and it‚Äôs a sure thing since she‚Äôs being very straight forward on seeing me. So I text her saying saying i sure don‚Äôt know who she is when she‚Äôs drunk and that we should link next Friday and find out. Well it‚Äôs been 2 days and she hasn‚Äôt responded. Any reason why?

It got so bad and the school did nothing so he switched schools and I hadn‚Äôt seen him for almost 8 years I think. I reconnected with him recently and I went with him and his mom a few weeks ago to a Renaissance Festival and it was really fun. But according to his and my mom texting, he has a crush on me. I have very low self-esteem and so I don‚Äôt think any guy will ever love me, that I‚Äôm too ugly for a bf, blah blah blah you get the idea. That also means that I doubt if someone likes me or not.

I don‚Äôt really believe that because I also want to hear it from him to confirm it or to know that he told his mom that he likes me.

So i have many female friends that are in a relationship or still looking.

But the thing is i noticed that (i live in asia btw so here being light/white skin is always associated with beauty and higher social status) these girls believe being pretty and beautiful is to have whiter skin and they would sometime put on make up that make thier skin look lighter than normal, taking supplement like collagen and avoiding/blocking the sun so they don't get sunburn.

However, when it comes to thier partner these girls like thier partner to be dark skinned and are not into lighter skinned/white skin guy as much or at all. And they confirmed it to me when i asked them about it and they said "" yes we prefer darker skin person more"" and others said "" we only want dark skinned person"". Funny thing is when we were looking at pictures on the internet we saw a picture of an African couple and they said the African dude look attractive but the female not so much despite the model in the picture being fit girl and lighter skinned than her male counterparts. (Forgive them please i try to promote skin colour acceptance and positivity to them)

This shocked me because white worshipping is very prevalent in asia and yet i found girls like these and recently i have seen increase in it even among many girls i know in the past who are racist/colourist against dark skinned person have changed thier taste and mindset.

66,q9uwao,1634460197,Girlfriend and Daddy Issues,"So I (24M) been dating my girl (19F) for a few months now. Maybe I was naive, maybe the psychological stereotype of daddy issues are just random jargon, but she asked me out and made quite a few moves in the relationship.

She's never been in a relationship before, nor even kissed a guy. Yet before we even started dating, she told me about fantasies of kissing me.

Anyway, over time, as I got to know her, I couldn't help but tick the boxes of common traits girls with daddy issues have. She was overly attached and put me on a pedestal initially (still does but not at the same level). She has never had any sexual experience but probably makes more moves than me. She enjoys getting attention from men, and likes if they flirt with them (though she never flirts back).

The biggest sign would be ""She started telling me about her dad and I've met her parents and I can see she doesn't like her dad"".

Anyway, while I'm not heads over hells in love, but I would still want to put in the effort to make it work if there's hope, specially since for now, things between us are good.

However, I've noticed that once I started showing affection or stop being indifferent to her, she has reduced the efforts on her end. While I don't want to be put on a pedestal, but being made feel appreciative by your SO is nice sepcially since they made you used to it by doing it at the start.

Her mother told her once ""Your boyfriend is too nice. He must be hiding something""

I wondered if being nice (not a pushover), just a romantic is actually a turn off for girls with daddy issues. Whether I should be worried about infidelity owing to constant need of seeking attention from men.

She's talked a lot about our future, I'm the first guy she's had most of her firsts with (kiss, sex, nightout, long trips, meeting parents etc)

Then later on she developed fictive alters based on ficitonal characters she liked and did a lot of reading about DID. She actively looked around for people who had fictive alters she liked and found one person with DID who had a fictive alter for Loki, who she is a fangirl of. She then told me that some DID people date multiple people. Her alter then developed a crush on Loki and she asked me if they could date.

 I did hear her out and explain to her that I would be comfortable stepping back and taking a break to let her explore this relationship her alter is interested in. But I would not be comfortable with her alter dating someone else at the same time she is dating me. She didn't understand my perspective and tried to persuade me/guilt trip me that it shouldn't affect us. The thing that bothered me was that she herself (not her alter) was very emotionally invested in her alter having a relationship this loki. She said she was hurt that the two relationships couldn't happen at the same time, but also said she didn't want to break up.

So it was pretty clear it was affecting us.  I felt like she liked the loki too to an extent. I feel weird about the whole thing, like I'm not enough but she doesn't know what she wants. I don't know how to get rid of this feeling this isn't what she wants. Am I being gaslighted? Am I being insensistive? Or does she just need to figure out what she wants?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9vc2u/my_girlfirend_has_did_and_asked_me_if_her_other/

However, we've been moving very fast, meeting every 2 days or so (mostly because she'd ask me to meet). We definitely have a strong connection and like each other a lot. We've been physical with each other pretty much every time we've met up (might not have been the best thing to do?) and recently I went over to her house to watch a movie and met her parents in the process (meeting her parents and having dinner with her family wasn't part of the original movie plan, more like a last minute thing).

Anyways, she definitely likes me a lot and wants me, but she told me that she's unsure if she wants a relationship and be tied down, but at the same time she wants a relationship and give her love to one person. She says it could be her anxiety affecting her (her doc recently increased her medication a little). She also said that she's afraid of guys leaving her because of her anxiety, or scaring me away, or that she'll be single forever. I told her not to compare past relationships or thoughts to what is real and in front of her. I am me and I want to show her who I am. (I realise that telling someone not think of a pink elephant will not help them not picture a pink elephant: could I approach her insecure thoughts differently to reassure her better?). I told her to take some time to think about things and get back to me. 

If anyone has experience with anxiety or anything related or just any helpful advice, I would love to know what I can do to make things easier for her. I want her to feel comfortable and not add to her uneasiness. She says she feels comfortable, safe and happy when she's with me, but then when I'm not there those negative thoughts start coming in. I want to know what the best course of action is to help get through this as I truly care about her and want things to last with her. I'm okay with slowing things down (any advice as to what exactly that means or looks like?), or anything else anyone may suggest. She doesn't want to lose me and I don't want to lose her.

No one needs to  give me the speech. I've seen enough comments about black women. I've heard enough about  that OkCupid study. But, he was so negative, that it made me wonder whether I show a similar negative attitude. I don't say angry things, but I probably say or do things that expose  my low self-esteem.

One of the  guy's complaints was that dark-skinned South Asians aren't seen as attractive. I'm not well versed on the topic, but I know colorism also exists in Asian communities. But the thing is, I actually do find dark-skinned South Asian men attractive, but he was so negative and angry, that I didn't even want to share what could've been a confidence booster for him.

74,q9w3ta,1634466164,I really need some solid dating advice!,"Context: 19m, Uni student, British Indian 

I‚Äôm gonna preface this simply. I‚Äôve never been in anything close to a relationship and I‚Äôve never had any kind of sexual encounter before. 
This is not due to a lack of not wanting these things, I honestly don‚Äôt know what my problem is. Bad luck maybe? 

For everyone out there, I genuinely feel like I have no game whatsoever. When I was younger my Dad was often busy at work so I spent most of my time in the house with my Mum and older sister. 
I can‚Äôt help but feel like this has caused me to be almost like too respectful of women, which sounds absurd, but its the only way I can describe how I feel. 

I feel like I grew up believing that sex was something very special for everyone involved and that there is no rush to for it to happen. I was taught that love and relationships, are difficult but worth it with the right person. Put both of these together, and I‚Äôm basically a hopeless romantic.  

As I said before this is not for a lack of not wanting these things, I‚Äôm not just waiting and doing nothing. Everyday around Uni, I‚Äôm always trying to talk to people, using a cold approach isn‚Äôt easy, but I always try to let the conversation happen naturally. I do the same thing in bars and clubs too. 

I know that OLD is an option I could take but I really don‚Äôt want to use apps. Tbh a lot of my friends, men and women, have congratulated me on not resorting to apps as they can be really toxic and often do more harm than good. 

I‚Äôve worked pretty hard on improving myself as a person and have some things going for me, aside from studying Economics. I‚Äôm a rapper, I‚Äôm learning Guitar, I go gym, I don‚Äôt drink or do any drugs, I love movies and I like gaming. 

It‚Äôs taken me a while to reach a point where I have enough confidence to even attempt talking to someone I find attractive. I‚Äôve been through tough times myself as I was diagnosed with a chronic condition at age 16, I lost a lot of confidence then. 
But still I think that being resilient and bouncing back from something like that is an admirable quality about myself. 

The problem is, I have a really difficult time reading the signs, I can never differentiate between whether a woman is just being friendly or flirty, and I usually I just assume the former for two reasons. It‚Äôs less risky to assume friendly behaviour and attempt to become friends first before anything else happens and second because I have no idea how to respond to a someone flittering with me, like how do I flirt back without just seeming creepy if this is a woman I‚Äôve only just met!? 

I‚Äôve spoken to a lot of my friends and family (older cousins) and they say I‚Äôm doing the right thing, and that when it happens it happens. 
But as everyday goes by and I‚Äôm still a virgin and still without partner, it does damage my confidence a little and causes some really bad thoughts. Eg. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just unattractive‚Äù 

I really feel like I‚Äôm just waiting for someone fo ‚ÄúTake a chance on me‚Äù, like the song from ABBA. But so far, I haven‚Äôt met anyone willing to get to know me as more than a friend!

And it was a great date imo, we talked for over 3 hours over coffee and we only ended the date because it was getting late and she needed to grab the bus home. When the bus came we hugged goodbye and she kissed me on the cheek unexpectedly.

We texted after that when she confirmed that she had fun, and asked if I wanted to have a second date, to which I said sure.

But I got a cold so yesterday we scheduled it for this coming Thursday because that's the only time she was available, because of her school and job. Totally understandable.

And today we were just talking like regular, just having fun, and then she hit me with, ""You are a great guy, and I like you but I'm not ready to date now, maybe later.....queue excuses"".

77,q9wlcr,1634468511,Tips for having tough conversations to end early dating,"A couple of months ago I (28M) started seeing a lady (30F) and we'd hit it off pretty well. We met in the OLD sphere so I had a few conversations going however things were feeling good so I slowly stopped swiping and discontinued any other conversations I had going......except for one

&amp;#x200B;

I matched with this other lady (28F) at about the same time but due to COVID limitations within my city it was impossible for us to meet, but our conversation was something great. We were finally able to meet last month and we have immediately formed a connection, it's something intangible. I never trust pre-date texting will be carried over into actual seeing each other hence I was expecting her to not live up to the hype and it to just resolve itself then and there 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that it's a month down the track I think I've had enough time to feel like the latter is who I have feelings for, she's the one I think about late at night or when love based songs come on. But I'm not good at having these conversations when things aren't bad. Previous times I've had to have these conversations there's always been a reason related to the person, something ""wrong"" in the dating scenario. This time I have no where to hide, nothing to point to as a problem, it's just me and my personal preferences

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible because I've met her parents and some of her friends while also not having a ""proper"" dating experience because of COVID (we're actually about to be able to go to restaurants again) I'm in a vortex of feeling like I've wasted her time but then not wanting to have that conversation which would compound the first point further. I've tried to convince myself that it's reasonable for me to keep dating both of them as things open up because it's a more real experience of dating but deep down I know I'd be doing that hoping for the situation to resolve itself rather than from a position of sincerity

&amp;#x200B;

I (F/20) hooked up with a guy a couple of weeks ago who goes to the same faculty as me in uni. I've found him interesting since the first time I saw him and at a party one thing led to another and we hooked up. After that I felt a bit off because I would really want to get to know him, so one week after we hooked up I added him on snap and just asked him out (with no expectations) and he said yes, very happily also. Last week and this upcoming week we are both busy with a lot of other stuff so we just decided that we have to do it when we can later on. Good to know is that I was very very anxious about asking him out, because rejection is something I very much fear and I'm just an anxious person when it comes to dating, so I was really really happy when he said yes and i felt proud over myself that I did ask him out. Fast forward one week, we have barely spoken on snap (I'm not really an active snapchat-user in the sense of keeping contact everyday with someone) and he yesterday randomly asked if i'm going out partying, and I said yes and he started asking where we're going (because I was with some mutual friends we have). Finally when he and his friends come and join the bar where a lot of people from our faculty is, he barely speaks to me. I have to give him attention to even look at me and it all felt very weird. We had a nice five minute chat, but that was it throughout the whole evening (that I initiated). I guess he's playing hard-to-get but it just felt so ridiculous? Like why did he not talk to me or seem like he wanted to talk to me, when he two hours earlier eagerly asked when and where I was gonna be. I don't require anything from anyone but it just surprised me how little he seemed to care that I was there. Then he just disappeared to another bar with some other people and I felt a little awkward the whole evening after that.  I feel like the hard to get method is just annoying and it frustrates me that we are kind of learned that it works (sometimes it maybe does) , so people if you are interested in someone please just tell them.

Prior to meeting up I (20F) explicitly told him that I was ideally aiming for something that could lead to a committed relationship. His reply was quite vague, a ‚ÄòI‚Äôll see where this goes‚Äô kinda message. 

Anyway, we met up for a pint, he was pretty chill in person so I (looking back at it, stupidly) asked him ‚Äòwhere did he want this to go‚Äô midway through. Got the same reply. Later on, both of us went over to my flatmates to play cards (it was a split second ‚Äòwhy not‚Äô decision, both of us were tipsy). 

Unexpectedly, all people involved got astronomically trashed on vodka. However, both of us managed to stay composed and avoid any awkwardness all the way through the night. Fast forward to 4:00am, he‚Äôs about to leave, I go along to lead him out. All of a sudden, despite giving zero hints throughout the night, he is persistently pushing for sex with all sorts of questionable phrases like ‚Äòawww I know you‚Äôre not dtf, but I can just show you my room‚Äô. We‚Äôre kissing, (with him occasionally choking me, which was a red flag as stuff like this is usually discussed prior) but I repeatedly tell him that tonight is really not the night for anything more and that I don‚Äôt want to ruin anything more serious that could potentially develop between us. 

My drunk horny brain is torn between sabotaging a potential relationship and wanting physical affection. We ended up spooning (no sex) in my bed.

Right now, I can‚Äôt remember everything I said to him or everything he said to me and whether he understood my reasons for not wanting sex. I regret not giving a better explanation in the moment as I really did not want to blow my chance at something more serious than a hookup/fwb.

He has a porn addiction but no sex drive. I guess I don't want to delve to far into the topic, but our sex life is a fiasco.

Context is I'm a 29 year old guy from the east coast that got divorced in 2019, working on my bachelor's degree, recently moved in with friends because I can only find crappy jobs.

97,q9yniy,1634477032,Why are men not replying to messages right away when they are obviously active online?? I don‚Äôt get it.,"I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for like 2 months or so. We have talked about ghosting etc before so I think we were clear on that. But recently he‚Äôs been ignoring my messages and would reply, say, 15hours later. I know he‚Äôs busy and all, but it wouldn‚Äôt take that long to type a quick reply right? Thing is, he‚Äôd text few days after, apologizing, and making excuses I don‚Äôt know anymore if it‚Äôs the truth. Like, I can see he‚Äôd be online from time to time but he just won‚Äôt reply. If you‚Äôre not interested anymore just say so and I‚Äôll be gone. Don‚Äôt come back few days later apologizing then doing the same old shit again.

98,q9yqqe,1634477331,Killing time or is he interested?,"After a long 2 year break from dating (partly due to Covid) I (31F) have decided to get back on dating apps and start swiping. 

There's someone (34M) who I've matched with that I think I like, and we've been speaking for the last 8 days, no more than a message (usually quite a long one) a day is exchanged. It's alot slower than what I have seen previously and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just that match he speaks to on the side, while he goes out on other dates with matches he has a greater preference for. 

The lack of pace hasn't been terrible, in fact it's a little refreshing to be able to chat a bit before getting asked out for a drink. But in total, because it's only a message a day, it's not even been a large amount of talking.  I'm wondering if I've just ended up liking someone who just isn't that into me and maybe it's worth just leaving this and finding someone else to talk to?

Am I being silly? Would love to know what anyone thinks. 

Thank you in advance for reading",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9yqqe/killing_time_or_is_he_interested/
99,q9yvcg,1634477797,Realistic or Idealistic?," I would like to spend the rest of my life with someone that cares and loves me, beyond the physical. It would be a deep soul connect, the type of connection when we meet it's feels like we've know each other all of our lives. I guess I want to love someone unconditionally and for someone to love me unconditionally. An equal/equitable and supportive partnership.

Also:
I posted this before in another subreddit, but I would like to know how you all feel about this.
I know not everyone want this from a relationship. But, what better place than to post this on Reddit?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9yvcg/realistic_or_idealistic/
