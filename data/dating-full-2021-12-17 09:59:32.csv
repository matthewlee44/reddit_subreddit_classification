The reason of our breakup wasnt because of a fight we have the healthiest relationship that anyone could ask for and hes loyal faithful and loving to me. The reason we broke up was cause my conservative muslim parents knew that i was dating him and i was physically involved with him, i had to cut him off and stop talking to him as my parents confiscated all my stuff (laptop,phone) and going out was extremely hard as my mom always has to know exactly who im going with and where and all of that, that all happened because of him, now things got better and i gained their trust back and even more. Im an 2004 girl and he’s an 2002 guy so im a senior in hs and he’s a 2nd yr college student. I don’t think the age gap is that much of a difference since i knew him before he got into college and other than that i’ll be turning 18 in 2022 and i’ll be in the same university. The problem here is that we’re texting everyday now and talking yet i dont think i’ll be able to see him much, and when i do i’ll always be paranoid and anxious to get caught by my parents and my life goes back to hell again. My thing is, i dont want to be texting him everyday and not being able to be around him as that makes me go thru double the pain than not texting him at all, however next year when i get into uni my life would be easier and i would be around him much more often. So is it alright if i open this topic with him? That i dont want to talk to him while im not able to be around him as much? In addition to that, he dated a very toxic girl in our yr break up and told me he had to go thru a lot of ppl to get over me, and the last girl he dated he had sex with (which isnt something common usually the extreme is just making out) and he used to spend 24/7 with her cause she ranaway from her house for 50days, he told me he nevwr actually liked her and never saw anyth long term with her due to her unstableness and how she used to threaten him that she’ll ruin her life, tell her parebts that he had sex with her so that her parents kill him (honour killing in arab countries read abt it) and her for committing such a sin. However she didnt do that and she’s in the same uni and gym as him and she did that on purpose to be around him more often sonce she’s severely attached and has BPD, he says he wants nothing to do with her since shes toxic and unstable and he says he wants to be around me for comfort. I don’t know what to do. Should i stop talking to him till i graduate (in june) and make sure my life is stable and my parents trust me and stop myself from gettibg hirt emotionally from missing him too much, or should i just keep on texting him and meeing up with him like once a month when i get the chance ? Then make things official again when i can be around him very more often when i get into university? What do u guys think about this whole situation i would really love some advice.

I know, it’s immature) Turns out he was going to break up with me but I’ll get into that later. So we broke up but I’ll admit, I still really liked him. 

We didn’t talk during those 6 months unless it had to do with school however I’m moving schools and these past few weeks we’ve started talking again and have been talking a lot (He told me he missed talking to me and that I have no idea how many times he opened our chat to start a conversation but just didn’t know what to say), flirting a little (calling each other cute etc…) and it came out last night that he still likes me and that I still like him. I asked him about our breakup and he said that he was only awkward because he was going to break up with me because  he wanted me to be happy because he thought I wasn’t with him (He overthinks a lot like I do) and that I’d be much better off with someone else (I absolutely adored him before and still do). He’s very pessimistic and has a “even if I wanted to/there’s no point” attitude. He constantly said this whenever I joked about getting back together (This is a pretty common thing for us to do)

Now that it’s come out that we still like each other, he said that we shouldn’t get back together because “He doesn’t think he’s good enough for me and he can’t give me the time or affection I deserve” (His words) I told him the opposite; how great I thought he was and yeah- he debated with me and I debated with him. He ended saying “Let's both move on and be happy with other people” (He thinks that I’ll be happier that way, which I won’t and I’m not sure if he truly wants that either) 

I really like this boy. Anytime I see him/talk ok to him, my heart skips a beat and I honestly can’t help but smile like an idiot. He’s pretty much my best friend (but I wouldn’t tell him that) and not talking to him those past 6 months was like torture to me because I just missed him so much.

I look around and see people in stable relationships/ marriage and it now making me bitter. I am happy for them but I want the same for me too. Why can’t I find the right man ? Why can’t things fall in place for me ? I am just tired of this entire process and tbh of life too. Life is meant to be lived happily not in this constant search. It is such a pleasant feeling to have someone in life who will be there for you??

Just me and my girlfriend, no side women/men, no threesomes just personal 1 on 1 connection. (Even though i was never opposed to my girlfriend to have another girl involved if she pleased.) We dated for about 1 year when i invited her to live with me in my apartment. Things were going good, we saw a lot more of each other obviously and i was happy about it, even though i do like my personal space. She was happy to because she had her own place (my place) for the first time. 

Now I always had my friends and family over and she was popular and had many of her friends over. That's fine, I liked to hang out with different people and smoke some weed and just watch movies, eat food, play games and chill. But she had one friend who i always just kicked it off with. Her best friend. (You ever just meet someone you completely just vibe with and it's not even like you are trying to it just is happening?) yea it was like that which i thought was cool. She had a boyfriend for 3 years and he hated me, but also besides the point. 

So one day my gfs friend comes over by herself and was hanging out with my gf in my room. I was in the front room drinking a red bull about to finish a raid in destiny. (Great video game) when my gf calls me in and says hey do you want to smoke a dab with us? (My team was under level to finsh the raid so i called it quits on the game) so they were on the bed sitting legs crossed like the weirdos they were. (Like who sits on a bed completely? I always sit on it with my feet touching the floor or lay down) my gf then gets up and says she has to use the restroom. 

So this is were it gets interesting. As soon as she leaves her friend comes closer to me on the bed and grabs my inner knee. (I'm like freshly stoned like 30 seconds after i took a dab) so i'm like looking at her hand and then her and then back at her hand and eventually i said what are you doing? She looked at me and moved her hand further up my inner thigh. At that point i said ""are you nuts my gf is in the next room and you can't do this"" (when i said you can't do this i was trying to say you can't do this to her because they were best friends.)

Without a moment later my gf opens the door and is like ""you passed!""

I passed???

I was pissed, like i am not the smartest person but I instantly knew what she meant by that. She then explained that she thought i might be cheating on her and she set up the whole thing to see if i would go for it. I acted chill but i was pretty angry. I always gave her my attention, she was with me like 24/7 besides when she worked and when i was working. (Like i said i am a one girl kind of guy, i don't even text other girls or flirt or anything like that, she had no reason to think the way she did. ) i felt very distrusted and would never plan something like that on my significant other. ( and i thought i had issues trusting people before lol) 

Anyways has this every happen too you? And what do you even say or how would you handle it?

We tried to talk it through, and he said how in situations like that he doesn’t always know what to say, he didn’t expect such a deep answer, and he doesn’t do well with death.

I wasn’t sure what to feel after that, because I felt like I had messed up by telling the story?

Then we part ways, it was happy, he kissed me goodbye. Told me to text him once I got home.

Nothing will ruin a promising relationship quicker than needy, insecure behavior. Some know this, many others don't. Here are some tips.

By date 2 or date 3, encourage her to keep meeting new people. Say something like, ""I want you to he sure"" or ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" After that, shush! Don't mention your other dates or ask about hers. If she says something like ""they are all weirdos,"" act uninterested and gently change the subject. Offer no information. If she teases you about your dates, feel free to compliment her, but do not mention dating. If she says something 

Try to limit dating to once per week before you have sex. Don't text her on her weekend day to herself, and ask few questions. Also, after the first date, do not accept an afternoon meetup, e.g., where she will see you Saturday afternoon, but has plans Saturday evening. Even if you are dying to see her, tell her you are busy, but next week is fine. If she expresses frustration with her schedule, tell her to get back to you, and discourage offers from her to change her plans. You may think a gap of 14 days will kill your momentum. It won't. If she is interested, it will only push you up. 

Understand other men are no threat to you. Most of her dates will be duds. If someone interesting reaches out, let her do the date. She will most likely walk out wanting you more, and if she doesn't, it wasn't meant to be. The only exception is an ex or a ""friend"" she mentions too often. In that case, do ask questions, because she may not be worth your time.

If she takes down her online profile, or says that she did, you can take take down yours, but don't say that you did unless she asks.

After you have sex, or immediately before, she may straight up ask if you're seeing other people. In that case if you want a relationship tell her she is only one.

My partner (let’s call her Green for the sake of ease; now ex-partner) and I had been dating for 6 months prior to the week just gone. We’d been best mates since meeting each other 16 months ago, when at the time she was with a S/O as was I. I broke up with my S/O and then months later my conversations with green had turned from friendly conversations into conversations that she was deleting evidence of overnight from her S/O- I’d wake up with notifications most mornings saying that messages were no longer available. 

Anyhow, as we both knew that something was potentially ahead for us, she broke up with her S/O and we started dating and entered into a physical relationship almost instantly. 
Things were great; we shared similar interests and values by word of mouth. She loved a few of the same things I loved, she bounced off of my energy and passion for fitness and started training and eating right; I started spending more time with nature, eating plant-based food occasionally with her at dinners, started writing a journal- much like she did. We vibed. 

Green was 20 and myself 26. Age didn’t bother either of us. I was very much still 21 at heart and she very mature and grown for her age, at least I thought. 
Green always had her notifications off for all of her social media apps, meaning when she received a message, it didn’t show on the Lock Screen. As for messages from numbers, no previews were shown either. Totally cool by me, never questioned anything. Would maybe glance over at each other’s phones every now and again but never went through each other’s phones, although I gave her my passcode and had previews/notifications on at all times. 

Green throughout the entire relationship was a very much focus on today kind of girl, and didn’t have much time or thought for the future. I like to think of myself as the same, however I’m always super conscious about taking into account my future and the future of my relationship into most/all my decision making and like to plan things. 
Green had been planning a trip in a campervan, a round-Australia trip, which I wanted to be a part of. This has been a dream of hers since the age of 15, to solo travel. I don’t blame her, I did exactly the same at 21, I came to Australia as an English backpacker myself, now I’ve been here almost 6 years. 
Green always told me she wasn’t sure if she wanted to still go alone or take me with her. Some days she’d speak of a future together, and our time ‘on the road’, and the next day she’d confuse herself and be unsure of what the future held. This was frustrating for me, as I wanted security and a future with Green. At least she was being transparent. I told her, as did her friends, that if she’s having doubts, it’s best to end things now rather than the week before ‘our trip’ as it would be harsh on me. Time went by and we stopped focussing on the now and just enjoyed every day as it came. We worked the same job at the same bar/restaurant- and we lived together. 

A few months into the relationship, one night she was drunk and told me she missed her ex-boyfriend (let’s call him Red). I was taken back by this, and waited until the next day to ask about it. She didn’t remember saying it, but came out and told me that it was true. She did miss Red. As a friend. Because they were friends before their relationship, and best friends throughout it. I understood. She then said that she wanted to start seeing him again, to catch up and check in on him. I also understood. I told her it made me a little uncomfortable, but I wouldn’t tell her not to. It had only been a few months since their split, and they were together for 3 years. What if? Anyway. They caught up on the condition that she’d check in with me a couple of times during their catch up to let me know how things were going, if she was okay, what they were up to etc. throughout their 3 hour catch up I didn’t get a single message and got worried of course. She replied after 3 hours, and told me she didn’t want to be rude and go on her phone at all, which I found weird, because whenever we’re out for dates or catching up about our days, she’s always on and off her phone. She’s obsessed with her phone, never puts the thing down. Snapchat, Insta, messenger, TikTok, you name it she’s on it. Anyway, I said to her, next time, I’d appreciate being invited along to one of these catch ups in a group setting so that I could feel more comfortable with the guy taking my partner out. This made her very uncomfortable and said it would be awkward for him. 
She always told me that if she ever had to choose between me and having a friendship with Red, Red would win. 

There were other various guys with names I didn’t know or recognise, usually the same couple in her DM’s at least twice a week whenever I’d glance over when cuddling/watching Netflix, and if I ever asked about them and what they’d talk about, she’d get defensive and tell me to stop caring so much and not to be controlling. One of them was in a different city, somewhere we were planning on going for Christmas this year. 
Anyhow, fast forward a couple of months, she tells me she needs space. Working together and living together is too much for her. She tells me she wants to move back in with her parents and sisters, but I told her I’d rather wake up with her every day and go to bed together each night than work together, let me give you space by quitting my job and working elsewhere. So I did. The job where we met, where I had all of my friends and work family that I’d been a part of since moving here, since breaking up with my ex S/O. 

Green tells me she has invited Red to her birthday party that I was planning; knowing I was uncomfortable with it, however it was her party so I couldn’t exactly tell her no. 
her 21st birthday is approaching, and I’ve planned the whole thing with her permission. I took her away on an all-expenses paid for trip to the Sunny Coast- went skydiving, stayed amongst nature under a mountain, made cocktails and played chess naked while watching the kangaroos skipping past outside. It was magical. We needed this getaway, and we loved every minute of it. So many great photos and memories, she even told me she wanted to marry me. 

The Sunday was the last day of our holiday, where I’d planned a big birthday party on the town. 60 of her closest friends and family invited, all a surprise party (ruined by one of her girlfriends but anyway). I made a scrapbook of memories of the both of us and stuck all the photos in with PVA glue and decorated it with various bits and bobs. I also got all of the invitees to send me a photo memory of her to put in the book too. 
The party is underway and everybody is having fun, Green is getting drunk, Red is here and I’m okay until I see them start putting their arms round each other and talking to our friends together. Our friends, even her friends, throughout the night had to tell her to stop giving Red so much attention, and that it was harsh on me. 

Green ended up kissing a girl on the dance floor for about 10 seconds, tongues, hands on face and bum, going at it. Green has admitted to having bisexual tendencies before. Is this cheating? Did I just see who I thought was the love of my life cheat on me? In front of me? She said she only went in for a peck, and that it meant nothing. Sure, I get it, it’s your birthday party and you’re young and drunk. But you’re also meant to be in a committed relationship with me, and you’re into girls/have done things with girls in the past. 
So anyway, long story short because this is getting long now: I get upset and walk off to sit down somewhere. She gets mad at me for getting upset, and instead decides to spend the rest of her night with Red while myself and a lot of her friends watch on in disbelief. 
I catch an Uber home, she comes home about half an hour later and I tell her I’m done and that she needs to pack up tomorrow and get out. We sleep, tomorrow comes round, I told her that what I said the last night is still valid. She takes time out and comes to the conclusion that what she did wasn’t wrong in any way and she can’t even apologise. All I asked her to do was to put her hand up, say she f*cked up and we’d move on, but she couldn’t. She’s also come to the conclusion that she didn’t like the way I reacted and got upset at her, and apparently that was the straw that broke the camels back for her and because of that, she’s out. 

So now I’m left here feeling guilty, feeling like I ruined our relationship for expressing my emotions, feeling like I overreacted, and somehow I still miss her. Somehow I want her back, and would take her back in a heartbeat, somehow I’m the one chasing. I spent $120 for her favourite flowers to be delivered to her mum’s house while she was ‘taking space’, and all I got was a thank you over text message when I asked about them. When I said to her ‘after all I’ve done and shown you in the past week on holiday, all this love and these sentimental gifts, and you do this to me?’ Her response was: ‘but I didn’t ask you to do any of that for me’. Days go by and she asks me why I’m not wanting to see her, as I keep making myself disappear whenever she comes round to pick up stuff from our house, I reply with because you broke my heart, and her response is: ‘and you broke mine by the way you reacted’. What? 

Am I wrong here? What could I have done differently. I’m all ears to learning different perspectives and understanding people. I’d like to grow from this experience and learn to never make these same mistakes again, because I genuinely feel like I’ve just lost the love of my life so abruptly.

I require your assistance, i will include some basic background.

I am 28 yo M, financially independent, driving car, introverted but curious for life ( i cook, work out, do extreme sports, watching movies. series, anime, make my own cloths, have 2 degrees and generally i am not afraid to be different in my taste, as unique not as weirdo).

She 29 yo F, working but living with parents, way more introverted than me.

We met 3 weeks ago on badoo, had some nice convos convinced her to go out one. She was very careful, as ""i do not go out with strangers"" but she came and we had nice flow of chat (we left after 4 hours due to next day being a working day). 

We kept chatting afterwards few days (i am usually an overtexter trying to tone it done, she is the other extreme, hardly texts)

After 2 failed proposals from my part (she was implying she was free and then when i was asking canceled me) , second week in a row we go out. Before we went out i made clear that i like her and as replied ""its very obvious, i dont feel uncomfortable but sometimes awkward"".

In the second date amazing flow again. Brought her a flower (i am a retro person ;) ) she couldnt stop smiling, turned a bit pink too.

In irony, when we text she hardly is there replying the next day or so, while in the date she doesnt want to leave.

Third week now still distant in texts, trying for the third date.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up. In texting i appear as ...i dont know, maybe needy? But when we go out i am all charming and she is talking to me non stop or asking me things. Last time as some point she was sad she thought i wanted to go earlier. But frankly i cant uncode whats going on.

1. You know i like you, i made it clear, you confirmed.
2. You know i want to see you, you accept (with problems apparently) and then you have fun chatting with me.
3. You almost totally ignore me the whole week.

I get easily attached to men I have a connection with, but it results in me wanting to be too serious too soon.

I am currently casually dating three men (no sex yet - makes me more attached) but I like one A LOT more than the other two. All three of them are new so I’m based my feelings off limited experience / interaction with them but it’s hard to get excited about the two I’m not as interested in. The one I like most could turn out to be nothing like I wanted and I might be writing the other two off too soon, but I can’t help my feelings.

How do I give everyone an equal chance until I know them well enough to have an informed opinion on long term compatibility.

As the title says I quite recently asked out someone from the office, I'm not asking about the possible consequences of dating a colleague, those are clear to me, we are both adults who can handle social situations pretty well, so it ends up being horrible we can talk it through and act like normal human beings in the workplace without our date affecting our work.

My real issue is that I didn't expect him to say yes at all, he only comes to the office every 1-2 weeks, because he works from a different city as a regional manager, I am the office manager, and well, he is pretty much out of my league. Very popular, kind, easygoing, and good-looking guy, on the other hand, I am a bit more withdrawn but also kind in my opinion, not that popular though. It is pretty clear that it's a one on one date and when I asked him if he wants to postpone it because of his busy schedule he said don't do it, he will be more relaxed after he parked his car. 

This honestly surprises me because I've had a lot of encounters with guys who had a similar but less mature vibe no matter the age, and to be diplomatic, they would come only once or twice after rescheduling, and after they wanted what they got they left. I really don't want this to happen again, so I am quite worried.

The issue is that I am 22 and he is 36 - which I am not sure about if it's actually an issue, my ex was 30 when I turned 21, we were together for almost a year, and we didn't break up because of the age difference but because we were toxic for other reasons. I found this out only later after I asked him out, I thought he is like 30 at max. And now I am slightly worried if it's going to be an issue that we won't openly talk about on the first date like I'm down to have kids from five years now but let me live and build my career for a few years before. 

I also didn't have a proper date in ages, like since I was 19 or so, I met my ex online and moved to a different country after like six months, before that few short-term things through friends, and now I am totally clueless. We will go to one of my favorite places, it's a very unique coffee-hot chocolate place with a crafted beer bar on the other end of the lower floor. I don't know how long it should last - he said he'll see one of his friends later and maybe go back to his city but that's flexible (also mentioned that there will be times when he will sleep in my city, should I think about what this means or leave it?). I always had like 3 hours long dates at least, good ones lasted longer even overnight that I won't be against but I don't want this to be a hookup situation.

We will leave after our Christmas call on Monday together which means other co-workers will see it and probably talk about it the next day knowing how they talk about every little thing, I don't know if he knows about this, to be honest, spending the little amount of time he does in the office. I don't really care about the opinion of others, but the fact that they might tease him too with a few sentences about it, I am not sure if he considered this or should I mention it. 

Today I bought him a little deer clipper with a note that says ""every day is a good day when you are in the office"", left it in his Christmas message envelope - everyone has one - with my name on it. I don't know if it was a good idea I was kinda impulsive buying it.

Usually, I don't stress this much because my dates happen rather quickly, a few days after we agreed to go out, but this time I had a whole week to overthink every little detail and I just lost my ""oh, I just go there and I'll be myself"" mood and confidence with it.

One example is the concept of Push-Pull (i.e. going hot and cold with emotions) by being ‘authentic’.  This is utterly contradictory advice and thinly veiled manipulation, in the guise of self-determination. You can disagree with her, be independent, not be too available—but if at the core of this behavior, you are trying to create a certain hot-cold dynamic, you aren’t being authentic at all. In fact, you’re being manipulative and weak.

Keep things simple. If you want to be in a relationship with someone, you need the freedom to be yourself entirely, be comfortable around them, and not rely on withdrawal of yourself intentionally or establishing boundaries solely for the sake of appearing bold to hold their interest. Being truly busy and holding to your obligations will take care of everything. If you are modifying your baseline behavior for the sake of creating a dynamic in your relationship, it’s not authentic.

If you want to text or talk to them, text them. If you want to see them, reach out to them. Just don’t be overbearing and insecure. No need to analyze a next step to get a reaction, have the
emotional freedom to act how you want. If you can’t be yourself without them losing interest, they don’t have a high level attraction to begin with.

-Make physical activity a priority. Sports, martial arts, lifting, etc.

-Make time to maintain your current friendships, particularly with men. 

-Make time for learning and self-development

It seems like this girl at work and I have some chemistry. We see each other maybe once or twice a week/2weeks. I gave her my number, she never texted, so I figured she wasn’t feeling it. 
See her again a couple weeks later, she apologize for not texting and “had been meaning to” I said it’s all good. That day, she was still flirty and we still had some chemistry, and Im the only dude she is like this with at work. When she was leaving she said “I’m gonna text you in a few minutes“. Im thinking cool, maybe I got a shot. No text. 
2 days later she at work again, she apologizes again, I tell her it’s not a problem. Same chemistry throughout the day though, and then at some point I say, “hope I didn’t make you feel uncomfortable about texting me. Don’t worry about it.” Then she calls me in front of her so I have her number and she saves it in my phone. We have a fun time at work and then as she’s leaving we’re taking and I ask her out on a lunch date and to come over and meet my cat before her shift (she’s a huge cat person). She was very excited and said yes!
I text her the next day, normal conversation, then in ask about where we should get lunch and get no response, for the rest of the night. 
Next day she texts me about how she thought she responded and that family member passed. I give her my condolences and let her know that I understand she’s going through a lot and that it’s cool if we can’t hang soon. Told her to let me know if she needs help or just someone to talk to. 
5 days go buy I text her and ask how she’s been.  No response, and i get it. She’s been dealing with a lot. I see her today at work. I ask how she’s doing, we talk, then she apologizes again for not texting and I say, not a problem. Work is chill, we’re talking about the new spider man move and how she is excited to watch it tonight. I ask her who she’s going with and she kind of sighs and says “you know those kind of relationships that you don’t know what you really are? We’ll I’m supposed to go with this guy I’ve been talking to but he hasn’t told me anything about when we’re going.” I’m dying on the inside. This was the first time she's even mentioned this guy. Then she tells me how she’s been irritated or frustrated with him and what not. I say, “yeah that’s gotta be tough to deal it….We’ll if that ever changes for you, let me know.” I go put stuff away since my shift it’s done, leave, and I didn’t happen to see on my way out.

Emotional vulnerability is incredibly difficult for me, and he hasn't had a romantic relationship in nearly a decade, so he's struggling with it as well. But I've been putting in a lot of effort to be clear with my feelings since Day 1. We get along very well, see each other about once a week and communicate by text or call nearly every day. 

The only problem is: last week, we spent the night together and I told him that I really like him and that I don't want to see anyone else. I told him I wanted to delete all my dating apps (I haven't been active on them since we met, but it's just the gesture) and I wanted to date him exclusively. I know he's not seeing anyone else, nor am I, but he immediately got awkward and told me that he ""knows I want a relationship but just doesn't know if he has that much to give right now."" 

Now, I'm not naïve. I've been dating long enough to know that means that he's just not that into me. However, his actions this week have been saying the opposite. He's on vacation right now but returning this evening, and when he found out that my weekend was totally booked, instead of going home tonight, he's coming straight to my place. He's been ridiculously affectionate and sweet, has been initiating more and more contact (I've backed off a bit — my pride was hurt when he told me he didn't want a relationship) and has been more complimentary and sweeter than ever. He hadn't told any of his family about me at all, but I found out this week that he's told his brother all about me, and was showing him pictures of me and even relayed a short conversation back and forth between us.

I'm at the point where I'm not in love with him yet, but it's getting there. One or two more sleepovers and I'm a goner. But this man is saying one thing and doing the other. I just don't understand. I know I have to talk to him, but is there a way to get the information that I want without straight up telling him that I'm falling in love with him? I think it might be a bit much, and I don't want him to feel pressured by the ""L"" word.

I was by myself at the bar when a few people walk in trying to sit together so I volunteered to scoot down to the empty stool next to me. I was then next to this really handsome looking man who ended up striking up a conversation with me and we ended up talking all night long.

A week goes by of texting, sometimes talking about random things other times being silly, flirty, etc. we planned to meet up again sometime for a drink.

When I left that first night I met him, I was in shock of how much I liked him and he was so nice, charming, can have a good conversation, funny, etc.
You get it, I like the man.

The next time we went out I find out he’s married, two kids, and he said his situation is complicated. He claims they’ve had issues for years and he’s just waiting on the youngest to turn 18. Basically he does everything for them and is only in it for the kids.

He said he hasn’t ever done this before (meet a girl, hang out and the connection with someone else while still married) 
I didn’t judge his status as he is older (early 40’s and I’m 27)

Long story short, I caught feelings for her pretty early on and then she ended up seeing some other dude and obviously I took it super personal because, well, I was 21 and had zero clue that I could meet someone else. That ended.

Fast forward about five years later, I’ve been on dates with 5-6 other girls since then but they were either not the right fit or just plain crazy. More recently I had gone out with this girl I’ve sort of know for a bit, only to be basically lectured by her on why I need to whore myself out - essentially I felt like I was getting slammed for not sleeping with anyone in five years, which I do sort of understand why that would be a turn off to some girls.

I’m not a bad looking dude, a lot of people have told me I’m attractive but I feel as though I’m sort of stuck in this “rut” where I’m just unable to gas myself up to just stick my dick in a girl and go on with life. On one hand I suppose I don’t want a full on relationship right this minute, but if the right girl came around I wouldn’t object. 

Basically - what am I doing wrong? My group of friends doesn’t really go out that often, and when we do it’s usually just us maybe one or two peoples girlfriends. I feel as though maybe I’m not approaching enough women, but the dating apps just haven’t seemed to be working at all.
