It’s not just women I am wanting to talk about. I am willing to talk about toxic men as well but I can’t help but feel like it is truly time to end this one specific toxic gender stereotype. At a time where I feel like women have never been more unaware of basic male psychology and openly complain about men flirting with them while at the same time expecting us to keep treating them like they’re “the prize” in every relationship why shouldn’t we talk about this? I feel like ending this toxic stereotype would cause a domino affect that could cause many other positive changes to happen. Maybe men will finally feel comfortable talking about all the problems they experience in life if they didn’t have to bend over backwards for every women that they date. Either way you can’t call yourself a man and pretend like this isn’t a problem. Because it just is. We’re not options and I don’t think women will realize that until it becomes a world wide movement. They did it with “ending fat shaming” why can’t we do it for this? I want to start a page. Make memes. Spread awareness. This should not be seen as a “mans job” anymore. And by definition anybody who thinks other wise literally suffers from toxic masculinity. Men have emotions. Men have anxiety. It’s time for women to realize that not every gender specific issue/stereotype can be blamed on us. This is a toxic stereotype that is pushed by mostly women that needs to just end. It’s good starter problem for a lot of our issues because if you think about this there a lot of other issues that our connected to this issue too.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,784780,public,self,Does anybody want to help me start a Reddit page to encourage women to approach men and learn how to deal with rejection?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngoy2f/does_anybody_want_to_help_me_start_a_reddit_page/,all_ads,6,,

So I matched a very beautiful and smart girl over tinder a week ago. This Monday we met for our first date. It was a nice day, we had long meaningful conversations and got along very well.

Now tonight she texted me that she felt like I would not be ready to handle her emotional state right now. 

So I called her. 

We had a long conversation. She confessed she suffers from BPD. But also stated that it is not very extreme. She doesn't hurt herself or engages in other self destructive behaviour. Only her emotions can be a rollercoaster and she needs time to trust someone.

I am a very emotional and empathetic person. I have a few friends who suffer from disorders like PTSD or Bipolar-pesonality disorder, and they see me as their anchor. They talk to me about everything and I feel like I can really help them sometimes. 

But those are friendships. 

I know have read a great deal of articles about BPD and tried my best to get some understanding of what people suffering from it go through.

I'm not sure what is like to date someone with BPD. I want to give it a shot because I felt a real connection on our first date + she is soo pretty that I can't help myself but have a crush on her.

Can you give me any advice on how to approach this whole thing? What can I expect? What are does and don'ts?

* Step 1: You put a magic button to join a challenge.
* Step 2: In challenge, both man and woman will answer 5 multiple-choice questions. No matter right or wrong, if you 2 have the same answers, you will match.
* Step 3: After matching, you can see his/her full profile then start to chat.

That's it, no swiping anymore. People will look at other heart first, then their photos later.

Okay so, I’m 19F and he’s 20M.
We’ve been online friends for almost a year but things changed since March
Indeed, like we were close friends I asked him advices on what lingerie I had to buy exct, he loved the idea of being my stylist.
We were joking about it a lot and finally we turned the thing into a game: If you get too horny about the situation you lose.
So we became friends with benefits. (No nudes but hella close)
It was really fun first but then the tension between us was so high that it became frustrating to not be together. 

We had a discussion and I told him that even if I’m not yet in love with him my body needs him asf and like I’m scared to be hurt in the future I prefer to be actually in a relationship with him.

He said that he felt the same but didn’t want a distance relationship cause he scared of being away from me for too long (pandemic anxiety)

So I responded that being friends with benefits was too frustrating for me and that if we stopped, I couldn’t seeing him as a «normal» friend. 

He didn’t agree and said he will always wants to be friends with me no matter what.

I didn’t respond for a week lol and I reached him to finally agree being simply friends but guys it’s so hard not tempting him or fully express my love .. 
It’s like I’m cutting my freedom, idk what to do 

Do you think I need to stop everything with him or not?

Which do you prefer and why?

It's no big mystery that dating in person is different then online. 

From a male perspective, it seems to inflate some womens' sense of value, and cause them to be pickier.

Men...are more or less the same. Dick picks/rude messages =cat calls.


Also, I've been doing some thinking, and had a question.

1) It's said that people are more shallow online, and things are mostly based on looks.


If someone swiped left on you or passed your profile, due to, ""not meeting their standards"" would that very same person reject you in real life?

If so, is dating in real life really any better?

I say this, because some of the profiles that I've seen are a little nitpicky (Must be 5'11 or higher, and such)

I was strongly attracted towards him but even after a he showed no efforts and I left the hopes tried not focussing on him even if it was so much difficult,

Later when we started staying in the same city we started hanging out all the time he took me to all his favourite places, to meet his friends,we started going on dates, I assumed atleast for now he may be attracted he will text but he almost never did, If I called sometime he would talk a lot

It would be different if he was just any stranger, I could let go
I've tried to let go even then 
Because it's hard not to miss him or not being able to talk but I can't help that he shows no efforts

Let's just say my parents are not the nicest people and as a result I have extreme difficulty opening up to anyone. Men I talk to/date will tell me about things that worry them in life, vent to me about certain things, etc-things that I guess normal people do in relationships! And to be honest, I do have a few close friends that I also do this with. But it took me a lot of time to get to that point with them. I had to know them very well for a long time before opening up and being vulnerable. The reason is this: my parents are very impatient people. They expect me to be this perfect being who never gets upset, never gets stressed, never gets sad. Anytime I've done any of the above, they have yelled and screamed at me. For example- There was a high chance we'd have to see COVID positive patients and the school HAD the vaccines but was not giving it to us due to administrative reasons and was giving it to those who had no patient contact-when I got mildly frustrated at the school my parents lost it with me, simply because I was frustrated and it's in their mind a sin to be anything other than happy. Bear in mind this is a rule only applying to me and my brother: my parents yell and scream at the drop of a hat and the idea of moving back home soon even temporarily makes my blood pressure spike. It's at the point that I'm so scared of my parents, anytime anything bad happens and I have to tell them, I stutter and stammer and I don't naturally even have a stammer.

So this lends me to not being able to open up with guys especially if I just met them recently. I have this inbuilt fear that like my parents, they'll snap at me and yell at me too. I know it's not logical, but at this point the fear of opening up is probably a little unconscious.
