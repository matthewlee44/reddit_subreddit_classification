1,oq6ab0,1627058601,Girls are utter non sense,"Females have been the one area I have never understood at all growing up. We are designed to be attracted to them but the process of obtaining one is utterly insane. I'm 24 now and there's been a total of 3 girls that liked me but I didn't find them attractive. I don't want to sound like a dick but they were all overweight and unattractive. I'm over 6 feet tall, fit (used to be a boxer) and according to other guys like my friends and older people, I'm apparently good looking. However, when it comes to attractive girls, they act like I don't even exist and sometimes are even rude to me.

I find it really easy to make guy friends and even speak to some girls that aren't attractive since they're usually nice but when I meet an attractive girl at work or anywhere, they're usually stuck up ass holes. I find it extremely difficult to even speak to them but then I see a fat dude walking around with a hot girl and I'm just thinking what the fuck, it just doesn't make any sense, it's almost as if I'm living in the matrix. Perhaps those guys are rich, or have a certain social status that I won't ever.

I tend to fap a lot, 3-5 times a day sometimes more on weekends when I'm not working. I live with my parents and have gotten used to a life of fapping and at one point I used to imagine myself being with girls I actually liked but now I'm starting to not give a shit and fap instead to meet my sexual needs and focus on things like work and hustle. Tinder as you all know is completely useless if you're not white or black, I look kinda white but girls somehow will know I'm not. Im so lame that I actually used a face editing app to give myself an insanely nice smile just to see if i can get matches, I did but I still can't actually meet a girl. Cold approach is ridiculous, I tried it once, approached around 7-10 girls on campus when I was in university once and got rejected by all, some were even weirded out, never tried it again lol. Nowadays it's funny and almost even a hobby getting rejected by random girls on tinder or in other areas of my life. They say if you stop giving a shit, girls will magically come to you, which I think is bullshit as this is what I've been doing most of my life to no avail.

It's just insanity.

2,oq6e04,1627058903,Don‚Äôt listen to dating advice from men or women who are conventionally attractive.,"People are going to get upset but this piece of advice is one that I think is needed.

Attractive people do not have game. Good looking guys aren‚Äôt picking up girls because of how funny they are, how kind they are, or how magnetic their personality is.

If I started having any kind of doubt she had an unprompted text or answer over the phone to ease my mind and could also easily do this in person the first time we met as well which was just strange as it was like she knew my whole life and exactly what I needed to hear. 

On our second date we did end up sleeping together, and I told her I had strong feelings for her to which she said the same and told me she loved me. I left, came home, and the next day things seemed well for the first half of the day and then she said she wasn‚Äôt ready for a serious relationship. 

I hadn‚Äôt asked her to be exclusive yet or pressured her and it was out of the blue. Her child was sick, she started her period, and perhaps I wasn‚Äôt attentive enough toward her needs that one day as I wanted to share the news of a possible promotion and a real estate investment deal.

Since then the conversation has all but died. I in a way feel lied to but understand she needs time and space.  I feel confused, torn between giving her the space she says she wants and fighting like hell for her. And can‚Äôt seem to find the perfect balance I feel like.

I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for over a month and we‚Äôre both really into each other. Our situation is a little complicated because he‚Äôs leaving for his last year at uni and will be about 800 miles away in September, so right now we‚Äôve agreed to be casual and will reassess the relationship at the end of the summer to see if we want to stay in touch noncommittally while we‚Äôre in school.  

The prior 2 dates in terms of physicality were make outs and a little second base but no mention of sex (this was about a month in). On our fourth date, he got to third base with me but I‚Äôve never had sex before so I was too nervous to initiate anything with him. 

I haven‚Äôt told him that I‚Äôm a virgin but plan to on our next date this weekend because obviously he deserves to know. He‚Äôs legitimately a great human being and I wouldn‚Äôt mind him being my first but he‚Äôs leaving and I think that would emotionally crush me if we had sex because there‚Äôs just not a ton of certainty in our relationship. 

Lately, we‚Äôve been getting more intimate and flirting in a vague but sexually charged manner‚Ä¶and I can‚Äôt help feeling like I‚Äôm withholding information from him. 

I want to have sex with him but know I shouldn‚Äôt, and I also don‚Äôt want to give him the wrong impression. I know it‚Äôs normal to begin getting more intimate and sexual at this stage, but I, immaturely, don‚Äôt want him to leave if he finds out my boundaries (even though this is totally an insecurity thing on my part, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll do this). And I want to talk to him about it in person but don‚Äôt want to come off as dishonest/or teasing without intent over text. 

Would just love some perspective on this

I‚Äôve been dating this girl for a couple months now, her past relationship lasted a couple years and it was super toxic so before jumping into a new one right away we took our time but I knew we both really liked each other a lot also we are coworkers as well. So I was intent and told her to tell me when she wants to start dating so I know your ready to make it official. Well a month or so into talking she asked me out and I asked her a couple times if she was for sure ready to become a item, she replied yeahs she wouldn‚Äôt of asked if she wasn‚Äôt ready so we started dating. Everything is going super good we met each other‚Äôs parents fairly early on but we knew we both really like each other. We spend tons of time together either at my place or hers, sleep overs you name it but we‚Äôd always see each other. Most of the time I was always asking when‚Äôs the next time we will see each other and she would tell me or I‚Äôd spring it on her and she‚Äôd come over but seemed very into it and happy at the time. There would be sometimes where should would surprise me to and ask me to come over which I liked a lot too. I‚Äôve already worked up to say I love you to her but she didn‚Äôt say it back which I‚Äôm okay with in due time I‚Äôd hope. We share a lot together and are very open with each other but as of recently we had a rough spot where I told her how I felt about being stressed and we went a whole day without talking about it anything happen, I‚Äôd always check in and ask if she‚Äôs okay and she would say she is so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but I had a gut feeling something was wrong and I had to be honest with about how I feel or I‚Äôll feel like this throughout the whole relationship, we agreed it‚Äôs a 2 way road when it comes to things like this. So yesterday I talked to her and she wanted to talk to me too cause something was clearly off about us. She told me she needs space and she felt she didn‚Äôt wanna keep this going but she said she really likes me and it hurts her knowing where I‚Äôm at in the relationship and it‚Äôs not fair to me that I‚Äôm saying all these things like I love you to her and she doesn‚Äôt know if she can say it back right now or soon she just doesn‚Äôt know. She scared about her future and what she wants to do and said she feels she can‚Äôt keep expecting me to always be there for her when she can‚Äôt be there for me. She been putting off all these things causes hang out a lot and she can‚Äôt say no to me, she‚Äôs scared and doesn‚Äôt know what to do or how to tackle things she wants to do, she said she always says to her self ‚Äú oh I‚Äôll do that this day or that but then we hang out and she puts to the side, so she said she thinks it‚Äôs best to go on her own. I understand people needs personally time and we can‚Äôt always hang but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if some of those things can be done while I‚Äôm there I‚Äôd assume they could but maybe I distract her to much for her to do them. Then said she didn‚Äôt wanna throw what we have away and be so impulsive and try to work it out. Hearing all this and not expecting really had me but I knew how much I love this girl and if it means I have to part ways with her and it makes her happy then I was all for it cause I don‚Äôt wanna be with someone that is only wanting to be with me cause they know it‚Äôs hurt the other person. I can live with that guilt this far into my life. If it‚Äôs not meant to be it‚Äôs not meant to be end of story yeah I love her but sometimes we‚Äôre not afraid of falling in love we‚Äôre afraid of being loved back. So I laid it all on the line told her how I feel if it doesn‚Äôt work it don‚Äôt work but at the end of the day I‚Äôm leaving the relationship as a changed person. I told her how I felt and that I could see that we do hang out a lot and could understand that she needs to be able to do stuff by her self and for me to not always chase her but have her chase me cause she was very agreeing with that about if I let her make plans it helps her be able to do things and not feel tied down to put things.She then told me I hate to go back on this but I wanna work it out with you. It‚Äôs probably easy to say okay and not think twice about jumping back in but like I said if you don‚Äôt want me because you truly want me then it‚Äôs not worth my time to invest in it period. So I flat out said don‚Äôt just jump back into cause that‚Äôs how I feel about you, don‚Äôt let it hinder your decision. So I asked if you truly wanna work this out and become stronger? I asked 7 times if she was sure and every time she said yes I‚Äôm sure I wanna try to work this out ! So just before I left I asked one thing ‚Äú are we on the same page now ?‚Äù She replied yes I said be serious with me and she later replied I know we are! So that brings us to today and I‚Äôve seen some good small strides in changes as in texting but the true test is what‚Äôs ahead and all I can do is take day by day.

But if you are not talking much to people you Can easily come off as arrogant, and i have heard that sentence alot. People simply look at me as confident, But because i dont talk to Them, they Think i am arrogant. 

So learn not only good body language But also how to be more talkative in social contexts!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqa0pt/if_youre_shy_with_confident_body_language_you/

At the time, he told me he would reach out in a couple months and if I was single and wanted to we could get drinks and catch up and potentially reassess. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect this to happen at all, we had 0 contact after this and I dated some other people in the meantime, he wasn‚Äôt really on my mind anymore, though initially I took the breakup really hard. A month and a half after this, about a week ago on a Sunday morning at 8am sharp he texted me to check in, ask me how I was, and ask if I would wanna get drinks next time he‚Äôs in the area (he lives 40 minutes away).

So I (25M) broke up with my ex (19F) three weeks ago. It wasn't supper messy but it was messier than it should have been. After reflecting over the past three weeks I realized where I went wrong and apologized for my part in the break up (I was being needy and overbearing). It was long distance but the break up was very abrupt as our whole relationship was incredibly positive up until the last two weeks where we just not understanding each other and she pulled the plug literally right before I was going to. I still love her and the breakup was very avoidable. So I sent this long text taking blame in where I went wrong and said ""I am not trying to win you back I just need to get this off my chest"". She replied apologizing for her part as well and said that she really missed talking to me and wanted to at least be friends. The past two days we have been texting back and forth a bit. Not to the level of when we were together but we've been joking asking each other what they are up to etc.. For me, it has been hard to read the signs. For one, after the breakup I blocked her on my socials which she said hurt her feelings. So the other day after we reconciled a bit I added and requested her back but she didn't do the same to me (except for snap). In addition, she used a heart emoji yesterday after a text which she immediately edited to a laughing emoji. Additionally, I am going to be in the town she lives in 2 weeks (it has been long distance), and I said we should get coffee or dinner and she replied ""if I am in town yes I can"". The issue is that the signals we have been sending off to each other have both been very mixed. I am trying to keep it cool and understand it may require some time to build back a trust but it is killing me to know what we are going to do moving forward. We both clearly still like each other but I want to know if we can try again. I can't tell if it is just neither of us wants to take the first move, if she is skeptical, or if I am the only one who still has feelings for her. I want to ask but the reason we broke up in the end was because I was being a bit overwhelming in terms of wanting to communicate better so I don't want to drive her away by  being sappy again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqa9d3/starting_talking_to_my_ex_again_who_i_still_have/

Last Sunday I went on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù with a work colleague of mine. We met at work, after working with me 3 times he asked if we ‚Äúwanted to get some drinks together‚Äù. The following days he texted me, we talked for about a week through text and then met up. We have not talked once since the date happened. 

Now to the actual point here.. at work, he only saw me working in a mask. When he texted me however, he saw my profile picture which was a selfie of me and I also sent him some selfies during the convo so he kinda had a plan what I looked like beneath that mask. Of course, he had never seen me in 3D without the mask, so yeah, I‚Äôll give him that. Tbh, we didn‚Äôt click through texting at all. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs funny and for me it would‚Äôve been mainly sexual, idk if he‚Äôs about that life, anyways. The date was awkward, I was acting very awkwardly bc I was nervous and felt insecure and overall it felt unnatural. But over text he seemed interested in me. At work we couldn‚Äôt talk too much usually.

I cant shake the feeling though, he ‚Äúghosted‚Äù me because he thought I was ugly. I‚Äôve felt like shit all week, feeling unattractive and disgusting because I can‚Äôt help thinking about it. I just wonder if I do look so gross without a mask. I probably do.

40,oqbpxu,1627074936,Should we give it another shot?,"Hi guys. So for reference I‚Äôm gonna link my previous post about this situation at the bottom of this post. I started to write this last night, I‚Äôm calmer and more level headed rn but I feel like it‚Äôs all gonna hit me again soon. I‚Äôd (23F) been talking to this guy (27M) since the end of February/beginning of March. It took us a little while to actually meet up but we finally went on our first date towards the end of April. 

We went to a bar and drank and talked for hours. It was literally perfect. He asked me if I‚Äôd wanted to hang out again in a few days. I‚Äôd said yeah and we went to the movies and had a good time but then we kinda got into an argument towards the end of it. After that he kinda ghosted me for a while but he‚Äôd still been on my mind since then because everything just felt so unfinished. 

I took it upon myself to mute him on everything because at that point we had each other on all social media platforms. I would still see likes/comments sometimes on mutual friends posts because we know some of the same people cuz we went to the same high school. Other than that though it‚Äôd been out of sight out of mind for the most part until he started being a little active on my posts at the end of June/beginning of this month. He would react to or comment on like half the things I shared. 

He started off doing it gradually so I didn‚Äôt really try and take it as anything other than him being friendly but he had really ramped it up recently so I decided to bite the bullet and message him finally. He mentioned how I‚Äôm a little sarcastic and it was hard for him to tell when I‚Äôm joking or not, which I‚Äôve gotten my whole life but I didn‚Äôt think I was doing that with him. But I apologized for it not having come across as intended. Then we got deeper into it and he admitted that he felt as though as I was dating multiple people where as he only dates one person at a time and he got insecure. 

It kills me because I genuinely don‚Äôt do that and was only focused on him the whole time and I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd made that clear. He felt as though he wasn‚Äôt in his rights to ask me if I was only dating him, etc; etc; We kinda left the convo in a neutral place although he did throw out a couple feelers it seems now that I‚Äôm looking back at the convo concerning us giving it another shot but I missed them at the time cuz I was just concerned with communicating my feelings after not having talked for a while. I know he has his flaws and I‚Äôm not putting him on a pedestal or anything but we just have so much in common and we have the same worldviews on a lot of things even down to being child free. 

I feel like right now he might feel a little rejected because I didn‚Äôt really acknowledge anything about us moving forward except for telling him that it was up to him because I don‚Äôt wanna pressure him. I was planning on reaching out to him again on Sunday to let him know that I‚Äôd be down to try again if he is but now I‚Äôm conflicted and I don‚Äôt know if I want to anymore or if it‚Äôs worth it. I fell for him hard and was put through a rollercoaster of emotions over some miscommunication and misunderstandings. 

Part of me feels like I should keep trying cuz I genuinely only want (ed?) him and I felt a strong connection but at times it felt like I was the only one fighting for it. Because the way I‚Äôm looking at it is that if it were me on the other end I would‚Äôve communicated and tried to fix the issues. I also feel like I might be overcompensating because I‚Äôve been told in all my previous relationships that I‚Äôm too cold and uncaring and I just wanted to actually make efforts for this one because I do really like him.

Topic and adjacent topics come up on a few other occasions, seemed VERY odd for someone to be so open about it but I kinda admired it. Bit of a red flag that she apparently just kinda flips a switch and blocks out any emotion regarding that stuff, or just detaches herself from triggering things, never went to therapy or anything. I've got my own baggage that I've spent years working on too, we all handle it differently, I'm not one to judge.


 I decided to keep talking to her and get to know her better. We went out a few more times, things were fun. Then one day in the car after lunch I open up a bit about some touchier parts of my past too, how I've done a lot of work on myself since (lots to be done still obvs), and she has since ghosted me.

The first time we fell off I was talking to someone else and deleted the whole app. And we didn‚Äôt exchange numbers the last time I was on. This time I got back on Tinder we really hit it off, we were talking non stop, it felt natural, he made me laugh, and we had so much in common. We went out on some really amazing dates. I was so tired of going out to eat on dates but with him we would do fun stuff like go to arcades or go to drive in movies. Everything was literally perfect and it was going steady for a month. Then I noticed he started taking longer to text me back but he would still reach out to me first but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because it wasn‚Äôt everyday he would take hours to respond. But I noticed that he didn‚Äôt seem as anxious to hang out like he did before. I work 6 days a week at 2 different jobs so any time I had I would spend with him. He seemed really supportive and helpful and offered to help me move into my new apartment. I felt like we were really connected. Our last date was on Saturday last week and we went on a hike and when he got in the car he didn‚Äôt seem excited to see me but when we got to our hike we had a good time and he was being affectionate.

I was open and vulnerable to him because in the past I‚Äôve been so guarded. But my only thing was if you weren‚Äôt interested why didn‚Äôt you just tell me that? I told him what he did was hurtful and he could have let me know that he wasn‚Äôt interested and I left it alone and never got a response back which I expected I most likely wouldn‚Äôt get a response. But then I go on tinder to see if we were still matched and I seen he unmatched me today. I still don‚Äôt know if I did something wrong. I‚Äôm just a little bit sad because I really enjoyed our time together and I thought he was a cool guy.

44,oqbz43,1627075745,Need advice on workplace crush [serious],"Hello everyone,

I am new here and this is my first post. so if i have ignored a rule or something don't kick me out :&gt; Please don't discard this as madeup story as it is long and dramatic coz i really don't have anyone to talk to about this. I am not from US/Europe. If anything in this post seem inappropriate, please forgive me and let me know so i can remove or edit. i hope this gives some context.

I'm 23 Male, working in a huge MNC. I have a crush on a girl on my team also same age as me. We joined on the same day so we got to  talking from day 1 (fav. things, cracking jokes) . She'd ask me any computer / technical stuff &amp; i will ask her all my work related doubts. I was surprised to know that someone other than me had similar taste in movies, sitcoms.

Then the social life killer Covid hit the world and we were sent home packing with laptops and headsets to start work from home. (any convo from this point on is in text due to WFH). Few months later me and some of my team got bumped up to a new team and guess who was also there. yes, it was her. since we are in transition to a new team, we have a lot of time to talk (via text). Now we talk almost all the time commenting about what is being said in meetings, helping with doubts regarding work and make fun of team leaders or teammates. I think this is the point where i realized that i'm having a crush on her. She'd laugh at all my dumb jokes (looking at it in hindsight). she'd always reply instantly (unlike my college ""crush""). She seems to be interested and understand about things i say. She'd pick me out of 14 others in group activities (she'd slip in the we can team-up ""if you want""). I haven't entered the ""doing things to impress her"" phase yet but i can see me doing coming sooner or later.

Generally (there are exceptions ofc) women don't go around saying things like ""hey x i think i like you"" and are not expected to. so it's up to me to decide whether she is interested in me. Im a shy person (as if asking relationship advice on reddit wasn't a giveaway). I haven't had any relationships before (not uncommon in my culture) and since i work in an MNC, if i misjudged her interest in me and ""made a move"" that'd be end of my time at my job which i come to like very much and pays good. We haven't talked anything about our personal lives. Like every teenager ever i have started dreaming about my future with her. I think i should not let this distract me and possibly cause her a lot of headache if it is just my brain creating feelings out of thin air.

My Questions to the people who have read this far are the following:

1. Am i just dreaming stuff or is there something of potential here?
2. How do i know if she is really interested in me now that we are not seeing each other in person due to WFH?
3. What should i do or not do if she is interested in me?
4. What should i do or not do if she isn't interested in me?

If you have any suggestions/advice for me that can't be displayed on comments, you are welcome to Private message me.

59,oqdbmi,1627080015,She says we‚Äôre moving too fast,"I‚Äôve (27m) been dating this girl (26f) for a few weeks now. Things were going very well the first few dates. Lots of fun and banter. Lots of heavy petting at my place. And some oral sex. No penetrative sex yet though. 

In between dates we would FaceTime a bunch. We wouldn‚Äôt really be texting all day but maybe once or twice a day with a goodnight video call just to catch up on our days. 

This girl would drop some hints about long term potential. We had a conversation about us, and she said that she‚Äôs really optimistic about us and that I check all her boxes. She told her family about me. She says she wants to travel everywhere with me. When we were out at a restaurant she called me ‚Äúher man.‚Äù

One day we were talking about kids, and she dropped the comment that she thinks about what our babies would look like. So that night I looked into her eyes and told her that I wanted to put one inside her. I also asked her to be my girlfriend but she said not yet, but assured me that she‚Äôs not seeing anyone else. I pushed the envelope too far that night and I think she got scared. Or maybe I just came off as desperate. 

Since that night (last weekend) we haven‚Äôt talked much at all. I texted her Monday if she wanted to meet (today is Friday), and she said she‚Äôs really busy. And more importantly she said we‚Äôre moving way too fast. She said she wants to learn more about me but not close our selves off to other options. 

After that I decided to completely ice her. She reached out to me two days ago asking how my day was, and she told me a story about work that day, in a very cheery tone completely opposite to the serious tone during the conversation we had when she said we were moving too fast. I replied and spoke politely but did not try to continue conversation. Since then we haven‚Äôt spoken at all.

I've always been told that I was good looking but I had so much anxiety and depression related to my speech disorder. I've now gained substantial amount of confidence and social intelligence but I still can't find it in me to just go and take my shot even when a girl is clearly eyeing me and receives my presence positively. I'm not a virgin but I'm very inexperienced. I know that I would be a great boyfriend or sexual partner but this one thing about me hasn't changed. I don't even get nervous, I no longer have approach anxiety and I barely any social anxiety. Yet I still do this out of habit I guess.

Some advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated...

I (M32) started talking to this girl (F31) mid-April and immediately we had great chemistry. Our first date was at a park and went great. Since then we have been talking and connecting on the phone almost every day and we had been making plans to see each other once a week. I am living in Toronto so our covid restrictions are just lifting. With that being said all of our meet ups since the first date have been her coming over to my place (we did go on 2 hikes in this period). We would chill out, talk for a bit, cuddle, and it would eventually always lead to sex. My problem is that I am absolutely crazy about this girl, I could see a long-term relationship with her but my clouded sex-crazed male mind has been making me skip a lot of important steps that any girl would like to experience during the courting period and in fact the entire relationship.

Since we hang out only once a week and I am trying to stay monogamous, my sex drive and desire for sex when with her is very high. We hung out last Monday and again.. I of course, wanted to connect with her physically and have passionate sex. I thought things went great but got a phone call from her yesterday saying that ""our physical connection is amazing but I feel bad when I am with you otherwise because you don't treat me like someone is special. You treat me like your prostitute."" You never ask me out on dates, we haven't talked on the phone in a week, you never try to walk me home or pick me up from my place to go to yours"". She also said that she thinks I only care about sex and am not fully present or excited to do anything else when sex is on my mind.

The weird part like I said is that I am actually crazy about this girl and would do anything for her. Especially showing up better and making more of an effort to be like a loving-boyfriend. I am honestly one of the most loving and caring guys when it comes to people I date but the internet these days teaches guys to play it cool and not over pursue in the beginning. It has definitely back-fired on me. I admit I was blind to these things she brought up and thought they would all eventually start to happen naturally but she feels like I am just using her. Anyway, she basically told we want different things and we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. We ended up talking for 2.5 hours on the phone and started to makeup but she still insists on taking time to process what I said as well as her feelings. I genuinely think she has strong feelings for me and I hurt her badly by not showing up 100% and giving her my full love.

I'm twenty and I've never had a boyfriend. Or have been confessed to.

I've been breaking down over this since I was seventeen because I felt so ugly and so difficult to love. When I was eighteen, i
I had a confusing long-distance fling with a guy I met here on Reddit who treated me like a doormat, and I stayed because I had no self-esteem. I was scared that if I let go, no guy would ever take his place. I met guys whom I liked that I didn't make a move on, or simply ignored, because I was too insecure to shoot my shot.

I am twenty now. My relationship with my friends are good. I have everything in order. My skin is clearer and my clothes fit better. I am not single because I'm ugly. I am okay-looking, but I'm outgoing and I'm perfectly capable of carrying conversations with people. I'm generally interesting. I have shortcomings of my own, and I am still deeply insecure at times, but I'm relatively well-adjusted.

I am single because by the time I started respecting myself enough to know that I was not unlovable, it was during lockdown and I didn't have the same opportunities to meet anyone. I regret not making any moves on guys when I had the chance, but it's all behind me now and it's still not too late. I am so, so young.

There are days when I think about the fact that I've never had a boyfriend, or that no man has ever made any real moves on me, and it hurts a lot. There are days when I think I should start sleeping around just to know what it's like to be wanted by a man. I cannot have these thoughts anymore. I am fine. I just have to be patient. Eventually I'll be able to go out again, and meet people again. This time around I won't hesitate anymore.

For now, I'll focus on trying not to attach my self-worth to how willing men are to give me attention. I am fine. I am okay. I'll work hard. I'll meet a great guy.

She likes me a lot and I worry a little about her heart, but I also rly like her. I‚Äôm just slightly emotionally unavailable and jaded from past relationships.

90,oqglzs,1627091768,Attractiveness and dating,"So before we get started, I just want to say that I don't have anything against these people and they are probably really nice people. The question I'm about to ask is about people asking out others. Why is it that guys who may not be that attractive what so ever and don't take care of themselves have so much confidence to ask out pretty women who are very attractive? I see this going the other way for men also, where the guy is very good looking but girls who aren't, tend to ask those men out. Why is that? Look wise, the people aren't really close to them and they are probably nice people, but look wise they are just unattractive as all gets out. 

So why do men and women have so much confidence when asking out attractive men or women?   


One other thing I found out in the dating world recently is that why do women pull away once you show you like them? Of course not all women are like that what so ever. But I see a lot of attractive women who like me, but once I show interest back...well they pull away. I believe it's the chase they like and once they catch their prey....they are kind of like done.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqglzs/attractiveness_and_dating/

I‚Äôve posted here MANY times in the past anxious af. Including the past three weeks about a girl I‚Äôve known for over a year. I asked her out we went on a decent first date, asked again. Great second date, ended up kissing multiple times at the end. Then she ignored my text asking for a third earlier this week. 

Anyway she texted me apologizing today and I was like yeah cool. Then tonight I met a girl who gave ME her number and we walked around downtown for an hour tonight. She took me to the train station (I pretended I didn‚Äôt know how to get there - she took me the long way ha ha). Doesn‚Äôt fit any of the MUST HAVE things I‚Äôve been so hung up on but holy shit she‚Äôs cute and I‚Äôm excited. 

It may not work out but earlier today I legit was like determined I‚Äôll die alone. So here‚Äôs to hope for everyone freaking out üòÇ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqgsba/met_someone_who_actually_likes_me_right_around/

93,oqgych,1627093051,He canceled plans tonight and I‚Äôm left confused about his feelings,"I‚Äôve (28F) been dating this guy (30M) for 2 weeks. We hit it off immediately from the first date and connected, got sushi and sat by lake watching the stars, laughing and talking for hours. Hung out the next day and got ice cream with his two year old just for an hour cause he wanted to make time to see me. We spent a few more nights together last week. He opened up about his divorce that was finalized last year and said he‚Äôs ‚Äúkeeping me/never letting me go‚Äù because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfect for him‚Äù (His ex wife is dating someone else btw). We have lots in common and have plans for some fun adventures and he offered to teach me how to drive a manual car, etc. He‚Äôs a car guy, as in he rebuilds old/broken cars and is nerdy, we both play Xbox. Also, He said he deleted his dating apps the day after we met and both said we aren‚Äôt seeing anyone else and are dating.

The last time we hung out was Monday. He started a new position at a new company on Tuesday, so he hasn‚Äôt texted as much the last few days during the day, which is understandable. He had to go out of town for the night (yesterday), we had nothing concrete set but said we had ‚Äúplans for Friday‚Äù when he got back to town. Well finally he told me he got into town and was picking up his son from them watching him at their house. I asked if he wanted to get pizza, and he said he was now having dinner at his parents house. I was like wait what..but we said we had plans? I said I‚Äôm confused and why couldn‚Äôt we hangout like we have been when he put his son to bed at like 8:30pm‚Ä¶ He made the excuse he didn‚Äôt know his parents would offer to cook and said sorry. I told him ‚ÄúI told my friends I was busy tonight. It‚Äôs Friday night. Can‚Äôt we hangout after?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy he couldn‚Äôt have simply told his parents he had other plans?‚Äù He kept saying he didn‚Äôt see the problem and that we can hangout tomorrow. I said ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs a no on hanging out on tonight ?‚Äù And he replied ‚Äúwe can hangout tomorrow no question about it‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even feel like replying the rest of the night, I‚Äôm super pissed and feel devalued. I even sent him a cute selfie this morning hoping he would he excited to see me cause we haven‚Äôt hung out since Monday! He made me feel so special last week, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the issue now... I have the freaking worst of the worst with dating, haven‚Äôt had any long term relationships because people suck with false intentions and aren‚Äôt genuine. I like this guy and can see it developing. But his feelings suddenly changed? Does he not value me anymore? I‚Äôm really pissed and confused he canceled last minute our plans.

Is it taboo if, when I see him in person, I just mention that next time we can skip the drinks and he can just ask to come over?
