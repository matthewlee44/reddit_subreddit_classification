1,oh7q93,1625875029,Why is this so hard?,"I went on a second date on Wednesday. 

He‚Äôs very kind. He‚Äôs divorced. He has two kids. From what I gathered, he‚Äôs only ever been with her. It‚Äôs not amicable, and it sounds like he‚Äôs over it. He‚Äôs been on a few OLD dates, and said they felt like job interviews, with me it was easy. 

We had a really nice dinner. Conversation was easy again, and he told me straight out that he likes me a lot. Asked what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm at the home stretch in my divorce. It was toxic and emotionally abusive. I told him I like this. I like how natural and easy it is. Maybe I should have asked him. 

We went to an outdoor beer garden, listened to live music. He asked if he could kiss me. Played with my hair. Was affectionate. I dropped him off at his apartment and we made out in the car for 10 minutes. I got lost goin home because I was dizzy happy. 

He texts me the next day, and when I said how nice it was last night, and that he‚Äôs a good kisser, he said it felt like a dream and it‚Äôs nice to have things to look forward to. That was at noon yesterday. Didn‚Äôt hear from him anymore, unless today when I sent him a playlist he asked me to make him. He said, ‚Äúthank you. I‚Äôll listen tonight.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. 

We don‚Äôt have plans for a third date. I have a 7 year old and it seems like our custody schedules are opposite each other‚Äôs. There‚Äôs no texting. No calling. No nothing. It‚Äôs like the dates are romantic and easy and then poof. I had to ask about the second date, I‚Äôm not asking about a third. So of course, despite everything he said to me about liking me, I‚Äôm questioning everything I said and did. Telling myself he‚Äôs not interested. I‚Äôm sad! Ugh after two dates, and I rarely feel that much of a connection with anyone.

Men who are divorced and have been single for quite awhile are mostly the ""been there done that"" kind of guy and say they won't put up with the BS. So anything you say or do, if they get offended, then point the if finger at you and accuse you of being BS. So they walk away. Men who are single and have always been single, no long term relationships, no kids, often love their single life, they are serial daters and are simply looking for something better, gosh....they just don't know what it is??? Hence, why they are single in their forties. You have the broken men, be careful of these ones, they have become the love bombers, these are the ones that will jump in and believe you are the one, then quickly jump back out of it and blame the hurt and pain from the past relationship(s). I have yet to meet a man who has a wonderful relationship with the mother of his children, has no baggage, has a great relationship with his family, well rounded and isn't judgemental of what a woman in her forties should look like. Don't get me wrong, they are out there, they are just needles that us single women have to find as we sift through the haystack.

8,ohkx4f,1625931420,Performance Issues,"I (48M) met a wonderful, beautiful woman (45F)on OLD. Been seeing each other for a little over a month. She had mentioned early in our dating that she had trust issues (from past experiences) and would not know when or if she would be ready for sex. I was okay with that. Willing to take our time and go when she was ready. Yesterday, we practically spend the whole day together hiking. I made dinner for us later that evening and afterwards, things got hot and heavy.  She finally let me know that she was ready for sex. Despite the wonderful news, it caught me off guard because I simply wasn‚Äôt expecting it. Things got hot and heavy. We were in the middle of making love when, during a position change, I lose my erection.  When it happened I was in a bit of a shock. I am super attracted to this woman in many ways. I could not understand why this was happening. I apologized. She said it was okay, that it happens. But later, while cuddling, she was thinking it happened because I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her sexually.  My heart sank because that was simply not true.  She is amazing in every way and I am incredibly attracted to her physically. 
In trying to make sense of why it happened, I recapped the events of the previous day. I should mention that I take pretty good care of myself. I exercise almost everyday and eat healthy. 
So the evening before we made love (sorry, it just sounds better than saying we had sex), I did a grueling workout of squats and lunges and masturbated before I went to bed. The next morning she and I did 2 hikes that involved a lot of stairs on one hike and traversing rocks and changing elevations during the second hike. By midday I was already feeling tired, but got talked into running a couple of miles with a friend of mine. Afterwards, I drank a strong coffee to help me energize for my date later that evening. 
I‚Äôm thinking my performance issue had something to do with being exhausted and having previously masturbated the night before, but I‚Äôm not a doctor and feel like I‚Äôm just making excuses.  I do feel incredibly embarrassed. I like this woman a lot and care about her.

I have been divorced for 5 years and rebounded into three more relationships immediately following the end of my 17 year year marriage (we have had two kids together: who are now 9 and 17.) There has been a few other little flings in there as well. 

I know I should have taken more time to heal and focus on me during this time but instead, I convinced myself that I had found the ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù a mere 8 weeks after fleeing my emotionally abusive marriage. Even with many friends suggesting that I might be rebounding- I was like a child with my hands over my ears during that time and was determined to learn things the hard way. So that‚Äôs what I did. 

That being said, I did learn a thing or two from those experiences and am currently working on truly focusing on myself so I don‚Äôt jump into another relationship that is not based in reality. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I am currently single (again). And for the first time since my divorce, I think I am actually feeling like I may be moving into a space where I will not be rebounding or just looking for a FWB situation. I am also thinking there is a good possibility I am still not ready for a serious LTR since I have spent a lot of time the past five years distracting myself with rebounding. So I thought this might be a good time for me to listen and learn from my community and do a little research! 

I am hearing that Bumble, Tawkify and perhaps E-harmony can be good‚Ä¶.anyone willing to share some feedback?

15,ohp4xp,1625945237,How do I move from rebounding to reality?,"Greetings everyone. This is going to be a truthful
And emotional post. Thank you for allow me to share here. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have been divorced for 5 years and I have a very ingrained pattern of rebounding since I left my marriage of 17 years. 

Within 8 weeks of leaving my marriage, I convinced myself I had found the ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù with a man I barely knew that lived in Belgium. We then embarked on a three year long distance relationship based mostly on vacations but  not based in reality. When I realized he was never going to take the steps to move closer (and he was a nightmare around my kids), instead of facing reality, I began a 2 year affair with a man already in a long term committed relationship with his GF of 7 years. Again, at the onset of this , I convinced myself that we had ‚Äúmagic‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù and that he was absolutely the one and only love of my life. 

His GF eventually found out about us, he landed on my doorstep and I allowed him to move in with my and my two horrified daughters. Within a short time this fell apart too and I swore I would never do anything as crazy again. 

A few months after this break up, I met another man on FB and we embarked on a rather secretive and highly dysfunctional relationship due to him being a Jehovas Witness (he was constantly trying to indoctrinate me) and since it was during the pandemic, and we technically were supposed to be in isolation, I kept him a secret. It was all very stressful
And finally we broke up as well. 

I‚Äôm realizing today they It is feeling like it is practically impossible for me to be alone even for 5 seconds to collect my thoughts and focus on truly healing. And what I invite into my life is stressful, time consuming and  unsafe. 

I have a lot of childhood trauma issues that I have have been in therapy and coaching for for years and I do feel I have made some progress with this. I also have a background in counseling myself byt even with all
This support, I am pulled very hard to constantly reach out for someone, anyone, and then it‚Äôs like I enter a fantasy place where I convince myself, this is the ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù and I have somehow ‚Äúfinally‚Äù found him. 

Two weeks ago I had a dating profile up on FB dating and within a few days of meeting this man , he and I decided we were in ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù and making all
Kinds of long term plans together. A few days in i found out that he was married. ü§™. 

I struggle to share all this because I know at a cognitive level, I  have not allowed myself the time to properly heal from my divorce and I am then moving things too fast with men I barely know. And it is a repetitive pattern. Obviously. 

Thanks for listening. The good news is that I have managed to keep the subsequent dysfunctional relationships following the live  in BF away from my kids. I also have owned the harm I caused them and my relationship with my daughters feels in many ways stronger and more authentic than it ever hash 

So some things have improved. üòâ

But I am really questioning what is going on with me especially following last weeks experiences‚Ä¶.Because frankly, that felt a bit nuts‚Ä¶

So I landed on the side of giving her the benefit of the doubt and a bit of ""what do I have to lose?""  

We went out last night, ended up hanging out for 3.5 hours and it was pretty fun.  She was cool and smart, sorta cute.  Talked my ear off, which is fine since I am on the quiet side.  

Turns out I had nothing to worry about with the in shape thing.  She's in good shape for her sport but it doesn't mean she's got some objectively attractive body.  Dunno how else to put it without sounding bad.  

In the end I got the feeling that she was into it more than me and I am not sure I want to be anything more than friends with her.  

We talked a bit about online dating and our different experiences.  And it dawned on me that she probably was having other dates in between the times we were in contact.  

But what I realized - and this is important, I think- is that who cares if she wanted to see other people while we were not in contact?  I didn't wait around for her.  If she didn't answer a text I was willing to let it go for an extended period.  So if she wanted to come back around and give it a shot, great.  She doesn't owe me anything and vice versa.  

If nothing comes of this interaction I do not consider it a waste of time.  I met a cool lady, learned a lot from her, found a cool place to hang out, and perhaps down the road have made a friend.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ohrgwg/update_just_curious_how_you_would_handle_this/

Match: Most of the men were looking for a serious relationship, but I personally did not meet quality men. Also, I didn't like that anyone could message me outside of my filters and it would go to my email. It was too time-consuming. This is the only online dating service I paid for. I didn't go on a single second date. 

Coffee Meets Bagel: This is my favorite. It sends you a limited number of profiles each day to look through. This is the only site I had relationships through, but the pool is small. Also it skews younger.

Bumble: Too much to filter through. The GPS tracking is creepy. Overabundance of men being interested in polyamorous relationships. Deleted after two weeks.

Hinge: Not bad. Ran out of quality matches after two weeks and ultimately got turned off by a man cat fishing and lack of serious men. Not much information listed on profiles. Deleted after 3 weeks.

I‚Äôve been dating this guy for over a month. We have a great time when we are together. When we aren‚Äôt out, he is very busy with his job and social life. Love it. 

Last weekend I was visiting some friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in ages. I text him during the day with pictures, I was having such a great time and wanted to share it with him. Radio silence.

The next day I finally asked what was up with his silence? He finally admitted that I text way too much the day before, and I made him feel like I was suspicious of him when I text and asked him where he was headed? Uhhh, ok...?

Didn‚Äôt see each other at all during the week. Some texting, now I‚Äôm paranoid about texting too much.

We go out yesterday. GREAT full day together. Early on in the date he slickly uninvited me to a family party he is attending in a week. Said he has that family function and they want to keep it small and what should he give as a post wedding gift (the party is for a weddings that happened during covid), was xxx cash amount good since he was going alone? As if he was paying back at least his dinner price. Uh, it‚Äôs a bbq at his sister‚Äôs house. He is close with his sister. 

It was quiet a few min after that. I let it go and enjoyed the day/night. Great time, even with that uninvite in the back of my mind.

Now it‚Äôs the next morning. I know he is up. No good morning text, which he usually does. I even told him I like that.

I think I‚Äôm answering my own questions as I‚Äôm typing this out. LOL

Then once every few days, we‚Äôd get into a longer conversation in the evening - anything from 2-4 hours. Other times one of us would be tired and say goodnight after 10-15 mins.  So very natural, easy and nothing too high maintenance or fast moving.

Felt like we were moving nicely towards meeting up at some point and the effort felt quite equal.

Then he had a medical emergency and is now undergoing tests to see if he has long term issues.  Understandably his attention isn‚Äôt likely to be on dating with that going on. He apologised quite a few times and I said no worries at all and I understand completely. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a few days then I dropped him a quick message to check how he was doing - he read it immediately and replied and we chatted for a few minutes until I had to go.  Then didn‚Äôt hear from him for 3 days and I dropped him another quick message - again he replied immediately and we ended up chatting for an hour.  He talked about how he was very worried about the medical stuff and work.  He is definitely very engaged when we do chat and he goes long periods without being on WhatsApp in between.  I don‚Äôt get the feeling that it‚Äôs due to his attention being on someone else. 

It‚Äôs now been another few days and I‚Äôm wondering whether to
A) leave him to get back in touch with me as and when (if ever)
B) drop him another message to check how he is doing
C) send a message saying I know he has a lot going on right now that is worrying and I understand if he wants some time to concentrate on what he needs to and if he wants, to get back in touch later on. But that I was really enjoying getting to know him - just recognise that it might not be the right timing for him.

Also during this time I met a guy on Reddit of all places and we‚Äôve become FWB. This has been fun but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship. Sure we occasionally throw in a meal here and there and we text a lot but at the end of the day it‚Äôs just fun and never going to amount to more.  
I keep thinking that I should get back on the apps to try and find what I really want but you all know OLD is a pain. I‚Äôm super comfortable with the FWB. It‚Äôs just easier to get my needs met by him and I can entertain myself with hobbies when I don‚Äôt see him.

42,oihya7,1626056260,Financial dramas,"I can't be the only one in this situation, at our age... I (40F) own my own house (well... I'm slowly buying it back from the bank, I own about half of it TBH) and my partner (51M) is really irresponsible about money and savings. He was renting when I met him, he is always in debt etc. It is the main thing we argue about but I've just had to learn to keep our finances totally separate because he's a nightmare where money is concerned and can't be trusted.

Anyway... we've been living together for about 18 months now, and in our country after 2 years of living at the same address something called a ""De Facto"" law kicks in where you are treated as if you are married, even if you're not. I hate this law, I feel like unmarried people should be left alone to do our own thing and if we wanted all that legal interference we'd get married, but that's the law and sadly I can't change it.

I also don't really understand it all because I don't see how it's different having a lodger who pays rent to the homeowner, or having a partner who pays me rent because it's my house and he's living there, but apparently it is different (because we have sex sometimes apparently, how is that different to a FWB-type lodger???) and I have to have a legal contract drawn up, which my partner has to sign and agree to, to protect my property in the event of breakup.

Here's where it gets murky. He doesn't want to sign up. I guess if I was him I wouldn't either because technically in about 6 months he'd be entitled to a share of my assets if we broke up even though he has contributed zilch. I've been to a solicitor and it's going to cost about $4k for me and about $2k for him to make this agreement because he has to see an independent solicitor (he can't use the same lawyer as I do) and he's essentially signing away his rights to my property and assets.

He said he doesn't want to, it's an unnecessary expense for him. My bestie is a family lawyer and she said I should just pay his expenses myself to get him to sign the agreement, she told me to look at it like an insurance for my house and my savings and super which will be worth it in the long run. I could do that but it just grates on me. Instead I've told him to pay the money and sign the agreement or else move out of my house and get his own place for 6 months then he can move back in and we can do this on a repeating 18-month cycle forever.

For me, the online dating thing is a double edged sword. You obviously have more visibility and can show your strengths and market yourself any way you want depending on who you're hoping to meet. Similarly, you can browse other singles in a manner not unlike online shopping. With any sort of online purchase I make I like to check user reviews and ratings. That's not an option with OLD. As a result there's the issue of what will be revealed behind curtain number one once you're finally connected and chatting. If they pass the first few steps and you decide to meet in person then you're waiting for curtain number two to unveil Jekyll or Hyde. Now if the initial meet up goes accordingly then perhaps you'll get to curtain three. More dates and more in-depth talks and onto the real getting to know one another. Here's where it gets to be a real chore. Not saying that everything up to this point hasn't been laborious. It certainly has! I'm so tired of telling my story. I'm tired of telling why I'm single, why my ex isn't involved, who my family is and their names and stories, my job/career story, all the little intricacies of what makes me who I am. 
I've been single for a while and have dated enough that I've gone through all this several times. Each new prospect that comes along gets fewer details and has to wait longer to get to know me simply because I've decided to wait it out and if we get to the point of things being really *really* serious, then I'll give them the details.

Begged him to propose, but she had huge insecurity issues and would email his coworkers telling them to not contact him- even for work issues. She caused a lot of work problems for him.

Since I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend-turned husband (19 month journey), she has emailed him and texted him trying to stay friendly. He shut that down once we became serious. They had a horrible break up and he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with her.  Then she turned to the son. Asking to go out to eat with him- my husband declined it. Then she started sending selfie‚Äôs of herself in bars to the son. What 40 year old ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù influence does that!! My husband blocked her from the sons phone snd told him no more contact. I‚Äôve been married to him for one month and in that time-
She keeps finding son on FB and Instagram and adding him. My husband blocked her on both accounts since. Then he emailed her. Telling her - enough. Move on. Leave me, my son and my family alone. He threatened a restraining order- do to the inappropriate selfies she sent - drunk and scandalously dressed. 
Then She has mentioned him on a mutual friends FB. 
And today she‚Äôs posting old photos of the son on her Instagram. 

What is up with this woman? Why is she behaving this way? Thoughts on how to make it stop?!

I thought it was a game the first year and my husband totally ignored it. But I think the game would have ended with him participating. Now I‚Äôm getting pissed. I‚Äôve never met her.

It's been about 6 months since we met and 3-4 of which we have been serious.  (We actually knew each other for a year but only met in person 6 months ago). We are somewhat long distance right now but he is all set to move to my city in the next 6-8 weeks.¬† He has a great job here but lives about an hour and a half away right now.¬† We typically only see each other for a few hours one night during the week after work and have a sleep over on the weekends.¬† It's tough sometimes and I get lonely once in a while but we're winging it pretty good!

He works a LOT of hours both in and out of the office.¬† He also takes on a lot of side jobs and as a result is spread quite thin.¬† Like this dude packs 37 hours into a 24 hour day.  I don't get impatient or jealous or pouty about it because I respect how much is he trying to come up (for lack of better words). He never leaves me feeling lonely or forgotten and we text often.¬† This man lifts me up every day, seriously - he is such a hugely positive influence in my life.¬† I know it's foolish to attribute happiness to another person and I won't do that but I have to say he came along at a time in my life when I was at my lowest, never judging me.¬† In the past few months I have transformed as a human and feel so excited about who I am and where I'm going.¬† I did that for me and I'm proud as shit.¬† But a lot of that was inspired by my man's gentle encouragements and this incredible way he has of talking me through my bullshit.

He does all this while being a single Dad of a teenager! A very good one too, devoted and loving.¬† His son is a respectful and brilliant young man who I get along fantastically with. 

 We all have ugly moments and get frustrated but I have yet to see my guy become flustered, impatient, agitated or angry.¬† He keeps his cool in the toughest situations and is so patient.¬† Even during the couple of times I got a little bratty with him over something petty he was super chill about it and he has this way of talking sense into me that's so respectful and never condescending.¬† He says this is from his time in the Marines but I think he's just genuinely a strong minded person!

He makes probably 3 times as much money as I've ever made on my best days and has never made me feel like less of a person or some bumpkin ass girl from the hills (which I kinda was til moved to the city in the spring, off a 50 acre farm in an extremely rural area).¬† When we're together we talk for hours and hours til we lose our voices.¬† It's like we can neither one get enough of learning about each other's lives and dreams.

So I guess the TLDR version is I have a man in my life that is absolutely a dream come true and every day I go to bed feeling loved and cherished.¬† To put it bluntly I am so fucking overwhelmed to think I have this amazing person supporting me and am free to love him back shit tons.

It only took 2 seconds for me to realize he was speaking to me. By the time I realized he *was* speaking to me, I had heard partial of what he was saying. I figured out what he was saying but I could only hear bits and pieces. 
All of a sudden the screen says CALL ENDED. I *thought* the call dropped. And he was no longer on the line. I said *to myself* I would call him back in a sec because I was driving.

73,ojett7,1626180324,I'm going to initiate a break-up for the first time at age 43.,"tl;dr: How do you end a good relationship when you know you're not ready for something long-term?

I separated from my STBX about 8 months ago, and I'm now just waiting out the full year so we can finalize a divorce. I entered the dating world basically for the first time 4 months ago after 20 years in a relationship, 15 years of marriage, and 2 school-age kids. To my surprise it was a better experience than I expected and I quickly started dating someone regularly. 

I was up-front about my separated status, and we had a good conversation early on about where I am in life: that a long-term relationship was not my priority right now, but that I wouldn't want to just arbitrarily end something that felt right. A lot of things HAVE felt right, and if it wasn't my first new relationship and so soon after separating, I would certainly want to keep seeing her to discover where things go. I've become more conscious of a few of the negatives I do see, and I planned to bring them up, but I realized some of these may be due to her understandable ambivalence or fear of committing given where I am in life. I'm realizing now the best thing for me is to end things soon before they get too serious. I should have gone into this more firmly focused on keeping things casual instead of leading her (and myself) on. 

This is probably dating 101, but ending anything other than a long marriage is brand new to me. I think my natural inclination is to always pursue a serious relationship, so it feels really strange and selfish to end something that has never had any major problems. But I know logically that I just need more variety of dating experience before I trust myself to enter into something long-term (and I think I deserve to just have some fun). So two questions:

1) If you have been in a similar situation in the past, how did you handle it? 

2) A specific courtesy-related question: One quirk that is an issue for me is that she has never invited me to her own apartment, despite her coming over here many times (and even lamenting about her friend who is dating a guy that hasn't invited HER over). Regardless of the actual reason why, I'm trying to figure out where to have this conversation with her. I'd prefer in person and at her place so she doesn't have to go anywhere after hearing the news, but that doesn't seem to be an option. Maybe somewhere outdoors, but not in a busy place, like a park? A phone call seems too impersonal after 4 months of dating.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ojett7/im_going_to_initiate_a_breakup_for_the_first_time/
74,ojfgs3,1626182521,ouch,"I am 44F and a few weeks ago ended my relationship that i had been in with 52F for just over a year.  I was the one to call it off, I do love her ...but there are too many incompatibilities there.  she's a great person and has done nothing 'wrong' in the relationship. There was just something missing there for me and I felt it best to split for my own wellbeing, rather than stay with someone lovely who I just don't feel 100% about. 

It just hurts so much to do it. Everything is still fresh and raw, I miss her so much and I'm crying all the time. My chest is aching, I can't sleep and I have a knot in my stomach. Heartbreak REALLY hurts and it completely sucks. I don't know how long I will feel bad for. 

I'm trying to take it each day at a time. I keep running the decision over and over in my head - did I make the right choice? Could I have tried harder to make it work? It's so painful and I am so sad and disappointed that this didn't work out.

 I think she wants to get back together and give things another go. I am having to be so strict in my mind with myself, reminding that there were solid reasons of incompatibility (schedules, priorities, leisure time, mental health, affection levels....) that i need to remind myself of. The missing her and the loneliness is so overwhelming, I can see it would be so easy just to get back together. But i know deep down that this relationship isn't right for me. I think i need to be on my own and single for a long while, I suspect i have some unfinished healing to do from my divorce, this break up has reignited some old wounds.

86,ojrfxf,1626217922,Don‚Äôt know if something is going on behind my back.,"I‚Äôve (44m) been seeing a woman (42f) for just over a month.  We seem to get on really well, and everything else has been incredible.  I certainly have no complaints with regards to our time together, we seem to enjoy each other‚Äôs company, and are very attracted to one another.  So far so good, right?

The other night we were together at my house, she was staying over.  I was doing some work repairing some photos she wanted to have up in frames, so I‚Äôm sitting at my computer and she‚Äôs sat behind me on her phone while I work.  She‚Äôs chatting to friends via WhatsApp, something that seems to be common but not - until this occasion - something I personally have an issue with.  We are comfortable enough to chat and or sit in silence together and reply to messages of friends do so.

But on this occasion I turn to ask her opinion of some work I‚Äôm doing to one of her photos, and she‚Äôs scrolling up two photos that, although I only saw them briefly, are obviously of a naked man with his hand just covering his junk.  She types a reply and closes WhatsApp.  I sat waiting for a comment or something but nothing is said.  We then left my work room and return to the living room.

It was then that I asked what the photo was?  She replied that her friend often sends her naked photos of men, as a joke or because they think she‚Äôd like them.  And that her and her other friend often laugh at them when they‚Äôre sent.

Now I‚Äôll point out that this other friend is a man.  And someone she spends a lot of time with, there are weeks that she‚Äôll not be able to see me because they‚Äôre out together, he‚Äôs a lorry driver and they‚Äôll be on the road.  

I can‚Äôt help but feel that these photos were probably from him and of him, seeing as they were also arranging for him to pick her up the next day and then she‚Äôd spend time with him for a couple of days.

It must be added that she hates to be at her home, as she feels unsafe their due to her ex living nearby, I have seen her there and she‚Äôs absolutely a wreck and constantly anxious.  I‚Äôm not making excuses but understand that her being away from there, be it with me or with her friend are understandable.

I have since had it out with her that I feel that there‚Äôs something going on and she has obviously stated that there isn‚Äôt and apologised for not explaining better and making me feel like there was something going on.  But I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling that while she‚Äôs away with her friend they‚Äôre not just being friends, if that makes sense to anyone?

We talk every day, including when she‚Äôs with her friend, both via texting on WhatsApp and on the phone, but when it‚Äôs not text based all comments regarding feelings are missing.  I understand that she might be worried her fiend would lecture her that we‚Äôve not been seeing each other long enough, but I‚Äôm not talking messages of undying love just sounds of blowing kisses, or general ily that she has said when he‚Äôs not around are always missing when he is.

So, after all this long explanation etc.  Basically help.  Am I being overly sensitive and reading into stuff that‚Äôs not or shouldn‚Äôt be an issue or do you think my concerns are based in something that does sound suspect?
