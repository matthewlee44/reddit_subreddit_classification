Told him to take things slowly and now he has drifted apart from me and doesn't want to meet in real life. 

Okay, to cut the guy some slack, I was the confusing one here. 

To give context: we met online, hit off really well, and chatted nonstop for a month, heck we even gamed together and called each other. After a while, based on my past exp of guys rushing into the relationship too fast and losing interest way too fast, I told him I felt uncomfortable that he called me names like ""babe"", constantly updated me about almost anything like what he had for lunch. I felt that way cos maybe he didnt actually like me for me, that he is just liking the ideal he has of me or that maybe he's just really desperate and lonely (he told me he doesnt have alot of close friends). Furthermore, he told me alot about himself, like his family's situation, why he and his ex broke up (we were talking about our types, he said about his ex to explain he felt communication was vital) and I felt very taken aback since we only met for like one month, and online. 

After I told him about how I felt in a long text, to just take things slowly and be friends first, he apologised profusely and said he understood how I felt. He then justified that he did all that to lighten the mood and start the conversation most of the time. Ngl, I felt bad then but I was still skeptical cos I've gotten gaslit by a  desperate guy before lol. Anyways, a few days later, he tried to make conversation again and I didn't reply as I was busy with work. I saw that he deleted it and then replied to him once my work was done, and he said he did it as he felt he was being ghosted. We tried to talk, he asked again if we were just friends (to which I said yes) but the convo got awkward and we ended it on a good note. 

Today, I asked him if we were meeting this week as agreed (before I told him how I felt in the long text) and he said ""no, lets just be friends"". I told him ""yeah lets meet as friends"" and he said no but he still suggested we could play games together next time. I thanked him for the time spent together and so did he. But here's the thing, after reflecting about it, i realised i  have screwed up. I didn't tell him clearly that i still saw him as potential partner, that when I meant friends first I meant like to get to know him well first before we actually date.

Now, Im worried that he has lost interest in me, found me annoying and has decided on his end to REALLY just be friends. I wouldnt like that cos I actually like hanging out with him but Im too prideful and I dont know how to apologise cos Im still skeptical. Ive texted him to call later but he hasnt replied yet. 

Does he still have interest in me? Does he really just want to be friends? How can I rectify this mistake? Was I being too skeptical?

We know some of the same people - about a year ago an old co worker actually saw him for abit. I remember she was pretty into him but she was also seeing a lot of guys and just having fun, so it didn’t surprise me that it didn’t last long. I never asked what happened.

Fast forward to last week, we matched and he messaged me. Conversation gets going, I realize I recognize him from the one time he came into work to see my co worker, and we talk about her briefly then continue onto other conversation. He ends up asking me out for that night. We exchange numbers and later on go out for dinner. The attraction is instant and chemistry and conversation is great. The restaurant we chose closes fairly early and it also got chilly super fast(outdoor dining only due to Covid here). He invited me to come back to his place and watch a movie so we could continue to spend time together. He said he wouldn’t be offended if I wasn’t comfortable and didn’t want to. (I’m not naive enough to think that sleeping with me didn’t cross his mind, but he did seem very politely and genuine.) I decided to go for it. We spent a whole movie talking more, even discussing our work schedules and when we’d be able to see eachother again. We started a second movie and got all cuddled up. The first kiss was amazing and things got heated pretty fast. He asked multiple times if everything he was doing was okay (consent is sexy and important !). After some fooling around he said I could stay over, no pressure for anything further to happen but it was late and he needed to head to bed. I was feeling super comfortable and decided to stay. We did end up hooking up and it was really good. 

We’ve now spent 4 out of the last 5 nights together and the only night I wasn’t with him, we spent most of the day together before I went home and he took me for breakfast the next morning and we spent the whole day together again.

My dilemma now is that obviously things are moving pretty quickly but I can’t tell if he has a genuine interest in it potentially becoming a relationship or if it’s just a long for him. We’ve talked briefly about some past relationships, including how things ended between him and my co worker, and I’m getting a bit uneasy. It sounds like it’s pretty typical for him to move this fast with all the girls he sees, spend pretty much every day together and then when something happens he doesn’t like, just cuts them off. (He ended things with my co worker for a completely understandable reason to be fair.)

He’s also already made a comment (while drunk) about deleting his Tinder because he hasn’t been on since we met. Not that I was going to hold him to it, but I can see that he definitely has been online on the App as his location distance has changed.

Basically I don’t know if I should continue to pursue things with him because I’m having trouble reading him and where things are headed, and I genuinely like him and don’t want to end up getting too deep of  feelings if it’s just a fling and he’s waiting for the next girl to come along.

Its even used as an explanation as to why terrible guys still find partners, because young women mistake arrogance for confidence. So confidence must be pretty important to ignore all the terrible things they do.

I get confidence is nice and all but its hardly the trait I look for most in a person. Just looking at my friend group, one of my friends gets shy and insecure sometimes but he's one of the most interesting, intelligent and funniest guy I know. Whereas my most confident friend (who also is the most romantically successful, so confidence really is king) is the least interesting. I mean I love the guy but he only really talks about alcohol and cars. If I was dating a girl, I'd much rather date someone really interesting but a little shy than someone boring but confident. 

An argument I've heard is that men who are unconfident probably have deep insecurities leading to toxic behaviours so its a red flag. Ok, that makes sense but it only explains why a lack of confidence is unattractive but not why confidence is attractive.

So why is confidence so important. This doesn't bother me by the way. Confidence is probably an easier trait to gain than becoming interesting, smart, funny, kind and so on.

We started having sex after the third date (he initiated the touching, but I asked him if he wanted to go all the way) and he asked me to be his girlfriend about 2 months in. His personality is introverted and he's a bit on the nervous side. I'm pretty sure he had no experience prior to me and he wasn't able to work up the courage to ask me to be his girlfriend until after we'd been drinking at a bar for a bit 2 months in. I'm pretty similar to him personality-wise and I also have issues opening up and having good conversations with people that I don't know that well. I find that lately though, I've found myself to be at the point where I'm comfortable enough to just talk to him casually and relax around him. It's a great feeling and the conversations between us are definitely flowing better because of it. 

My issue is that I feel like he still hasn't really gotten comfortable with me yet. It's not an issue of him not liking me enough. I definitely get that feeling that he's just completely fallen for me because he shows all the classic signs in the way he stares, hugs, texts, or just treats me in general. He's even tried to get me to meet his parents several times, he's asked me to go on family vacations with him, and he's mentioned possibly moving in together in a year (I haven't actually met his parents or gone on vacation with him though because I've had conflicts each time. I gave him a maybe on the moving in together since I personally feel like it was way too soon to seriously consider that). He's a big worrier and always asks me if something he did was ok with me and is always trying to make sure I didn't misinterpret or misunderstand things he says or texts he sends. 

Again, this is all cool with me as I really like him and I feel like our personalities just mesh really well. I feel like I've discovered a long lost friend in him that I also happen to find attractive. I just feel like he's having an entire conversation with me in his head instead of out loud. Like lately, I've been talking more openly with him about things and feeling more comfortable with him. Sometimes, there'll still be that pause in the conversation. I'm fine with these conversation pauses, but I notice that he'll just sit there and he looks like he's thinking about things. He'll open his mouth like he's about to talk and then he'll end up not saying anything at all. Whenever I notice he does this, I ask him what he was about to say. He'll usually get embarassed and say it was nothing. He actually gave me an answer to what he was about to say a couple of times. Once, it was something about how he was thinking about me giving him a blowjob right there (we were in public and we both laughed it off). The other time, it was about me moving in with him next year (which I said maybe to bc we had only been dating for like 2 months at that point). He doesn't usually initiate conversations that often though, and when he does it's usually small talk and he's asking me random questions about myself. He never tells me much about what he likes or what he's been up to lately. So, at dinner, the conversation usually ends up with me talking almost the whole time about how my week went or things that interest me or something that happened one time a couple years ago. I'll keep trying to steer the conversation back to him and let him talk, but he gives me those short answers that I recognize from myself that are signs of being nervous and uncomfortable.

We are exclusive but we haven’t got labels yet. I’ve met his family, friends, and we’ve also made travel plans for the future. We have only had one ‘argument’ which was resolved maturely, and I’m genuinely really happy with him. 

My issue is this; he actively looks at hot women on his Instagram. His reels are full of half-naked TikTok style videos, his discovery page is full of hot women, and he follows professional models, celebs, and others. I also saw that when he searched something he had random beautiful non-famous women in his recent searches. Could be exes or others he may fancy.

It bothers me and I don’t know why as he hasn’t followed any new pages since seeing me and doesn’t comment/like their pics or messages them. I trust him and he opens the app and his messages around me (doesn’t act secretive). He also gave me his phone passcode for when he asks me to check something while he’s driving. 

So I think it’s a case of him browsing. I understand it’s normal to find others attractive, and if it were a few seconds glance at a woman who walks past then I wouldn’t care. That would be coincidental but this seems like he’s seeking it out. I don’t think he’s wrong for it but it’s not my thing. I don’t spend time salivating over hot men on socials so I just don’t understand it.

I’m thinking whether to wait for when we’re official to bring it up? As I just don’t know if I can accept it.

And she wasn't physically my type either, but we hung out and I enjoyed her company and the conversations we had and didn't expect or care for it to be more than that.

She wanted to stay friends and stated the reason being she was seeing someone at work and it was going well. This bruised my ego a bit, but I don't mind being friends because it was fun and I had fun hanging out with her and I assume she did too because we ended up spending the entire day together every time we hung out which was about 4 times.

I've also kinda been messing around with other people during the whole so being rejected doesn't really affect me as a whole, but If someone says they want to be friends I kind of expect them to act like a friend? like she's just bad at replying to texts has difficulty sticking to plans, doesn't really seem interested in me as a person at all unless we meet up and hang out, so it's just very confusing as a whole what she wants exactly and i've been leaving her alone to see what she does, but then she comes with a text asking me how I am doing and it feels like she's forcing herself to care when she probably doesn't?

It's very weird because she's probably taken more pictures of me out of everyone I know since the beginning of the year, has expressed interest in doing more fun things together in the future, but puts little to no effort into it?

I'm going to warn that I'll likely seem upset with this Post, and I kind of am, but you'll likely see why soon enough.

\----

Simply, I've never really had trouble being hurt by people but I do have massive issues with being liked by them, especially women. I'll wonder about the why's myself but that's not what my Post is about.

it's about my last three ""experiences"" with people who ""supposedly"" liked/had interest in me. (Mostly). &amp; It's about how I could not be hurt by everyone, evidently I don't know how to do that.

\---

so to start this off I'll speak of some girl who, like the other's, supposedly had interest but then said interest abruptly and reasonlessly dies. This lady was quite gorgeous but never did she say much. I guess that should have been a signal of disinterest, but she also claimed that she has issues following what people say. So I guess I can't say for certain. For days we spoke, and she proclaimed her interest in me, which I found nice.

What wasn't so nice was how the day before my birthday she abruptly starts talking to me, sends me some pictures, and before I can even respond and as I get ready to look nice for a picture for her she says that she doesn't like the vibe between us and that we have nothing in common. (I'm wondering how a person can decide that when they offer none of their interests or likes, personally, but oh well)

So be that I guess.

\----

This second one is a bit more fun; for you all maybe. A bit after that first woman I start talking to another, and this person was quite a bit more forward than. Advances were made by her, and I reciprocated.

Plans were made to actually get together, and we traded intimate photos in addition to words and a few others things. We spoke and interacted so much, I don't think I've spent as much time on anyone within a day.

However, as with the last, a day came and all came to ruin again. Turns out she was still in love with another and didn't actually like me at all.

In fact, she said everything was only because she was bored.

...So be that too I guess...

\----

This final one's honestly just bullshit, I'm sorry for being vulgar but damn, this one's today-fresh so the pain is rather strong still, and I don't like the three stings of it either. (You'll see the stings I speak of soon)

So a bit after that second girl I start speaking to another, not for long I'll admit, but it's about the closest I've been to a proper relationship. Last night we made plans to hang out for a portion of today. whihc honestly gave me sincere happiness, I've been in a city for quite a few years and haven't been able to make any friends or anything. So I guess it gave me some hope, you know?

However, here comes the first of those stings I was talking about; I wasn't the only person she invited over that day. She actually had another person over at her place for the morning. which I can't say made me feel the greatest.

How ever, supposedly this guy was so creepy that it made her not want to meet me today. This was the second sting, and it was understandable I'll give it that, I don't hold the ""not wanting to meet"" against her, the reason is sound. (I will say thought that I'm not appreciative of another's actions ruining plans of mine)

So Instead of meeting we just text for a good portion of the day.

But then comes the third and final sting, she spoke about still being interest in some person in a different town and that she wants to date them, not I.

...

...

***Sigh***

So be this too....

I (33M) have been friends with this girl (28F) for about 5 years. We met through common friends and got into a casual sex relationship for a few months. On my end, I really liked her as a friend, we were having a lot of fun and all, but she confessed she had feelings so we stopped seeing each other for a little while.

She however wanted to remain friends and I had no objection to that so we started hanging out again with no sex involved. She was going through a difficult time financially so I offered my help, we hung out on a regular basis and texted everyday.

Her feelings were always kind of coming and going, and I didn't know how to tell her I wanted to date, so I didn't for a few years. I'm a loner so it was fine by me in a way, dating makes me uncomfortable overall, and I knew it would complicate things and didn't want to lose her as a friend.

Since things were slowly coming back to normal in my country pandemic wise, I expressed my desire to see what's out there, and as expected, our relationship clashed. She couldn't bare the idea of me dating other people so she backed off and we didn't talk or see each other for a few months.

I've had a few dates since but things never felt right, as if something was missing. I kept wondering how she is doing, what's new with her. I held myself back from texting her so many times because I knew she needed her space, but over time, it made me more and more sad that I couldn't reach out to her. We had so many shared memories and all, and I figured I miss her as a friend, but now it kind of aches and I'm very confused about it.

Then week later we go out for a long walk and some lunch just the two of us and she said I had a great day and gave me a hug.
From then on I have been off work for a week and been texting each other literally everyday bar today as well I am camping and phones don’t have long battery life until i found a plug to charge.

I responded saying something like ""haha, you never really know if someones up to it on a first date, next time"", as I thought he was flirting. He then continued talking about it saying that prior to the date I said I knew what I wanted (that being a relationship, which I had been clear about to make sure we were on the same page) and in this case he knew what he wanted and that was ""a kiss and maybe more"".

Its like, its hard enough to meet someone, hit it off, have an honest conversation about expectations and what we're both looking for and somehow make it all the way to hooking up. And when we do its all good vibes, but it always feels like something unspoken develops after we've left each other and they had time to ""process""...

Like, couple days ago i hook up with this girl. We were clear about it being just a friends with benefits thing even before i showed up and i can say for sure the sex was way better for her than it was for me, she came 3 times and i didn't even get a chance to. She even said it was some of the most fun and interesting sex she's ever had, we were laughing a lot

Like i get this a lot, where everything seems great when I'm there and she even took me to this party afterwards so it's not like i just up and left her. I know she had a thing about clingy guys wanting to crash at her place so i left without a fuss and didn't text her much.

But its like, our communication was fine, great even, up until the point when we hooked up and then she goes dark and it could take more than 24-48 hours to respond to a single one of my texts. She sees fit to try and gaslight me like nothings going on like the others but she unfollowed me on instagram. I've gotten the same exact vibe from girls I've fucked before where the parting communication is ""this was fun lets do this again soon"" and they somehow get it in their minds to block me out of nowhere sometime after.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating officially for the past 2.5 months and have been knowing each other unofficially for the past almost 6 months.

Our relationship was going amazing up until around 2 weeks ago, she lied to me about some things, one being the identity of an ex, and another being a rather strange lie (see other posts on my account). This created some tension in our relationship but now it just feels like its gone down the can.

Last night we were talking, and she brought up how I was upset the other day. I was upset because I moved to a brand new city and knew nobody, I have always struggled to make friends my entire life due to bullying and such. But I took a lot of socially energy to make plans with people that day, who ended up bailing last minute. I was frustrated, and sad but I didn't take it out on anyone, I was just in an off mood that night. I told my GF about it at the time and I didn't really feel supported or like she cared, but I shrugged it off.

Anyways she brought it up last night and said that she doesn't like how I throw a pity party or that I whine about problems. And then proceeded to say that she doesn't have any sympathy for a lot of issues I have in my life. This hurt me quite a bit to hear because in the first month of our relationship she didn't act like this towards me, she was very supportive of any issue I faced in my life (not that I face a lot) I'm just confused why she is no longer acting like that and is now cold to my issues. Her tone gives me the opinion that she doesn't care and that ""her issues are more important and difficult than mine"". Which I don't think is fair, I believe that in a relationship, both peoples hardships are valid no matter what they are, and you support each other accordingly.

On the contrary she ""whines"" or ""throws a pity party"" over things all the time and I don't react like that, I either offer to help or just sit there and let her vent to me. One of these things she brings up a lot is about cleaning her house because she has a 2 year old who likes making messes.

I felt like what she said was downright mean, when she is upset she often gets aggressive with her words and says things like ""you're too sensitive"" ""all these talks about our issues are dumb"" ""I don't need you in my life""

The talks she is referring too is that when I am upset in a relationship, I like to sit down and talk in a way that is ""When you said/ did this, it made me feel like this and I don't like that"" (which I think is the healthy way to argue/fight). When we have these she clams up and doesn't really have much input or she gets very defensive and says hurtful things. Often the apology she leaves me with is one that I'm not satisfied with. Because she doesn't act like she is genuinely sorry. Idk whenever I upset her I feel very guilty and try my best to not do those actions again.

She often tells me how I should and should not feel and that I need to get over it. For reference, she told a pretty big trickle truth lie to me that I was upset over because I think honesty is very important in a relationship and she told me that ""nobody else in the world would care about this, get over it""

I talked to my therapist about it and she said that how my gf tells me how I should and shouldn't feel is a big no no. I agree, but like in the first month she was so good to me and reacted in the correct ways to all these issues, and now she is someone else. It feels like I'm dating an entire new person, this isn't the person I fell in love with.

I am proud of the fact that as a guy I can communicate my emotions with people in a way that is not violent at all. Even when I'm extremely mad at someone I sit down calmly and say ""when you said this it made me feel like this"". I feel like that because I don't yell or act mean when she upsets me she doesn't seem to realize the gravity of how much something hurt or upset me idk, but I don't believe in yelling at people or getting aggressive with words or actions when you are upset, my mom taught me better than that. Maybe I'm a little sensitive but I'm 21 have graduated, has an amazing job, and a very profitable side business and my own place as well. Idk, I feel like my sensitivity and people skills have helped me in being so successful at my young age.

I am currently being stonewalled after I texted her and told her that what she said to me last night hurt my feelings, I'm honestly tired of it. Has anyone been in a relationship like this before? What happened?

I just want things to go back to how she treated me in the first month of dating.

We met when I was visiting his hometown and we went on several dates during that visit. The day I was leaving, I told him I liked him and I encouraged him to visit me where I live. We didn't talk much after that but a month later he visited me for a weekend and we had a wonderful time. He said he knew he was going to have fun but he had more fun that he even expected. After that trip, I was moving back to his hometown in a month so we had plans to meet then. We don't talk much in between that time, aside from one phone call that he initiated. When I do move back to his hometown, we spend time every weekend together and even went on a weekend trip where all his friends were present. While we never discussed this, I heard through the grapevine that he is also regularly seeing some other girl as well. I am not sure what happened with that but a week ago I bring up that I am still seeing other people and he I know he is too. He mentions he is not seeing anyone else at this moment. (He does not, however, tell me that he has stopped or is no longer interested in seeing anyone else- just that there is no one else at this moment).

I just graduated college, and we had been seeing each other since I finished school. It’s been great and we would always have great time together. I feel like she truly understands me and I feel very comfortable and happy with her. 

Despite the vast difference in age, we do like a lot of the same things and could talk on the same level often. It makes me very happy to see her, even though she lives more than an hour away.

I decided to break things off just because I felt like the relationship didn’t have a real future. This is mainly due to how we are both in very different places in life... It sucks, and I really felt like I broke things off in the worst way possible (we had sex, and I told her almost immediately after, I know, shitty... I expect no sympathy from anyone for just that). 

The worst part of all of this is that I felt as though I had no doubt in my mind that she was someone I wanted to be with. I had my doubts that we would end up being together, and when we finally were, that spark just faded in me. I hate how it has to be this way, and I wish I could undo what I’ve done.

Normally he comes my way but the last 3 times (March-May) I've finally visited him. The last time we were together was mid-May for four days and everything was completely normal. We've never been exclusive since he's pretty private in that regard and his parents are homophobic but all his main friends know about me.

Since June 6th, he's been more distant and completely unlike himself with me. We still talk daily and he will message me first/be jovial, but saying goodnight on a regular basis has mostly stopped as well as me getting any compliments from him. The last time I did was memorial day.

He told me on June 9th via phone that he wishes things could go back to being more casual but didn't elaborate and claimed he was still very much attracted to me. Both of us split the cost for an expensive hotel room in my area the weekend of July 4th, which is still planned.

I have a feeling it's mostly because he's getting tired of me not working a regular hour job but he's too nice to say that (he works Monday through Friday as a leasing agent and I work remotely as an art dealer for commission, but it isn't consistent.) We've never had a fight or falling out about anything.

Yesterday he apologized for not talking much and asked if he could see me again

I work less, I focus less on my own maintenance (working out, studying, leisure time, etc), and as things progress, I start to even isolate from my friends/family.  


I do not think that this is the fault of my partner (though I have had a few that have actively tried to drive a wedge between me and my social groups). I think it has to do with some sort of... *need,* of mine, to commit to my partners too much at the expense of myself. I become invested in their issues, problems, and desires so much that I just... get off track, and it's hard for me to maintain.  


And when I stop maintaining myself, I start to stop being the guy that they were attracted to, and start to become a drag. I don't know how to be myself *and* commit to a partner, right now. I feel like I need to be alone to be my best self, at least for now. I still want to meet people, I just don't want to date - I know I'm not healthy enough, mentally, to commit. Weirdly, I actually feel a sense of... relief? Thinking about that. Just a month ago, I was reeling from a breakup. Now I feel much better, though I still have work to do.

It's not that I am saying ""screw dating,"" or even that I never want to date again. It's just that I feel more content by myself, and don't feel the need to rock my own boat to find someone right now, if that makes sense.
