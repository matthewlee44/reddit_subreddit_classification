I’d post on here asking for advice whenever I felt like something was off, trying to get reassurance and different perspectives from strangers. When you start doubting something in your relationship that’s because deep down you know something’s wrong and it’s your intuition trying to protect you. 

You don’t get anxious just like that and past relationship trauma isn’t always to blame. For example- if you never think about your SO’s ex partner and you don’t worry about them at all that’s because you know you have nothing to worry about. If you worry your partner will cheat on you and feel like you can’t trust them it’s because they somehow showed you they aren’t reliable. Whenever I felt anxious about some things in relationship, I compared it so some other situations and realized what I am anxious about and what I’m not anxious about. 

I’m not talking about people who are constantly anxious or who don’t trust people in general right from the start, but about people who get that feeling of anxiety randomly one day and it starts repeating itself. I know that a lot of people can’t tell a difference between anxiety and intuition. For me, if a feeling comes and goes it’s usually just a fear (anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

Now context means everything when it comes to flakes. So if a girl flakes on you the day off then to me that is an automatic move on and don't even respond back to her type deal. It's a level of disrespect. You set aside your time to chill with this person and they just gonna wait last minute to cancel on you. 

  
If she cancels on you the day before then alright you can try to set something up for another time and see if things work out then. This way she at least gave you a day notice to like re-plan your own thing. But if she cancels again then she is done. Move on and look for other prospects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I would have the viewpoint of be relentless and pursue a girl until she flat out says listen im not interested then move on. But why are you gonna go after a girl who is luke warm about you. I think at this point if you don't have like interest in me im not gonna try to convince you otherwise. There are so many girls out here you should be lowering yourself or letting her try to have such an upperhand in the situation just to get a girl. I think the reason people think its cool to flake or ghost is because as guys we need to hold each other to a higher standard and have more self-respect for each other. Getting a girl isn't the end all be all here.

My last relationship was a mutual break up so it was fairly easy to move on from it. 

But recently, whenever my mom mentions how I should have a friend set me up with someone or mentions anything about my dating life, I kind of recoil.

As of this past year and a half, I haven't had a drive to start dating anyone or really try to. The idea of going on dating apps or always trying to pursue a relationship seems like a pain in the ass. More so than it ever has before.

I think part of this is because I've found I really enjoy being single in my young years. I'm 22f. The fact I don't have to make decisions with someone else and can just choose where I want to go and what I want to do without having to worry about upholding a romantic relationship is very freeing for me. 

I have found a lot of contentment in just hanging out with friends and working towards bettering myself for just me and me only. I can take little vacations by myself and do all the things I want to do just for me. In a way being single allows you some much needed selfishness (which isn't always bad as long as you don't hurt anyone :) )

A relationship should add to your life, not take away/feel like a necessity to happiness. I think people can really find themselves being single, which when the time comes when you really want a relationship, it will be so much more healthy and worthwhile. I see folks who quickly go through relationship to relationship and I don't think that's necessarily healthy at times.

We’ve been playing games and teasing each other for such a long time. He’s asked me out a few times but only after rejecting my advances. If I say anything that suggests we’re not friends, he’s put me in my place. Only then would he ask me out. Naturally I would turn him down and put him in his place, the place being my friend.

We just had a sort of “argument”, it was more so passive aggressive. He didn’t snap, or crumble. I’m not going to fold either. It wasn’t really an argument but I can tell this can’t go on. 

He’s told me he really likes me before and find me beautiful. I believe him but I’m not sure if he can be my boyfriend. I’m so used to joking around with him, I don’t think I can be affectionate around him.

Does anyone have any reasonable advice, considering everything I said? I’m not asking about the correct thing to do just how do I get what I want without lowering myself. I’m so close to moving on.

My friends are telling me to force myself to move on but I really like him. I could easily move on and be happy with someone else. There are plenty of guy I’m attracted to that are trying to ask me out on a date. The problem is I want him because we have a connection.

It was a pretty quick evening since I was about to leave on a trip, but we agreed to go out again when I got back.

We texted back and forth a bit and then she said that she'd love to see me again but she wasn't sure that I was very interested in her because I didn't really ask questions about her, even when she offered information. Then she wished me ask the best. I responded by saying that we were connecting so well that I was finding things out about her without asking a lot of questions but she hasn't messaged me since.

I'm sharing this because nobody's ever told me that before so needless to say it was a bit of a surprise. It's been the better part of a year since I've been on a date with someone I seemed to connect with as well as her so it's a bit frustrating. I can see why not asking a lot of questions could be a sign of not being all that interested in getting to know someone, or being self absorbed.

Looks matter In trying to find someone, being confident matter when trying to find someone, being unattractive plays a major role in trying to find someone. If you are confident but unattractive you will probably not find the exact person you are trying to find and do not listen to people who say “if you’re confident you can do anything” as that statement is completely false. There are some people who are unattractive who can land very gorgeous women but at the end of the day that scenario happens less than 2% of the time. If trying to get into a relationship and find a romantic partner constantly plague your mind then leave this sub as the people who “try” to help you don’t know what they are talking about or won’t tell you the truth. The harsh reality of what you need to do is to get into shape, no big gut or flabby skin, you need to be be toned. You don’t need to have a six pack or anything but you need to be toned. I know achieving this is hard work but you need to do it. The next thing you need to do is get a job and work your ass off at it if you aren’t doing so already or go to college and get a good degree that will result in a high paying job or better yet go to trade school. The next thing you need to do is live on your own and not with roommates. The next couple of things you need to do are to be confident. This is the hardest thing on the list to do but you need to be confident. Start going out to places and talking to random women just talk to them, don’t have the mindset of trying to bring them back to your place or anything as you are not ready for that step at all. All you should be doing is talking to woman to get comfortable around them. Keep moving to the next person to the next when the conversation is done. You will know when you are ready to try and pursue something as stupid as it sounds and even then you will fail and flop but you just have to get back up and do everything again. Do all of this and your chances will increase of finding a potential partner but it’s not guaranteed as some people are just destined to be alone and you could be one of them. This is all the harsh truth that no one  wants to hear but it what’s you need to do and for anyone  that tells you otherwise is completely wrong even if they give you valid points they are still wrong. Not everyone is the same which people don’t seem to understand so you need to be the best version of yourself that you can be and sometimes that’s not even enough. Heed my harsh truth or not but it is the truth.

I’m a high functioning autistic guy and way back in 2018 I was accepted into a college program for other people with learning disabilities. Got to move a state away from my parents and into a dorm as I wanted the hell away from them. I moved into one of the dorms which was brand new and I didn’t have roommates I had a room all to myself which was great. First semester went amazingly well I made a great amount of friends and did really well in all my classes. 

Come second semester second week my best friend told me that our other friend told her that this one girl liked me. Now previous semester I kinda had a thing for this girl (I’ll call her M) but it kinda died during the last few weeks because she likes to complain about her mother and other things that don’t matter. She would also compliment me sometimes no one’s really ever complimented me before it made me blush when she did. 

She complimented me when I got six inches taken off my hair it was long and curly it was still long after I got it cut shoulder length and people would say I look like a rockstar with my style of hair. She said “hey did you get a haircut? It looks really nice.” Me:”thanks.” “Can I feel it?” Me: ”um sure.” “Ohhhh it’s so soft!” 

Just hearing that she had a crush on me was enough to bring the feelings I had back and the fact that no one’s ever been interested in me romantically. So I guess I liked her because I thought she liked me :(. 

The next Monday we both sit down and something in me tells me that something is wrong about this. I asked her that I did like her and then I asked if she liked me back but she didn’t say yes or no. She told me that she loves her mom, her sister, and her two brothers and after she graduates the program she’s transferring to a school that’s like 30 minutes away from mine. Then she asks me what does this make us and I said I’m not sure and I had a class to go to right after that. For the rest of the day until the end of my 5:30-8:00 class I was super confused and upset. After I got back from class she wanted to tell me she changed her mind and wanted to try with me. 

Now since I am new to dating I’m not all that great with communication. We didn’t really go out on any dates throughout two months we dated I asked if she wanted to go out a few times but she always said maybe. We also lived in the same dorm.

On weekends she likes to go home to see her family so one day she asks if I can take her home and hang out there. She also didn’t have a drivers license at the time. We hung out for a few hours and I just constantly felt awkward and I didn’t feel relaxed.

The next time we hung out at her place I felt a bit more relaxed and a little less awkward. Her teenage sister hung out with us and I had to listen to horrifying BTS music videos. The next day I was walking to my evening class and she texts me asking if I hate her. I told her no why would you think that? And she said that her sister told her I looked like I hated her. I didn’t hate her and I convinced her I didn’t.

Come Valentine’s Day I buy her a card, flowers, and a box of chocolates and I also wanted to take her to the Cheesecake Factory. Her mom already made plans for her to go to church and on a Thursday which was odd to me. Her mom canceled the church plan and I asked her if she wanted to do dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and she asks if I made reservations for it and I said no. I’ve only been to the Cheesecake Factory twice in my life I did not know they made reservations. She made me feel like shit for not making a reservation. Later that night we exchange valentines gifts and we end up ordering a pizza.

A week or two later about an hour after her mom takes her home she starts texting me and getting on to me about how I am bad at communication and getting on to me about how I’m not all that close to my brother but she’s very close to her brother. My brothers a busy guy with two kids to raise and he’s kind of a serious guy that can make any conversation uncomfortably serious he’s also 14 years older than me so there’s an age gap. And she said something that scarred me mentally and it’s something that I’d never thought she’d say “alright but I don’t usually date people with a disability that’s not really my type when it comes to guys.” That sentence really made me upset and had me in tears for a few days. I showed my text to my best friend right after she texted me to try and get advice he tells me that yes I could work on my communication and she can as well because a lot of the messages she sends me are cryptic. He end up calling her and shaming her for saying what she said he told her she was a bigot. We lasted two more weeks I should have broken up when she sent that text but I was a dumbass and thought I could move past it.

The next two weeks were just downhill. One day we were sitting in the union and she wants to know how much money I have in my bank account and I tell her I don’t think that’s your business and she says “don’t make me yell at you I need to know.” So I caved and told her I didn’t have much and she said ugh my sister has more money than you. The Sunday before we break up I really try an attempt to communicate with her and she gets mad at me for texting her while she’s at work and tries to make me feel bad about it. My best friend sees an upset look on my face and asks me what has she said to you? I told her she’s mad because I texted while she’s at work. Unknowingly after I told him that he send a really long text to her i don’t remember what but I do remember the text saying “stop acting like an asshole to him” and when she rolls me about the text that is the only sentence she got out of it. The next day she breaks up with me and I’m feeling the same way about it. During the process of the breakup she tries to turn my friend against me unsuccessfully and later that day she tells me she just wants to be friends and I agree to it. At the end of the semester I told her I didn’t want to be friends and I blocked her on everything. Throughout the rest of that year I was depressed and afraid to get into relationships. Fast forward to now 2021 I am trying to work on myself and lose 90 pounds 255 to 165. I didn’t weigh 255 back then and now in 2021 I just feel gross, unattractive, and just plain afraid to get into another relationship.

Wattup guys i'm a 20 year boy that really needs advice on what to do. First off, i am not english so please forgive any mistakes i might make along the journey that i am about to take you into. Also it is my first time writting in reddit so fingers crossed ahahaa.
So a litle bit of a backstory about myself, i am 20 year medstudent that really didnt dive into the idea of dating and girls in general since last years and it has been quite the struggle. I gamed probably my entire life (which helped deal witha lot of stuff) and I consider myself pretty good in social meetings and have a great sense of humour, and some self esteem issues😳...but when it comes to girls I dont have a clue on what to do😂😂. A lot of people say it is with practice and I accept that but I really need advice in the situation i am currently in.
So I met this girl, lets call her Beth for explanation purposes, when I got into university, about a year ago and we got along REALLY well and i mean really well, we talked everyday and I fell HARD for her (my first love/crush ahah). Then something happened, we slept together, but nothing sexually related happen just cuddling. I was a bit like 'wtf is happening here' bcs i had no clue if that meant annything to her or if that was a normal thing to happen...so i talked to her about my feelings and about that night and i got rejected...which to me didnt make sense bcs she was all over me hugging, kissing, even holding hands at times and dont get me wrong she has a very touchy-like relationship with people but no where near to the one she had with me and everyone thought we were dating. So I actually took the rejection really well beacuse I was so happy that I had the courage to spill out the feelings I had which I considered to be a lot of development in my courage department ahaha. But after 2 weeks of not contacting her (just did when i needed something school related) she began to call me and text me everyday which I found odd at the time but found it fine since I liked our friendship a lot, and so never tried anything sexual again (despite having some feelings). Then I started to hang out with new friends that I met in college and I loved them, they bassicly became my family we are really close and i bassically almost got over her....and THEN she got JEALOUS, but really jealous and so she started to hang out with them also and became part of my group of friends which kinda pissed/is pissing me off. So then the summer came and now in the beggining of the semester , about 1 week ago she began to almost ONLY hanging out with THEM, she had her other group of girlfriends but now it is like she ditched her girlfriends and now ONLY hangs out with my friends...like WTF...i mean they were kinda my way of also getting over her and know she is in there. Also she started to hugg me, messaging me and saying she misses me all the time, and so i started to set boundaries about what she can do in that department but she IGNORES ALL OF THEM. She is also constantly jealous of a girl which is in my group of friends and Beth is jealous of her all the time and wont shut up about it. I am really losing my mind and it is becoming really difficult to interact with beth. And now I am kinda struggling with anxiety and some sort of depression that  because my feelings started to come again and when Beth's bestfriend is with me and Beth she ONLY talks about boys for Beth and always pointing to attractive men that are good for her and I swear it is the only topic of conversation when she is with us which kills me inside but i try my best to hide it. So as i said I am feeling really depressed because I dont know what to do and I really cant concentrate or feel motivated to do things. So i really wanted to know you guys opinion in my situation since i am really strugling and dont feel confident to talk to someone about it.

I consider myself a generally charismatic person. Most people I've met in pretty much any setting like me. This has been very consistent from primary school all the way through two high schools, a university and 3 workplaces.

But to my knowledge I've never attracted anyone as a result of being charismatic, and I've never gotten the sense whilst speaking to a woman that she likes me in anything besides a platonic sense. A woman I was dating once commented that she'd be more attracted to me if I wasn't so goofy/expressive/hyper all the time (though she didn't go into any detail about how else I should be acting, stoic would be my guess?), and I realized that there's a difference between being charismatic in general, and being charismatic romantically/sexually. I'm looking for advice on how to work on the latter.

I sometimes think it might be because I have a overly positive and jokingly child-like demeanour, so that makes people sub-consciously categorize me in a platonic zone in their minds since those qualities on their own don't fit with typical masculine traits (though by my understanding they make a great addition to them).

It seems most people assume someone doesn’t want to date someone without a car because of financial reasons, that it must mean they are broke, and being broke is unattractive. I don’t care about money. I am broker than fuck myself. For me, the reason I’m debating this, is because of transportation issues. We are about 30 minutes apart. I do NOT want to have to be the one driving to get to them every time we do something together. There is not a great public transportation system in this area. So it probably means they simply do not go out to do much. Their manager at work picks them up for work. Not having a car in a location that doesn’t have widely available public transportation really limits things you can do. And that is what I find unattractive. I empathize with people in this situation, I know it is very difficult to not have a car. It prevents you from being independent. And I’m sure that fucking sucks. Having said that, I just can’t see myself dating someone in this scenario. And, yes, maybe there is a bit of worry over their financial situation. How long have they been without a car? Are they irresponsible with their money and that’s the cause of not having a car? Do they just simply not understand the importance of saving up for a car? Is their credit awful?

Should I have waited for him, given that he had still put aside time to meet me despite his crazy schedule?  Was I in the wrong for cancelling on him before giving him a chance to show me he cared in real life?

I warn you, english isn’t my main language.
I went on 2 dates with a girl that is going through a breakup that happened less than a month ago. Her relationship lasted 4 years. In the first date, we really connected. In the second date, we had fun at the start and I felt a connection. Knowing that she is going through a breakup, I didn’t feel comfortable kissing without saying something beforehand so I told her that I felt like it. She started crying and talking about her ex and how she wish she could get back with him, but that she doesn’t want to at the same time. I talked with her, tried to help her as much as I could during 2 hours. Eventually, we had to go.

At the end of the date, I said I was open to see her again and that I don’t want to pressure her into anything. She said she wanted to see me again too and gave me a hug. 

The next day, we texted a bit and she told me she felt really awful. She said that she need some time alone and that she isn’t ready to date. I said that I understand and to take care of herself. I told her that my door remains open for when she is ready. Later that day, she messaged me again and I answered her that I was confused since I thought she wanted to stop seeing me. I asked her if she likes me and she said she doesn’t know, that she is in a weird part of her life.

Yesterday, we texted a bit and I asked her if she was open to simply be friends since we really get along well. She said yes.

Here’s where I’m beginning to feel doubts. A part of me thinks that I may have been pushy with her and scared her off dating/a potential relationship with me in the future. Another part of me understands that she is in pain and that it’s not my fault, that it’s not because I’m not attractive/interesting enough. I can’t help but feel responsible. Also, I hope that it will develop into a romantic relationship eventually, but I feel like I shot myself in the foot by asking to be just friends. Also, I texted her 24 hours ago and she did not reply yet.

I’m a high functioning autistic guy and way back in 2018 I was accepted into a college program for other people with learning disabilities. Got to move a state away from my parents and into a dorm as I wanted the hell away from them. I moved into one of the dorms which was brand new and I didn’t have roommates I had a room all to myself which was great. First semester went amazingly well I made a great amount of friends and did really well in all my classes. 


Come second semester second week my best friend told me that our other friend told her that this one girl liked me. Now previous semester I kinda had a thing for this girl (I’ll call her M) but it kinda died during the last few weeks because she likes to complain about her mother and other things that don’t matter. She would also compliment me sometimes no one’s really ever complimented me before it made me blush when she did. 

Now I think I have a pretty good personality. I love hanging out with my friends and going out and having a fun good time. I love gaming I play things like assassins creed, halo, Skyrim, any adventure or RPG and I can’t wait till 2022 because I believe that will be one of the best years for gaming ever can’t wait to play Starfield. I’m also a lover of sci-fi books and fantasy like the Percy Jackson books or the Maze Runner and so many others. I am currently reading the Witcher series and when I am finished I plan on reading the Dune books then watching the movie. I am a fan of anime and I think it’s much more fun to watch with your friends. One of my favorites is Tokyo Goul. I am also getting into manga starting out with Black Clover.

She complimented me when I got six inches taken off my hair it was long and curly it was still long after I got it cut shoulder length and people would say I look like a rockstar with my style of hair. She said “hey did you get a haircut? It looks really nice.” Me:”thanks.” “Can I feel it?” Me: ”um sure.” “Ohhhh it’s so soft!” 

Just hearing that she had a crush on me was enough to bring the feelings I had back and the fact that no one’s ever been interested in me romantically. So I guess I liked her because I thought she liked me :(. 

The next Monday we both sit down and something in me tells me that something is wrong about this. I asked her that I did like her and then I asked if she liked me back but she didn’t say yes or no. She told me that she loves her mom, her sister, and her two brothers and after she graduates the program she’s transferring to a school that’s like 30 minutes away from mine. Then she asks me what does this make us and I said I’m not sure and I had a class to go to right after that. For the rest of the day until the end of my 5:30-8:00 class I was super confused and upset. After I got back from class she wanted to tell me she changed her mind and wanted to try with me. 

Now since I am new to dating I’m not all that great with communication. We didn’t really go out on any dates throughout two months we dated I asked if she wanted to go out a few times but she always said maybe. We also lived in the same dorm.

On weekends she likes to go home to see her family so one day she asks if I can take her home and hang out there. She also didn’t have a drivers license at the time. We hung out for a few hours and I just constantly felt awkward and I didn’t feel relaxed.

The next time we hung out at her place I felt a bit more relaxed and a little less awkward. Her teenage sister hung out with us and I had to listen to horrifying BTS music videos. The next day I was walking to my evening class and she texts me asking if I hate her. I told her no why would you think that? And she said that her sister told her I looked like I hated her. I didn’t hate her and I convinced her I didn’t.

Come Valentine’s Day I buy her a card, flowers, and a box of chocolates and I also wanted to take her to the Cheesecake Factory. Her mom already made plans for her to go to church and on a Thursday which was odd to me. Her mom canceled the church plan and I asked her if she wanted to do dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and she asks if I made reservations for it and I said no. I’ve only been to the Cheesecake Factory twice in my life I did not know they made reservations. She made me feel like shit for not making a reservation. Later that night we exchange valentines gifts and we end up ordering a pizza.

A week or two later about an hour after her mom takes her home she starts texting me and getting on to me about how I am bad at communication and getting on to me about how I’m not all that close to my brother but she’s very close to her brother. My brothers a busy guy with two kids to raise and he’s kind of a serious guy that can make any conversation uncomfortably serious he’s also 14 years older than me so there’s an age gap. And she said something that scarred me mentally and it’s something that I’d never thought she’d say “alright but I don’t usually date people with a disability that’s not really my type when it comes to guys.” That sentence really made me upset and had me in tears for a few days. I showed my text to my best friend right after she texted me to try and get advice he tells me that yes I could work on my communication and she can as well because a lot of the messages she sends me are cryptic. He end up calling her and shaming her for saying what she said he told her she was a bigot. We lasted two more weeks I should have broken up when she sent that text but I was a dumbass and thought I could move past it.

The next two weeks were just downhill. One day we were sitting in the union and she wants to know how much money I have in my bank account and I tell her I don’t think that’s your business and she says “don’t make me yell at you I need to know.” So I caved and told her I didn’t have much and she said ugh my sister has more money than you. The Sunday before we break up I really try an attempt to communicate with her and she gets mad at me for texting her while she’s at work and tries to make me feel bad about it. My best friend sees an upset look on my face and asks me what has she said to you? I told her she’s mad because I texted while she’s at work. Unknowingly after I told him that he send a really long text to her i don’t remember what but I do remember the text saying “stop acting like an asshole to him” and when she rolls me about the text that is the only sentence she got out of it. The next day she breaks up with me and I’m feeling the same way about it. During the process of the breakup she tries to turn my friend against me unsuccessfully and later that day she tells me she just wants to be friends and I agree to it. At the end of the semester I told her I didn’t want to be friends and I blocked her on everything. Throughout the rest of that year I was depressed and afraid to get into relationships. Fast forward to now 2021 I am trying to work on myself and lose 90 pounds 255 to 165. I didn’t weigh 255 back then and now in 2021 I just feel gross, unattractive, and just plain afraid to get into another relationship.

You select you are available to do whatever in the next hour and then you either find someone to do things with or it just removes you after 1 hour.

The app shows who is available NEAR YOU to hangout within the next hour and if they match with you, you can chat and figure out the details of the meetup

Unless you go on the app and GO LIVE on the app, the app does not show your profile to anyone.

Is this a good idea?

There's this girl I went on casual date with. My intention was to just go out for coffee or ice cream. Since it was the first time we were going to spend time together since the first time we met when we conversed. I was working security at a bar for a weekend and she stirred up the Convo. 

We met up once, and it wound up sleeping together. (Not my intention, I fully went in prepared for coffee or ice cream and to actually get to know her) I found this woman very attractive so I really wanted to try things organically. 

Shortly after we texted for a bit. Then she stopped showing interest. 

I went about doing my own thing for a while, and then the other day I thought of her so I decided to reach out. 

She stated that ""she thought I was cool at first, but then it seemed like I was self centered"" personally I'm not going to sit here and argue whether I am or I'm not because I think that's up to everybody else to decide based on knowing me. 

I then told her: ""OMG, I had no idea you felt that way. I'm am embarrassed I gave off that impression. I would love the opportunity to see you again and we could discuss at length and maybe get to know each other better.""

Now at this point, she was actually responding to me which was more than she was in a long time. 

But then I guaged that maybe she'd made up her mind. So i went on to say. 

""I totally understand if you've made up your mind on the situation and you don't want to see me anymore. I will make my self scacrc on social media as well to alleviate the process"" 

To which she responds: what does social media have to do with it

---- now. A little back ground
The entire time I've known her, even when she got distant, she has been actively viewing all of my post stories and profile. 

What is the point? 

If she doesn't want to be involved with me anymore, and it doesn't seem like she necessarily wants to be at least friends or acquaintances. Why maintain the Social media connection. 

Generally if I can tell that the person and I are not going to converse or interchange ideas permanently, I usually just remove and unfollow. I just like my connections to be organically transparent. I see it as meaningless empty fodder if the person is connected to me but we don't ever talk update or catch up. 

Now I am aware that I have total autonomy here and I can remove unfollow and block her easily. But if I'm being honest I wanted to explore whether there's any chance of redemption in the situation.

Because if there isn't, then I know that it's hopeless, I can get rid of the fodder, and never look back. 

I'm curious as to what her frame of mind for wanting to stay engaged on social media and watch my activity but not wanting to pursue any kind of relation with me?
