2,n9hj18,1620684509,Tinder is useless for ages 20-25,It's either women promoting their Instagram and snapchats to get more followers or a bunch of dead accounts. You get the occasional like maybe once a day that is either a bot or someone ugly trying to find someone. I hate to say ugly but that's what it is. I have better chances hitting up a bar or club.

4,n9hx6m,1620685582,Perceived fears resulting in missed opportunities,"I (28M) don't know how to explain what I'm feeling but when trying to meet people or come out of my shell especially around women.  When I say this I mean talking to women I don't know in public.  Small talk, hookups, etc are all incredibly difficult for me because I am utterly petrified as coming off like a desperate creep.  I'm incredibly self-conscious of how women I don't know feel around me. When women make extra space when walking by or when they cross the street very suddenly (rather than wait at a crosswalk or something) I always wonder if I did something that made them feel uncomfortable or if I creeped them out in some way.  I know I'm not the most attractive guy, but (I don't think, but dating apps have me second-guessing) I'm ugly either.  I'm just plain and average-looking most of the time. Due to this fear, I try to make myself as non-threatening as I can.  I try not to look at women in public, I try not to talk to women I don't know in public, I try to take up as little physical space as possible and try to appear as non-threatening as I can.  I have missed opportunities to talk with who I think would be interesting people.  I'm currently a Physics Graduate Student at a university and while waiting for my covid test I saw this girl with a very detailed homemade astronomy backpack and a T-shirt with stuff about general relativity on it and I was super interested to talk to her because I'm an Amature Astronomer and I love looking at the night sky, but I couldn't because I was worried about making her feel uncomfortable.  I have seen her 3 separate times and I'm kicking myself because I know I missed a huge opportunity to talk about an uncommon shared interest.    


This is not an aversion to talking to women either because when talking to my friends who are women, I have no such issues. This is purely when it comes to talking with women I don't know in public.  I come from a family where my twin sister and mother are very strong and outspoken women and I'm very sensitive to complaints women have about men.  I'm hyper-aware of how often women fear for their own lives or get creeped out by men walking up to them. I'm hyper-aware of how unsafe women sometimes feel around men and they do these things for their own safety because they feel that they can't trust men sometimes because too many men (which is a minority but not an insignificant minority) act like creeps toward women.  I vastly prefer when women ask me out rather than the other way around because it removes so much stress from me but that rarely happens because once again I'm a very plain-looking guy and two culturally it is the expectation for men to be the ones to make the first move.  However, this constant fear just paralyzes me from making the first move.   


I thought I would try dating apps to see if that would help, but again being a very plain guy I don't take very many photos of myself and I'm not that attractive. I have a few good photos and I posted the few good ones I had but they can't compare to some of the photos I find on dating sites.  I occasionally get matches but online dating has really started to hurt my self-confidence.  I know that online dating is really just an attractive game but it still hurts.   


Covid has really made this worse because I don't get the opportunity to talk in groups of people like I would normally to meet people.  This is made doubly worse because I also moved cross country during covid so I don't have a circle of friends where I live right now. That is what really helped me find dates in the past.  I don't have problems getting dates once people get to know me because I know I am a very interesting person to talk to.  I have a lot of really varied interests and I can usually hold conversations for hours with someone about any number of topics, even ones I'm not familiar with due to my curiosity and willingness to ask lots of questions.  


What should I do? Advice from women would be especially appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9hx6m/perceived_fears_resulting_in_missed_opportunities/
5,n9hxjw,1620685608,Did we both mutually ghost each other or is this a clear rejection? A girl needs insight!,"Matched with this guy on tinder while in a different city for work. We texted for two months, shared a mutual interest in art so we’d always exchange our work. He really enjoyed my feedback and would always tell me how impressed he is with what I create and the amount of things that I do. He would never talk about himself or reveal anything sensitive— I didn’t think this was a big deal because I am quite closed off myself. Whatever. I planned on returning to his city (I fly there for work pretty frequently and also have friends and family who live there) fairly soon so I figured we could save all the personal stuff for then. 

I would text him mostly towards the end of the week. This kind of became a routine. On occasion he would text me, but I definitely did most of the legwork. I remember there being two instances where he was like, “I have nothing of interest to share, just wanted to reach out and say what’s up.” I saw this as a positive sign. He had 0 reason to text me and he still did. Our conversations were always very surface level, we’d mostly just talk about how our weeks went.

Our last conversation was probably the best one we ever had. I sent him something I made, he asked about how my night was going, and the conversation took off from there. We went back and forth for a good 3 hours and at the end of the night he reiterated how impressed and proud he is of me and wished me a good rest of my weekend.

Since then, nothing. It’s been 10 days. Nothing from me and nothing from him. I guess in my defence I was trying to see if he would reach out.  I texted him last time and before then it was him who initiated. I keep thinking, surely if this guy was interested he would reach out, right? Then at the same time it’s like, I’m interested in him and I’m not doing anything about it.

Is this guy waiting for me to contact him, and if so, should I contact him? Does he assume that because I haven’t contacted him, I must be busy? Is my silence keeping him from initiating?

I’ve never been ghosted/faded on before lmao someone please help me navigate through all of this!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9hxjw/did_we_both_mutually_ghost_each_other_or_is_this/
6,n9i245,1620685971,Why would he want to look for someone else?,"To start I already realize that this is selfish and irrational. I would appreciate some feedback. 

So I (19f) am talking with this guy (22m) and we have an amazing connection. Currently we are fwb but it’s not like sex and not talk, we have sex and cuddle and admire each other. He’ll hold me in my arms and tell me how cute I am, give me lots of kisses, and hold me close. We talked about where we stand after the first night we hooked up. I wanted an exclusive fwb situation but he doesn’t want to commit to that and be able to meet other people when he is actually ready to be in a relationship when he gets to the spot he wants to in life. 

He told me he would definitely date me and it’s not going to take it completely off the table and that the person he wants to be with could easily be me. but again he is working to improve himself so he doesn’t want to commit. The sex we have is amazing and we both expressed it’s the best we’ve ever have, him even saying it’s addicting.

My question is why would he want to continue looking for potential partners for the future when he clearly likes me as a person and really enjoys sex with me. He makes his love for my personality and character well know and compliments it all of the time. I am a unique individual and honestly believe that there aren’t many girls out there that would be as goofy as me and have my little quirks. Essentially I am one of a kind and he will not find anyone else like me. 

He didn’t just start meeting new people by talking to me, he has been doing so, so he’s been around a bit. He told me that he is so so so happy that we met and that he really wants me in his life one way or another. 

My problem is I can’t stand the thought of him treating someone else like he does with me and giving them such an intense amount of affection and having sex with them (again why would he when out of 12 people I’m the hottest and the best?). 

I realize all of this is his choice and his right, I just personally and sitting here letting it eat me alive. 

He told me he would tell me if he does start to talk to other girls and I’m afraid that when that time comes I’m going to lose my shit. 

I will also add that I have Borderline Personality Disorder which highly ontibites to my feelings about this. I just need rational people on here that aren’t me to help understand.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9i245/why_would_he_want_to_look_for_someone_else/

9,n9ie3y,1620686900,Is my only option to just get more attractive?,"I see posts on r/tinder and think ""Wow, I wish I could get away with saying something like that"". But those situations can only really happen when there's initial physical attraction anyway. I'm not attractive. At least not in a traditional sense. I like to think that I'm very open-minded, honest and down to earth, but it's so hard to get a chance to show off my personality when the swipes have already gone left cause I don't look appealing. I get about 1 match across all four dating apps I use a week, and every single one of them either ends with them ghosting/deleting me. It's not like I'm being forward and pushing anyone away, I generally like to start off a conversation about something I notice on their profile. It just seems as if it doesn't really matter what I say, it always end up the same way. Is there something else I should be doing?

I really wish dating in reality was an option, but I'm far too awkward to make moves on people in person, even without a global pandemic that has locked me to my room 24/7. I want to feel like I'm a viable human being but it seems like my value as a person is dependant on how good I look. I know I'm wrong, but why does it feel like I'm right? I just want the chance to prove to someone that I am worth a try, and I can make them happy, even if their first thought was never ""Wow, I want to fuck them"".

I dunno. I guess I'm just venting. I don't really know how to bring any of this up to my friends, cause I know what their response would be.

We have probably spent time in person together on about 10 different occasions and we text almost every day. We pretty much always make out and cuddle and talk for hours and hours barely even sleeping. We have had sex once but we were both drunk and it wasn’t that great to be honest. She told me she had never orgasmed with a partner and she has insecurities about her body. The odd thing is her past is riddled with casual sex and she has had many partners whereas I have only had sex within two  longterm relationships. It seems to me that she is quite promiscuous when alcohol is involved especially. Two dates ago she told me she thinks her antidepressant give her a low libido and paired with her insecurities she doesn’t want sex often. Now on our last date she said I’m not her usual type as her usual type is someone who is an artist of some sort, edgy, passionate etc. and she finds sexual chemistry through that. So basically now she’s questioning if she has any sexual attraction to me at all because I tried to initiate it the morning after our last sleep over and she said she wasn’t into it. She stated  that she loves spending time with me she is attracted to me she enjoys cuddling and kissing me but doesn’t feel an urge to be sexual with me. Right now I’m in a pandemic lockdown anyways so options are slim and I enjoy spending time with her anyways. She is often all over me kissing my neck, heavy make out sessions even gave me oral once but now she comes out questioning her sexual attraction towards me. I understand there’s a lot of aspects going into this... I’m not willing to be in a sexless relationship but I’m enjoying it for what it is right now although I would want to have sex of course. I’m wondering if this sexual attraction could grow with time, if it’s likely that it’s her meds killing her libido, if that’s something she was just pondering that she said in the moment or if I’m 100% making my way into friend zone.

25,n9kqdk,1620693841,Learning Them Hard Way...But It Was Worth It.,"I have decided to get this off of my chest in the hopes of finding some relief from these haunting memories. This person will forever stain any recollection I have of my old high school. Sometimes it feels so hard to believe this even happened to me, as it feels like something one can easily find on the pages of a corny romance novel. I swear whenever I think of this I can not help but find humor in how much it all seems to feel like a plot of some dumb chick flick. Anyways, here we go.

August 2017.

I had just returned to school following a rather enjoyable summer gone south, as less than a month prior my Nana died. It was rough as we were very close. I was employed at the local pizza place and was working less than part time. In other words I was still very much a teenager. I will not obsess over every detail as doing so will consume a lot of time and turn this simple Reddit post into a novel, which can easily be done as I love to write. Anyways I met this girl when during orientation of my Sophomore year. I did not directly introduce myself to her but we caught eachothers eyes during this interaction. Shortly after this I began to notice her shyly greeting me and blushing when we saw eachother. I did not entertain the possibility of her liking me, as she was H O T. I am talking absolutely gorgeous here. If you have ever seen Pulp Fiction, she looked a lot like that latina cab driver portrayed by Angela Jones. Like model material. Needless to say I felt she was out of my leauge, although girls have liked me before and asked me out, I often remained single due to some issues I had. She would often stare at me and shyly greet me as though she had a crush on me. I did not think it was possible, as my self esteem was shit. This continued throughout the year until the beggining of my junior year.

We ended up in the same class that year. At that time I was studying a certain language  and was well learned in it. I was deeply devoted to eventually becoming fluent in this language. I would often speak said language around my classmates, as I knew they wouldn't understand me, considering that this language was rarely spoken in my city. Anyways this girl approaches me and asks me what I said. I tell her and she suggests that I teach her. Great, now we have an excuse to talk. I though she genuinely wanted to be study partners and was excited that I had someone else to study this rare but beautiful language with. From then on she would flirt with me more, tease me more, and just talk with me more. One time we met eyes as I was walking down the hall and she smiled, looked down and blushed, It was then I was considering the posibility of her liking me.  For the longest time I suspected she wanted to be good friends, and was genuinely interested in being study partners. The flirting continued on her end and then one day right before Thanksgiving Break she asks me to hold her bag whilst she goes somewhere. Right before she leaves she tells  me "" u/whenthesunbleeds I want to let you know that I like you too. "" Then she ran off without giving me a chance to respond as if she feared what I would say next. 

Later that day, in the final period for the day she tells me clearly that she likes me, and that she has had a crush on me. Hearing this made me happy and estatic, but at the same time nervous. This beautiful girl has a crush on me but I have no way of being a good BF for her. Just for some context, I was quite depressed at that time, considering that I was mourning the death of a fiend and that I was having some issues at work. I was definitely not in a place to date or be with anyone, and in some way, Ii still am not today. ( I am a recovering addict)  She then began to put her hands on my shoulkders and caress them. It felt amazing. I was already falling in love with her at this moment, more so than any other girl. I wish I could say that I accepted her invitation to love her. I wish I could say that I kissed her. I wish I could say that we are together today. But no, I freed myself from her embrace and left the class without saying a word. I know I must have looked like a huge jerk, but I didn't know what else to do. I did like her..But I knew that allowing her into my life during this ugly time eouldnt end well. She deserves someone who isnt burdened with so many issues. She continued to greet me warmly on the rare days I did attend school, until one day I got kicked out for not going and completely lost my chance. I think about her a lot. I replay that day in my head a lot...But perhaps it was not meant to be. I still need to work on myself before I begin to share my life with others. Wherever she is and whoever she is with I hope she is happy.  I wish I can forget about her and move on, but alas it is never that easy is it?

I went on a few dates with a successful woman who's the exact opposite of me.

I would dance around every question she asked about my living / job situation. Or I would stretch the truth making my job sound better than what it was. On the first date, I essentially dodged questions and painted a picture of something I'm not.

All it did was create a huge amount of anxiety for me going into the other couple of dates we had. Me being nervous made her nervous. It was just a disaster until she broke it off via text message.

The ironic thing was: If I would have just told her the truth when she asked on the first date, she wouldn't have even gave a fuck probably. And me being honest would have made me look credible and trustworthy. Me being honest and owning my shit would have gave her the confidence to open up about hers.

43,n9m6aw,1620698330,Do you feel rejection from a job interview is easier or more difficult to handle than romantic rejection?,"What's your opinion on rejection in trying to find a job compared to trying to find a partner? Which one is easier to deal with?

When looking for a job, you look for job listings and send in your resume. Many places won't contact you. Some places might call you in for an interview but will reject you after the interview. Some places might give you a second or third round of interviews only to reject you. A smaller number of places might give you a trial period. Some places might give you the job after that.

In some instances, you might get offered the job after the first interview.

At every level of the selection process, you think to yourself that there might be a chance you could get the job or not. It's not too dissimilar with dating where you have to convince the person to go on a date with you. Some might not want to see you after the first date, some might go on a few dates with you only to not want to see you anymore. At any of these stages you might picture a possible future with this person, only to get rejected.

The major difference I see is that when looking for a job, many might already be employed, just in a job they aren't completely happy with, so they're looking for something better. So if you get rejected in this circumstance, you still have a job to go back to, albeit one you're not fully satisfied with. However, it's still a job that can help pay the bills. With looking for a partner, most people are single so if they get rejected, you go back to being single. There's usually no stop gap in the meantime before you can find your true partner.

Another thing I feel is that romantic rejection is a rejection of your entire being. A job rejection might be simply you don't have the skills required for that job, so it doesn't feel as personal because it might just be one aspect of your person. Or they might have found a better candidate. With dating that's the same, but for some reason knowing or even thinking that they're met another person they like more than you can be heart shattering. It's a hit to the ego more than a job rejection I feel. 

When you get romantically rejected, it just feels more personal. You might really like a job because it pays well, is close to home, for a company you really want to be part of. But with romantic rejection, it seems like they're rejecting you as a person on every level. It's not as bad if you ask a stranger out and they're only judging you on your appearance and a very brief and quick interaction, but if they've gone out with you a few times and reject you, it feels like they've seen what you're about and thought to themselves that they don't want to have anything to do with you. And that stings. The pain from which can affect your mental health for a while.

47,n9mkeu,1620699578,Should you bring up abstinence in a first date? My broken engagement after refusing sex for too long...,"(Please bear with me my first language is not English!)

I (24F) started dating when I was 22. When I started dating I met this guy (30M) and we started dating, ended up engaged and then broke up horribly... he was the first guy I've ever dated and this scarred me pretty bad.

One of our greatest issues was me ABSTAINING from sex till marriage, while he wanted us to be sexually active since the first month of us dating. I was totally against that and wanted us to learn more about each other and such. He kept on opening the subject of sex every now and then, and every time I would till him now is not the right time.

He proposed to me and we even started looking for a place together and worked on the interior design of the apartment we were considering.

I asked him one time if he was upset that we still haven't had sex although we've been together for a year and he replied ""I would be upset of we haven't had sex in a month over the relationship"".

One day we were having a date and suddenly he burst out and kept shouting at me for that he ""can't take it anymore"" and ""I should've done what crazy guys do"", implying forced sex. After this I told him I no longer want any problems and he could have sex if that's destroying our relationship. He ended up turning cold on me and would stop initiating conversations with me, refuse to have dates and such, although I said he could do what ever he want.

After several months I could not take it and ended up asking to break our engagement, which is what happened.

It's not that I've no sexual desires at all, it's that I've always been scared of the idea of sex, I was sexually harnessed by a family member when I was 10 ( which I shared with him), but I also wanted to share my first time with my husband... and him always opening the subject over and over made me uncomfortable, but when he proposed to me I thought he would understand...

I'm now open to dating and I'm scared of having to experience the same thing again.

50,n9ncjs,1620702186,"I fear talking to Women, Looking for advice","I (28M) know the title is hyperbolic but I fear talking to women I don't know in public. Small talk, hookups, etc are all incredibly difficult for me because I am utterly petrified as coming off like a desperate creep. I'm incredibly self-conscious of how women I don't know feel around me. When women make extra space when walking by when I see women constantly looking when I'm walking behind them to campus, or when they cross the street very suddenly I always wonder if I did something that made them feel uncomfortable or if I creeped them out in some way. I know I'm not the most attractive guy, but I'm not ugly either. I'm just plain and average-looking.  I try to make myself as non-threatening as I can. I try not to look at women in public, I try not to talk to women I don't know in public, I try to take up as little physical space as possible and try to appear as non-threatening as I can. Today I missed an opportunity to talk with who I think would be an interesting woman. I'm currently a Physics Graduate Student at a university and while waiting for my covid test I a woman with a very detailed homemade astronomy backpack and a T-shirt with stuff about general relativity on it and I was super interested to talk to her because I'm an Amature Astronomer and I love looking at the night sky, but I couldn't because I was worried about making her feel uncomfortable. I have seen her 3 separate times on campus (the backpack was a giveaway each time) and I'm kicking myself because I know I missed a huge opportunity to talk about a shared interest.

This is not an aversion to talking to women either because when talking to my friends who are women, I have no such issues. This is purely when it comes to talking with women I don't know in public. I come from a family where my twin sister and mother are very strong and outspoken women and I'm very sensitive to complaints women have about men. I'm hyper-aware of how often women fear for their own lives or get creeped out by men walking up to them. I'm hyper-aware of how unsafe women sometimes feel around men and they do these things for their own safety because they feel that they can't trust men sometimes because too many men act like creeps toward women. I vastly prefer when women ask me out rather than the other way around because it removes so much stress from me but that rarely happens because once again I'm a very plain-looking guy and two culturally it is the expectation for men to be the ones to make the first move. However, this constant fear just paralyzes me from making the first move.

I normally don't have too much at get-togethers with groups of friends such as BBQs or other social gatherings where everyone is friends with someone because people are looking to socialize and once people get to know me and start talking to me I don't have any problems finding dates or asking people out.  I know I'm an interesting person and I can hold long, witty, and interesting conversations with others on a wide variety of topics. However because I'm attending Graduate school, my friend circle has reduced to Zero and Covid hasn't helped either.  I have tried online dating and I have gotten a few matches here and there but like many guys on here, being average looking means that online dating results in failure.  The one match I had that had resulted in a virtual meet-up has not really borne any fruit and though I think we will be good friends I really didn't feel anything click.  I've lost a lot of my confidence due to the online dating scene especially if it takes over a month of work to get a single meet-up that may or may not result in anything.

So we picked a place and a general time for when I got back, but no set date. His replies were fast (maximum a few hours) and all was well.

As soon as we made the plan though, he hasn’t messaged me much/his replies have been much slower (once a day or less). He messaged me something that reminded him of me but that’s it. I replied and his reply after seemed enthusiastic. I replied once more and he hasn’t messaged me back since (it wasn’t a question or anything that had to be replied to though).

We’re still a little over a week away from when I get back. I’m kind of new to this so I don’t understand if this means he’s losing interest?

60,n9nnit,1620703199,"do ""minority"" personality traits multiplicatively make it harder to find someone?","I know finding someone that you mesh with is more than just checking off a series of boxes, but it feels exponentially harder when you have several personality traits that land you in the minority relative to the general population in each of those aspects.  For example, I feel that the following are my ""minority"" traits:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Vegetarian.  Very little dairy.  Just nonfat Greek yogurt and a little cheese on pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Don't drink alcohol.  Or caffeine.  Rarely take over-the-counter medications.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Relatively high wage earner.  Not a corporate ladder climber, just got a good education and am good at what I do.  I don't live extravagantly - have an average size suburban home and two vehicles that are 10+ years old (and one is a bit of an econo-box gas-mileage-wise).  I have a pile of second-chance paper towels and napkins that I keep for wiping stuff up.  I have an office-sized trash can in the kitchen so I can use plastic shopping bags in it instead of having to buy larger trash bags that I'm literally going to throw away.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Estranged from my parents.  I feel they failed in certain aspects as parents because of their own issues that has led to transgenerational trauma that has impacted my life in extremely negative ways.  The last straw was their betrayal by burying their heads in the sand and continuing to associate with someone else who they know has had direct negative impact on my life and that of my children, despite me directly telling them so.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Non-left, non-right political viewpoint.  Do what you want to do as long as it doesn't negatively impact anyone else.  You are responsible for your decisions and your life.  Don't expect anyone else to pay for your health care, your college, etc.  Don't have kids with someone and then cry to the government that you should get the lion's share of custody so that you can financially rape the other parent while the government holds them down.  Less government involvement in the lives of citizens (healthcare, abortion, guns, etc.)  The government should be there to make sure citizens' rights aren't violated, defend from other countries invading, maintain roads and infrastructure, and protect the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Extreme do-it-yourselfer.  In 16 years of owning my home, the only thing I've paid anyone to do was install a new heat pump and extend a drainage culvert (and the latter was only because they could do the whole thing cheaper than I could buy the pipe).  I've installed a wood stove and built a hearth for it, front walkway, flooring, a radon mitigation system (that I designed), attic stairs, attic vent fan, attic flooring, ceiling fans, major yard excavating including horseshoeing the driveway, fencing, patio, built a jungle gym.  I also do all my own vehicle and equipment repair / maintenance.  I design and fabricate things that don't exist or because I can do it cheaper / better.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Like animals, but don't see the point of pets.  I've had fish, lizards, mice, rats, birds, cats, and have lived with someone who had dogs.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I don't want to be an amateur zookeeper where I have to spend time and money on an animal.  I don't want to be tied down by an animal that I have to get home to feed, let out to go to the bathroom (or have my yard used as a bathroom), or pay someone to do those things when I go away.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Don't really have any friends.  I have a few guy buddies at work that are into similar stuff as me (cars, tinkering, guns), but we rarely hang out outside of work.  I just feel like everyone's too busy with their own families and their own lives and I don't want to be the loser single guy that's encroaching.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Not into watching/following sports.  I'd rather do something active myself.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Cynical / particular.  I have a lot of quirks about the way I do things and keep things in my house and other areas of life.  Tucking the front and back door curtains behind the door handle when I close them, ripping the four flaps off the tops of cereal and other food boxes once I open them, custom-made toothbrush holders that point the ends of the bristles down so they dry better, etc.  Wearing 30 dB noise-reducing ear muffs in my cubicle at work because some inconsiderate people think the whole common office space is their personal conference room where they can use their speakerphone for calls.

&amp;#x200B;

Do all these multiply together to create some ultra-minority where the likelihood of me finding someone compatible is some tiny fraction of a percent?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm 40 and it kinda feels like that in itself narrows down the field so much already.  It reminds me of that car-finding-website commercial where the guy is standing there in a sea of cars and as he says what he's looking for, cars start disappearing until he's left with his perfect car.  Only it's the reverse and you feel like all the people you would mesh with are already in committed relationships and the people on dating sites are not what you're looking for in some aspect or another.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't live in or near a major metropolitan area either, so there's another narrowing of the field.

&amp;#x200B;

65,n9o81f,1620705206,Feeling down," Just need a place to vent about the current girl I’m interested in.

So backstory: I (25 M) have been friends with this girl (23) for a while, and we met on a dating app but never actually went on an official date (we have hung out a lot as friends). I recently asked her on a date (made it clear by using the word date specifically). She said yes but we ended up hanging out at her house instead (her roommate was there, but we snuggled up on the couch together). We rescheduled the date for a day later in the week on a day that she had something else to do but thought she could make it anyway. However, she didn’t end up being available; to me, it felt like I got blown off by her. Still, I do think she is interested as I asked about rescheduling again, but she informed me that she will be out of town for a few weeks.

This is all technically fine yet it bothered me a little. She went out of town on vacation and I got curious because I hadn’t been on the dating app in a while and saw that she had updated her profile and set her location to her vacation spot on the dating app (it's one where you have to set your location). It’s within her right to do so as we’re not officially dating but still made me feel very unwanted and my heart sank a little. It does make me question how she sees me. Weirdly, she did add me on some social media platforms as well this week. Not sure where I stand, but it has me feeling a bit down.

Thanks for the read, feeling a bit better already just typing it out. Probably overreacting and there’s other fish in the sea. I just get stressed out after investing my time in someone. Any thoughts are appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9o81f/feeling_down/

I know people come and there's plenty of fish in the sea or whatever but you really will never knock it until you try it** 

For context, at the tail end of summer last year I moved home from college after graduating to my hometown, a medium sized city that's big enough to have new faces, but lots and lots of old faces as well.

Quite frankly, moving home was terrible, without the ability to go out, a stagnant job market, and none of my friends being around and the ones who are around I'm just not that close with, this has definitely been probably the loneliest times of my life, and I fell into a rut of being stuck.

I got COVID pretty badly in January, and decided to redownload a dating app just out of boredom in quarantine, and every other face was a person from high school I dread of being even seen with, until a particular girl came across who I matched with that I immediately thought was the cutest thing ever, and still do, dark black hair, she's tall but so am I, dark skin, freckles with a good song in her profile and a funny ass bio.

I don't really fall for girls ever, I'm a relatively stoic person, I had one serious crush in college beforehand, but that's about it. I told myself I'd hit her up once I'm out of quarantine, and had my shit together.

I got out of quarantine, I quit smoking cigarettes which was a bad habit I picked up from being home out of stress/boredom, started working out again, and started working part time just to save up money and get my own spot, with hopes of subletting somewhere for the summer and figure out something later on.

She never weighed that heavy on my head, but I always had her in the back of my head that she would be someone I'd love to get to know if I had the chance this summer, and once I had my shit together a bit, and was always a bit of a motivating factor in my attempt to get my life back on track a bit.

Three days ago, I checked if she was still around for the first time since we matched, and she was still on there, I dunno why but I didn't hit her up then, I really have made strides since I first initially matched with her and I had thought of something funny in my head to say, but just figured I had too much to do over the weekend and I'd get to it on Monday once I'm free because I didn't wanna text her initially then leave her in the dark.

Opened it up today with the intention of sending a text I plotted on for a few days and she was gone, either unmatched or deleted her account.

I feel like such an idiot, and realize I am, all this time I was trying to fix myself for the better because I thought I couldn't actually be good enough for something that I was interested in for once but in reality I probably was just fine. I have this hole in my stomach like I just got shot with a double barreled.

I realize, it probably doesn't mean shit, there's always the next one, you didn't even talk to her, and you don't even know if you two would've connected. But I learned lesson the hard way that apathy does you no good if you really feel something, I think it came down to being nervous I wasn't good enough and lack of self confidence, now I'm left with a feeling of deep loneliness that's rid me for a minute since everything went to shit a year ago.

Her IG got recommended to me a few months ago and I didn't follow because I didn't wanna be weird, and I still don't wanna be weird and I probably won't follow but part of me wishes I just DM'ed her in the first place.

How do I continue to move forword, but not remind myself of these not-so-fond memories *to let go, but not forget?* I feel like I’m holding myself back.

He is absolutely sweet and funny and smart and fun and he has given me every reassurance (verbally and symbolically) that he’s very into me. He is a bad texter bc he uses his phone for work to connect with clients and travels all day for work 7 days a week but always makes time to check in at least 1-2x per day. 

He’s met almost all of my friends, attended a work dinner as my date, and recently invited me to a get together w his friends and his sister who he’s very close with. She even told me how much he likes me. 

I feel so good about him and we had the exclusivity talk about a month in, but we still have not had the DTR talk. Other people in passing have referred to me as his gf and he didn’t flinch but we just never directly talked about it.

Should I bring it up or is it still too soon? I would be shocked if he reacted negatively, he’s given every indication he’s very into me but my past experiences with avoidant attached men have left me scarred. 

He seems securely attached, we even talked about attachment and he’s used the word “relationship” to describe us twice now. He also had a gf for 3 years but it ended bc she cheated with a coworker so even though he’s young he doesn’t seem afraid of commitment.

Part of me wonders if he thinks we are already official bc we’re exclusive and he’s referred to our “relationship”? I’m relatively new to dating as I as in a LTR and living with my ex a year ago so I’m genuinely confused.

I know this guy is still in love with me because he is always saying how much I mean to him. He’s mentioned to me how insecure he is about dating and how’s he’s “found the one”. But I don’t feel the same way. 

I still like this guy but just not in a romantic relationship way anymore. 

He’s a great guy and he’s done nothing wrong. But I just don’t see it going further. We have different ideas of life for example he’s said he wants kids, I’m not so sure I do. He dislikes the outdoors, and I love it. He isn’t driven by personal or professional goals and I feel like I need to be with someone who is driven with personal or professional goals, as I personally have them. 

We are just different people. Like I said great great guy! But I just feel like we are different. 

I don’t want to crush his heart and make him feel like I was using him for the pandemic, or make him feel like the love was never real because it was, it’s just not there anymore.

And I don’t want to put it off because I don’t want to drag him on.

1. Corny to send a pic of you holding a flower?

There is sending a handwritten card but it will probably not get there on the right day (birthday, valentine's day?)

2. What might be some good options? 

3. Could send a picture of a handwritten letter and my hand, I guess, too corny?

She gave me a really positive reply, telling me how much she appreciated the support and how often she gets overlooked for being a “psych” nurse. I told her I thought she was cute and I’d like to get to know her, so I sent her my number and told her to text me it she was interested. I didn’t get a text so I figured she wasn’t interested. But she still requested to follow me back and has watched everyone of my stories for the past two weeks. She follows a lot of people so unless she spends every day watching thousands of people’s stories I’d say this is weird behavior.

84,n9q7q2,1620712984,An old Ex,"Not sure if this belongs here or the flair, I guess ""need advice"" is appropriate but I already know what the right thing to do is, it's just hard as hell. 

Dated a girl in high school, well, ""dated"" is a strong word, we went to formal together and hung out a few times. We were technically a thing, but it was pretty clear it wasn't going anywhere, she had overbearing (slightly racist) parents that hated me for existing and she had extremely high aspirations and the raw intellect to match so I can see why dating wasn't exactly super important to her.
All the same, everything she did made me feel happy, I swear her smile could light up a city, her empathy, intelligence, talent for everything left me in awe. And I truly felt something for her that I couldn't describe, I'd been in high school relationships before but I was still discovering myself. So what I felt for her was really hard to comprehend. 
Then one day she ended it, said she couldn't talk to me any more and that she couldn't really explain. I tried to figure it out, but respect her wishes and just let it go without an answer. (honestly the hardest thing I've ever done) and just like that, it was over...

It's definitely had an impact on me in a few other relationships, but it's still the only one I can look back on with any semblance of happiness. The problem is that happiness comes with a real uncomfortable longing, especially after coming out of a few really rocky relationships. 

Not knowing why it ended or having any real closure made it hard to move on, but now (6 years later) we've started talking again, she's made it pretty clear we're just talking and hanging out as friends, and as much as I want to respect her and just move on, she's a great friend and the last thing I want to do is impose in her life, but I can't help but want something more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9q7q2/an_old_ex/

Like I’m dry af over text. I never know what to say, or how to say it. And when I do have something witty or funny to say I usually never end up saying it because I feel like my humor is something that has to be experienced in person to be understood. I usually end up being left on read, or I usually have to end conversation just for my own sake because it gets to the point were it’s literal cringe. In a face to face scenario though, I’m confident, funny af or so I’ve been told by many people, a bit on the goofy side, very straight forward, and I usually don’t have to think about what to say, I just say it and it usually always works. I can usually have a womans’ number or Snapchat in 10 minutes. But it usually goes south from that point. I set up dates within an hour or so depending on where I met the person/how the vibes felt or if it was on a dating app. I usually try to chat for a day or so just so they can warm up to me but it usually just ends up to me losing interest from the person I was talking to due to the fact that my texting skills are lacking in many areas. What’s some tips? What’re things y’all do while texting or snapchatting to keep a conversation light and funny or flirty? Keep in mind I’m very technologically inclined but I absolutely despise cellphones and what they’ve created in this world. I also can’t STAND Snapchat yet I’m basically forced to use it due to the fact that it’s the “new way” of staying in touch. Let’s put it this way, if I’m at a live event or on vacation I never have my phone out because I’d rather experience what’s going on with my own eyes, not looking at a live event through a phone screen while I record. I have a handful of pics of all the different states I’ve visited and usually have to ask my friends to forward me pics of all the places we’ve visited. I had dinner tonight with a few friends and everyone was glued to their phone while I sat with my arms crossed staring out a window because everyone is so obsessed now a days with social media and what the kardashians are doing.

88,n9qmnm,1620714810,Playing the pitch against a home run,"At the start of this year I was seeing a Girl who I met from tinder. We had a connection within the first couple of weeks but it was clear to me she was playing the pitch, while I was looking for a home run (I wasn’t even speaking to someone else, let alone meeting up with other girls and sleeping with them) so I left her...

I came back to her after 3 weeks and when I confronted the topic she admitted to me she was sleeping with someone else. Yes, I understand this is something out of my control and it would be ignorant of me to act like she did something wrong. I left, she slept with someone else out of her own choice (she isn’t contracted to just me and only me specially as we only knew eachother for a short period of time). 

We carried on dating as I didn’t care about the fact she slept with someone else after a short period of time because if she truly liked me that shouldn’t be a problem.

Later down the line I asked her who he was, I’m a clean cut guy so if a girl asks me about my body count or names for a general conversation I’m going to keep it real regardless of their reaction. 

She told me it was someone I wouldn’t know who lived far away, I replied “oh so just a one night stand with a random guy”

She replied “I wouldn’t call him just a random guy” 

Because she wouldn’t tell me his name and the response I got, I found it strange so I left...

I get everyone has a personal opinion and ever individual is different but was I wrong to leave?

I kept it real with her and all I asked was the same back, she called me toxic, threatening and manipulating but I left because I saw this as a red flag, any advice I would appreciate for my next future relationship",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9qmnm/playing_the_pitch_against_a_home_run/
