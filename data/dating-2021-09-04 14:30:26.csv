0,phy4xe,1630784258,Should I buy flowers for my recently rekindled FWB?,"A little before the whole covid thing erupted I was seeing a girl, we met up on a night out and began repeated seeing eachother, explicitly under the pretence that this was a freinds with benefits thing... That said there were some sweet moments we shared which suggested more was going on beneath the surface, she made me a nice breakfast one morning, and another time we enjoyed a nice date at the beach together.

I'm not sure what happened after that, I wasn't willing to commit to a relationship partly because I had some warped ideas on what I deserved/needed at the time and partly because I did not see her as a girl I would end up marrying, though I did enjoy our time together. 

I told her I had no intentions to enter a relationship up front when we went for a meal after the beach and beleive I saw hurt in her eyes. We went to her flat again afterward but we didn't see eachother after that. Over the lockdowns I would think about her sometimes and wonder if I had been hasty in my judgements...

Fast forward 18 months from the beach day and completely by chance I bump into her again, once again, we got talking again and things have led once again to our seeing eachother. This time around though I have changed my approach, I'm trying to take her out more and have suggested subtly that in the past I am somewhat regretful for my emotional nonchalance towards her.

I do not beleive in clean slates or 'picking up where we left off', because that is not possible. But I do feel I'd like to explore what I could have with her if I were less guarded with my own feelings now. The only thing that concerns me is that I am not crazy about her like I can be about other girls... it means I am more grounded in my emotions, which is a positive for me, but I wonder if I'm just moving this along because it's a preferable alternative to being lonely which has been an all too present reality for me this past year or so, winning her over again was very easy, like mind-bendingly easy, after many bungled failures in my dating life recently.

Anyway when she sees the sunflowers I've bought she's going to love it. I'm so looking forward to pulling off this gesture. I know she'll love the unexpectedly simple arrangement of sunflowers, and I'll enjoy the thrilling rush of having made a girl happy. I think it  will also show I have potential romantic intentions that extend beyond the sensual needs of the flesh. That said, I am feeling an undercurrent of guilt spouting from my original doubts about how much I want her, if my feelings are not in earnest, I may have to hurt her again at some point and the beautiful sunflowers may come to represent a lie, in truth I am not sure what I want from her yet but my point is I'm opening myself to possibilities I wasn't earlier. Should I wait that I'm certain I want a girl before making such a gesture? or am I just overthinking it all.

3,phyc3l,1630784948,Is dating in your early twenties worth it?,"(This is my first Reddit post EVER, so go easy on me please üòÖ)

I‚Äôm a 23M from the UK. The last date I went on was in the summer of 2019. So over 2 years now. Since then I‚Äôve been on and off the dating apps (Tinder, Bumble etc.) and haven‚Äôt had any luck. I‚Äôm not the best looking guy in the world but I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm not downright ugly either. I do get the odd match (maybe once a week) but it never goes anywhere (no reply, match doesn‚Äôt message me within 24 hours). 

Recently I‚Äôve moved into a flat with a friend for university and he‚Äôs got a girlfriend who‚Äôs over quite often. So I guess I‚Äôve become quite jealous of him. 

I‚Äôve tried listening to men‚Äôs podcasts and reading articles online for any sort of advice on dating at my age. Quite a lot of them say that dating in your early twenties is a waste of time and that you should focus on your personal health and education/career. 

I can understand that, but when literally everyone in your circle is dating or has a girlfriend it‚Äôs hard not to feel like you‚Äôre missing out. 

On the other hand I think a lot of people my age don‚Äôt really know what they want from relationships. I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm at an age where I‚Äôd want a serious long term relationship (not marriage but certainly a partner). 

I could go on more but I‚Äôll stop myself here.

So, is dating worth it in early twenties worth it? Or should I focus on myself? (Easier said than done)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phyc3l/is_dating_in_your_early_twenties_worth_it/

5,phycje,1630784991,"Dissappearing ""boyfriend"". What could it be and how to handle it?","I've been going out with a guy for a couple of months. It's been great: we've had good dates, we've spent the night at each other's apartment, he cooks for me, I make him breakfast, etc.

Since before we met, he's been thinking about moving to another city, so I never really see him during the weekends because those days he travels to try to capture the ""spirit"" of that place before making a final decision.

Sometimes he doesn't go to another city but to his brother's house. The thing is he always comes with another plan for the weekends and he never shares what he does during that time. I decided not to ask anyway because, from my perspective, this is not a relationship yet.

Today, a Saturday, he texted that he had decided to travel again (without even having planned it beforehand during the week). It kind of bothered me, but I only answered ""have a nice time and enjoy yourself!"" with a wink. He replied with a sad emoji and I texted back that if he really likes that place that much, he should be happy to go there. Then he sent the zipper-lipped emoji and that was pretty much the end of the chat.

To be honest, I've felt jealous and uncertain about this situation, but at the same time, maybe I don't have any right to complain because we don't really have a relationship.

He's always very sweet with me. Today, he acted plain weird and like he doesn't even think of me as his third option when it comes to planning what to do during the weekend. üëÄ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phycje/dissappearing_boyfriend_what_could_it_be_and_how/

9,phytvb,1630786677,Meeting an old crush / soul mate after 10 years,"I‚Äôm still a bit baffled right now that this happened and can‚Äôt really believe it at the moment. 

Ten years ago, I had a couple rough years in school. Skipped a lot of classes and was pretty depressed for some time. I repeated my last year and so got to know new people. Met a girl and we had crazy connection from the beginning. Just looking her in the eyes was so mesmerising and she seemed like a great person. Never met someone like her before or after. I still had issues I was going through at that time so I didn‚Äôt reciprocate any of her advances, just treated her respectfully even though I couldn‚Äôt believe someone like her even could exist. But she was persistent as hell and basically stalked me in a very enjoyable fashion for the whole school year. Even though I knew she liked me I never told her what I felt for her because I was just too scared of her rejecting me. This was all felt very movie-like back then. Seems pretty insane today, but that‚Äôs what low self esteem does to you. 

We didn‚Äôt keep in touch after that until last Thursday. After a couple of weeks of terrible nights of bad sleep on vacation and without work that kept me busy I had to think about her. Always felt bad that I didn‚Äôt say anything to her because she really helped me out a lot to get out the hole I was in back then. 

So I wrote her on Facebook and basically told her what she meant to me back then. I thought I might not even get a reply or just a generic one but she wrote me back she I made her day and that she was really happy about my message. 

I thanked her and wished her all the best. Since I wanted to close my FB account (which I just made to write her ) I told her that today and and that she used to be a sunshine for me back then and some other genuine nice things. Truthfully, I hoped a little bit that she would tell me she would like to meet me but I didn‚Äôt ask her and prepared to say goodbye to her for good and just give her honest compliments. (Btw, if you‚Äôre in the mood for a mental breakdown, present your feelings to someone on Facebook)

She then said that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to believe how much she needed those words at the moment and that she would print out everything I wrote her (I was already making screenshots of her replies :p). And then she invited me for a coffee in the city she lives now (a couple of hours away from me)!

I can‚Äôt fathom that I got that lucky twice and told her I would love to come visit her sometime. I‚Äôm super excited to meet see her again and finally get to know her. 

How should I approach this? This all just seems so stupidly unreal at the moment. Has anyone had a similar experience? 

I understand that I don‚Äôt really know her or that she might just go through bad times right now and need someone to lift her spirits but it‚Äôs just seems insane to let her go a second time.

16,phz7jx,1630787967,Broaching the topic of splitting date costs,"Just wondering how to broach the topic while still being seen as respectful and also being respected. I come from a culture where women expect men to pay for everything. 

Some girls I've dated have actually offered to split, or even to pay for the tab and those are the girls I like the most. Not because I don't have to pay as much, but because they come off as progressive women that aren't tied to outdated gender norms.

And then, there are other girls I've dated (including a girl that I'm seeing now) that kind of just agrees to stuff, but might find it hard to be decisive themselves (i.e., where to eat, who's paying for what, etc), they expect the man to make all of those decisions.

And then, finally, there are the girls that expect to be pampered and will judge you if otherwise.

And so, in a pie with three slices, where each slice is akin to the three types of girls described above, the odds are lower to get a girl that is willing to take charge and willing to bring out their wallets. Let's assume I can spot out and avoid the girls that like to get pampered. That still leaves me with the girls that aren't willing to make a move themselves. So, how can I go about suggesting that we split the costs of a date? 

I'll also like to point out that I am someone that is totally fine with footing the bill for the first date, considerate about our income/circumstances and whatnot. But I just don't believe in the idea of men having to pay for everything. It is not gender equal.

31,pi06l5,1630791292,Do I deserve to be loved?,"I've decided that I want to start dating again but I've now come to realize that I can't even picture myself in a loving relationship.

In past relationships when someone has tried to show me love, in my head I'm thinking ""lol stop pretending, you've already got me."" It's like I don't believe I could really be loved.

I've learned that this all comes from me feeling ignored by my family, not receiving consistent love from them and not feeling like they trully care about me. This has lead me to question if I really do deserve to be loved? I hadn't realized how much this feeling from my childhood effects my life as an adult now. I want to get over this and start believing that someone could actually want to be with me for me, and that I could be a priority to someone.

Have any of you felt this way before and how did you get over this? Any advice is appreciated! &lt;3

He is the ex-boyfriend of one of my former acting school classmates, who she spoke rapturously about at that time. She thought he was the most wonderful guy in the whole world, and they eventually broke up due to ""personal differences"" even though she still maintained that he was a great guy. Well, he saw me singing onstage during an acting school performance and reached out to let me know that he loved my voice and never ever forgot that performance. 

Since then, we have been exchanging flirty texts and finally he said that he wanted to drive to NYC to spend a weekend with me. We were going to spend the weekend cooking fancy meals together (he is a professional chef, and I used to be one) and hanging out at his favorite bath house in Brooklyn. I felt like this was the perfect opportunity to try to take my mind off this guy in my life who broke my heart last month, not that I ever said that out loud.

So he drove 8 hours down from Vermont and brought all this food with him. Then, less than a day later, he decides to drive back because ""he just wasn't feeling it."" He said we had nothing to talk about, which is thoroughly ridiculous seeing that he is an actor, singer and chef just like me. He was so repulsed by my company that he couldn't even bother to stay and eat the food that he brought, let alone the easy sex that he could have totally gotten that night. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward things that we both like, yet he made very little effort to engage with me.

Like I just don't have any interests in common with these guys and the attraction and click just isn't there, even though usually they want to go on a second date and I just don't feel the same way. 

I liked this one guy on Hinge about a week ago who I was immediately super into and it looked like we had a  niche interest in common and a similar educational and cultural background, but its been a week and we didn't match. After going on another bad Hinge date last night, I'd really just like to speed up this process and add the guy on instagram on the chance that he just doesn't check the app often as opposed to passing on me. Obviously if he doesn't accept my follow request I'll have my answer.

 I don't want to overstep any creepy boundaries so I just wanted to hear some thoughts on that. I know it's definitely bold and forward but a few years ago I met someone at a coffee shop and then found him on Facebook and messaged a week later which definitely might have been ""creepy"" by some people's standards but he was flattered and it ended up working out, so I tend to not shy away from boldness and am pretty confident.

(32M) Allow me a moment for some background. I've used PoF, OKC, and, more recently, Hinge and Bumble (although Hinge was a bust and I don't wish to get off topic). I've never had any success with these. I get matched maybe two or three times a year on OKC, but most of the hits on PoF prior to me deleting my account were bots/scams. Bumble, I get a little bit more attention, but perhaps even worse than on PoF, because at the very least, on PoF the bots and scammers responded in broken English and were good for a laugh.

OKC and Bumble I'll get matches, but frequently, they never say anything. Especially on Bumble. I've had perhaps a dozen matches in the six months or so I've used it at the recommendation of Redditors' comments on this sub, and not a single one, not one, has messaged me. Everyone knows by now, based on it's popularity, that women have to message first, right?

So after a quick Google search, I've come to the conclusion, or perhaps just confirmation bias, that these apps and sites bait you into staying there and continuing to use and pay for their services by creating fake profiles in order to give you the barest amount of attention, thereby keeping you subscribed based upon false hope. Does this theory, for which I have zero proof but anecdotal and my own experience, hold any weight?

It seems a little shady to me that all this 'activity' I receive when I'm offline suddenly vanishes when I login and purchase a week's worth of premium (out of curiosity and honestly a little hope to see who said yes to my page).

73,pi3ekg,1630803500,Advice on how to get over hookup??,"I didn‚Äôt want to make this too long but 

Hey guys, I lately have been overly obsessed with this guy that I hooked up with a few years ago. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm posting this in the right sub. I‚Äôm going to make this as short as possible. I don‚Äôt want to give out too much info as I‚Äôm not sure who might come across this post. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Hooked up with this guy almost 3 1/2 years ago. When I was like 18, he was 23 I believe. We use to flirt at work a lot &amp; were both really attracted to each other.. Not to toot my own horn, although I‚Äôve always gotten male attention, it hits different when you‚Äôre really attracted to the person giving it‚Ä¶ Anyway, we hooked up on 2 different occasions. We both really enjoyed it, he was always really sweet &amp; made me feel really beautiful..  The last time we hooked up I ended up blocking him afterwards because I just KNEW in my gut that he had a girlfriend‚Ä¶ he would text me at really weird hours &amp; a lot didn‚Äôt add up (found this out LAST year actually, He did indeed have a whole fianc√© &amp; a whole child)

That wasn‚Äôt the last time we spoke, though. 
I had got back with my ex in the meantime because he was improving a lot, but we had broke up again due to me finding out that he had done a little more cheating than I initially thought &amp; I just needed space.

I thought about the guy I had the hookup with &amp; I messaged him, he was still very much interested months later &amp; I did honestly kind of like him but I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship- but to him I guess it seemed like I was a little clingy. I think I scared him off though cause he never responded to me after I sent a certain message. 

I finally found out months later on why he stopped replying when he tried to hook up with this other girl that we worked with &amp; whom I was really close friends with, he told her although he think I was ‚Äúreally beautiful‚Äù he knows that some women can‚Äôt just handle hooking up. I know. He is obviously a douche. 

But for some reason years later I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm obsessed. Like I literally stalk his socials. I‚Äôm ashamed. Its gotten out of hand. I have been doing this since like 2019. It‚Äôs like I need closure. It‚Äôs like i don‚Äôt know why he couldnt tell me hisself instead of never responding to me. Even with me finding out that he had a girlfriend all that time it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm still desperate for
him to reach out to me for closure. I saw that he messaged me on fb literally months after it happened just saying ‚ÄúHey‚Äù but my page was locked before I could even respond. It‚Äôs like how can you say all those nice things to me &amp; the stuff he did to me that night is not something you do with someone that you have sex with for the first time. It‚Äôs like he made Love to me in a way. I know I‚Äôm so stupid. I replay it all in my head. The sex. How he was talking to me during the sex. The way he use to call me beautiful and sexy. üò© it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt heard it before but it‚Äôs just the fact that it was him. Like I was doing just fine with me having him blocked back then but I guess him basically rejecting me trigged me or something üò© Ugh I don‚Äôt want to think about him anymore.

We're both in pretty good health, my bf has stomach and knee problems. His family history has people living well into their 70s.

I have had the odd week long back and forward with a few but they ditched/ghosted me and when I asked for the reason why, I've had these responses so far (I've had some crazies who gave other feedback, without me asking for it, but it was them projecting so not worth mentioning):

* Me wanting children someday
* Being too smart (I'm smart but not THAT smart, if I was to guess my IQ I'd say around 120)
* Too young to have chosen to be living in that area (quiet Scottish town 30miles from the city)

I put a decent amount of effort into putting together my profiles, not really sure what the issue is or whether this amount of interaction is to be expected and I'm being impatient.

I've been on one date, she was pretty and smart but she didn't show any interest in me (while texting and on the date) so I didn't ask her out again as I thought it'd be a waste of time, I got the impression she was just after sex (she booked a hotel next to the place we went for dinner which really put me off during the date as I haven't had sex for a few years, I was nervous enough as it was!).

All my previous relationships started without any dating with the exception of one (which lasted the least), they started by just hanging out after meeting through work/friends and getting flirtier until they turned romantic.

I reckon I must be doing something wrong, I just can't put my finger on what it is. My social skills were never that great and with the lockdowns they've no doubt gotten worse. I've contemplated just lowering my standards and interacting with the matches I don't find attractive in order to practice but it would make me feel dishonest.

I moved here a few years ago with my ex and my friends live really far away so meeting new people though them isn't really an option. I spent most of my time inside the house, even pre-covid, so I've been pushing myself to go outside to read or walk everyday in the hope that I would stumble across someone interesting; either to get into a new friend circle or just meet someone directly but I'm extremely nervous just walking up to a woman to start a conversation so I've not approached anyone yet, in fact I've had a woman SPRINT away after looking over her shoulder and seeing me which really put a dent in my confidence, I was just leaving the beach and we happened to be on the same narrow path!

83,pi4gtn,1630807838,Is he interested in me after our first date ??,"Today I went on a date with someone I met on Bumble. I (19F) had been talking to him (21M) for about two weeks before we met up, when he asked to a week before. We both have a lot in common and share similar plans for our futures which really interested me. So we decided to meet up at a ramen restaraunt and go to a nearby bookstore afterwards. 

We met up at the restaurant, and everything seemed to be going pretty well between us. He did drive an hour and a half to meet me, oddly enough he lives in a town I used to live in, but once we sat down our conversations seemed to go well. I'm very shy in general but did try to open up with him during our dinner. We talked a bit about our favorite foods, animes, what he's doing in school and things we'd like to do. It was very friendly and kind of ""surface level"" talking if that makes sense, but I both think we enjoyed it. He was smiling a lot, and so was I, and seemed to avoid eye contact but we did make some occasionally. I don't know if there was any strong chemistry going on but I did feel a little at least, and am honestly really interested in him. He did pay for everything when I offered to go dutch. 

Afterwards we went to a bookstore nearby since we both like to read, and walked around checking out things a bit. But since we got there our conversations kinda became more awkward, not in an uncomfortable way, more so just not knowing what to say exactly. We'd each make comments about certain series we were looking at and joked around about some things but it was pretty surface level I guess. 

Once we were done we walked outside and he said he had a good time and would like to do it again, and I said I would too. He asked if he could hug me and we gave each other kind of a side hug (though I did use both my arms) and then we left. It all ended kinda faster than I expected but that's okay.  I haven't heard back from him since. 


Idk if it's just cause I'm pretty awkward in general with people, but im getting mixed feedback on whether this is all a good sign.

Then we had our second date recently- went to a comedy club (which I got the tickets for) and had a few drinks. I though it would have been appropriate that if I got the tickets she'd offer to pay for the drinks. If not the first round then at least the second round. 

Nope, nothing from her. She just kind of seemed to expect me to get everything for her. What I mean by this is when it comes time to pay she just stands back and looks at me making things extremely awkward in front of the waiter so I just pay.

92,pi5d9v,1630811544,I rejected a girl a few months back after she wanted to get back togerther,"Like the title says; a girl broke up with me a few months ago (only dated for a week) over such a ridiculous reason of me not wanting to dance with her and like two months later she calls and tells me she‚Äôs sorry, and still likes me. What really threw me off though was during this phone call she said she needs a job and has trouble paying for her apartment and asked if I can move in with her. I told her I‚Äôd think about it; when really I wouldn‚Äôt think about it and figured she‚Äôs just trying to take advantage of me which is her reason of bringing up her needing a job and money. About two weeks go by and I just randomly delete her from Facebook. I haven‚Äôt talked to her since. 

The reason for me being so cold to her was just because of how she broke up and ended any future dates. After the dance refusal situation she texts me a few hours later and tells me she‚Äôs looking for someone else with a different outlook on life and different qualities. This hurt me pretty bad and just got a little sad. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking whether I should have just given it a try and maybe moved in with her because it‚Äôs just nice being in a relationship. Did I do the right thing or should I have given her a second chance?

95,pi5mt4,1630812671,Did I perceive this as a rejection because of my insecurities?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pi5mt4/did_i_perceive_this_as_a_rejection_because_of_my/
96,pi5phz,1630812991,Why do you think there‚Äôs so much anger between men and women regarding dating nowadays?,"I‚Äôm only 20 but from what I‚Äôve seen old people say this is pretty new. 

So constantly on social media from mainstream ones to ones like Reddit, I always see just hate thrown between men and women when it comes to dating. I often see men talking about how they can‚Äôt get a date, how women pass up good men to get used and abused by jerks, and that women use guys that they know like them for emotional support while only actually being attracted to bad guys.

On the female side, I see women talking about how guys use and abuse them, emotionally manipulate and gaslight them, and how pretty genuine awful most guys are. I also see a lot of girls talking about how low the bar is for men so they really have to settle for assholes because theirs no other option.

I see both of these sentiments common in even people up to their late 20s so I know it‚Äôs not just my age group.

Turns out it didn't touch and if it did which it probably did. I did not notice it even a little bit. Why? Probably because after our first slow kiss it just went to straight making out. Apparently I'm a natural at that as well so let's fucking go. Anyways yeah, if you got a big nose don't feel scared about this kinda thing.
