1,nzd0lr,1623639674,"""Verified"" profiles on dating apps are definitely not full proof and easy to fake","My friends and I were hanging out and decided to take a crack into the flaws of how dating apps work this past weekend, and what we discovered is that verifying a profile to authenticate someone being real is absolutely easy to fake. One of my friends grabbed some pictures of an Instagram model for a fake profile he created on Bumble, and then proceeded to go through the verification process on it. He snapped a picture of himself doing the pose requested by the app, and within seconds, it verified the profile as being real. I'm not sure how these apps manage to carry out verifications, but our guess is that is as long as you do the pose and vaguely resemble the person in the picture (in this case, my friend had dark hair and facial hair like the guy in his pictures.)

This makes me wonder how many other fake verified profiles are out there, and what the exact requirements are in their process, because if it's just a matter of doing the pose and being a guy or a woman, that's a huge issue. If you're on a dating app and assuming a blue check mark makes it safe to assume the person on the other end is real, let this be your warning that it isn't always true.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzd0lr/verified_profiles_on_dating_apps_are_definitely/

I‚Äôve known him (M, 31) my whole life, and he‚Äôs been like a brother to me ‚Äî that is up until I started seeing him differently when I was in high school and had a huge crush on him ever since. Before my brother passed, I started to actually like him, and finally revealed my feelings to him after my brother‚Äôs funeral (not the best time emotionally). When I told him then, he said if we were to ever get together he would end up marrying me. Since then, we‚Äôve both been in long-term relationships, but still always had each other in mind (we‚Äôve talked about this). It was difficult to say the least. 
Fast forward to now, we‚Äôre actually able to be together, and our emotional and physical connection is something I‚Äôve never experienced before.

10,nzdvhi,1623642534,"Stop saying ""you deserve better""","My last two exes told me that I deserve better during/after breaking up. Both relationships were amazing in the beginning. Texting and spending time together frequently, cooking together, going on adventures, envisioning our futures intertwined with each other's, everything that couples do during the honeymoon stage. Unfortunately, things fizzled out slowly after moving too quickly. I am well aware of my tendency to choose people who I am not compatible with, but it was still heartbreaking to go through the breakups. I'm not going to say that it was my fault or their fault. My exes and I simply fell out of love. 

Ex 1 texted me a few weeks after I broke up with him, completely out of the blue. They apologized to me, saying that they wished things ended differently, hoped we could be friends, and that I deserve better. It really sucked hearing that because I realized how much I idealized the relationship and how they realized they couldn't fulfill my needs, no matter how much I wanted them to. It seemed like they were trying to escape blame and pose as the ""good guy."" I know they had good intentions and they really cared, but it still hurt to hear. 

Ex 2 told me I deserved better as we were breaking up. They realized that they were leading me on and didn't realize it until a few days before the breakup. It felt one-sided, and that made the breakup hurt more than the previous one. For days after, I couldn't find the motivation to get out of bed or eat or go to work. Then, I felt an intense anger after realizing that the only reason they were saying was because they didn't want to take accountability for the lies they told. They wanted me to think that they were doing me a favor by allowing me to find someone better. In retrospect, I'm glad that we broke up, but I still feel pangs of anger because they couldn't have handled that more poorly.

Is it safe to give her oral sex? And yes, I will use a condom if we have sex. She read that with sex, the pulp can go away naturally. Does anyone have any experience with this?

37,nzhtuw,1623658192,Need Advice on Flaky Girl,"I get drinks often at a coffee stand and took interest in a girl that works there. Never really planned to do anything cause I know its their job to be nice but people. Ending up messaging her on Instagram and everything flowed super well. Talked a lot, said she loved seeing me come into her work and agreed to go on a date. Even told me a time to come into her work to make me a drink she thought id like. Came into her work and talked for a while effortlessly and just felt super natural. Only left once another customer came and couldn't stay any longer. Today was when we had planned for a date and I texted this morning to confirm. She didn't reply till way later in the day and pretty much avoided the question and just said she had to work the next day. I replied just saying it was fine and that I'd let her give me a date she could go rather than me checking in every fucking day like a lost dog **(Didn't phrase it like that)**.

Guess I don't really know where to go from here. Normally at this point id just throw in the towel cause I've never liked chasing after girls that are like this. But for context I've went on quite a few dates that have technically went well. Like the date was planned to just be a short dinner and we'd end up talking for 5 hours. But on all of these I have just felt nothing towards the girl at all. With this newest one just the smallest convo crushes my stomach. So I don't really want to just abandon this :(

Went on a date with a woman from hinge, we called a few times before and decided to go to a science museum. It was great and the woman was nice but I can‚Äôt tell if she was interested in a second date or not. 

We didn‚Äôt kiss since we both had masks on for most of the time and I was in two minds to touch due to corona since I wasn‚Äôt sure of her position but she did talk and ask all the standard dating questions about family and what we do and randomly she asked my salary lol cos we were talking about life and careers and we did laugh a lot too. 

I did compliment her on her outfit and paid for a drink after. 

I‚Äôve sent a message after saying thanks for good time etc and asking when she‚Äôs free to go again? But not sure if I fucked up or not since I didn‚Äôt make a physical move

We hadn't seen each other for 2 years until I added Thursdays to my shifts. But now the times we do see each other are great. We get on so well with each other. We talk, we laugh, we joke around, we both give eye contact as we walk past each other and heads turned to each other while she walks past me. But we don't stay next to each other the entire 4 hours we see each other, because it's a workplace and don't want other co-workers clocking on that something it going on with me and her. But we do spend majority of time together only in work though. I have never seen her outside work.

I can tell she is interested in me because she always comes towards me when I am in a different part of the store. For example, I walk away from her for a bit to do something else and in a few minutes she comes back to me. In my workplace, all the managers are lenient so she tells the manager ""I'm going to chill with him (my name) for a bit"", and they don't care. So she actively wants to spend time with me. She also asked ""have I got a girlfriend?"". I read online that a girl asks that if they are interested. She also talks about her more private areas of her body to me, even though I'm not her boyfriend. 

I haven't asked for her number yet because I have only just started to see her again after 2 years apart.

When would the ideal time be to ask for her number? 

Where would I go with her if we do go out for the first time?

Would I just play it cool on the first date and no actual physical contact such as holding hands, kissing etc?

48,nzj31d,1623663788,2.5 month FWB relationship abruptly ended. Need some help with clarity on what happened here. Did he get super busy or did an ex girlfriend come back?,"Okay so I met this guy 2.5 months ago at a bar at a mutual friends party. He made it very obvious he was into me and he took my number and texted me the next day. I had come to this party with another guy who I had been kissing infront of him.(I'm giving these small pointers incase it helps) Anyways he texted me the next day and we started speaking from there. I soon learnt he's not into texting cause our chats would only consist of 'Hey' but he'd regularly call me up and video call me to see me. 

Now some more pointers -

This dude is not on any social media at all. And when I asked why he wouldn't really answer me.

He has never even tasted a sip of alcohol in his life but loves to party.

He is very rich and also very very hardworking and focused.

Like he's told me he goes without eating because his work comes first sometimes.

He never told me his correct age ever (kinda sus again) but I'm assuming because I'm much younger he didn't want to scare me away (22, he's 30)

He is very very into fitness, now I can't help but wonder if he's recently had some crazy heartbreak, how can someone be this motivated lol and not into social media, not into texting. ( I don't mean to sound shallow)

I don't really know anything deep about him

There's a lockdown going on here for all the time I've known him. Now, he started really pursuing me, by that I mean Calling me \*every single day\* I decided not to put too much of my focus though on this guy because to some extent he would still act only like a booty call (call me really late at night) we'd not talk about anything dirty so I just assumed he was actually busy thru the day. He would genuinely just call to see how I am.

I would be very interested whenever he called but wouldn't go too out of my way to answer his calls, call back etc etc

Now I felt sick during this time and he would call me up every single day, video call me to see how I am, even send me food at home. After I was better he made a plan to hang out and said he'd been waiting to meet me. He was genuinely such a nice dude and was very encouraging and caring towards me.

Keep in mind, this was a very light friendship I still don't know anything deep about him and he doesn't know stuff about me either. When I'd ask he'd give me general answers so I decided to keep it that way too. And I was actually fine with it cause the friendship was so light and it was a great vibe so the fact that we didn't know much about each other didn't bother me.

We were friends with benefits though and would hook up every time we met. 

He started sneaking me into his house so that I could spend the night with him on weekends, he introduced me to his cousin, he would force me to hang with his friends every weekend (I wouldn't go to meet his friends because due to the age gap I didn't want it to appear that I was his toy or something) so I'd decline but hang separately with him later and he'd be fine with it assuming I'm just awkward or something. The most we've gone is three days without speaking and he'd immediately call and ask why? What's up? Is everything okay with me? 

He told me recently hes genuinely fond of me and likes hanging with me. Also hes very mind game free, like hes not one of those dudes who play mind games and act toxic.He also mentioned he's happy to not have sex and just do other stuff even just cuddle because hes banged enough girls, he said this after i mentioned i was a virgin.

Trust me he really made an effort here. And soon even I started reciprocating and would make sure he knew I enjoyed his company. 

We met this weekend, he sneaked me into his house for the night (he lives with his parents) we hooked up, I went home in the morning, he texted me as usual in the evening saying Hey. I continued with something lighthearted to which he didn't respond. I texted him the next day he said he's out of town, I asked him when did he go, he archived my message and never opened it. I assumed he's crazy busy. I texted him on the weekend asking if he's alright. He just said he had been working like crazy due to lockdown being opened again. Which I found to be a valid excuse since it did open the very next day after we hung out last. just whats weird is we never went even a single weekend without speaking, even if he was busy, he'd just call to check in. I texted him back with something sweet, he just saw my message on Sunday early morning at 6 which I found a bit sus because he gets up late af only gets up early if hes out partying or like If i was staying over to hook up with him, he never responded ( I didn't think much of it since he would never really text, only call) I then called him at night because it had been a week since we properly spoke, he answered we had a quick one minute call which is crazy since we always talk longer. He said he's okay, everythings fine, he went on his quick out of town trip, hes back and work is fine (I thought he had not been responding because work was v hectic and this whole time he was out of town) I asked him where had he been to which he said, here only. :/ and then he said let's hang soon (which I felt he didn't really mean but only said so that I calm down, don't question him and would cut the call soon)

I literally cannot help but wonder wtf happened. It makes me only think that he had an ex who's now come back into his life.

Because it's absolutely crazy just the previous weekend he legit forced me to hang out with him and spend the night, fast forward to the next day and he's stopped pursuing me. Literally wtf could be the reason why? He doesn't text or call now and it's been a week. I cannot help but overthink this, I know I should just move on and I will

I dont want to sit and think its because i didnt make enough efforts, also he knew i was kinda shy so wouldn't take it personally

But I really appreciate if anyone could help me get clarity on this situation. How could something just change in a day

It only makes sense if he was using me to get over a girl and shes back now, right?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: A guy really pursuing me for 2.5 months, we have a FWB relationship. It's very light hearted nothing too heavy. I've started hanging out with him only after he proved himself to be genuine and a great guy, he pushed to hang out with me last weekend and next day he bounces and cuts down communication massively.

BUT it's like I felt uncomfortable the whole time, like overthinking all the time, trying to not run out of things to talk about, not even alcohol helped. It's like I felt this apathy, like if I wasn't there, and I dont know why cause I kinda liked the girl. And this feeling it extends like all around me, like now I think I would feel the same way with any girl, I feel I would fuck up.

Does anybody know why I feel this way?

60,nzknfb,1623670049,Was my relationship emotionally abusive?,"About two years ago I met a girl and I must admit, I thought she was very attractive and even though we started as friends, we hit it off right away. We shared similar interests, goals and dreams.

It took about six months for our first big argument, after which she didn't talk to me for almost a week but we made up and she seemed genuinely upset about the whole thing and was very apologetic. I'll spare the details of every point in the relationship but it felt to me that as time went on, she became less and less willing to admit fault and slowly, everything that went wrong between us was because of something I did. The fights weren't constant. Things would be fine for months and then it would explode and, like a fool, I'd go into damage control and try to fix things. She never wanted to talk about what caused the fights, either. She'd just blow off steam for however long it took her to get over it and then it would go back to normal. This part I was never comfortable with as I like hashing out my problems with people and we never once did. 

COVID turned out to be our tipping point. I was laid off on April 1 of last year while she was fortunate enough to keep working. I also got lucky and got my unemployment filed in time to avoid any gaps in my income so I wasn't stressed about money in the slightest. I was also happy because she seemed non-plussed about the virus and we got to spend more time together. Then one day, in early May, she accused me of being resentful of the fact that she was still employed while I was laid off and in that moment, everything I had been willing to overlook in her vanished. Even now my blood boils just thinking about it. I told her that I am not the resentful type and replied with ""That's not what I've observed."" I told her that it was probably the most cutting and hurtful thing I've ever heard somebody say to me, to which she replied something along the lines of ""I call it like I see it."" I cut it off right then and stewed in my own anger. We briefly reconnected at my instigation (again, as a fool) in September but the snide and cutting comments resumed not long after. Once I started to really stand up for myself, she broke it off and we have not spoken since. 

I do believe that this relationship was abusive but it's hard for me to be sure because I'm still a bit sore from it and it doesn't check all the boxes. She was fine with me hanging out with my friends, she LOVED my parents and for the most part, was very easygoing. Two big red flags that might explain her behavior was something she mentioned to me when she confessed she believed she might be bipolar. I knew she suffered from pretty severe depression so bipolar disorder might explain the rest. The other was the fact that her father was emotionally abusive to her as a child so I think that really set her up for treating others that way. I think it also played a huge part in her unwillingness to sit down and discuss our problems like adults.

In this case we're screaming ""personality"", and clearly it didn't help any WW1 veteran back then who returned deformed from the front lines, we just cast them out and acted as if putting their names in books is as good as human contact, but they were deprived of it and people discriminated against their deformities. The veterans even preferred returning to the frontlines because that's the only place they met people who would listen and understand them.

66,nzlcp7,1623672607,"After some passionate dancing and a kiss, she has gone cold","Hey, I'll try to keep this brief.

So I met a women through a male friend of mine at a party. We were left alone, I made some conversation and we surprisingly hit things off pretty well.I got her number and then we proceeded to talk, things were going well. 

The following weekend, myself, her, our mutual friend and a couple others all went out for drinks and once again it really seemed as though she was into me! Later that night we went to a club and we were dancing intimately and ended up kissing a few times. Things were really good! 

However, the following weekend I noticed her and our mutual friend are a little close. He was lifting her up, tickling her and stuff! And I just don't know whether it's that friendship level close or they are both hiding feelings for each other. On top of that, she went extremely cold and distant toward me that weekend and it just threw me off completely.

I even asked him before, is there something between them both and he just never responded (very suspicious).

Also, when me and this friend were doing something with some other females, he told me not to mention it to her. I can understand why but this was also weird.

Ultimately, I think there is something between them and maybe she was using me to make him jealous. On the other hand, I was hoping maybe she was just feeling shy because we hit off intensely in the club.

I'm literally clutching at straws here because I really like her but I just need someone else to share their opinions, so I know my line of thinking isn't wrong.

TLDR: I think a woman I met through my friend maybe using me to make him jealous, how can I be sure?

75,nznvh0,1623680449,Why is it sometimes so hard for people to communicate what they want from you,"Hello fellow redditers,

I come to you with some questions about a recent situation from my dating life.

So last week, I ended up meeting this guy randomly while me and my flatmate were on our way home. He was with his friends and we all
got along together but me and this guy ended up hitting it off so we exchanged numbers.

We went on a date which ended up quite okay as we talked about plenty of stuff - he seemed really careful and attentive. At the end he kissed me and held my hand during the entire walk home. The second date... well.. I ended up at his place. (He was very nice and sweet when we met as well - holding my hand and kissing me in public). However, things didn‚Äôt go _that_ well as we had sex quite a couple of times but everything ended very quickly from his side (less than 30s). It didn‚Äôt bother me at all as I still had a nice time and I made it clear for him as well.

Ever since then though, he‚Äôs been kind of avoiding me and I think I just needed the opinion of other people regarding this:

1. If you simply want to have a one night stand with someone, isn‚Äôt it much easier to let them know about this upfront?

2. Is there such a thing as sleeping with someone too soon? (I don‚Äôt really agree with this as if something is there, why resist the emotions&amp;chemistry? Also if someone likes you, that shouldn‚Äôt really count in a negative way?)

3. Could it be that maybe he was a lil bit embarrassed about what happened?

I think what bothers me is the fact that I don‚Äôt really understand why is he acting the way he does.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nznvh0/why_is_it_sometimes_so_hard_for_people_to/

You can check the post history for the full story. Yesterday, on my birthday, I decided to end things with him. I was at the point where I wasn't happy with our arrangement. I want the titles and the commitment but he doesn't. He told me this plainly in the beginning. I thought I could change his mind and I couldn't. It all feels so real right now and I'm crying writing this. It is sobering to say the least. I know that what I did was the best thing for the both of us. It took me a while but I've finally accepted it, despite how much I care and have feelings for him.

Some things that are becoming very clear to me. 1) I wasn't happy. 2) If someone tells you they aren't looking for a relationship. As literal as it sounds, believe them. In the end you are setting yourself up to get hurt based on the rare chance that you could be together. 3) I was being selfish. We obviously didn't want the same things for our future and me wanting more than he could give me was wrong. 4) The hurt you feel at the end of it is not worth it. I know that I will feel better with time but i was careless with my heart and my precious time and I have no one to blame but myself. 5) I let myself down. Out of all the options I had, I chose the man that didn't want me instead of the one that did. I know that this type of masochism stems from my traumatic childhood, but going forward my decisions have to have my best interest at heart. 

I'm writing all of this, and unhiding my old posts to say thank you for everyone taking the time to write  encouraging words and giving me good advice. I'm also writing this, for the men and women who might be in similar situations(hips) to make sure your needs are met and to never settle. I'll post updates to how I'm feeling soon.

78,nzo8it,1623681429,"(21F) I hooked up with my ex a week before my first date with my new boyfriend (21M) I cut it off after our first date, but we had texted a lot for a month before hand and then I lied to him about it.","  

I'll keep this short and sweet.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for two months exclusively and have been talking for around 5 months in total.

When me and my boyfriend first started talking, (we never met in person first, I Dm'ed him on Instagram) I was casually seeing my ex that I broke up with a month prior, (was a short, not even 2 month long relationship, guy was very manipulative, so I left him) But 2 weeks after the breakup he like made me feel really shitty about it and I wasn't in a great place and idk we started hooking up a few times. This happened while I was first texting my boyfriend I am dating now, who treats me amazingly. But as soon as I went on my first date with my boyfriend, I could see an amazing future that I wanted to pursue with him. So I told my ex that I just wanted to be friends with him so he wouldn't freak out on me (he's one of those guys) this guy could not understand that we weren't together, (kept saying I love you to me and stuff) so about a week before me and my boyfriend got into a relationship, I blocked him completely because he was flipping out over me not hanging out with him anymore.

Anyways, in our first week of dating, my boyfriend told me that he had been talking to other people during the time we had been seeing each other, he never hung out with other people, but he flirted in a sexual manner with some girls, he then asked me if I had done the same, which he said he would have understood because we had no commitment to each other. But I told him that there was nobody else I was talking to, this is true after our first date, but before that, while we were texting for around a month, I was seeing my ex. This happened up until around a week before me and my boyfriends first date.

I have lied about it for the two months we have been dating because I don't want to hurt him, He askes me about it sometimes so I think he suspects something, I thought that if I had told him at the time, he would think that I was just sleeping around with a bunch of people, which is something I don't ever do, ( I haven't even slept with that many people). But now I feel like I have to stick with the lie as it's been dragging on for two months, and I feel guilty. I am completely committed to him, and all this happened before our first date even, but i feel like I should have just been honest from the start.

My boyfriend values honesty quite a bit, and is honestly too honest, he will tell me the truth over almost anything. I don't think he takes lying very well, as he was in an ex relationship where he was lied to almost every single day and was cheated on.

Am I in the wrong here? should I come clean?

79,nzoalq,1623681587,I accidentally triggered a past traumatic experience in my gf,"Hello. So basically in the beginning of May, my gf began feeling depressed.  At first it was only affecting her a little,  but throughout the month it became worse. We had been best friends for 2 years prior to dating.  We started dating in December of 2020. Anyway,  I did try to improve her situation and depression but it didn't work and only sorta drained and brought me down as well. But with her, ever since I've met her, we had always been able to work things out with communication and just talking things out. Any small bump in the road, we always talked it out. That's what I've always done. And so towards the end of may, when things were at it's worse, I just wanted to do what I've always done, which is to use communication to talk things out. 

Because I know communication in relationships is very important. And so during the span of a week, I'd ask her often if she could make more time for us to talk, because she had kinda been more distant because of the depression.  And I'm not an expert on depression,  I didn't know how exactly it affects you or what all symptoms it brings on. I really didn't.  And so I sorta asked a lot if she could make more time for us to talk, because I genuinely thought that any problem can be made better with communication. And looking back, because she was dealing with depression,  it made her wanna be alone more than usual,  and just kinda deal with things on her own. And just made her need space.  But I was really thinking that space was the wrong thing to do, and that just talking things out was the solution.  Looking back I see that I was wrong. Communication is important,  but it cant solve all problems.  And during that week, I did kinda get upset that she wouldn't make more time for us to talk and communicate our feelings and figure out a solution. It made me feel like she wasn't putting in the effort to try and just communicate and solve the issue. Looking back I was wrong for thinking that. I was overwhelmed with a lot myself and not thinking clearly. 

And I guess basically my constant asking her to make more time for us triggered something from her past. Basically Years ago she had a boyfriend who was super terrible.  He abused her physically,  emotionally,  verbally etc. He was super controlling and did terrible things to her. And apparently one of the things he use to do was to tell her she needs to make more time for him and that ""she never makes time for him"" and just stuff like that. And because of me saying I'd like for her to make more time for us to communicate,  it reminded her of him and what she went through. And it just brought back those memories. And she told me afterwards that she needs to take some time to herself.  She made it clear that she still loves me and that we will continue the relationship where we left off when shes ready. 

But I just feel terrible.  I never intended to remind her of her abusive controlling ex. I genuinely just thought that talking things out and using communication was the best solution. Looking back I know I was wrong for thinking that communication can solve all problems,  especially depression. I'm nothing like her ex, I genuinely love her, I care about her. And I have nothing but love for her.  I've never abused her in any way. And I just wanna know what things I need to be doing to make sure this never happens again.  I have never been with someone who's had traumatic things that have happened in their past. Or someone who's dealing with depression. I want to be the best boyfriend possible. I'd like some tips and advice for when you're with someone you have to be extra sensitive around because of past trauma etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzoalq/i_accidentally_triggered_a_past_traumatic/
80,nzoexk,1623681923,How to proceed...,"I'm (28M), she's (37F). We will call her A.

""Introduced"" through a colleague (B) of mine that thought we should meet. Colleague had dinner with A a few weeks back which is where B name dropped me. Later that week B gave me A's number and told me to call her.

Played a bit of phone tag that weekend (Memorial Day weekend), but we did have a nice 30-45 minute phone conversation which ended in us starting to lose service so we parted ways. I reached back out to her a few days later to see if we could set something up, but she was going away for the weekend. Texted her a few days after her trip, mentioned wanting to get together, she said she would like to but her dog is going through some medical issues right now so outside of work she spends most of her time at her mom's spending time with her dog. Understandable. She did mention she would like to chat in the mean time and hopefully next week (now this week) her dog is a bit more independent and she will have more free time.

I have not heard from A since Thursday night, in which I ""left her on read"". Her last text wasn't really anything to respond to and it was getting late, so I just went to bed. I have not reached out to her since, but I was kind of hoping I'd have heard from her this time instead. Her responses have always been enthusiastic and long and when I asked about her trip, she sent me pictures from it unsolicited, so she *seems* interested. The other side of things is she has not once initiated conversation, and outside of our first phone conversation she really hasn't inquired about me much. Our conversation has flowed well, but she hasn't done any real ""getting to know me"". I understand text isn't the place for this, but we haven't even had a first date yet...I feel like you'd ask a *couple* questions at least. Also, she is definitely someone that is busy. I stay busy too, but come on...30 minutes for coffee shouldn't be *that* much of a burden on someone's schedule.

So Reddit, how do I proceed? This is the first girl I have pursued since my ex and I parted ways. I feel like I'm new to this whole dating thing... My ex was also very assertive, so I haven't had to ""pursue"" or ""chase"" someone in years. How do I do it while maintaining my dignity, self respect and confidence?

This is not for the guy who has trouble starting conversations and managing social anxiety.

Rather, this is for the guy who is intermediate and has conversations with girls, but not the conversations that he wants.

If you find that you struggle to keep conversations going and girls don‚Äôt invest easily, or that getting a girl‚Äôs number or a girl to go on a date with you is an uphill battle, this is for you.

Having girls want to interact and hang with you should be as easy as gravity is certain.

To achieve this, you will need to drop the good, to go for the amazing.

What do I mean by that?

Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to lose track and instead of approaching girls to get to know them, we get lost in our thoughts, and before you know it, we‚Äôre approaching a girl to impress our friend.

We can then later tell them that we‚Äôre chatting with her on Instagram and show them her pictures to see how hot she is.

But that‚Äôs not what we really signed up for.

What you need to know is that your value proposition is wrong from the start.

You are funny or cool or something that offers value upfront, and as an exchange for that, you ask for the number, and it‚Äôs only fair that you get it, since you offered something. 

But that doesn‚Äôt mean this number will translate and you‚Äôre not even set up to start the interaction from the most ideal place.

Here‚Äôs how you cure this: (video version here: youtube - watch?v=GU9SSD7Xsfo )

For a long time, maybe a month or two, you‚Äôre not allowed to close. You‚Äôre not allowed to move things forward. Can‚Äôt take a number, IG, can‚Äôt escalate on a girl, can‚Äôt try to have sex with her, nothing.

No agenda.

This means you will have to ‚Äúburn‚Äù some interactions that otherwise would yield a number. Understand that unfortunately, you will never see this girl again. Be ok with that. You‚Äôre paving the way to the quality of interactions you want to be having with these ‚Äúsacrificed‚Äù girls.

You also need to stop talking to the girls where you know they‚Äôre not investing as much as you.

The ones that only talk to you for validation but have no intention of actually making plans with you.

Yes, I know it‚Äôs hard going back to square one but this is how you will make room for the interactions you really want to be having.

You are still allowed to go up to girls, and have fun etc. In fact this is encouraged.

Your mission is not to give up. But to slowly turn things around and have girls ask for your number.

The first step is, like I said, not being allowed to ask for it yourself.

The second step is realizing you have nothing to chase for. Since you can‚Äôt get the number, there‚Äôs no chance for the interaction to go anywhere. So you must give up from the start.

And instead be there. Be present. Once all your cool strategies for eliciting compliance are not allowed anymore, and you give up, you will realize that the only thing you have is the interaction itself. You won‚Äôt be funny for the number‚Äôs sake. If you are funny, it‚Äôll be because it‚Äôs genuine.

And once you start accessing that place of authenticity inside you, everyone will be on you like you have a magnet.

Authenticity is so rare that people can‚Äôt help but be magnetized to it.

Once you are in that position, you will be the guy the girl is trying to get to invest. And it will be your choice, whether or not you will do it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzq0ed/exercise_to_get_girls_and_people_to_invest/

97,nzqgw0,1623687474,My thoughts on online dating and why it works for some and not for others,"Ok so please just hear me out. This is just a thought I had on why some people do not get matches at all, and why others are finding dates all the time. My personal view on online dating, well dating in general, is that looks and physical attraction trumps all **(initially!!!).** My thinking stems from physical attraction, while ignoring personality and personal interests etc. I am not saying these are not important, but the truth is that physical attraction is what starts it. Keep in mind my entire post is about initial attraction and finding mates at the beginning.

Ok so:

Basically online dating just amplifies real life dating. In real life you have:  
A) A majority of people who are average looking  
B) Some people who are very good looking  
C) Some people who are below average looking

Think of the above as a bell curve. C is the left of the curve (ugly people), A is the middle (mostly people who are average) and the right side of the curve is B (attractive people).

The people who have the easiest time in real life finding mates are those in B. Those in C obviously have a harder time. I don't think it is controversial to say that some people just do not find many (if any) dating partners at all in real life. I know some guys in their late 20s who can count the number on dates they have went on with one hand. On the other hand, there are people who are going on multiple dates/week. I know guys who go shopping to find new boxers and come back home with a new number. It is what it is. Then there is everyone else in between.

Another thing to keep in mind is that men and women who are not getting dates in real life due to their below average looks are still attracted to other better looking people. I hate to use the number system but just to get my point across a 3/10 male is going to be attracted to the 7/10 girl, not a 3/10 girl (assuming he is hetero). Conversely, that 7/10 girl is going to be attracted to a 7/10 guy, not the 3/10 guy (again assuming she is hetero).

Now, why should online dating change any of this? Why would people who are not getting dates or attention in real life (due to looks) suddenly get matches and dates from online dating platforms? These online dating platforms are just amplifying the effects of the bell curve I described above. The real answer to why many people do not have any luck with online dating is because they are below average looks. It is that simple. The common complaints that I read above dating apps is stuff like: you cant filter well enough, I dont get matches, girls ghost after a match, etc. Some of these apps definitely have flaws and can be improved, **but for many these apps work.** I know plenty of men and women who get plenty of dates off Tinder. They are getting matches and going out and meeting these people.

When you are at a bar and see a girl you think is attractive, do you think ""gee I wish I knew if she liked football and jazz music"" or do you think ""I want to go talk to her and get her number"". Probably the second one. If successful, from there you would converse a bit over text and then go on a DATE to get to know her better. So why are we not seeing these apps like being at the bar? We don't expect the bar to filter out people for us... at the bar we just find/scan for matches and then do the rest ourselves.

So for those of you having issues with online dating, maybe you have to ask yourself: ""is it the app, or is it me?"" - I dunno, is that the harsh reality?

Thoughts? Is this just something people are ignoring and its easier to blame the app?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzqgw0/my_thoughts_on_online_dating_and_why_it_works_for/
98,nzqnhg,1623687945,I 21(M) and 19(F) went on a second date that went fine-ish but I ruined it all horribly with a phone call two hours later. I really like this girl a lot and need advice on how to take it from here texting her to make amends and so she can see me as a normal guy again.,"So we went out on our second date and it was supposed to be casual, she texted me after our first date and told me she wasn't looking for a serious relationship... For a little background of who we are it goes as the following:

We will call the girl Jane (fake name): Jane has a very free spirit and has a wide range of sense of humour and she is very joke-y. She is in some sort of orchestra and travels through Europe and has lived lots of cool experiences. Pretty athletic and just a person full of the kind of joy that is very contagious.

Me: I don't know how to describe myself but here it goes: I am not the greatest conversationalist but I try to be a good listener and ask good questions. I'm a pretty serious person though I do try my best at teasing when I'm on a date. I'm studying at uni but I don't really know what I'm doing with my life and I like writing songs on my free time.

Anyways, the date went pretty fine but she told me she had gone to sleep at 6 am the night before so she was super tired but she just appeared to be bored all the time. On our first date she did most the talking but in this one she answered my questions and intentions to start conversation but there was kind of a lack of connection going on. I am going to be completely honest here: I kissed her on the first date and took it easy on our second date (only kissed her at the end) but she was kind of a shy kisser, like there wasn't much tongue, just the tip, and although she told me I was a good kisser in the middle of it, right after we kept going at it she stopped to tell me she doesn't really like long kisses. Her friend was on her way so maybe she just didn't want to be seen making out or she wasn't feeling it or she was just telling the truth.

Weird signals: At one point while laying together on the beach side by side she had her dresse's lower part uncovered so you could see her butt (she was wearing panties) and she bought it up. I didn't know what to say I just said something like Wow you really have all my attention now or something stupid like that. At another moment we were joking about something and she told me that she wasn't a good girl anymore because she wasn't a virgin. I had no idea how to respond to that, it kind of came out of the blue. And last, at the end of the date I noticed she wasn't wearing a bra. I don't know what all of those things mean considering she wasn't paying me much attention and left early, the date was supposed to end at 6 pm but she called her friend and they decided to meet at 5 pm (we met at 2pm).

Where I fucked up or things didn't go well:

I live in another city and I didn't get the chance to buy a bus ticket for my ride back because I made a friend on the bus and didn't know how to break off the convo to go buy a ticket so I didn't get any so when she asked me at what time I was going back I told her I didn't get a ticket but didn't explain why or anything. This might have led to her thinking that I wanted to spend the night or something. At one point she showed me a tattoo she has on a finger so I challenged her to a thumb war but she turned me down (and said that I already knew her trick so she wouldn't win). While laying on the beach a wave was going to get to us so we got up and grabbed our things but instead of going to another spot we went to the street. She didn't want to go get a drink. At one point she asked me what I wanted to do and I don't know why but I didn't think at all and just said half jokingly ""you know what I want to do"" and she said ""go for a drink"" and I said ""no"" and that was the end of it. Really fucking stupid on my part. At the end of the date her friend asked if I would come with but since my date didn't ask me I said no (instead of saying the better answer: ""it's up to her \*and look at Jane\*"" but i wasn't thinking straight.

Where I really really really fucked up (its the second call not the first). I called her one hour later to say goodbye because our goodbye was kind of lame and short it was like this super short hug with little to no affection. So I say goodbye and stuff and I ask how to hitchike because I missed all my buses. An hour later I text her if I can ask a serious question and she says tell me. I call her and say it's going to be kind of a speech and say the dumbest, most desperate, intense shit a guy could say on his second date, something along the following ""hey so I'm trying to not overthink things here but I can't help but feel that something was off today so I was just wondering if you could tell me if you had a good time, things you liked things you didn't. And just be honest about it even if you have to be mean."" I think it was even longer but luckily my memory is garbage. She said something like ""I think you are overthinking and have too many expectations. I had a really great time and hope you did too, you should just be happy for what it was"" and some other stuff I don't remember but you get the picture.

Anyways, I'm feeling super shitty and depressed right now. I know that makes me look emotionally immature, needy, desperate and what not but it's the truth. I really really liked this girl and would love to see her again. She left yesterday to another city (our date was the day before that) and she comes back in august. I have her number and would like to know if I should apologize, talk about something, ask her anything, or what can I do so she remembers me and the idea she has of me can change enough so she wants to see me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzqnhg/i_21m_and_19f_went_on_a_second_date_that_went/
99,nzqoec,1623688014,stick to your own kind,"This is a bit of a rant but whenever I seek out help in terms of dating I always get several responses that tell me ""to stick to my own kind"" as in other people on the spectrum. Some responses are more crude than others but they are always the same, only date those who have Asperger's. It doesn't matter to them whether or not this response makes sense or has any sort of basis other than the fact I explain I have Asperger's to provide as much background information about myself as possible. I do not get any responses when I ask for clarification or only general hostility as to me asking even.

Only recently was I given some clarification and that is nerotypical individuals aren't accepting of differences or anything that differs from the status quo, even if it is just to guide someone.

I guess it is what it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzqoec/stick_to_your_own_kind/
