What is confidence? It seems to be a universally attractive quality, but I don’t really understand it. I recently started going to therapy, and this is a recurring topic. How I’ve always understood confidence is that it has to have a concrete basis, otherwise it’s just performative. For example, I’m confident in my singing voice. I can go up and sing karaoke with no embarrassment or self-consciousness. In contrast, I have a friend, let’s call him David, who is very confident but has no discernible basis for that confidence. Can’t really hold a job, is an alcoholic, has multiple kids he doesn’t care about, few skills, yet he talks and interacts with women with confidence. He’s the life of the party, but also a complete dumpster fire. From my perspective, he’s getting the benefits of confidence without doing the work. From my perspective, the only things he’s actually confident in is his ability to manipulate women into sex.

I’ve come to understand that this is a cynical and invalid perspective, coming from a place of pain and confusion. I’m trying to replace this corrupted idea in my head, but I don’t know how. My therapist said that people who are confident are confident in themselves, but I don’t understand what that means. What are we if not our skills and experiences, the effect we have in the world? I know I’m missing something somewhere down the line, but I don’t know what. 

Look, I know I’m overthinking this, but I can’t help it. So, help me out. What is confidence? Does it have to be based on something? If not, should it? Is it just lying to yourself and the people around you? Can you tell the difference between genuine confidence and someone faking it for performance? Idk, but I’d like some more perspectives.

And yes I know this post clearly spells out loser. I’ve accepted that I probably am a loser. 

Is it worse for a 21 year male to not have this experience or a 21 year old female?

I don’t even have other male friends so if your advice is to start dating I can’t. This is because I don’t have my tribe yet. Women will pick up on this and this will be a turn off for them. I also don’t want to be that guy that puts too much attention on a girl because I have no friends. 

Friendships takes years to build so I’m looking at a window of a year and a half when I can start dating by social standards if I am successful making friends which is really difficult to do. So most likely 2 or 3 years.  So I’d be maybe turning 23 or 24 when I’d be fit to start dating. Is this a good or bad thing? Are women turned off by lack of experience around these ages? Should I lie to future women and act like I’ve been with many despite having no experience?

I’m not the type of person who puts too much attention in this and is desperate to get into a relationship. However I am at a age where this is becoming to concern me. I don’t have any experience with women let alone people in an age where I should be somewhat socially intelligent. My social intelligence is below room temperature which is why I don’t know how to make friends or get women.

We hit it off pretty quick and I’ve honestly been enjoying my time with her. Am I head over heels for her? No, I’m taking my time and trying to get to know her and see if she’s worth my time. But the first night we went out, we ended up making out and walking back to my car she was hanging all over me. I thought it was the alcohol since we had went to a few bars that night. She invited me out to some bars with her friends and she was back to being super affectionate and stuck with my the entire night, which I really enjoyed. It showed me she was enjoying my presence. It was a really fun night! After that we chilled for a few days and then I took her out to coffee and we got to know each other a bit better. I’m not one to judge past mistakes as she told me she has been arrested before but informed me that she finished her probation and got the misdemeanor off her record and I never gave it attention after that. Well last night she calls me and happens to tell me that she never finished probation and is technically on the run. Her response was, “I paid the fines, they have my money. They can try and come get me.”  Which I was like oh. Another thing that raised a few questions is that I asked if she wanted to hangout the day before. She responded with “I’m feeling a bit tired and I want to be alone.” Totally cool, she asked if I was mad about that and I said no and that said that everyone needs space. Well on the same call on the same day she told me that, she tells me she got sent home early from work because one of her coworkers tested positive. And I was thinking, “Why didn’t you just say that to begin with????” Like wtf. I’m vaccinated already but it would’ve been nice to know if I was carrying that shit around. She then sends me a picture of her at an Urgent Care center with an IV saying she’s getting her Covid test. Now this is confusing, as I work as a first responder and was required to do Covid testing during the pandemic and was never required to give anyone an IV during testing. I know it’s been a week, but this story of hers doesn’t make too much sense to me. 
I want to see where things go but I know I’m smarter than to get played by some girl I just met. I’m not getting my hopes up and I’m not letting my guard down.

I have spent my whole life trying to be the best person I can be. Women weren't attracted to me in my teens and early 20s although they all wanted to be my friend. So I've just carried on with my life trying to be the best I can and still trying on the side with no success. I've excelled in every area of my life except dating. I'm in the best shape physically of my life. I earn well above the top 1%.

While I've done this I've also now aged out of the dating market, as all the good women my age are married with kids. Younger women are attractive to me but don't want to date me now any more than they did when I was their age.

I don't want kids myself at this point because women have taught me the only value you can have in life for dating/love/sex is based on your height/race/face. Since I wasn't born with the right ones, if I have a kid, they will suffer the same as I did unless they are female (my sister for example gets hundreds of matches online and can set up dates every day - no penalty for her).

I was going to try cold approach in yoga classes, climbing gyms, crossfit, bars, and clubs one more time but that's impossible still due to mask mandates. At this rate those may never go away or it might take another year as we're going into fall now.

I've tried posting my profiles for feedback and been told their great. I had my female relatives make a new profile for me from scratch and got nothing. I recently read a thread on here that made me chuckle. A woman here replied to a Craigslist ad from a guy who was willing to pay $200 for anyone who could set up a date in online dating using his photos. She tried to do it and failed, saying ""damn, online dating is hard for men.""

The only guys I know who succeed at it are tall and white or handsome. I'm told this is because women want to take pictures for social media standing next to a Hollywood actor looking prop, and also they want tall, beautiful, white babies. So the rest of us are relatively useless as we can't provide those things.

The last options I then have are moving to another country like South America where brown skin or being less than 6' wouldn't be considered a disease. Or paying women to date me, so I can at least go on one date with one woman I find attractive in my life. 

Moving would have pros of letting me date more freely, but I'd have to give up my high paying job, house, family, and friends. Paying women would mean it's just transactional, but I could keep all those things.

Which is the better option and is there anything I've missed?

I am already fine with being alone. I've been alone my whole life.

I have been dating a woman for 3 weeks (gone on 5 dates, had sex twice).  It came up on date #2, before we had sex for the first time, that we are also going on dates with other people we meet through dating apps.  Totally normal of course, although most don't actually talk about this, I feel like it is normally the big secret everyone knows.  

Anyway, after the date I ended playfully saying, ""Any hot dates coming up?"" half joking, but she ended up explaining that she had one the next day.  I felt jealous, which I am ashamed to say, but it is true.  I also had a date with another person coming up, so this isn't fair, but still felt this way. I did recognize that it is healthy for people to date multiple people and wished her a good time.  

A few days later we went on date #3 and ended up having sex for the first time and spent the whole next morning together which was amazing.  It felt like much more than a hookup and we continued to text the next few days as we have done.  

After some texting I asked her how the date went with the other person she had earlier in the week.  She said she had a good time and didn't even drink.  At this point, I think most people would leave it at that, but for some reason I kept inquiring.  I no longer felt jealous at this point, but was curious and felt a bit excited I was learning this info that I almost felt I shouldn't know.  I ended up asking, as a joke, ""So, how has the sex?"", not expecting a response.  BUT, she ended up responding, ""okay"".  

I went into shock, honestly one of the more emotional feelings I have had in life.  Similar to pre panic attack feelings with blood rushing, dizziness, etc.  Jealous feelings came back, but now I also felt very turned on (wtf?).  I have no idea why, but I got really excited and I feel a bit ashamed for it. Almost like I should not be feeling this way.  Then I started worrying about STDs. Then started wondering why she decided to sleep with this person on date #1, but not me (""obviously she likes him better""-is what ran through my head).  Of course, I didn't want or try to hook up with her on our first date, so it isn't fair of me to make this comparison, but there I was doing just that.  

So fast forward a bit, I went on 2 more dates with her and we are planning to keep seeing each other.  I really do like her.  She also has seen this other person one more time, but I didn't ask anymore questions this time, not yet anyway.  However, I'm mostly not feeling the raging jealously, although it comes back every once in a while.  Our time together is really amazing and I am beginning to think continuing to be 'open' or whatever the term is could work in the long run.  I have gone on other dates, but I really mostly want to spend my time with her. We are contuning to share our stories from other dates, mostly making fun and joking around about them and I find it really exciting to talk about. But anything about sex from them hasn't come up.  Again, feel a bit ashamed for this and don't know what to make of it. 

Has anyone else experienced similar? Or what did you feel when you learned about someone you\`re dating other dates?

During this pandemic, I broke quarantine once to hang out with some friends and their friends, and almost kissed someone who showed interest back (I was the one to ask if there was something going on between us and whether he'd like to 'talk'). I denied more advances as soon as he kissed me -- all because I felt nothing. Nothing at all besides thinking to myself ""this is so weird"". Furthermore, I've also had a couple dudes from college confess their feelings (one of which even told me ""it's alright, I realize you don't like me back"" since we'd been friends for months and I told him how difficult it's been for me to find someone I have actual feelings for).

I recently started hanging out with my old company of friends and i really feel attracted to a girl that is part of it.
I already knew her from before but we always didn't really talk much. But since i came back i felt attracted to her so i tried to get closer and talk with her a bit.
Now, I don't really know what to do next to best improve my chances, for example I don't know if it's a good idead to ask her out right now and potentially waste my chance or if I should wait to get closer to her (somehow). But if i wait i really don't know how much i should wait or if it will even improve my chances or not.
If it sounds like chaos it's because it's the same inside my head. I am on a rejection streak of like 5 girls and i am really starting to lose my shit. 
I live in a really bad place, not a lot of people to hang out with and stuff so everytime i find someone i am attracted to i worry because if she rejects me who knows when i'll find another girl i like (my tastes are a bit weird so i don't like the average girl)

A little about myself: I am a person who has never had a serious relationship. As well as dating. What I call ""relationships"" usually begins in two scenarios: either it is a colleague with whom we worked side by side for 15 hours a day for several months. It is difficult to keep borders here and we either started dating, or a cold war happened between us. In the second case, it all started with drinking (or a sleepless night on a yoga weekend) and a night of frank conversations about problems that, in an incomprehensible way for me, turned into a relationship. For a couple of months in both versions. All my attempts to just start a relationship (tinder, acquaintance on the street / at the university, etc.) usually led to the fact that I became a substitute for my father. Literally the role of the father with all the ensuing projections. That in my 27 it is strange, but many people in vain think that I am smarter than them and this happens not only with girls :( Or maybe I'm just too ugly, who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Such a situation happened recently. I played pub quiz on Sunday, my team has two guys and a girl. After the quiz, we drank a couple of shots, which we won, and went for a walk. The three of us walked first, she and another guy. The second guy was somehow silent, maybe I suppressed him, I don't know how it works, I don't tend to do this with people on purpose. Then there were two of us, I volunteered to walk her home and hold the bag when she needed to tie her shoelaces. Damn, it's so weird to talk about that at 27: D There was all sorts of empty talk about music, movies, and stuff like that. And then, already at her entrance, she suddenly asks ""have you ever fallen in love strongly?"" And I'm even lost what it is. Did she take our walk as a date? Or was I too private? But after that, she became more open to me and stayed closer. Plus she said that for half a year she had not been in a relationship and the first love was an abuser with whom they were just friends. I'm confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to see what happens next. I called her again, this time tete-a-tete. We had a good time, walked and sat in a restaurant. The conversations were more personal, she said something that slightly alerted me: ""All my partners with whom I was comfortable were several years older than me."" This was said in the context of a discussion about her close friend's wedding. Our age difference is 5 or 6 years. And at the end, near the entrance, she asked me ""Have you met people with whom it was pleasant to be silent?""

&amp;#x200B;

Both meetings I was ashamed to take her hand or hug her goodbye. I am confused by the status of these meetings and whether I will cross personal boundaries, thereby offending her.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually the question. Should I invite her directly to the third meeting as a date?

Now that I've ran into her more, it's just like, I see beautiful girls all the time and usually couldn't care less, but my instinct tells me she's completely my type which almost never happens, and that I might have a shot if I find a good approach.

Thing is I run into her so randomly (leaving super market, or just see her passing in the street). It would be so obvious and cringe for me to just be like ""hey so we're starting this conversation now, and I'm totally not interrupting whatever you're doing"".  I'm very much a ""leave people alone"" kind of guy.

I am okay with being a virgin, and even openly admit it and (non-self deprecatingly) joke about it when the subject comes up with the women I have briefly dated (and they tend to be cool about it). I’d like to be able to move past it.

I tend to be cold and straightforward with people/dates. This is okay and acceptable in business and work, but it is killing my date vibes. 

On dates, I tend to never touch or express physical interest, which is probably why my dates lost interest after the first. I only realized this on my own after reading women’s dating experience with men similar to me on this site that women might be interpreting my expressed interest as ‘mixed signals’ at best, and ‘let’s just be friends’ at worst. 

I try to be as aware as possible, but I feel like I might be overthinking this. On paper, I should just initiate and escalate physical contact as much as we are mutually comfortable with, but in practice, I feel unable to ease into it. Interpret ‘it’ as any physical touch that comes to mind.

There is also the terrifying idea in which my date not only accepts my advances, but doubles down on wanting to go further than I want to. In theory, this is great as we are both clearly interested, but in reality, I self-sabotage with inappropriate jokes that kill the mood almost entirely, and where I play it off like the mutual interest never happened. 

Strangely enough, my preferred place to meet women was at a dance school studio. I felt okay with holding strangers close because it was the expectation. Though there is no romantic energy from me, I did not feel terrified to hold, guide, and dance with women at all.

I think it’s an understatement to say that this is entirely in my head, because I have had clear-cut interest and success up until I sabotage everything and pull out (metaphorically, of course). I feel better having shared some of my struggles, but I’d appreciate any thought on the subject.

Well, to be simple about, all the women I've been meeting seem like they'd prefer if I wasn't around and I'm not sure why. If there was wrong that I'm doing I'd understand, but I'm trying to be nothing but nice. (Or Caring/loving, whatever way you'd like to see it)

It's... not working out, as you could likely tell by the purpose of the post. &amp; It's not that I'm expecting relationships for being nice, but I do expect, well, more than I'm getting.

How do I mean? Well, Let's list all of my experiences with women.

\-First-

This person lead me on for two months, lying about literally everything. When I spoke about it, most seemed to see only that I was mad that she doesn't want to have sex with me anymore.

In actuality though, even after everything she says that she still would. (which I can't say I care about anymore, not to mention if she'd have sex with someone she's not attracted to, while already with someone...)

Her lies? (If you were wondering?) Well, there's her lying about thinking I'm attractive, lying about being violated by her brothers and father, lies about never having been with anyone even though she has for the past 6 years, lies about recent death that was bothering her, lies about where she lives, and a bunch of others.

Literally nothing that she told me over the two months of getting to know each other was true.

So there's a ""fuck you"" straight to me.

\-Second-

Around two months ago too I met another person. Nothing's happened really so far, but she said that she likes speaking to me so much that she wants to move the conversation to discord. (instead of the app we were using)

It's been about a month since, without adding me or anything, and, well, I'm pretty sure I just got lied to again.

There's also her proclamation about how she has a ""bad habit"" of not saying anything to people for weeks.

I personally believe that's untrue, and she still goes on the app but won't say anything to me.

Another ""fuck you"" have I earned, reasonless this time as well. At least I'm getting used to it I guess (That's a lie)

\-Third-

About a month ago I started speaking to yet another person. However this person says that I'm bad at communication and don't know how to ""talk to girls""

Which might be true, my experience is slim, I'm slightly autistic and socially/mentally slower, but she can't call anyone bad at communication when she's awful herself. How am I meaning?

Well. she literally just says lol to everything. and gives one or two word responses to anything ever said.

Ask her what's up? ""Lol""

Ask her how her children are? ""Looooool""

Ask her how her game's going? ""Hehe""

....

Good fucking god, I'm sorry, but this all is reminding me of why I never really liked people.

They'll treat you like shit and it's never for a reason. (In my experience anyways,)

you know what else is making me feel pretty hated? How anyone I message on dating apps never say anything.

&amp; My messages are nothing but nice. I usually just send wishes for luck in what they're wanting to find, or a simple hope for a nice day.

But all I get is a wordless ""fuck you"" (actually some of them are said)

You know what I really, really like about all of this? If it was done by someone they liked at all it would be treated well. Doubt they'd be getting no response... fairly certain something would be said and it'd be thanked for or enjoyed.

so, if what I do isn't being appreciated... &amp; if nothing's being said...

...

\---------

TL;DR I feel safe assuming that all these women that ""like"" me would actually would prefer me less alive. (a little far? Probably not actually, I know most only care for those that they may have sex with.)

It's what I'm seeing, so is there a way where I may have people actually like me? &amp; not treat me like shit?

I find it strange how I, with my bad life and only being half-raised because I didn't have parents around, am able to be at least okay. What's all of these people's reasonings for being some kind of harmful? especially those that had nicer lives and Parents and were never abused and happen to have nice bodies? Seriously

I'd like advice on how to not be treated badly by everyone I'm meeting, especially these people that supposedly ""like"" me. (I mean, if they didn't wouldn't they make it so I couldn't be part of their life, or why would they want to know me but not know me? )

""I like you so much that I want nothing to do with you at all"" (It's basically being told that, the whole thing)

I'd like advice on how to not only ever be used or mistreated by people too. I hear people don't like Abusers but they do pretty well. (They need people to do anything, right?)

I'm going to say it, it is pretty awful how you have to be good-looking enough or something just for people to talk to you and not treat you worse than they likely treat criminals and Warlords.

So my friend Megan (30f) and I have been friends since college, and she’s been an integral part of my adult life. I really respect her and her advice, so when she said she had someone for me to meet, I was excited to meet someone she thought would be a good match for me.

Well…until she started to tell me more about him. And she is not doing him any particular favors. 

She admitted she doesn’t know much about him, but what she has shared hasn’t particularly excited me. She mentioned some mental &amp; physical health stuff that, if I’m being honest, sounds really intimidating. She showed me his picture, and I’m not attracted to him at all. Not always a deal-breaker if he’s got a good personality, but she also made an off-hand comment about me helping him find a new wardrobe, which I found kind of strange (as if he’s not an adult who can dress himself??) He also doesn’t sound particularly driven, which is important to me. The overwhelming quality she’s emphasized is that he’s really “nice” (which, no pun intended, is nice), but I can’t help shake the feeling that she’s overemphasizing his “niceness” in order to compensate for a lot of these other qualities which are kind of making me nervous. Especially when she can’t pinpoint any other specific qualities he has.

I hate to say it, but I can’t help but feel she thinks that I would make a good caretaker for him rather than a partner. Or she’s nervous that I’m already 30 and unmarried - which I’m personally fine with.

I should also note I’m very introverted, so meeting new people in general is exhausting and nerve wracking for me. Adding on top of that what I’m interpreting as potential red flags, and I’m starting to psych myself out.

We were clearly invested in each other, and as life eased up - we flew to meet each other and spent time together. 

Fast forward 9 months, we've spent 2-3 months physically together, got invested in each other and got much closer. Obviously we don't know all the red flags yet, but lots of good stuff between us - shared interests, mutual respect, etc.

Yet, I find myself struggling to shake off the feeling of going home that I seeded last year, and am constantly trying to figure out if I can make this work by continuing to live here. Or should I walk away from an incredible human, just because I think I want to go home.

After covid restrictions became less strict this summer, we saw each other more frequently (during these meetings) and got closer to each other.

I believe she might be interested in me because of a few situations but I'm not too sure:

* she told me she enjoys spending time and having conversations with me
* when I was late to a gathering she texted me and asked if I was coming. Later that night she explained to me that she was quite busy with uni assignments but only came to see me again after a long time
* At another gathering, we spend some time apart from the rest of the group when we were all meeting at a park. She tried to stay close to me and also teased me now and then.

Unfortunately, she told me we won't see each other for a long time as she is going to study abroad for half a year (in 1 1/2 months).

I was quite busy lately and therefore didn't ask her out earlier. She's such a wonderful woman and I'd like to know if things could work out.

Weeks ago, I posted about how I thought this guy liked me. Well two days ago, everything blew up. 

I had been angry at him for weeks because I felt like he lead me on and deceived me.  Weeks ago, he had said he was dating another girl which surprised me, because I thought he liked ME. He had been flirting with me and doing things to indicate he liked me. It shocked me when he said he was dating another girl. I didn’t confront him about it until two days ago though. 

He sent me a video on Instagram after I posted a new picture of myself. Since he contacted me first, I took that moment to confront him. The whole thing turned into an argument. I told him I felt like he had lead me on and deceived me. He then said that he hadn’t and that he had only been nice to me which wasn’t true. He was definitely flirting with me but he kept denying it. 

He said that he didn’t like me and how he never asked me on a date and never had a crush on me and never said I was cute and blah blah blah. He was rude and it hurt my feelings. I ended up calling him an asshole because I was so mad at how he had lead me on and tricked me. He said that I was just mad because I couldn’t and can’t get with him. He kept saying that I needed to apologize for calling him an asshole, which I refused to do, because he is one. 

The conversation ended with him telling me to leave him alone and that I was just mad because I liked him and he didn’t like me. 

After he told me to leave him alone, I did. I stopped messaging him immediately. I posted some Instagram stories shortly after our argument, and I noticed that he looked at all three of them. He looked at my story that I posted yesterday too. 

By yesterday, I had reflected a little, and I definitely don’t want a relationship or friendship with him anymore. I decided to block him on Instagram so I can move on. I don’t want to see him or talk to him. I also don’t want him watching my stories or seeing my posts. After I blocked him, I felt relief. I resolved to move on. 

However, about 30 minutes after I blocked him on Instagram, he messaged me on Snapchat. Evidently, he was angry that I had blocked him on Instagram. 

This is exactly what he said: 

“Your something else man 😪 but it’s whatever I’ll still pray for ya! God bless next time don’t force people to crush on you when they really don’t want to. I can tell your a little bit new to dating so that’s my advice for you 💯.” 

I then messaged him back and told him to please stop contacting me. He said “okay (: God bless 💯”. He then screenshotted our message exchange on Snapchat for whatever reason. 

Honestly I don’t even know what to think. This freaked me out. And it confirmed my opinion that he’s an asshole. He messaged me on a different social media platform just to say something mean after I had already blocked him. And, how did he figure out so fast that blocked him? He had to literally be looking at my Instagram account all day to immediately figure that out.

even during our last date( me coming over to her place and cooking dinner together), she told me how she "" really wants to get to know me more""...

and now she ghosted me. I texted her sunday if she was free this weekend and I haven't heard anything since.  I had a feeling this would happen because she would take longer and longer to answer texts and sometimes not even respond to them...

Hi all,

little bit of a rant. Please feel free to leave if you had enough negativity in your life or go down to the tldr if you want to skip all the bullshit.

I (m29) am just tired of dating. Sick and tired of it, this whole dating culture nowadays in tinder, bumble, etc is just stupid, emotional draining and self esteem killing.

I am just tired of deleting and recreating accounts, engineering my profile with pictures profile descriptions. Even if you get that down, you still have to work your ass off for being ""original"", ""unique"" just to get a fucking reply, which is against your odds. More difficult than getting a match, is getting a reply.

If you manage to get a reply, getting a date after that is another chore. Then you go to one, two, three dates, everything seems to go fine, you get invested just to never hear of the person again. That's it, no explanation, no anything,. And you are left wondering what the fuck you did wrong.

You have to plays all your cards perfectly, you cannot have a bad day, you cannot fail, all people seem to care nowadays are first impressions, one slip and that's it, you are off. What's even worse, people seem to blame you for not being ""interesting enough"", ""lack of chemistry"", etc.

However, every time that the topic comes up when someone else talks to her about it, or even something is said that relates to her being Asexual it puts me in a nervous funk. I don't feel like talking to anyone, I distance myself from everyone, my anxiety goes through the roof, and I get a little sad all at the same time. 

I am concerned that it becomes a problem later on in our relationship (she is sexually repulsed), and while we are both young (16M and 16F) hence me saying later in our relationship, I am concerned that me being heavily sexually attracted, and her being complete opposite will divide us. I cannot keep having these 'funks' because they fuck with my mental state and get her concerned about me because she has no idea what triggers them, but I don't have the heart to tell her that anything about her sexuality makes me uncomfortable and nervous.

I don't want something as ridiculous as sex being what breaks us up, but I don't see myself as being able to live an Asexual lifestyle and also cannot do open relationships because the thought of that just makes me feel like it would be cheating even if she OK'd it. 

Hoping for some good advice for coping and accepting it instead of having to have an incredibly awkward conversation which may result in breaking us up.

I (23F) met this guy (22M) two months ago at a bar and we instantly hit it off. I mean, you would think we had known each other for years. I got his number and texted him the next day telling him how much fun I had and that we should do it again, he agreed and asked for my snapchat. This was fine, because I honestly just thought we would hook up every now and then, because I wasn't looking for anything serious at the time. A week later after snapchatting every day, he invites me to come meet his friends and sleep over at his apartment. I thought it was a bit weird that I was already meeting his friends, but I thought whatever it'll be a good time. I ended up having so much fun and I loved his friends too. We've been snapchatting ever since and slowly things seemed to have escalated. I did NOT expect this (or want it tbh). We talk nearly 24/7 (mainly on snapchat though, which has obviously turned into a red flag now that I'm actually interested in the guy, but is also not uncommon for people my age unfortunately) and we've learned A LOT about each other. I mean, he offered to edit my resume if I needed (never thought a guy I was casually talking to would be interested in giving me career advice) and has also offered me a ton of advice on some personal issues.

Anyway, we've both been extremely busy between work, vacations, etc. so we didn't see each other again for about 6 weeks until this recent Saturday 8/14. Again, I went bar hopping with him and his friends (the same ones as before) and slept over and we had even more fun this time around. However, I made the mistake of asking his girl friend, who I was really hitting it off with, something along the lines of ""is he a player?"", and to my surprise she told me I was the first girl he's ever brought around their friends of four years (twice, at that) and she thinks he likes me. So then I was thinking, he might actually be one of the guys who isn't trying to play games (like most men my age). He was holding my hand that night and doing all the right things which just convinced me even more that he might be a good guy.

Yet, I completely forgot that there's a good chance this girl is going to tell him what I said which would probably freak him out. Which I think may have happened, because fast forward to today and he has been nothing but dry. He's been answering me once a day until yesterday, and I've been trying to start a conversation like usual and he just sends back selfies with no words. I feel like I'm getting the boot.

I have absolutely no clue what happened other than either a) his girl friend told him what I had said which weirded him out, or b) he's just awkward/scared after seeing me again? I don't know. All I know is I was really under the impression he was \[decently\] mature for a 22 year old and seemed like a really nice, genuine, smart guy. I didn't even want to like anyone because I usually end up getting hurt one way or another but this one snuck up on me and now it looks like I'm just going to be hurt again.

So I guess my question is, can anyone tell me what happened? It's not like I expected to be dating this guy, but the change in energy was really sudden and I feel like the longer I entertain the lack of conversation the more self-respect I'm losing. I also know the guy has a lot going on in his life right now and I don't want to take anything personally that might not be personal. (But I think it is.)

I honestly feel stupid for even posting this or being in such a circumstance, but I'm hoping to get some insight into the situation.
