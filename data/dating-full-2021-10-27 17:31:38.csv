Honestly I’m (26F) so frequently frustrated by dating, I often wonder if I just prefer being single. 

I don’t ever want kids and I’m pretty independent. Not looking to be attached at the hip to someone but happy to meet up a few times a week in early dating. I like to go off and do my own thing- solo travel abroad, hit the climbing gym by myself. I’m very blunt and upfront about these things, but I often run into this issue…

Fellow ladies (or men) who are upfront about what they are looking for, how do you avoid men who lie and say they are cool with it but are actually just biding their time because “oh, she’ll change her mind once I get her to like me…”

The last three guys I’ve broken it off with had this mindset for some reason and it drives me crazy. 

I don’t understand it all…are they that desperate for a relationship that they would straight up lie and say that they agree when they don’t? Why would you bother dating a girl who explicitly told you that she wants something other than what you do?

Some friends mention asking for answers without revealing your mindset so that they cannot tailor it to what you want to hear. But honestly that seems like an aggressive job interview style approach?

This guy and I were talking for a few weeks prior to our first date just last week and then second this weekend. They’re in the navy doing logistics and recently was told he will be deployed in a few months.

Not to sound smug but he was pretty obsessive. Texted all day throughout the day, was eager to make plans and want to see me, talked about what would happen when he deployed and just very flattering. I know there’s the stereotype with military personnel about moving quickly but he wasn’t in a rush, rather very “all over me.” I just thought if I get to know him and things go well we will see what happens. 

Randomly from the weekend a switch went off - I was unsure when I would see him next and he wasn’t seemingly making effort into fitting me in. I understand the dudes busy but I also have a life and am extremely busy but with dating that’s just what you do - make time. 

The sudden change in tone made me text him what the deal was and if he actually wanted to continue dating. He basically said at first he was and the more it’s talked about he realized he didn’t have the ability to balance everything like he thought so we agreed to just cut it loose.

There was no argument or effort to keep things which is ironic because a few days earlier he was all over me.

Everyone tells me the clique dating advice and I get it but it’s mentally draining. I’m trying not to let this bother me as I know I’ll get over it but it left me thinking “even this navy dude isn’t willing to compromise so why should I”

Eventually, I ended up developing this huge crush on him based on the stuff he posted and his musical taste, as well as the short interactions we had.

I talk to a lot of guys, sometimes I have hour-long conversations and I don't feel what I felt with this guy.  For a long time, I tried rationalizing my feelings because we didn't talk much, but I always had the feeling he liked me back. 

I asked him out three times, and the first time he said he would take me to his friend's house so we could drink and watch tv there, but his friend was hitting on me very often thru my DMS and I wasn't interested in his friend at all. I thought it would be awkward and I didn't know how to say that so a few days went by and I asked him out again and this time he was acting all weird saying he didn't know if he could go or not. Eventually, we set a date and I even made sure to call it a DATE so he knew I wasn't just asking to hang out with him as friends. The day before he cancelled and tries to sound apologetic, but I could tell he was coming up with so many excuses that the truth was probably something else. 

I couldn't stop thinking about him because even though he cancelled on me, he still kept watching my stories and I felt sometimes like he posted songs that had to do with our situation. Since we always tend to think people we like are posting stuff for us, I ignored most of it. Eventually, things started becoming clearer and now I think that the reason why he is so difficult to approach isn't that he doesn't like me, but because he has HIGH levels of anxiety. 

In fact, I sort of think he's been liking me for way longer than I have been liking him and he's been paying attention to all my posts and has a better idea of who I am than I have of who he is. I found that out after he intrigued me and I decided to do some research on him (not stalking!).

I noticed that every time I talk to him, he takes a long time to respond, and I don't want to just freak him out all the time and make him have panic attacks, but I'm also a super intense person and I'm liking him a lot. I just wanna send him memes, and multiple audio messages and talk to him over videochat, but I feel like everything is a HUGE step for him. 

There's also the fact that he mentioned he was in a 3 year-long relationship that ended badly. The relationship ended in mid-2020, but apparently, it was really tough on him cause he seemed to have given his all to her and he was left pretty broken. The last time someone broke my heart was three years ago, not only a year ago, so I understand how this is also very recent for him. I feel like he is always holding back on what he's gonna say to me because he likes me a lot but can't give me his trust. 

Now, don't get me wrong I'm usually very humble, but I have a LOT of options, just that for some reason I have a feeling he's a really good guy and there's just this cloud of paranoia and anxiety preventing us from getting closer.

I don't mind taking things slow. I'm not even into relationship labels. I just want to get closer to him and I don't know how anymore at this point. I know he has to deal with his shit on his own, but I also have a lot of shit to deal with that I felt he was understanding about, including my anxiety too. I tend to be pretty understanding when it comes to that but this entire situation is making me anxious too! I'm ready and I don't think that he is. Now my question is: do you think it's possible for someone to get over their anxiety of spending time with another person they've been liking for some time? How could I act in a way that is conscious of his situation but also try to show him that he can trust me and he can be vulnerable around me without having to prove myself or put myself down? I know I'm confident and I can be pretty intimidating sometimes, but I'm also anxious when I like someone. Because I think he's worth it but I don't have THAT much to go on and I never chased anyone in my life. I only tried this hard with him cause he gave me mixed signals and I had a feeling it was anxiety from the start, but now I'm REALLY liking him and this whole situation is hard to interpret if it's just the beginning or if it's gonna be the usual dynamics if we're ever in a relationship.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1101694,public,self,tips on approaching an anxious guy as a confident girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qh267r/tips_on_approaching_an_anxious_guy_as_a_confident/,all_ads,6,,,

The title says it all. I’ve (20F) been seeing a guy (23M) for the past month and a half -ish who told me he loved me last night, however, he has never given me a physical compliment. He compliments my intelligence and personality…just never anything physical, even when I try to dress up. I’m in England from the US getting a masters degree, and typically attributed the lack of compliments to British stoicism. He enjoys seeing me every day, and he’s never had a real girlfriend before (he spent his formative years in boarding school…). We haven’t put any labels on our relationship and have gone only as far as holding hands and kisses on the cheek (it took him awhile to try to hold my hand).

I’ve been feeling really low on my self esteem and don’t really know how to handle all of this. My concerns are:
- he doesn’t actually love me? Maybe he’s just lonely, but doesn’t love me because it’s been so soon. I have considered that maybe I’m viewing this from a more experienced lens than him.
- maybe he has no idea what he is doing with women…
- maybe he is not into women at all…? (Not to speculate…)
- maybe he just doesn’t find me attractive?…I am definitely not a model but I don’t think I’m bad looking…

I don’t really know where I should go from here.

I basically was at his house more than my hotel. 
(Im.gonna skip details because I can talk about that moment and this would turn into a love novel)

So fast forward it was time for me to leave .y contract was up, even tho my job asked me to stay another month. I said yes, but had to change my mind because family issues back at home 3000 moles across the country. I had to take custody of my niece who was gonna go into foster care. (I couldn't live with myself if that happen even if I possibly met the love of my life)

So I left, we tried to keep in contact but he was so emotional and sad that he said he couldn't do the long distance thing, he couldn't bare not physically being around me and it hurt to see me on video chat and he can't hug me and so on. So we decided to end it. 

Months later he contacted me saying, I haven't stopped thinking of you and I let An amazing women go and guys when he said that I kid you not that previous night I cried myself to sleep missing that man. And when I received that text I was so happy.

We decided that we owe it to each other to see one another again. 2 weeks later he bought his ticket He flew here 14 hours and 2 flights later he arrived! We had a very good time! I fell for him all over again despite I had some things going in my life. That drew my attention from him, but it was amazing. 

Long story short he stayed 4 days. We now text and call each other. Always saying how badly we miss each other, and how we want to be in each other's arms. Just today I woke up to him saying he wish he could hug me right now, and right before that text arrived I was looking at the pictures we took when he easily here. So I know I should ask him hey what are we doing here? But I have we sort of talked about it, but we really didn't get anywhere.

I’ve never dated without a car but it would be really nice to clear that debt - making things more affordable.

But I’m done with this dating shit. I’ve loved one hell of a life so far, and I know that right now it’s 100% best for me to call it wraps on dating. My first ltr was a healthy relationship and started about 7th grade year and ended my sophomore year of high school. It ended on good terms and her and I are still good friends, everynow and then we still hook up when she’s single, but we don’t let it get further than that.

After that relationship ended I had met another person who I thought would be my next ltr. She was a nice girl, was focused on school, did things nice with a very freaky side. However she wanted to hold off on sex till our 1 year so that our first time was a special one. I said cool, I was really into this girl and sex wasn’t a deal breaker for me. Fast forward about a month or two before our 1 year she gets cold and distant. I end up finding out that she cheated on me because we weren’t having sex. Keep in mind the times that would get steamy and I would try to initiate she would stop me and I would stop when I caught that hint. I’m not gonna force myself onto someone either that’s fuck shit and anyone who does that deserves to rot in hell. Anyway I dump her and she completely melts down starting by being angry at me then begging me to take her back. I blocked her on everything and she still tries to talk to me she even pulled up to my old job at a mall near me and tried to talk to me. I told her that I was doing just fine without her and that I never needed her in my life again. Mean I know but I don’t give a fuck anymore. 

After that relationship I started talking to another girl and long story short she strung me along so she would have a good image for her family. Fuck her too. 

Now it’s present day after high school attempts have been a Complete shit show, the first girl ghosted me cause I wasn’t in college and instead am working in a tattoo shop. Girl 2 I was dating for a couple months and she cheated on me too. The most recent one girl 3 tried to set me up and get me jumped. I got away but like dude fuck this dating shit. I don’t care anymore as much as it feels good to have a companion with you, I’ll be better off just having hookups for now. Like I said I know I’m only 19 but with the experiences I’ve had can you blame me?

How can I go about this without seeming like a social pariah to people?

This occurred during my school break, and as such, my friend was away in Spain. She and my girl are aware of each other, and they seem to get along quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently she just came back and became aware of the new relationship, and at first, she seemed happy about it. However, recently I've noticed that she has been a lot more intimate with me. She's getting close to me when we're sitting and she's a lot more touchy than she used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple of days ago, I asked her for some relationship advice given that most of the time I was with a girl it was always on some casual ""just smashing"" vibe. However just after she seemed to get kinda quiet and played a song whose lyrics amounted to ""I like you"". It's a phrase that's repeated in the song often. I'm a bit of a music buff in the sense that I notice what people play, and this is something she hasn't played ever before.

It's an entirely different vibe.

Im 25M, she is 32F, Will summarize my situation

* 1st Meeting/Instant Date: Met her outside a bar, good conversation happened, we drank together, i tried to spice things up saying she has a kissable face, she replied that she goes further only if there is a romantic chemistry, kinda not into hookups, had good conversation later, she asked for my number, i gave her. we called it a night and went to our respective homes.
* 2nd date: she texted me she owes me a drink , sets a date on weekend, I was like 'Yeah, lets meet', she rescheduled to next week, i was like cool you let me know when things have settled a bit, she texts me again later to meet on next weekend, im happy, we met at a game arcade/bar, played some games, had a lot of awkward silence, but we also discussed about meeting for a next date.

After the 2nd date, i texted her she looked cute, she texts me back saying i look very handsome myself.

* 3rd date: I scheduled this date, it was cloudy and might rain, so there was a chance of rain, i picked her up, we drove around the city, walked around the river, eat at a restaurant, this time the conversation was good, no awkwardness, we discussed about meeting for next date. i drove her back, she asked me to come inside her home and wanted to teach me a board game, introduced me to her roommates, nice people. Me and her played the game, she looked sleepy/tired at 9pm(she sleeps early). i said we should call it a day, i left , she came to drop me till my car. asks me to text when i reach home. she was about to go, i hold her hand again and say that ""i really like spending time with you"" she replies ""Yea, same here xxx, you're a nice/great guy""

after the 3rd date i text her i reached home and liked spending time with her, she says the same and says she enjoys my company.

How do i escalate and establish a relationship with this woman,i dunno physical escalation, but we do hug everytime we meet and part after every date.

im scared that if i dont escalate things, i might turn this relationship into platonic instead of a romantic one, but i don't wanna come off as too strong. i have a feeling that she is really mature and knows the dating game really well, im a noob when it comes to dating.

We’ve know each other for about 2 weeks now. Non stop talking and we’ve been enjoying each other’s company. We’ve gone on one date and we hooked up on the night after our date. And she’s extremely open with me. She has some previous trauma and has been dealing with some eating disorder issues. Well she was over last night and we were watching gravity falls. Mom texted me saying dinner was ready and Ash wasn’t really hungry. I told my mom that she wasn’t hungry and mention that was dealing with a eating disorder. (Which Ash is actively working on)

Me and my mom talked this morning saying that she doesn’t seem to have a very healthy mental state unlike me.
(Which I honestly don’t think I do. I have ADHD and dysthymia) which brings up even more questions. But my mom stated with my previous relationships I’ve always have had to pick up my partners slack with their mental instability.
Which I don’t really mind but I know it’s not healthy. And I’ve started to realize how close (romantically ) I’ve gotten to this girl in the matter of 2 weeks. I’m not used to it and honestly it’s kinda scaring me.

Is this normal should I be taking it slower. Should I have taken the time to get to know her rather than just putting all of my cards on the table?

I’ve already talked to the girl about my fears a bit and I don’t know how well she’s taken it yet.

I think I like him. And I feel kind of guilty because I’ve just broken up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. I don’t think I would pursue anything at the moment, as I’m still struggling with my mental health a bit and I think I need to be single for a while. I also don’t think he likes me back, and I’m sure it’s just a crush that’ll fade away.

And lately i've been wondering if she's also interested in me, she's very playful, we talk freely about sex and we sometimes make jokes or allusions, she let me massage her when she's in pain... i notice that sometimes she can stare at me, wether i'm looking at her or not, i'm always making her laugh ect... and one thing that got my interest was when she told me that she's maybe seeing a men, when i ask her who he was she told me she'll talk about it later. 

The next morning, we were talking and i asked ""so who's that guy you talked about ?"" And she said ""nothing, i just wanted to see your reaction"". I really don't know what to think about this, is she trying to see my reaction as if i would be jealous or she's just playing ?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Florida. I have been trying to change the status quo, but everything seems simple. In some uncertain times, I became very bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About me-I am an independent woman. I have a failed marriage and I always believe that people who like to gamble must not have a unique love. My predecessor was a gambler, and he lost everything in just a few months. I think this is very sad. What I want to accompany him now is a cold prison bed. So I dislike gambling. After the divorce, I moved to this legendary city. I have my own business and my own unique and clean friends. I usually like sports. Travel, golf, swimming, reading, food and shopping, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have no feelings in life, but to be honest, my recent work and life are a bit bad for me, so I am looking for someone. I am an optimist, but because I passed and let myself not relax, I want to change myself and hope to contact some friends. I live in St. Louis because I can’t meet my friends. I hope I can meet more friends in the United States or Canada. After the epidemic, we can eat something meaningful. I am 35 years old. I believe that many people will mature and experience this era. Due to my work, if I haven't recovered for a long time, please forgive me, it doesn't mean that I don't want to talk, it's just for me. Say that my job is everything to me at the moment. However, I will try my best to maintain the dialogue.

Okay, so I’m in a different state for work, I’ve been working out, working on myself, wasn’t going to the gym looking for a man or anything. For about 2.5 weeks there was this guy who I’d see about every morning at the gym since we both workout from 2:30a - 5a. I’d see him but I didn’t really care much until one day we made eye contact and he smiled. 
After that I started noticing him more and then every time he’d walk past me I’d look over at him and we’d smile. We eventually started saying hello or good morning!

So last Wednesday, we were leaving the gym, he held the door open for me, and I asked him his name, he told me his, I told him mine, and then he was like “it’s nice to meet you.”

I went back home for the weekend/a SLIPKNOT concert lol and then came back to work on Monday. He was at the gym as usual. I’d also like to note that every time I go to the AB section he’d come in there a few mins later, we’d say hello and smile and that’s it. Id be too shy to say more and didn’t know if he was just shy too.

So Tuesday this week I was getting frustrated. I assumed he was interested but was too shy to say anything since I could be intimidating and hard to read like most people in the gym I guess. But I decided to just suck it up and as I was leaving so was he. Like I don’t know if we were just leaving at the same time or if he was making himself available for me to talk to him? But anyways I was like “hey!” And he said hey and I asked him how he was, and he told me, then he asked how I was and I told him and we had a playful conversation and talked about what we did for work etc. so then I was just like “well I want to give you my number if you want it and want to text sometime.“ And he was like “yeah of course” he seemed shocked but enthusiastic. He seemed kind of nervous when trying to store my number pressing the wrong buttons because his phone is kind of old and not really calibrated very well but once I gave him my number he said he texted me but I never received the text so I was like well I can take your number since you’re having trouble and he was like “ yes that would be even better.” And then he gave me his number and I called it so he had mine and it rang on his phone so I know it was the right number. it seemed like a good conversation, seemed normal it wasn’t awkward and I said thank you and he said goodbye. It sounds awkward when typing it but I promise everything seemed very nice he was really easy to talk to you and I thought We left on a good note.

So 12 hours go by and he didn’t text me so I just decided to text him “hi!” …

No response.

At the gym this morning he wasn’t there. He’s been to the gym every single day Monday through Friday consistently up until We exchanged numbers… still no response to the text either and now I’m wondering if he changed gyms just to avoid me….

Idk know. I seriously did nothing wrong. I’m 28 and he’s 35 so that behavior is so weird coming from a grown man… like why give me your number if you’re not interested? I’m not a baby so I can handle the truth upfront… it’s the lies or ghosting that hurts.. 

I don’t know how to feel at this point because I was working on my confidence and I have never approached a man in my life before. I’m used to them approaching me but I figured I’d just grab the situation by the horns this time.
But man, I’ll tell you that men really know how to ruin a woman’s confidence.

I feel like by 20 most people have had some experience with the opposite sex. Maybe they flirted a little or someone had a crush on them, most people have already had a relationship in their late teens and I just haven’t. 

I thought it’d be easier out of high school but it’s so much harder. I thought that because there were so many girls, at least one would be in to me but no. 

I’m at a point where it’s hard to maintain hope that it’ll work out for me. I feel like my confidence also suffers. Like when I’m using dating apps it feels like I’m just wasting my time because I know I’m bot going to get a match and I don’t have anywhere near the face or confidence to just go up go a random girl and start talking to her.

I’m 19 and never done drugs or gotten drunk before. I’ve never kissed a girl or held hands either. Feeling this way has made me feel sad and a bit bad about myself. Sometimes I feel like it never happen.

Me (18m) and my girlfriend (20f) had a discussion last night about our relationship and our boundaries and I don’t know if I can trust her. We see each other everyday and really enjoy each other. We’ve been dating for about a month and I’m catching red flags that I don’t know if I should ignore. Everything about her is great except my trust in her. I’m going to tell 100% of the truth about our feelings and what’s happened and I’m not going to be biased. I’m dating to marry not just to screw around. All I say is that you read everything.

Reasons why I like her/ am dating her:

1. She has high interest in me. She doesn’t act funny, she buys me gifts a lot, she texts back fast, she’s always eager to hang, always down for sex, she lists me on social media, and she genuinely cares about me. I never have to over pursue her and she pursues me a lot. She pays for dates sometimes and her gifts are really thoughtful. The relationship is 60/40 and she does most of the pursuing.

2. We have the same interests/ values . We’re both really fit and workout all the time, we both really love basketball, we’re both family oriented, she wants to be a house wife in marriage and I want to be a breadwinner, we listen to the same music and she’s really just the female version of myself.

3. We’re really affectionate/ connect well. We hang out everyday. We always cuddle, we have a good sex life having sex 3-5 times a week. She always kisses me, shows me affection in public, we play fight, can talk all day and get along well. She’s feisty and I love that. We just really connect well and always miss each other.

4. She’s good looking as hell.

5. Her family/ friends are cool and they respect me. They’ve taken me out to eat, her mom and dad are so nice, they always insist to do stuff for me and are really respectful. I’ve had long conversations with her parents. Her brothers are respectful and older than us.

Red flags:

1. She plays basketball with a lot of guys. I may seem insecure for this and I’ve talked to her about this but she plays basketball in a gym with all guys and she’s the only girl. I’ve played at her gym before and she had fun but the guys were kinda flirty (but not too flirty to where they were out of line). It seemed like they were more friendly than flirty. Normally a girl playing basketball with all guys is a deal breaker but this girl played in high school, keeps up with basketball, has tons of posters of players in her room and LIVES basketball. She always talks about basketball and loves the sport, we went to an NBA game and she knows and likes basketball more than a lot of girls I’ve seen.

2. She has a lot of drama. She’s afraid to take me to a party because guys will get jealous and be messy. A guy has game to her house with a gun because he was jealous of our relationship but luckily she has 3 older brothers who told that guy off. She posted a tiktok of us and I saw a few guys commenting about our relationship and I told we her I didn’t like that and she said she blocked the guys she used to talk to before me but idk if it’s true. When we were at the gym she told me she saw a guy she used to talk to there and he disliked her because she left him and alot of other guys she was dating for me.

3. She’s told me about how she’s been done wrong in the past and how’s she’s done guys wrong in the past. She told me how she’s cheated by twerking on another dude at a party. How are ex cheated on her and she cheated on him back with his friend. She sounded like she regretted it and she told me she’s changed but that stuff happened when she was in high school. She’s told me a lot that she’s afraid that I’ll cheat and that she’s dropped all the guys she was dating for me. I want to check her phone but I don’t at the same time because it’s kinda immature.

4 her tiktoks are kinda sexual. She doesn’t exploit her body which I’m happy about but somethings she says kinda catches my attention. Some were goofy but some talked about sex and “sneaky links”. She said her body count is 5 including me but I hope she’s telling the truth.

*special notes

We both came to agreement that we don’t fully trust each other.

We’re on good terms and aren’t mad at each other about this. Our talk last night made me feel more comfortable with her but I wanted to ask about this on Reddit to fully make sure.

My best-friend has been my best friend for about three years. Every time I have asked her to come to my house there has always been an excuse. She has been to my house maybe three times this year. Over the year and a half of my boyfriend and I being together he has noticed and heard many times about how she has brought me down. I love them both dearly but recently I asked her to come over with her boyfriend to celebrate Halloween. This is the first year I am living in a neighborhood that does trick or treating and I am so excited. To what i thought would be a simple yes or no answer became two days worth of nothing but drama. I kept bringing it up to her and she kept telling me to tell my boyfriend to invite her boyfriend. She was scared that her boyfriend would immediately shut the thought down and thought that if my boyfriend asked him he would at least think about it. I thought this idea was just outright dumb but I went with it. Since then her and her boyfriend have been talking poorly about my boyfriend and I’s relationship and she has been openly sharing these conversations with me over the phone. I do not talk bad about my boyfriend to her and obviously expect the same of her… This has been about two days now of hearing their thoughts on whether we will actually get married, what he doesn’t do for me, etc. Basically down talking him to me for two days now. She called me again today to continue their shared thoughts on us and I did not stick up for us or really say anything at all. Once i got home I couldn’t shake it any longer and got so overwhelmed that i started crying because the trash wasn’t taken out. I ended up calling my boyfriend and sharing everything that i have been through the past couple of days with him. He of course becomes livid and I now feel like I have made the wrong decision and don’t know how to get myself out of this hole. He began telling me how fake she has been to me and that I need to text her that we are no longer friends. He feels so strongly about this that he said that he would text my best-friend’s boyfriend himself if i did not speak up for myself. I understand how my boyfriend feels and  agree with him for the most part.  Other than the fact of texting her about everything and completely cutting her off. I honestly feel like I don’t want either one of them to be a part of my life after all of this drama.  My boyfriend and I will be continuing this conversation when he gets home from work in the morning. I do not feel as though I should cut my best-friend off completely or be so harsh to her. I wish I would’ve  just stuck up for us and shit the down talking up the first moment it started. I honestly don’t know why I didn’t.  Am I wrong for sharing all of the with my boyfriend? I’m at a lost of what I need to do when he gets here. I am thinking about saying that I am not texting her what he wants and I will tell her what I think is best.
