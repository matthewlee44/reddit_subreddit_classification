I plan on doing both at the same time because, I want to get fit/learn a martial art and I want to find a partner. As the title of the question implies, I have a bit of a height preference. I care more about how strong a woman is (I'll get more into that later), but height-wise, the taller she is, the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, my lower limit is 5'0, and even then, that might be a little too short for me. My upper limit is 6'4, because that and higher is also pushing it a little. But like I said, what's more important in a woman for me is strength. By that, I mean her physical strength, toughness, athleticism, muscles, fighting ability, et cetera. Essentially, I agree with Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bepop when he said: *""I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I'm asking this question is because of my height. At 5'6/167 cm, I'm short for a man. While I am mostly secure about it, I am worried about how this will affect my dating prospects. A lot of women prefer taller men because those men make them feel more feminine and protected. And I'm worried that my height preference--""***the taller, the better***""--may make my chances of finding someone smaller. To reiterate, I care more about how strong and tough she is, but I'd rather not be totally restricted to women who are petite. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I know that height is not the be-all end-all for male attractiveness, but being short does put me at a disadvantage.

I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and only a handful of dates over the past few years. In 2019 I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. A few months ago I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking.

Most of these guys I end up cutting loose once that effort drops, because I have certain expectations when dating. I have these expectations regardless if there is commitment or not. 

Ive been seeing this guy and first couple dates were great! He took me to a free art museum once, then we went thrifting and got lunch. Super fun and he paid for the lunch on that second date and our uber and then dinner later. Those dates he always asked me the day before. 

Well a couple days ago... at 10pm he asks me if Im open to grabbing a drink. I say sure. We go to a bar thats walking distance from his place (he doesnt have a car). We get to the bar and he goes ""I drank at dinner so I wont be getting anything, but you can grab a drink"" I go get a drink and he doesnt pay for it. We then chat for a couple hours... We head back to his place, chat for 3 hours more and then I spent the night (no sex) just cuddling. And then I drove home the next day.

Today I logged back on Tinder only to see that she unmatched with me. I did not think of it much because it once happened again where for some reason the match dissapeared and re appeared a few days later, only for today being different. I decided to open my discovery on Tinder and long behold the first profile that popped up was her's. Maybe she deleted her profile and made a new one but I am not sure yet. We also talk on messenger but still hasnt replied to my text yet despite being active. I am not giving up yet and will give a week or two maybe she replies. 

What I find strange is that we were planning to go out next weekend so that is why I am finding it odd that she unmatched/re-creted her profile.

Many of the people with grew up with knew she had this crush and pretty sure he did too. However, he(26M) never showed romantic interest. I (26F) would on rare occasions have small chit chat with him, never felt anything but brotherly love for him. 

Once we went to college many of us went our separate ways. Moved to different states, started careers, yah know adult stuff.

Fast forward to 2022. I created new IG and I get a follow request from my friend’s crush. I can’t say old crush because she still has these feelings for him years later. I should add that she is also best friends with her crush’s sister. This is important because they all occasionally all hang out. I haven’t spoken to him since 2015 when I moved out my home town. We sparked a conversation after realizing we play the same instrument. It’s been very casual messaging. 

Of course because this is my best friend I let her know. And she was fine! Didn’t make any remark, she expressed how she wanted to move on from this childhood crush.

Now, I get a missed call from this gentleman. I call back…And he wanted to take me to lunch since he was in town. I agreed but I’m nervous to tell my best friend. I understand that this doesn’t mean much and I’m not trying to read into it... but I mean he is taking the time out to take me out. I understand that they have never been in a relationship but it feels like I’m going out with her ex or something.

I kind of tell her everything. I don’t want to unintentionally hurt her by not saying anything… then it seems like I’m hiding something. But then canceling the outing because my friend still crushes on him seems very teenager like.

Might I also add— he has grown up to be a fine, handsome gentleman. I mean I haven’t seen him since we were in our late teens. In addition, he has other qualities that are admirable.

Before she moved to another machine she told me where she works, without me asking the question. I also caught her looking at me briefly before she left the gym. 

I'm sceptical because she didnt smiled for a bit. I saw her the next day, we just said hi to each other but I had an impression that she was avoiding eye contact for the whole session.

Probably because I am that way a bit myself. I consider myself somewhat eccentric or out of the social norm. I'm not into shallow connections and I crave intimacy but not just the physical kind. I enjoy intellectual stimulation and I would I guess refer to myself as somewhat of a sapiosexual. i also like men who are a bit on the sensitive side or have a soft side to them.

I draw in these type of dudes but they also tend to come with issues whether that's heartbreak, childhood trauma, abandonment, or they're just a straight up azzhole. The problem that I'm trying to correct is how I am with my trauma/abandonment issues. I'm actively trying to work on being better for myself and a future partner.

I met a guy and things were looking great. He seemed relatively normal then he told me he was sexually abused when he was younger. Ok, no judgment. I was compassionate, but now the communication is odd and he seems to be behaving weird online. I'm giving my distance and letting him work out his own issues. 

He seems to be acting fickle now but he closely watches what I do online. The old me would rush in and try to save or fix him but this has always backfired and it's not my job to save anyone. But it just gets me down because every time I think I've met someone where it could actually lead to something real...maybe the potential is there, I realize they're riddled with issues and are in a healing process. Also, I am not a rebound nor do I come off that way yet I meet so many men who are straight out of a relationship and its really upsetting that they know I'm looking for something legit meanwhile they're just trying to cope.

I (29m) went out on a first date with (32f) a week Friday. It went really well. Conversation flowed, chemistry clicked. I had a great time and was really looking forward to a second date.

The next morning, Saturday, I woke up in extreme pain. Could barely move. Vomited from it. Went to the ER and it turns out that my appendix had become infected and was hours away from rupturing. So I ended up having to have an emergency appendectomy that night and I’ve been recovering ever since (it has been just over a week since the surgery). 

I let my date know what was going on and to my surprise she was really kind and supportive about everything. In fact, she asked if we could go on a second date before I could ask her. 

With that being said, I’ve been recovering for a week and haven’t seen her since my appendectomy. My doctor said it’ll take 3-4 weeks to fully recover and I’m only a week post surgery. 

I’m not sure when I should have a second date with this woman. I don’t want her to feel like I’m putting her off but I’m also still recovering from this surgery. Luckily appendectomies have a quick recovery time compared to other surgeries but the timing of this couldn’t be worse. 

My energy levels have been a bit of a roller coaster. Some days I’ve been feeling great while others I’ve been sluggish/tired, so it’s hard to make plans. My doctor said this was normal in the first 10 days after surgery. 

Given the nature of my emergency surgery, is two weeks between dates acceptable? Obviously this was out of my control. And does anybody have any tips about a delayed second date where it won’t feel like a first date remake?

They have been together for years, spend a lot of time together, talk on different topics ... But in fact, you want more: make her your girlfriend. But this topic for such a guy-friend is a taboo. He drives away any thoughts in this vein, because he is afraid to destroy that connection with the girl that has already been established. And there is a reason for this. But there is also a limitation.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this article is for a guy friend who wants to get even closer to a girl. Our goal is to pull back the curtain of fears and insecurities. Get out of this two-fold situation, discard the role of a person who seems to be close, but too accessible. Did you recognize yourself in the description? Accept the following fact: despite all your communication, among other contenders for the role of this girl's boyfriend, you are the furthest from the goal.

&amp;#x200B;

The first and most important thing is to get out of the image of a friend. A person who constantly hides his emotions is pinched. Who tensely ""holds his face"": like, the current communication with a girl-girlfriend is enough for him. This is a false mask that prevents you from expressing desires and acting. The girl gets used to this mask and becomes more and more attached to you ... only as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

No need to sharply confess your feelings and climb to the girl with kisses. We need to rebrand, in short, change the image. You must become more serious and courageous. So that she feels: you are not just a guy with whom you can chat about anything and laugh until you drop, but a man who attracts girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Your behavior should say: you have a masculine principle, that very core. If you just rode a skateboard, focus on sports. Improve both appearance and well-being. A fit, physically developed man is attractive to a girl on a subconscious level. Did you go to the cinema? Switch to exhibitions and museums. This is you too, but more serious and interesting. Girls are drawn to what they don't know, that other world where a guy can take them. But in friendly light relationships, guys often do not show this world to a girl. They are shy, and in response to questions, they give the girl only the information that, as they think, will not scare her away.

&amp;#x200B;

But now everything is different. The girl calls and calls to drink beer on a bench. You refuse, but not dryly, but in an enthusiastic voice. Today it is more interesting for you to go to the exhibition, to learn something, and not to kill time in vain.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have done favors for her in the past, carefully end this charity under the right pretext. Let's say you pick up her nephew from kindergarten on Wednesdays, but you can't do it anymore. You have a swimming pool and a gym. (According to the real plan, you really went in for sports!). A woman often exploits a male friend on his own initiative. Because he has nothing better to offer. But now you will have an alternative, how to please a girl. And in order to understand what exactly and how to offer her, you will have to study books on psychology, undergo trainings, hone your skills in communicating with other girls - you can’t do without it.

&amp;#x200B;

Make more friends and girlfriends - bright, interesting, such that these acquaintances can brag about among other things. So the desired girl will appreciate you more. It is useful to have a couple of really beautiful girlfriends, even if they are not very attractive to you, but the men around you like them. With them, if it doesn’t work out differently, it’s just possible to establish mutually beneficial friendship, according to the principle “you - to me, I - to you”. Having caused a slight jealousy of a girl-girlfriend (because of which all this was started), you will instill in her the same love feeling that you wanted to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

After all this, the girl will be drawn to you like a magnet: it turns out that you are new and interesting. And she thought she knew everything about you! Your image will sparkle with new colors and will fit much better into the scenario of a love relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again: there is no need to abruptly cut off past communication, forgetting all the joint jokes, jokes, hobbies. Avoid extremes. Smoothly and beautifully present yourself in a new role, the role of her future boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

The results will surprise you. The girl will not be able to communicate with you so easily, but she will only be pulled harder. Moreover, the quality of your communication will improve, because now you will open to her an unfamiliar, interesting and exciting world. When you notice changes - do not miss the moment. And for this, learn our recommendations on other topics, deepen your knowledge. And don't be shy about making your future girlfriend happy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162592,public,self,How do you go from a girl's friend to her boyfriend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t3urml/how_do_you_go_from_a_girls_friend_to_her_boyfriend/,no_ads,0,,,,,

My last relationship ended almost a year ago, I took some time just for myself before starting going into the dating scene. Especially since there were a lot of internal things I needed to iron about what love should be like for me. 

I went out with this guy from an app and so far we’ve been on two dates. He’s fairly attractive and after seeing his photos, my sisters commented that he is one of the best looking dudes I’ve gone out with this far. 

However, on the first date I felt like something was a bit off. Not that he displayed any overt red flags, I just didn’t feel attracted to him like I have in the past with other men when they did the same actions as he did on a fist date. 

First of all, I feel like he interrupted me a bit, but I chalked it up to my ADHD/ first date nerves. Then he called me hot, which isn’t a bad thing, I’m just not used to it coming from a person that I just met with no prior comfortability. And at the end of the date as I was leaving he said that he was hoping he could kiss me since he’s been meaning to all night ( which again isn’t bad, but I am the type of person that does not form sexual chemistry that quickly with a person that I just met). I thought why not because we sat for 2.5 hours and the convo was good so I thought why not test the chemistry by kissing him. When I kissed him, I didn’t enjoy it and he started with tongue right away (although not too heavy but still). 

When I usually kiss a guy for the first time, I have this feeling of exhilaration but it wasn’t there. I still told myself to be patient because it was just the first meeting. When the second date occurred he continued to compliment on how hot I looked was despite spending 5 hrs at a museum where I said many interesting things that he could have complimented. He also told me I was hot in response to me sharing a story where I was bullied in elementary school. He said he didn’t understand why I would get picked on since I was super pretty and that they were probably jealous. He still interrupted me a few times which is frustrating because again as an adhd person, I couldn’t finish my train of thought. Then he kissed me in the car when we’re done that took me by surprise because it came out of nowhere and he followed up with him saying that he has been wanting to do that for awhile. I tried to non verbally cue him on how I want to be kissed but he was just doing his own thing (could be lack of experience but he did say he was in more than 3 relationships) He also isn’t able to intellectual stimulate me or keep up with the conversation.

I can’t tell if I’m being super negative or only focusing on the bad. In the past I’ve been in super intense and passionate relationships that were built on strong emotions. They were also inconsistent. He in contrast is consistent and says what he does/follows up/doesnt play games/ is overt with his feelings and opens doors/ wants and did pay for basically everything (I did offer to help and bought the tickets ), picked me up from my place/ brought me home on time/ kept the kissing at just that and never tried to take it further by keeping his hands in respectful areas. And he wasn’t judgemental and kept an open mind when I was talking about bits of my past. He also was vulnerable about his past relationship errors and his family dynamic. 

I guess i just don’t know what to do. What if I am acting prematurely (because there are good traits) but at the same time I feel like an object of lust sometimes when I’m with him which makes me uncomfortable and not want to spend to much time with him (especially since his eyes dilate like he’s on cocaine). I also don’t understand how someone could feel like that so quickly.

It's been a few days since then and it's been really hard to gauge how she feels. After that date, her texts and replies are talking longer to come through and the content of what she's sending me seems to be a mix of ""I'm interested in still talking/not interested in talking further.""

I didn't get a straight ""I'm not interested anymore"" message from her so I honestly don't know if I am right or wrong.

Anyways he suggested he’ll go get that checked out since he had no idea what’s on his genitals.
Fast forward a few days later I noticed something on my lip which made me think about herpes and I super freaked out so I had to ask him , again politely if he ever had any herpes . He said he never had that and again, he suggested he’ll go get a blood test for that.
Two and a half weeks go by and I wondered if he did eventually go get tested and checked by a doctor, so I asked him if he got the chance to get tested, he said not yet ( btw this entire conversation is by text) 
And I had the feeling that he is angry at me for asking , he mentioned that for the warts he needs to go see a doctor and I asked if he’s planning to? 
He then texted saying he does not want to talk about it, and just the way he put it sounded kinda angry.
I feel like I might have been pushy although I tried to be as gentle and not pushy as possible about it.
And yes I would agree this is a personal topic but since we both had sex this also could be affecting me and I believe I should be updated if he does have anything transmissible.
I then apologised for being pushy about it and he just didn’t bother to answer me at all.

I pointed out to him that by his own logic his parents lives are meaningless as they don’t have fabulous jobs, live in a simple house etc and that in my eyes no matter what he makes he will always be poor for only having value in someone’s salary.

Since I already have a Bachelor's Degree, I only need thirty credits for another Bachelor's Degree. We met at my work in early October when she was a customer, and I helped her find something and commented that I also attend her college after seeing her ID on a lanyard she was carrying. She asked me my year and major and I asked her hers, and we asked each other want we want to do with our major. We talked for about ten minutes about a book I am trying to publish, and she asked me to email her an attachment of the manuscript, and gave me her personal email address.

We talked again in passing on campus the next day, and I emailed her it from my personal email address. This is the only time that we used our student email addresses with each other (she never emailed me and I never emailed her any other times). Another time on campus, she said “Hi, friend” and “Bye, honey.”. when we were done talking for three minutes. She said hi to me again at my work. I had been considering asking her out for awhile but was too nervous due to not being completely certain. I think that emailing her to ask her out might be too random and improfessional, but I also do not want to wait too long.

Understandable, but still I expect a reply within two days. I don’t think that’s asking much. He’s been responding when he can, but he’s quite busy with work and he’s at home with his family right now. 

He told me after our last date that he’s very serious about getting to know me and he wants to see me whenever he gets back from visiting his family. He told me he would love to maintain contact while he’s out of town so we don’t lose our connection. He scheduled a time and place for us to meet when he’s back, but that’s all I’ve heard from him since last week. He also finally apologized last night for not replying sooner, but gave a vague reason. He reassured me he still is interested and wants to see me when he gets back, and again confirmed the time and place. 

I asked if he’d wanna talk on the phone sometime instead if that’s easier and he told me he’d love to. He called me earlier after work today (late). He told me he couldn’t talk long and he apologizes “in advance”. 

He filled me in about about some family drama, and then asked me about myself. I started talking about my cat, then work and we talked for a total of maybe three minutes before he cut me off saying his food was ready for takeout at the restaurant he was at but that he would talk to me later. 

Seriously? I asked him if he was going to call back tonight “what time?” because I was going to go to bed soon. He hung up without answering me. I don’t know if he heard my question but I found it a little bit rude. He knew he was going to call me tonight, so I’m not sure why he didn’t just wait until after he ate or finished whatever he was doing. Also I don’t know why he didn’t at least answer my question about when/if he could call back so I’m not waiting around for him. It’s just a little bit confusing because his communication has been really limited and hot and cold and it’s frustrating me. Especially when he has me pinned down to meet him this weekend, AND he was the one that suggests we stay in contact to “not lose the connection”.

I posted about him before. I really like him. We were friends for 7 months and then started dating back in January. He made a joke one time about being boyfriend and girlfriend, but I just brushed it off since we never had the talk.

On Valentine's Day, he said he's nervous to meet my dad because he's never had to meet previous girlfriends' dads before (which is strange because I didn't think he would want to make it to the point where we would introduce each other's family). But I didn't bring up him meeting my family ever.

He asked what my parents were like, and I asked him what his parents were like. We took a lot of pictures together that day and he even bought me flowers, chocolates, and a face mask with flowers on it (which was so cute). We had a lot of fun. We talked to other couples (we were doing a Valentine's Day dinner river cruise), and one couple asked if we were married. I immediately tensed up, got nervous, and shook my head. He (my...exclusive partner) laughed and said ""thank you for asking, though. That means it's going well"". I had no idea what that meant, but I just assume guys' interest in girls wane by the two/three month mark. So I've been keeping my distance romantically to avoid getting hurt, but still being affectionate and flirty in our relationship.

That said...I really \*really\* like him lol. My sister and my brother-in-law are having their vow renewal this coming June with a time period theme. It's a ball of some sort with the ceremony happening first. My other sister is bringing her serious boyfriend of 4 years, and that just leaves me...alone. I've pondered the thought of inviting him because I think it'll be a fun time and I see myself being with him long-term. But I also don't wanna bring it up because I don't wanna push him away. I've been accused of being emotionally unavailable when dating because I have a history of ending things prematurely when I assume guys wouldn't want anything with me. But with him...I'm very serious about him. I would only bring it up to a guy if I felt like I could see myself with them long-term. I definitely see that with him. Lately, he's been initiating all of our dates. Going to the movies, spending time on Valentine's Day, getting lunch together, and he even offered to drive me to the hospital when I was sick with food poisoning. He's told me he told his sister about me and she said I sound great.

I guess what I'm asking is, guys, if you were in an exclusive relationship with a girl, would you be turned off if she invited you to a family event? Or if she even brought it up almost two months into being exclusive? I know people recommend six months before inviting someone to meeting the family. And it's probably not guaranteed he'd been into me by that time.

I’ve confessed to dudes, asked them out, messaged first on dating apps, approached them irl, asked for phone numbers, tried to strike up conversation, etc. but it’s never worked for me really. The farthest I’ve gone is is the “talking stage” where the guy eventually stops responding. 

I get that rejection is a part of dating, but I am wondering what I am doing so wrong that I just…haven’t had any success. I’ve literally lost count of the number of times I have tried. And in some of these cases, the guys have become flat-out rude to me once they got the hint that I wouldn’t mind dating them. Like with one guy, I was once walking behind him into a building while carrying two heavy boxes, and right as I was struggling through the doorway with those boxes, he literally let the door slam into me, causing me to drop everything, and he watched it all happen as he walked away. I just thought it was super…rude on a human level?

I know looks matter a lot for women too, so I do try to present myself as “attractive” as I can (keeping my weight down, doing hair/makeup, etc.). I would like to think I’m at least “average” appearance-wise, and so have been the guys I’ve gone for (based on what my friends tell me when/if I point out who I’m into atm). 

It’s kind of depressing to go on Reddit and read comments about how “flattering it is”, or how a woman making the first move is something that should be done more, etc. But ime, most of the guys I’ve made the first move on have found it very off-putting. And I’m not some weird social pariah either…

It just scares me because I really would love to find someone, and I’ve genuinely been trying for *years* at this point. And I’m not someone who really “attracts” guys either.

When we were teens, I had a huge crush on her, and I'm 95% sure she had one on me at some point too (she cuddled up to me when we were watching a movie, once at a small party we were all sitting around in a circle playing some card game, and she played footsies with me and nobody noticed).

Every time I've hung out with her though, it was through my cousin. The two of them used to be close friends, and the three of us would hang out together. But every time she initiated hanging out, it would be through my cousin, and I'd be invited as a tagalong. We did meet up for coffee a few times at our Uni campus (and I initiated all of them), but aside from that we don't really hang 1 on 1.

A few months ago I text her to wish her a happy birthday and she responds with: ""Thanks! Hey do you want to come over and check out my new apartment someday?"" I replied with ""Sure, we'll have to do that sometime"".

**1. Am I ready for this?**

This may seem simple but the key to a great relationship is knowing oneself. If you feel rushed or pressured in any way, marriage may not be the best idea.

**2. Is my partner ready for this?**

Maybe you have a really good reason to get married. Maybe you just really want to be married. But if your partner seems hesitant, or you feel like you are pressuring them in any way, give it some time. There is no need to rush into this.

**3. Are we doing this for the right reasons?**

There are a lot of really bad reasons to get married. If you are not doing it for yourself, then it is probably not a good enough reason to do it. One important question to ask is if you and your partner have considered signing a prenuptial agreement. Although it may not be the most romantic gesture, a prenup can provide full control and protection of both of your financial situations. Be sure to talk about it with your partner before making a decision.

**4. Can we afford it?**

Are you both financially ready for something like marriage? For some people, this may not be a big issue, but planning a wedding is hard and expensive work. Make sure you and your partner are ready for that.

**5. What would my family/friends think?**

When it comes down to it, this is your decision. But if the people who are closest to you would have a problem with you getting married, that may be something to take into consideration.

**6. Do you want kids?**

Kids are a big factor in long-term relationships. Make sure you and your partner have similar plans. If you do want kids, think about how many you want, where you want to raise them, if you want them to go to church, etc. If you already know where you stand on these things, share them with your partner.

**7. Do you want pets?**

While not quite the same as kids, for some people pets can be a deal-breaker. Keep that in mind.

**8. How long have you known this person?**

The rest of your life is a very long time. Do you know your partner’s quirks and annoying habits? Can you live with them?

**9. Do you trust this person?**

If you feel as though your partner is keeping things from you, you need to confront them before getting married.

**10. What are my future plans?**

Where do you see yourself in five years? In 10 years? Is your partner part of that plan?

**11. What are your partner’s future plans?**

Making sure you have goals that will lead you in the same or similar, directions are important when making a commitment meant to last a lifetime.

**12. Where will you live?**

Combining two lives into one is a complicated business. Have some ideas and/or solutions ready.

**13. Do you and your partner share the same faith?**

Religion can be a very divisive issue, especially if kids become a factor.

**14. Are you ready for drastic changes?**

This could be from losing all of your independence and giving up all of your free time to having to legally change your last name. A service such as EZ Name Change can help but these types of lifestyle changes can be trying.

**15. Are there any medical issues that need to be addressed?**

Some things are on a need to know basis. Marriage is need to know.

**16. Is there anything you have been keeping from your partner?**

Secrets do not bode well for a healthy marriage. If there is something you have been avoiding telling your partner, sharing it before you get married is the only way to go.

**17. Do you know how to take care of yourself?**

If your living space is constantly a disaster or if you without cooking yourself a solid meal, you may want to focus on taking care of yourself before getting married. Marriage is the joining of two lives, and if yours is a mess you don’t need to be forcing that onto someone else.

**18. Do you have strong opinions about the wedding?**

If you’ve made it to this point, this will probably not be a deal breaker. That being said, if you know what you want your wedding to look like, make sure you share that with your partner. Going into a marriage resentful about how the marriage ceremony went down is not a good idea.

**19. When you spend time with your partner, does it leave you drained or recharged?**

You are signing up to spend most of your time with the same person. If you feel drained or exhausted after spending time with your partner, you need to seriously consider whether or not marriage is a good idea.

**20. Do you love them?**

That’s it. The rest of this list you can probably work through. It may be hard, almost impossible, but if you truly love them then everything will work out. Sacrifices may need to be made, on both sides, but marriage is all about love. If you have that, then you can get through the rest.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162608,public,nsfw,20 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Getting Married,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t3zfyu/20_questions_to_ask_yourself_before_getting/,no_ads,0,,,,,

I'm underachieving somewhat in the rest of my life but trying to be better piecemeal over the course of the last year or so and it's going alright. I still live at home, and I think some here might know that can make dating harder as you get older. One unique and specific aspect of it is such a drain on my dating esteem, and that's how excitable my mom seems to get if she can ever find out I'm going to go meet with a girl. She's not stupid, she's figured out somehow the way my dating life has generally been, even though I don't think she knows much about it specifically. She has good intentions, and just desperately for me to find something more serious or at least wholesome but probably both with a girl. She knows I've never had a girlfriend, but she's been able to use deductive reasoning to figure I've had a few fwbs, and she has heard from me about some of the times I've been stood up or ghosted or rejected and stuff. I think she's just kind of a curious mom, who has a natural and reasonable interest in her son's life. I can't be mad at that. I just really hate how she wants to be in the know about these things. It just makes the bad parts waaaay more bad. Because of this, I honestly try to avoid talking to her or having her find out much about my dating life. 

Well, the other day, I tried to be lowkey when a girl I had the best first date ever with came to pick me up for a second date. I have a car btw, I just drove last time and she wanted to drive this time. Well her pulling up in front of our house caused my dog to sprint over to the window and start barking his ass off, and my mom went over and started looking outside. When she saw me come upstairs after cleaning up and putting on a less slouchey outfit than normal, she put her hand on the door and asked me who was outside. I told her it was a gal from a dating app, and she asked what her name was. I told her. She tried asking another question but my dad yelled from the other room for her to just let me go and I left. After the date I snuck her into my room, and I was so into her -- and I'm not gonna lie totally into it -- that I let her give me basically the worst hickies of my life. She felt kinda bad about it but I played it cool, and I was cool, bc I was really happy. She was like the coolest girl I've ever met and spending time with her felt sublime, literally bliss. She ended up leaving at like 4am. I sent her a text saying I had a great time and cant wait to see her again. She sends me one saying she got home safe and she had a great time too. 

The next day, we were having family dinner and the thing my mom wanted to have as topic conversation was the whole date from the evening before. She asked me a line of innocuous but still prying questions, I begrudgingly answered, but she really didn't take notice of how obviously I didn't really want to tell everyone at the table about the girl or the date. Even though as far as I knew, it went well. We had an uncanny amount of things in common, and also some of the better conversations I've had on any dates before. My mom always tries to ask me something to the effect of ""Do you think you could have a future with this person?"", and I told her I hope but I really don't know, it was just a second date. My dad told her to stop asking me about it, that it was just a second date(he was tryna come in clutch for me) and that she'd gotten enough. She protested a little, but I jumped in and changed the topic and the phishing expedition was over. 

The next day, at around 10am I sent her a snapchat text asking about how a thing she told me about the day before went. It'd been about a day and a few hours since our last message, so I thought I had waited a decent amount of time before messaging her back. It's been over 12 hours and she hasn't even opened it. This isn't my first rodeo, I know that this means there's not going to be a third date.

I am absolutely dreading my mom inevitably bringing this up in the future, so that I can once again tell her that it didn't work out, and I don't know why, and blah blah blah. She definitely still wants to know more. The humiliation factor for me is just so bad. I'm not hung up about her basically ignoring me. Getting stood up, ghosted, ignored, rejected, let down, etc are all just the facts of life in dating as far as I'm concerned. I have a confession: I'm really really irrationally bothered. See, going back years there's been a trend. If my mom finds out about a girl, she always pulls a bunch of info from me after like date one and two, because she's so excitable about this kinda thing. After getting herself invested in the narrative, reality takes the same turn. Literally as soon as my mom pries and pries and gets filled in on everything she wants, the next day or day after is always the day when either I get told straight that the girl's lost interest or it's the last day I ever hear from them. It feels like a curse, and although I know it's irrational, it *feels* like her asking is what's causing this to happen to me. I don't believe it in my logical mind, but rn I'm kinda mad. I'm like, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP ASKING. I wish I just had all this play out but without the door and the dinner thing. I can live with the rest, but the added humiliation of this constant getting my hopes up and narrative that is being created in front of my family of chronic failure is just maddening. It makes everything so bad. In abstract, I don't see any reason why she shouldn't be allowed to ask, or why I should be so defensive. It's normal for a mom to want to know. I'm just tired of it always being apart of the way this shit plays out. It *would be* weird for me to ask my mom to not inquire so much unless we get to like a fifth date or something, because who would I be to make up a rule like that? And try to say she's not allowed to talk about certain things with me or whatever. It's her house, and I don't want to police her speech. She doesn't know how much her having to know so much is making me feel humiliated.

A couple of months ago I couldn't find a blanket. This blanket means a lot to me since it was my grandma's who has passed away in 2013. I value this blanket more that my PS4 or my computer. It the most important thing I own. So anyway I couldn't find it and I've started thinking about the worst. I thought they threw it away in the trash. It's a pretty old blanket like 10-16 years old. She had it before I was even born. I looked everywhere and I still couldn't find it. So I started to ugly cry. At that moment I was thinking about leaving my boyfriend over this. He knew this blanket meant a lot to me. I was very close to my grandma and I was the last one to see her alive. 

The day before she died I ran away from home after a fight with my mom. I went to see her and i left at 9:00 and went back home an hour later after having a conversation with my grandma. Last thing she told me was 'be good to your mom she's alone trying to raise three kids. It may seems unfair sometimes but one day you'll understand and will be grateful of her sacrifices' I left and went home.

The next morning my mom was called by the hospital and told us she had passed away in her sleep.

Do you want to get married? Well, love may not be enough. Before getting married, here are 20 important questions to ask yourself

## 1. Am I ready for this?

This may seem simple but the key to a great relationship is knowing oneself. If you feel rushed or pressured in any way, marriage may not be the best idea.

## 2. Is my partner ready for this?

Maybe you have a really good reason to get married. Maybe you just really want to be married. But if your partner seems hesitant, or you feel like you are pressuring them in any way, give it some time. There is no need to rush into this.

## 3. Are we doing this for the right reasons?

There are a lot of really bad reasons to get married. If you are not doing it for yourself, then it is probably not a good enough reason to do it. One important question to ask is if you and your partner have considered signing a prenuptial agreement. Although it may not be the most romantic gesture, a prenup can provide full control and protection of both of your financial situations. Be sure to talk about it with your partner before making a decision.

## 4. Can we afford it?

Are you both financially ready for something like marriage? For some people, this may not be a big issue, but planning a wedding is hard and expensive work. Make sure you and your partner are ready for that.

## 5. What would my family/friends think?

When it comes down to it, this is your decision. But if the people who are closest to you would have a problem with you getting married, that may be something to take into consideration.

6. Do you want kids?

Kids are a big factor in long-term relationships. Make sure you and your partner have similar plans. If you do want kids, think about how many you want, where you want to raise them, if you want them to go to church, etc. If you already know where you stand on these things, share them with your partner.

## 7. Do you want pets?

While not quite the same as kids, for some people pets can be a deal-breaker. Keep that in mind.

## 8. How long have you known this person?

The rest of your life is a very long time. Do you know your partner’s quirks and annoying habits? Can you live with them?

## 9. Do you trust this person?

If you feel as though your partner is keeping things from you, you need to confront them before getting married.

## 10. What are my future plans?

Where do you see yourself in five years? In 10 years? Is your partner part of that plan?

11. What are your partner’s future plans?

Making sure you have goals that will lead you in the same or similar, directions are important when making a commitment meant to last a lifetime.

## 12. Where will you live?

Combining two lives into one is a complicated business. Have some ideas and/or solutions ready.

## 13. Do you and your partner share the same faith?

Religion can be a very divisive issue, especially if kids become a factor.

## 14. Are you ready for drastic changes?

This could be from losing all of your independence and giving up all of your free time to having to legally change your last name. A service such as EZ Name Change can help but these types of lifestyle changes can be trying.

## 15. Are there any medical issues that need to be addressed?

Some things are on a need to know basis. Marriage is need to know.

16. Is there anything you have been keeping from your partner?

Secrets do not bode well for a healthy marriage. If there is something you have been avoiding telling your partner, sharing it before you get married is the only way to go.

## 17. Do you know how to take care of yourself?

If your living space is constantly a disaster or if you without cooking yourself a solid meal, you may want to focus on taking care of yourself before getting married. Marriage is the joining of two lives, and if yours is a mess you don’t need to be forcing that onto someone else.

## 18. Do you have strong opinions about the wedding?

If you’ve made it to this point, this will probably not be a deal breaker. That being said, if you know what you want your wedding to look like, make sure you share that with your partner. Going into a marriage resentful about how the marriage ceremony went down is not a good idea.

## 19. When you spend time with your partner, does it leave you drained or recharged?

You are signing up to spend most of your time with the same person. If you feel drained or exhausted after spending time with your partner, you need to seriously consider whether or not marriage is a good idea.

## 20. Do you love them?

That’s it. The rest of this list you can probably work through. It may be hard, almost impossible, but if you truly love them then everything will work out. Sacrifices may need to be made, on both sides, but marriage is all about love. If you have that, then you can get through the rest.

Apps have been a waste of time, and I don’t have any friends in the area to do social activities with anymore. I started a new job in the fall working with dogs and have been crushing on my coworker (24F, let’s call her K) pretty hard since we met. I flirt with her and she’s never been put off by it, has always responded positively, but understandably can’t actively reciprocate because she’s in a relationship. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. She and her bf (call him S) went to his sisters wedding that she had overseas. When they got back I greeted K with a big stupid grin saying how much I missed her. She responded teasingly “Oh trust me, I know!” This past weekend, K found out from our coworker (22 f - J) that S messaged J while K was sleeping next to him and tried to solicit nudes from her. She broke up with him and is understandably upset but has said it’s over because she doesn’t tolerate cheating.

What’s weird was how she told me. She didn’t need to tell me but she did, and she waited until we were the last ones there for the day. Normally we both work until 3 but we were both there until 5. I went inside and she was trying to latch a dog crate shut, so I said something like “having trouble? Here let me show you how to do it, climb in.” She laughed and said something to the effect of “I’m not really into being tied up,” to which I replied, “I’ve never tried but I wouldn’t be opposed,” or something along those lines. That’s when she told me she was cheated on. Stunned, I expressed my sympathies. The rest is kind of fuzzy because of how nervous I was but I couldn’t help myself from using the opportunity to shoot my shot. I think I said something like “you deserve so much better, let me know when I can take you out.” She chuckled, “I knew you were gonna say that.” I had talked to her before about my cold streak on tinder, OkCupid, bumble etc. and she was always reassuring saying stuff like “you’re gonna be alright you got plenty going for you.” There’s a bunch of little things between us that have given me reason to suspect she may have had a little crush on me and I honestly think we might end up dating.
Obviously I could be way off but the way this situation fell into place just felt so surreal. I’ve caught her glancing at me plenty of times and she’s definitely caught me looking at her. Idk, I think I’ve got a good shot here, we’ll see. My only worry is one of our coworkers that she’s kind of friendly with, I don’t know if he’s dating anyone but if he’s single I’m worried he might try to hit her up. That’s all I really have to say, idk I’m just really excited and anxious. She’s fucking awesome and we have a fun dynamic.
