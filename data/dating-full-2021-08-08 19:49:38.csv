How unreasonable is it for me to make pets a deal breaker? I have nothing against people with pets. I am always very nice to my family’s cats and dogs and would never mistreat them. However I can’t see myself living with a cat or a dog. I have a lot of bad experiences and just don’t think it will work. I won’t get into specifics.

I’m worried I’m basically shutting myself out of ever finding the right girl because of my stance on pets. A lot of people love pets and I just feel like I’m sort of a bad person because I’d prefer not to have pets. I’ve thought about giving up dating because of this and just being alone the rest of my life. 

Is this unreasonable? Would it be possible to find someone who is okay with this?

When I have had luck, and I do get that first date, for one reason or another it just doesn't click, either for me or for the other person. It's been pretty 50/50 on that front.

Maybe if I just stop caring I'll have better luck down the road? That being said, I'll be 32 here soon and it just seems like the older you get, the harder it is to find anybody worthwhile.

In my head it sounds good, but being short (5'5) black, and average looking in today's dating scene is not fruitful at all, I basically get ignored day in day out, I'm honestly not suprised, due to the internet and dating apps, women have far more better options at their fingertips, and can literally demand the exact type of guy they want, me on the other hand I have to really play my cards right just to get past texting, which a majority of the time I fail.

My oldest sister has a baby girl, and my youngest sister is having her 2nd child some time this week, also s baby girl, meanwhile, I have years on them no kid in sight, let alone a partner to have one with. 

But I'll be honest here, my little brother is 6ft and an attractive guy, he's the opposite of me, he's the bad boy thug with felonies, I'm the straight and narrow career minded guy because it was drilled into me to be the example for the rest of my siblings since I'm the oldest, both of my sister's are also attractive women so they've never had problems having guys to date, me on the other hand, the good genes skipped me.

I constantly get left on read, ghosted, and friendzoned. I'm starting to accept the fact that there's a strong chance I might not ever have my own child, due to not being able to successfully date into days dating scene, as well as finding a wife. I had it all planned out as a kid, of course little did I know how dating would be for me. It's gotten so bad, I get angry with myself whenever I find myself attracted to a woman, or if I find myself around a woman I'm attracted to, I go the other way, or I do not speak.

Dating apps have also been horrible, but I keep swiping just in case, but my likes stay at 0 no matter how many times I swipe. It isn't fun being a short average looking guy, but hey, everyone can't be a handsome 6ft and up black man, I say the only upside I have physically is that my face doesn't really age, nobody knows I'm 28 until I tell them.

Hi! So, to set up the context, I’ve known this girl for around 7 years. We met when I was a teenager, just began to socialize after being a shut in for years. I fell in love fast, but it wasn’t mutual, I was clearly lacking affection, and this destroyed me for a year. I finally got rid of these feeling after working on myself, found a girlfriend I’ve been with for 4 years (it’s over now). 
But there has always, like always been some weird behavior with this girl where we both were close and knew it was a bit more than friendship. Never kissed or anything, but it was there. 

Now, I’ve been at a party two days ago, where I offered her to sleep in the truck I came with (since it rained outside) but without anything else in mind than helping as a friend. But, she told me « if I come with you, we both know we’re gonna sleep together » followed by a discussion about the fact that we both wanted to have sex but still keeping the relation as friend. 
But in the end, she told me it would change too many things between us, and she preferred to not take the risk. 

I feel like being played with, years of behavior too close for friends, telling me clearly that she wanted me, for rejection in the end. 
All of this happened when we were completely wasted.. so I texted that we should talk about this without alcohol involved, and just got a « maybe » for an answer.

Posted this on the dating_advice sub but didn’t get many responses.

So there's this girl I met in my apartment complex. We met because we happened to be outside with our dogs at the same time. We've interacted a handful of times, however the first few times I was definitely really awkward and timid because it had been a hot minute since I'd talked to a girl I thought was attractive. I wasn't feeling particularly confident as I've been stuck inside for the better half of two years due to the pandemic and my job becoming remote. Haven't had any success with OLD during that time either as I'm pretty average and am not particularly photogenic. I've recently decided to no longer be passive and to actually make attempts to meet people and form more relationships in person, not just with women. My puppy has been a tremendous help in re-priming my social skills thus far.

In general she seems really receptive to talking to me, however I can't say that she's given any signs of romantic interest, but I would really like to take a shot with her because if I don't, I know I will regret it. Fortunately, the more we've spoken the more I've been able to open up and become more confident. The last time we interacted I was much more engaging in asking her questions and ended up formally introducing myself and shaking hands. She also brought up to me that she has an old dog crate that might be good for my puppy that I could take off her hands. I probably should've grabbed her number then and there, but I, for lack of a more appropriate phrase, pussied out.

I rarely run in to her as our contact is very dependent on us being outside with our dogs at the same time. With that being said, I would really like to get to know her better. I would love some tips on how I can flirt with her to at least give her the impression that I'm interested. Not sure if I should just outright ask her out the next time I see her or if I should play it slow and let things develop. Was thinking I could give her my number so she can send me pictures of the crate she offered to give me so I can figure out if it would work well for my puppy and then take it from there via text. I also have no idea whether she's even single. I've only seen her alone with her dog, so I am assuming so, but really can't say for sure. And considering we're essentially neighbors, I'd like to not leave things in a weird state if I happen to get rejected. I was thinking I could also just propose a doggy play date of some sort, but then that might lead me right into the friend zone if I don't make my intentions clear.

As a divorced guy in his mid-40's (no children), I have been on a few dates in the last couple months.  However, I recently went on one where the female clearly made up some bullshit about needing to be somewhere, and that was after 50 minutes.  I just rolled with the punches and to be honest, I wasn't much into her that much at all.  That made me think about the concept of ""boring"" dates.  From my perspective, I don't think I have ever been on a boring date ever in my life.  But the other day was just fucking weird.  The gal kept asking me about my previous relationship; I had been with one person for 14 years, married 8 and then divorced.  I would indulge some of the questions, but after awhile I pretty much had to say I don't want want to talk about that.  After that, the conversation just went dry. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is a two-part one.  First, do any of you think boring dates are really a thing or is it just one person or the other not even trying?  Second, if you were in my position, and divorced, how should I deal with that question in the future and does anybody here have an guess why my ""date"" kept hitting me on my divorce?  BTW, I didn't bring it up, she did.  I usually don't talk about past relationships until I know someone a hell of a lot better than a couple dates, and certainly not on the first.

I understand if you feel like you should dismiss my issue, I really wouldn't blame you, but I don't know what else to do and, reddit's really helped me in the past before so that's why I'm here seeking anyones help.

All my life I've always desired a relationship even since I was in Nursery (Kindergarten for U.S. users) I really don't know why, but I just always wanted to be with a girl (I'm a Male in case you couldn't tell). I'm sorry if this comes off as like a kidish issue but, it's this fact, this obsession I have for women that's just put me through litteral hell and just caused me to become someone I just couldn't stand to be anymore, overall its lead me to a very dark and dangerous path. Luckily I got help for my depressive state and for a time I got better, but lately my desire for love has kind of made me take a few steps backwards. I understand I'm still young (I'm 19 turning 20 this September) but I'm a real impatient, pessimist, who is oddly (despite the fact that I'm infatuated by them) terrified of being around women.

I've done crap I'm really just ashamed of, crap that if I carried on with, I most likely wouldn't be here typing out this post. I want to approach women but I'm so terrified of being seen as a creep and just rejected. I literally walk around for hours around places that help me mentally, thinking/hoping that I might bump into ""the one"", but I've been through this routine a thousand times. I really don't want my mental situation to go back the way it was, as I am still currently on medication to help me cope with my depression and panic attacks when I'm out in public. I can tell I'm declining mentally, due to me returning to terrible old habits, I really dug super deep into a pit and just can't seem to get out.

She texted me a few minutes after leaving “I know I already said this but I had a great time with you :)” I left her on read because I didn’t know what to say becuase I didn’t have a good time.

I've tried talking to her and start conversations with so I can get to know more about her on a friends level. We have something similar that happened to the both of us in life, I've told her that I wouldn't mind connecting with her based a similar event that had happened to both of in life.

Last year I've really tried reaching a few times to her by trying to start conversations with her but She was very skeptical of me based on something she heard from other people about me. So up until April this year I stopped trying to talk to her or trying to be in the same area as her in church because things weren't being reciprocated. Now as of this summer I've had this hot and cold experience with her when we see each other at church which is like 2-3 sundys out the month when we volunteer for our respective teams at church.

She's on the welcome team and I'm on the media team. One time she's nice friendly and smiling from ear to ear we she sees me (when not a ton of people are around) then other times she's shy and quiet and pretty much gives me the cold shoulder. (when more or certain people are around) 

I feel like she's playing a game and is loving the attention of me trying to talk to her and find out more about her. I feel like such a fool for going along with this experience I've been having with her. Should I call her out about this or should give up and ignore her?

The 1st day went smoothly we had an All Group Lesson=AGL she obviously knew my name from the others as she came to inform me to inform everyone where our next JGL was then we had the JGL nothing really happened again she talked about Jesus then all of us were just with our phones me with my broken Samsung Galaxy J5 to pretend i was using it because phones were took at sleep so i gave them the broken one anyways a boy from the group who was also our neighbor that was entering his Cabin that we will call He-Man came to unfortunately ask me if i would have sex with her i was like Wtf man? And realised i had a competitor then i just acted cool and used my Poker Face and said No You? He immediately said: oh hell no! Then i saw his friend Cringer when i closed my door at that moment i realised Cringer had a thing for her then i just listened to some David Bowie at me and my friends cabin nothing really happened again we did the usual shit and went to sleep

The 2nd Day: had a little bit more action we had breakfast and i acted like a total clown for most of the time with my friends then we had our break then we had this sort of church thing preparing for a i dont know how to say this in english but Ritual 😂 where we sang about anything and adored Jesus Christ in these Ritual Preparings she never really mentioned my name which was wierd then we had a JGL nothing really happened then we had Little Housework to do like taking the garbage out so i think i did good she thanked me everything went good then we went to sleep

The 3rd Day: I woke up immediately went to breakfast ate we had the usual shit until the JLG our lesson was first at her Cabin then we went to another cabin where there was a Billiard Table they played Billiard with Cringer and i was pretty fucking scared then sometime later i went to wait my friends behind the bloody church i heard someone knocking a window and the only window to be knocked was her window so i was like wtf and wondered if it was another window but it seemed like it was her's then she saw me looking in her window maybe she didnt knock it because she later closed her curtains while i was looking after that we had the usual shit she made some speech before we went to sleep about wanting to know someone and some person pretending with a 1000 masks yeah iam an idiot so i associated it with myself please dont blame me it was like being in a hypnosis then we went to sleep

The 4th Day: very little was happening i missed Breakfast did the usual shit then  we had an Junior Group Leader Activity Hour where we had to spill Water on a bucket while there is a kind of curtain in front of us so we cant see where the bucket is the best thing is she had to hold our bucket as our Junior Group Leader i of course didnt wanna do that she obviously saw i was somewhere i said i didnt want to get wet that was a lie after that i wad convinced that Cringer had a crush on her too but much later i dont hate Cringer tbh after sometime we had another JGL there He-Man and Cringer played some more Billiard with her later we did the usual Homework i got a good comment after that nothing happened and it was time to go and get some rest

The 5th Day:  This day i went to breakfast did the same shit again we had another JGL of course i went to the absolute farest i could from her in the upstairs she of course came far but in front of me in the upstairs i dont remember this that good anymore so this day might not be identical to real events then we had the class she was asked to play Billiard she didnt she just stared at her phone while i did the same  the day was over nothing happened

The 6th Day: normal shit again JGL started i went under this time she went up again she sat on the stairs where i could (i feel disgusted) see her butt the other girl that got kind of close to her looked at me very wierd with a smile then we did all of The Jesus stuff after that she asked anyone to come watch Netflix with her no one went not even Cringer so i decided to go i just stood on the stair like an idiot while she explained some of the plot i of course watched the first episode afterwards at home it was pretty good Vis a Vis can be found on Netflix anyways i as a complete utter idiot left and Cringer realises that i have a bomb too goes in and fucking stays there i of course leave as the lesson ends and suprise suprise some other people come in and they stay in there my friends Aaron, Anakin and Vinny go play some Billiard as we come in they start clowning afterwards in the upstairs  Anakin and Me play first i win Anakin i won Aaron too i didnt even play with Vinny then we just get the fuck out of there i as a brooding piece of shit go apeshit in The Cabin after that nothing happened and we went to sleep sang Nirvana before that cause He-Man and others were in there going all apeshit crazy

The 7th Day: went normally nothing really happened if i remember correctly at night we sang Nirvana while my friend's dad came to guard there and watch so the kids sleep

The Homecoming Day: Missed breakfast had to pack my shit after that we had to give our Bibles to our Junior Group Leader because they had to write something from The Bible after that she gave it to me i saw she had a Metallica Shirt so i said Nice Shirt! She said absolutely nothing and just went away oh yeah and a before that we had to write one good thing about every person we were in a ring one other wierd thing was that she was always in front of me and my friends that could be coincidence but yeah anyways i wrote something like Wonderful Person but when i got her paper i was wondering why she was laughing with the girls that were not Junior Group Leaders there were 30 of us so she obviously had to have my paper because 30÷2=15 so yeah if you had someones paper they had yours obvious logic anyways i even counted she was exactly 15 people away from me dont ask why after that The Bus came to get us and we went to Learn The Confirmation which sucked ass after that we went home i then looked at the writing in My Bible and the paper and knew what she wrote: Your nice and you know alot! Then i told all my friends about the crush i had on her they were like Wtf? Then they showed me their papers they just got Your nice! And i know i was in her group and all that and this story isnt over yet

3 days later/Confirmation Day: I woke up i hadnt thinked anything but her after that i did The Confirmation and i almost got a heart attack she was with Cringer FUCK!!! i almost got a panic attack they were talking something after The Confirmation i listened to Number Of The Beast after that we parked in front of the store i saw her go in so i went and said Hi! to her she knew i was there and didnt respond she was looking at cards i think she clearly heard me after that i bought candy for my sister and cousin and went out happy somehow then i think i was a bit sad

2 days after Confirmation: i got an idea to text her i found her Instagram and then her Snapchat i messaged her she answered Hi too i then asked other good series' because i had watched the first episode of Vis a Vis she said The 100 i said i watched 4 seasons and after that she spoiled me The Last Seasons well it was kind of ending there i then said Breaking Bad is pretty good after that i asked her what animal she would be dont ask me why she said Cockroach because she would be the survivor

3 weeks of speaking: we spoke somedays i was always the one who started the conversation one day i was a total idiot and confessed 
Me: I have feelings for you
She: i dont know what to say then 
She: we really didnt even talk at the camp 
Me: i dont know what to say either
THE END OF THE CHAT

6 days later of confession: 
Me: Hey
She: Hey
Me: I just went to (where i went)
She: Well iam going to go (where she went)
Me: Ok
She: 😂👍🏻
Me: 😂
Me: (i asked a question)
She: (she answered)
THE END OF THE CHAT (i gotta admit this wasnt even important

During the 4 days of Break: She started posting things like Brunettes being Wife Material on Snapchat and a Love Song about a woman singing how a man used her as medicine for him in the Story there was the song on Spotify and a message saying something like: Lyrics reflect the moment sometime i went to check her Instagram she had put posts about love a lot

End of Break: i finally started thinking she may like me so this may be embarassing but i remember shit from what i wrote to her we talked something about what we were doing so yeah but after an hour she changed her Instagram's profile pic to a HornPub (this is getting NSFW if i type the real thing) logo styled Love You then today at night she deleted most of her photos for some reason yeah idk what the fuck is going on anyone a human analyser without meeting them?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,944487,public,self,Its 3am where i live dont blame my writing and i know it's shitty sometimes,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p0qdbr/its_3am_where_i_live_dont_blame_my_writing_and_i/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I'm just frustrated, angry, and depressed with how my life has turned out. I missed out on so much, not just in terms of dating, but in terms of socializing in general. The socialization part is kind of up in the air. I'm meeting people through different activities and stuff like that, but it's still too early to say. When it comes to dating however, no such luck.

So there's a bit to unpack here, but the overall problem is that my life stage and experience do not match my age. At all. I’m 27 (almost 28) and have zero dating experience. I just graduated college last December, and I’m still working for crappy wages, and am currently living at home (I live in the Bay Area). I’ve been making effort to get a better job, and I might be getting something good real soon. But I will still be far behind most people my age. Though I don’t care. I’m not interested in “moving up the corporate ladder”. If I can earn enough to live comfortably that’s fine with me.

The biggest issue comes from my lack of dating experience. At my age, everyone expects me to be past the “discovery, exploration phase” have a bunch of experience, and being in the “matured, settle-down” phase. But how can I do that when I have no dating experience? It’s like starting a game and skipping straight to level 5. 

The thing that really angers me is that I really want to have that “carefree, go with the flow” phase, where people just date to date. And now according to society I’m not allowed to have that. Now I’m expected to “have an end goal” or “know what I want” despite having zero dating experience. And I’m also expected to be “husband/provider” material. This pisses me off because I don’t want to settle down/get married anytime soon, and I sure as hell never want any kids.

I just want to experience that youthful, fun kind of dating where things just happen naturally. If it works out great. If it doesn’t then we move on. But I refuse to date with “intentions” or an “end-goal” because that is inorganic and I honestly have no goals when it comes to dating. I just want to discover things for myself naturally and figure out what I like.

Unfortunately I am not allowed to do that anymore because I’m expected to be past that. And it makes me angry. I’m envious of anyone who got to have a normal youth. I have no more options. I just wish sometimes my life would restart. Then I could experience all the things I missed out on.

since reopening those accounts I've talked to one girl but quickly let her go when she told me she's a demisexual (I have no problem with people like that but to me sexual chemistry is important as well as basic chemistry I don't want to wait for months or years to find out.)

She seemed super into it- laughing, lots of playful touching in each other's faces, yes we were drunk but we had a good time- I asked her for a second date Monday and she said ya and we even set up the time/place, again drunkenly.

I walk her home, we made out and she smiled and said she can't wait for Monday and to text her when i'm home. I text her when i'm home, she says ""thanks for the great spontaneous night! Excited for monday"" and i said me too goodnight text you tomorrow.

I text her today around noon just to see how her brunch was, she responds about an hour later and says 'Hi! it was good very relaxing blah blah how is your day?""

We had a good time on both dates and I enjoyed her company—but I wasn’t as attracted to her as I’d hoped. We both admitted that we’d taken past rejection hard and that we’re slow to open up—but she felt comfortable enough with me to share some things about her upbringing that I’d imagine she doesn’t share with many people.

Because I wasn’t all that interested in her romantically, I called her on Saturday (two days after the second date) and told her that my heart wasn’t fully in it but that I enjoyed our conversations and her company. I could tell that it hurt her and she just said in a soft voice “okay bye.”

I don’t know what I expected her reaction to be but I wish we’d had a chance to talk a bit more. If she’d asked, I would have been happy to share a few things that I questioned about our compatibility.

All that said, I enjoyed her company and care about her as a person—so I’m debating sending a text along the lines of “Hey, I realize our conversation yesterday was pretty short and that it might not have been the best time to talk while you were still getting up. All that said, I’m happy to talk more if you’d like to.”

Has anyone had a similar experience? Should I send the text or just let her process the rejection in peace?

Any advice would be appreciated!

It's alot. It's caused me to reexamine my entire life up to this point and has made many experiences I couldn't previously explain make much more sense in retrospect. Perhaps the thing I've been reexamining the most is my complete lack of any dating or sex life. I used to think it was because I was simply incapable of attracting a partner. I now realize, upon reflection, that I had a number of very obvious (to a normal person) opportunities for a relationship during my high school days. One such opportunity, for example, came in the form of a girl in my chemistry class actually giving me her number. At the time, I thought this was simply a gesture of kindness that she didn't actually mean. So I threw it away and never called her. I regret this deeply, not only because I actually liked her, but because I'm sure I must have hurt her at the time. There were other instances but the point is, my neurodivergent brain didn't recognize them for what they were. So, fast forward to the present day and I think it's easy to see why I've always been single. I've always been okay with being single actually. Socialization (even when it's positive) is exhausting to me and I never thought I can barely comprehend romantic relationships let alone pursue one. Suddenly, though, (perhaps due to the fact that I'm about to turn 30) I've become deeply depressed and concerned about being alone. For one thing, despite some reassurances I've heard, dating at this is age is empirically more challenging (and it was all but impossible for me to begin with). If you're lucky enough to have a career you're kept busy with that, and if you (like me, sadly) have accomplished very little, you are unappealing to potential partners for being perceived as a loser. So, I feel as though I'm backed up against a wall here. What do I do? Is it possible to date for someone in my position? I know people with social disorders must find love sometimes.

I'm a 24 year old guy who have never been in a relationship. I've never really put an effort into getting dates. Why? Because I was so unbelievably, ridiculously shy and an insanely awkward person. Anyway, now that I'm a bit older and more confident, I'd like to try to get into dating. By the way, I am Deaf which is obviously a huge, huge reason why I've always been a quiet person and why I've never been in a relationship.

Anyway, I understand that the fact I'm deaf will be a turnoff for many people - and that's ok. But I'd like to put a lot of effort into this thing, while I'm still young. 

I've tried out a handful of dating apps this past week. Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and OkCupid (by the way, if there's any other dating app you guys think I should try out, lemme know.)

Each of them has their own 'premium' version which you have to subscribe and pay for. I was just wondering which, if any, of them are worth it.

My (20M) SO (21F) have been together a year, and she’s had twice as many partners as I’ve had (1/2 dozen for me) except mine were all in high school w/people I knew over three years(mostly exploration)and hers were mostly random hookups with fully-grown adult men she’d meet on dates ranging from professors in their 40s (wealthier than me and just misogynistic enough to come off as confident and attractive in the trad. male way) to hotshot bartenders who ride motorcycles (prob much cooler than me), all over 1 1/2yrs. She’s also been a bit more adventurous with locations as there’s usually always a bit of alc involved for her (parks, museums etc, whereas I’ve only tried bedrooms). The difference could almost be attributed to growing up in LA vs NYC (laid-back and calm fast-paced and exhilarating ). As some of you can imagine I can sometimes be insecure about it.

Note, she does deal w daddy issues and is a survivor f SS while I’ve practically never had any serious traumas or lacks in my childhood to the point where it’s both boring and lucky. 

In the past, I’ve asked her questions about previous partner’s sizes and how I compared (not sure why I thought good idea) but she was somewhat upfront and eventually I figured out that she’s had bigger multiple times, believed the average was around 7’ long and maybe 5’ girth?(very close to me)—which means I get no pts in the size department despite her telling me I’m “the perfect size”. I’d like to trust her but any decent partner knows that’s the only right answer so idk what to believe. She recently watched the show “Sex Life”—she was rooting for Adam Demos’ character if that means anything while I identify much more as the other dude. 

While I’ve had my fair share of insecurities around her answers and subsequent jokes and allusions to my insecurities in a mocking attempt to reassure me, the part that comes back to me is that she larger dick is “nice for the novelty” but not something she’d want to do longterm. From my POV, I’m not really sure what to do with this. Is it like—some girls just want to try them on for size for a bit and then settle for something more practical?? How should this be understood?

Plus, I have an insecure desire to kind of “meet her at her level”—earlier on I wanted to take a break, do all those more wild, sexperiences until I matched her count, then come back (not going to happen obv). Or even find the male equivalent of a “novel” sexual partner (what’s the big dick equivalent for a woman (big breats/boobs have never equated more pleasure so that’s not it)) but idk what that even would be? Any ideas?

Any thoughts on these points? Should I somehow just work past my insecurities here? Am I even ready to be doing a long-term relationship?
