My question is, what do you guys do in these situations? Sometimes these girls remember me but usually not. Either way, sometimes they 
seem interested like they want me to talk to them (and sometimes not) but I figure if they were actually keen they’d respond even if they are inundated with male attention from online dating. Like if you have a way to get in contact with me then respond, no? I’ve literally experienced this countless times. Even girls that have unmatched me before a convo could even get going look at me or talk to me like they are interested when we bump into each other in real life.

11,q2gj5o,1633510594,Am I the rebound?,"I (23F) have been dating this guy (24M) for a couple of months. He seemed like a really intelligent and emotionally mature guy so I became quite excited to see him. (Something I should mention is that my attachment type is fearful-avoidant, which made me attracted to a lot of emotionally numb/distant past partners, so this guy felt in the beginning like a breath of fresh air). So far he is really attentive, sweet, respectful, giving and is priding himself on his integrity.
In the last couple of days our interactions inclined towards more sexual ones (heavily making out, sexting) and I like it however:
Although making a clear statement that he'd like to be with me in the long term, he still keeps a picture of his ex on his facebook profile (holding-hands-being-a-happy-couple type of picture). When we began talking he kept saying he's feeling alienated (so I'm guessing lonely after the breakup). Also, he's using a notecard from his ex as a bookmark (which he brought on the last date!)
I talked with him about not being really over her but he said I shouldn't worry. He told me SHE broke up 5 months ago after SHE cheated on him, but the last year of the relationship wasn't great. I didn't ask him if he dated after the break-up, but I don't think 3 months after is enough to jump back into a serious relationship.

I really want to trust him because he has other great qualities that I hardly find in other men but now I'm really questioning whether I should keep going with it or end it before he'll break my heart.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2gj5o/am_i_the_rebound/
12,q2gj5s,1633510594,I had my first real date yesterday and the outcome was painful,"I have been texting this guy for about a month now and we clicked right away. He is the best friend of my ex, they roughly have the same personalities so we got along incredibly well. Since he's into books as well, I thought I'd lend him some. He said let's meet and go out instead of simply exchanging the books for 2 min and then bye. I said yes but little did I know that he saw the meeting as a real date.

He took me to nice places to eat, we talked and laughed and had lots of fun, but I had absolutely no idea that he would fall for me after a month of texting, and I knew that if anything happened, I wasn't ready to go further with him.

When he dropped me near my house, he gave me a birthday gift (it's today) it was a book, plus little goodies related to the things I loved, plus a little poem he wrote me asking if I wanted to be his girlfriend. Unfortunately, I knew I had to turn him down.  


I knew I wasn't ready, there wasn't enough physical attraction for me, he is my ex's best friend whose mention still kind of hurts me, so it would be unfair for the guy if we got together with me not being 2000% over his best friend. Besides, I am only 22, have been through excrutiatingly painful relationships, and the following year may be chaotic in my life since I got my last year at uni, I might move abroad, and so on. I told him I'm not ready to invest myself into a relationship.  


I feel incredibly guilty and ungrateful for rejecting and hurting him. I cried my eyes out afterward. Although I know deep in my heart that I couldn't have forced myself to get in the relationship. I've never met someone so nice, who put so much effort for me, and my frustration is through the roof. I wish I could have said yes. I wish. But I know it wasn't the right time.

I have always put effort into my appearance, am very healthy, always been confident in my looks and personality and never had any issues with guys and dating ever in my life (sorry if that sounded cocky, just for context).

Until this year, when my ex dumped me because I had pretty bad anxiety for a few months due to family and health issues and I couldn't really cope with it and was very down and long story short, he dumped me and it really did crush me. Took me a while to get over it, then in July (4 months post break-up) he came back saying how sorry he was, how he should've been there etc, and because I still loved him I went back. 

During this time, after the first 2 weeks of it being great he made me feel really shit, bailing on me, not wanting to see me, barely speaking to me etc, so I ended it - thinking I would be fine. 

I am over him and it now, I'm better off without that situation he's just an immature loser, but every guy I speak to/text/date now I just have this underlying fear they'll leave or just not like me or something and I've never been like this before.

18,q2hs0t,1633516792,Second Date: takeout or cooking together?,"I’m(20F) currently arranging a second date with a guy(24M) I had met last week. For the first date, he took the initiative and organised essentially everything and we ended up back at mine for the night.

Usually I much prefer when a guy organises the date like that, because I’m incredibly indecisive when making plans to the point where it stresses me out. It makes me so relieved when a guy takes away that stress and makes all the decisions for me. But for this second date, I want to prove I’m interested and so I’m trying to be the one to make the plans for once. So far I’ve chosen the date (Friday night) and decided to stay in at my place for a movie night (there’s this film on Netflix we’ve both been dying to see so I thought it was the perfect opportunity).

But then he asked me whether we should get a takeout or cook together when he comes over. I’ve been stumped on this question for almost a whole day without replying to him because I don’t know how to answer it. I know this appears like such a tiny thing to get worked up over but I honestly cannot make a decision on the food situation and it’s stressing me out way more than it’s worth. I just want to ask him to choose but I’m worried that would make me look lazy.

I almost want to say takeout because I might be able to get a cheeky student discount, and then we have more time to be alone together without spending time on the cooking. But then would that make me appear like I don’t want to put in the effort? Or that I only want to have sex with him by cutting corners?

On the other hand, cooking a meal could be a fun way to get to know him a little better. I’ve never really cooked with a guy before, I imagine it could be quite romantic? But then again, I live in a student house - the kitchen is filthy and there would probably also be my housemates cooking in there as well (and I’m definitely not comfortable with PDA in front of them) so I feel like it could be really awkward.

Again, I’m fully aware this is such a mundane problem to get worked up about. Organising dates/events tend to overwhelm me, even with the most simple decisions. I’m not particularly looking for answers on here (although genuine advice would be appreciated &lt;3), I’m mainly clearing my silly little brain of thoughts as I find it tends to help me with decision making.

I greatly enjoyed it, we laughed a lot and the date went several hours. It was one of the best first dates I had if not the best first date I ever had. Besides us seeming to be on a same level for humour and just spending time together she  was cute, open, independent, interesting and had an overall great character. 

She extended the date from her side by suggesting additional things to do and at the end we agreed to meet the next day. Today she cancelled telling me that does not think it will work out as she thinks there are just a few things missing. 

Now I feel devastated despite us meeting only one time. At that point it's always hard to see what might be possible. Me feeling that way is even stranger as I'm currently only here in Dubai on vacation for a few days (which she knew before our first date). So even if we both liked each other developing and maintaining a relationship would be very unrealistic as we are living on different continents.

39,q2k7vs,1633526061,I wish to ask a woman about her feelings for me - after I told her already that I like her. Help?,"So I [20M] met this woman [20F] a few months ago at a friends birthday party. I'll call her ""A"" for now. We became super good friends with another gal, ""B"", and we formed this three person friend group in which we would hang out a bunch with each other.

Recently though, because of college, the group has Ben able to hang out less all together, and its mainly just been ""A"" and I hanging. Recently within the past month, I realized that I had developed feelings for her. I didnt know how to go about navigating these feelings for a while, but eventually after talking with multiple friends, including ""B"", I ended up telling her that I liked her and I was interested in a relationship.

Her response was a little more complicated than I had ever heard before, though then again I've only her been in one committed (on my side) relationship before. ""A"" told me that she wasn't sure about how she felt about me. She explained that she did feel something she thinks, but that she wanted to make sure her feelings were real and not just some friend obsession or something. She and I both discussed that we want something long term and committed, which was nice.

I found this general hesistation to be a bit weird though (if thats the word) because before this, the main thing that pushed me to ask is that I thought she was giving me clear flirt signs. She'd lay her head on mine and hug me too, tell me her parents already like me, gaze at me then look away, and hell she's even called me her favorite before.

But even though I'm confused, I'm not angry or sad or anything because of it. I refuse to be that kind of person, and I always strive to be understanding.

The interesting thing about it is that she told me and made it very clear that she was not rejecting me at all, nor doing the opposite yet. She has multiple concerns within herself that she talked to me about, such as her being asexual (and me saying that I was okay with that/wouldn't push boundaries, that seemed to make her a bit happier), her being in a relationship before but losing interest a bit in because she realized she didnt actually like the guy anymore, her being pretty occupied with school, and things like that, which to me all was understandable.

Overall though, I told her that we could take things slow, and that we could continue as great friends for now. Since that point, she's stopped most of the 'flirty""(?) actions, with acception of hugs for the most part. And we've continued to hang as friends with no mention of what I asked before.

So now, its been about 3 weeks. I still don't have any update one way or another, and I have to admit that I do kinda want one - *even* if she realizes the feelings weren't real or she's not ready for a relationship right now. But I also wish to be understanding of her and respect her. I've never really been in this situation before, so I'm unsure if 3 weeks is too little time for her to know her true feelings, and I'm also unsure if it would be rude for me to ask her again right now. All I really know right now is that I do want to ask for an answer, but that I don't want to ruin anything if there's a chance she might genuinely like me.

How do I exactly go about this? Does anyone have any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2k7vs/i_wish_to_ask_a_woman_about_her_feelings_for_me/

So last weekend I went to an arcade bar, tried to invite friends but none came so I was by myself. In the short time I was there I had 4 interactions where I wasn't sure if girls were being flirty or friendly, so I didn't ask at all about a date or a number or anything. I want to know what you guys think. 

1. Almost immediately saw a girl that was in a freshman class in college, so after I ordered my drink I went to talk to her. She remembered me, asked who I was with, I said nobody and why that was. She said her group was about to go back to their hotel, and hit her up on Instagram if I was out later on if I wanted to hang out in a friendly way. 


2. After they left, I went to the second floor and this fairly drunk girl at a table immediately points at me for me to come over, and she wished me to have a good night, have a fun time, said something drew me to her to talk to me, offered to buy me a shot or buy each other shots. Most skeptical about this one because she was clearly very drunk, not shit faced but definitely feeling it. 


3. Had to go piss, needed someone to watch my beer. 2 girls at a table sat right next to the bathrooms. I approach, introduce myself, say I'm going to the bathroom and wondered if they could watch my drink for 2 minutes. They seemed in a good mood and agreed to, one joked that she was tempted to drug my drink (side note, imagine gender roles reversed in this scenario. Yeah.). I took it as flattering. Came back to get my drink, same girl joked she only drugged it a little, they were both smiling and having a good time, both also a good level of drunk. 


4. Sat down at a table by myself people watching, some girls I knew from high-school walked by, saw me, talked to me. I knew 3 of them, the fourth I didn't. I asked to hang with their group, they agreed. Said 4th girl I didn't know seemed to make it a point to talk to me and ask questions, if the group walked somewhere she stayed by me, and we bonded very briefly over video games (none in common though unfortunately)

54,q2m4h9,1633532102,I need advice,"I really need some relationship advice. Sorry for the long post. I would really appreciate all your advice thanks so much 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 and a half years. We live together and have two dogs which complicates things. Anyway. I’ve been feeling unhappy in the relationship for a while, I’ll sum up the reasons here:

1. He’s never keen to do activities with me. I’m an adventurous person who hates just sitting at home. I love to go out, have a glass of wine, go to look outs, be in nature etc. I also am crafty and I love to do home improvement sort of stuff. He’s so lazy all he loves to do is play PC games and nap. I feel like in this way I feel extremely bored and like I’m missing out on my young years (I’m 24 F and he’s 28 M)
2. Controversial one but - he has no financial ambition. I’m in a transitional phase right now where I’m studying again after my first degree didn’t offer good job prospects. And while his degree got him a job, he only works 30 hours out of choice and hardly earns enough to sustain us should my current study commitments cause me to not maintain my hours at my hospitality job. I’ve never been someone who dates guys because of their money, but not being able to pay for basics with one of us in transition turns me off a lot. 
3. Our life in the bedroom is….not great. I won’t go into detail but he puts in zero effort and I feel dissatisfied in every way possible in this area. 
4. This kinda falls into number 1, but we have no social life. He’s very introverted and likes to just hang out with me which is fine, but I always longingly look at our neighbours and their social BBQ’s they host and I think about how much I wish we had couple friends I could invite over. I’ve tried really hard to connect with other couples and make friends with them but he’s never keen to catch up with them and has negative opinions about almost everyone we meet. 
5. He has very little what I call “domestic initiative”. Meaning I have to organise all the cleaning/chores and tell him what to do. Which is a turn off. I know this is an issue for a lot of men, but damn it would be nice to have someone who has more initiative and used their brain in this way. 

Now I know what you’re all going to ask - which is have you told him how you’re feeling? And YES I HAVE. I’ve had countless serious talks where I told him how unhappy I feel and that if things don’t change I’ll need to leave. And he’s always apologetic and hears me out, but then nothing changes. 

Reasons I haven’t left already includes that we live together, and I’d have no where to go while I study because I don’t have high enough income, also given that I have two dogs I can’t take with me into a shared housing situation. Also both my parents live in apartments so I couldn’t go live with them. He told me before that if I ever broke up with him that I’m welcome to keep living here as a flat mate because he still wants to see the dogs (we both love our dogs immensely). But also another reason I haven’t left is because in his heart he is a kind and loving man. He’s just so lazy and unmotivated. I have so much love for him because of how sweet he is, it’s just I feel so unsatisfied in all the other areas of our lives. My heart hurts when I think about the hurt I’d cause him if I left him because I know that he’s so in love with me and can’t imagine life without me.

55,q2m7p1,1633532374,Why does he only text me on the weekends?,"So the TLDR is the title: I met this guy a couple weeks ago and I noticed he never texts during the week. Should I give up in it?

Here’s the long version:
I just left a long term relationship a couple of months ago. I’m only 23 so I’ve never had to learn about the dating scene with all of it’s unspoken rules and also never learned how to flirt.

Anyway, I was at the mall with my friend the other day who was pretty buzzed. We walked past a store, saw a guy that looked cute, and she asked if she could get his number for me. And I’m like well I won’t stop you lol! And so she went over to him while I went to a different store and told him that her friend thought he was cute, and she came back and gave me his number.

We texted a little back and forth, talked about university a little bit and then he ghosted me. I thought it was pretty funny when he ghosted me after I said I was an accounting major haha. But then the following weekend, Saturday, he said he was super busy and he promised he wasn’t ghosting me or anything he just got caught up in some projects &amp; asked when I was free. So I told him alright no problem whatever I’m free next weekend. We never made exact plans or anything but we swapped social media and he said I was pretty cute and I answered Monday morning saying he was too. Then he ghosted me AGAIN. 

And I was wondering why until I noticed the pattern: he ONLY texts me on weekends. My friends are saying I should just let go. I feel like it’s a red flag that maybe he has a girlfriend or something. But he was really sweet to me over texts. Should I drop him without explaining or should I ask him why he only texts me on the weekends?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2m7p1/why_does_he_only_text_me_on_the_weekends/

63,q2mopp,1633533739,"As I get further into my 30s and soon to be 40s, I see more clearly that many people around my age are in relationships with their jobs","I'm deep into my 30s and lately, I've been matching with others around my age or even their 40s who initially, I'm relieved to find another single professional who seems well put together in their lives and doesn't have a ton of past relationship baggage. As we move onto talking in person and then trying to plan out dates, I've come to realize that these people just might already be in a relationship with their jobs, though.

I love hearing about what people do for a living and expect that to come up in conversation, but I can't tell you how many phone calls or dates I've had recently where the person went on and on talking about their jobs, some story that happened in a meeting, or even asking me which systems I use at mine as if I were one of their colleagues. One person keeps giving me updates on an interview process they're currently being considered in. Another felt like an actual job interview of me. Having a career you care about is a good thing, but when your idea of conversation focuses that much on work, it gives off the impression that you're consumed by your career. I've also had dates cancel at the last minute because they chose to stick around work longer rather than make our plans, which isn't a great thing to do.

It's too bad because otherwise, they're people who seem to have a lot of good things going for them, but it's one of those ""getting older and being single"" observations I've come across with being single at my age. It's a hard place to be in, because if you try to date people slightly younger in their late 20s or early 30s, they are more prone to be playing the field, ad at the other end, it's people unwilling to make time in their lives to date because of their jobs.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2mopp/as_i_get_further_into_my_30s_and_soon_to_be_40s_i/

They still care deeply about me but I just feel like our vibes don't exactly match recently. For example, I love planning stuffs to do together and trying out new things while they have a bunch of work scheduled on the weekend and prefer home-cooked meals, watching TV. There were lots of stuff we did together last semester that we haven't done again because of our schedule, also lowkey feel like they're not excited or feel like planning for it anymore. I don't think we grow apart or he stops putting effort into the relationship. We've been through some serious discussions in the past and have definitely gone closer, but lots of the excitement of a new relationship has faded away. I don't want to blame them for not caring about me anymore cause that isn't really true.

I don't want to break up, but I'm not sure how to initiate the talk. I just want to let them know I'm kinda bored and the excitement has faded away, and Idt they put 100% of their mind in the relationship anymore.

67,q2n6mu,1633535279,"My ex comes back, we restart, then in weeks he dumps me AGAIN, I’m devastated","After a truly amazing joyful relationship for a few months, my ex (27M) broke up with me (29F) out of them blue in June without an explanation and blocked me on all social media… he came back beginning of September via text asking to have a conversation with him. I saw early August he unblocked me from IG and FB but didn’t reach out until a month after. Because our breakup destroyed me emotionally I was leery at first, asked a lot of questions which he gave genuine (it seemed) answers to. He told me he ended it because of a custody battle with his ex wife and didn’t want to involve me. His ex wife and him have divorced for over well over a year maybe even two (he only she bits and pieces of his past). I felt there was more but took him on his word. He claimed not have dated anyone over summer. He said I had the qualities of a woman he wants and hoped for a long term relationship with me again. We talked a good amount. I cannot deny that I wanted to see where this would go. We decided to retry our relationship after he came to visit me for 3 days mid September (we are 3 hours long distance). And he got a hotel room to sleep at but we spent the whole time with each other (didn’t do anything sexual). He took me out for nice meals, we cried together, we laughed and hugged and kissed. It felt as if he never left. I had been depressed and thought about him all summer, I asked the universe to bring him back if he still loved me. He made tons of promises to me such as he wouldn’t repeat the last and he would see me again, giving me reassurance, texting back immediately, and telling me he would work on proving to regain my trust. I felt pretty confident in moving forward with him again. 

Last Monday I was having some anxiety and also had a vivid dream that he was ignoring me and wouldn’t speak to me. I called him, and we talked. We agreed we would find a routine to our communication style again, communicate more AND he asked me to be his girlfriend officially again! Well, He went to San Diego that night randomly with his kids for their birthdays on a road trip. But as soon as he got there at night he changed into a different person and refused to hardly text or call me the next day. I understood he was busy with his kids but he suddenly acted like I didn’t exist and got angry at me for wanting to FaceTime/call/text. He said “he wasn’t sure if things between us were okay”. My anxiety spiraled and was so confused and feeling so many thoughts. I hadn’t done anything wrong! 

Last Wednesday he drove back home and said we could talk that night. We did for 2 hours, he was super angry on the phone, I was crying and he was (gaslighting me) saying it was all my fault because he felt I was putting priority over his kids. I respectfully told him that’s not at all what I was trying to do. We literally just had said we would communicate more and find a routine. He repeated he’s been busy with his kids. This was never an issue in the past, he always would still communicate with or without his kids. What happened or him proving himself to me?? He said my anxiety reminded/worried him of his ex wife who had a mental health issues. I said you cannot compare us, his ex wife and I are two different people.

So last Friday morning, After hardly hearing from him from all the kid birthday festivities all week, with zero details of what he was specifically doing and him still super angry at me (over nothing) I asked him to call me. He sent me a huge text saying I want a teenage relationship and he told me he was busy with his kids still for the weekend and maybe he couldn’t give me the attention I needed. WTF he was supposed to be proving himself and he switched on me!! That was the last text from him. I sent a very kind, supportive and respectful text back. No word. I waited 3.5 days. I was sobbing and confused and felt worthless in limbo. Monday night I sent him a secondary text asking for him to contact me if he cared at all and reminded him the promises he made me. No reply but removes me off Instagram… he ghosted and abandoned me. AGAIN. But this time he didn’t have the decency to even send me one more text. So I blocked him…

Who comes back into someone’s life and asks to restart the relationship for weeks then dumps them and breaks their heart AGAIN?! I truly feel that there was more he wasn’t telling me. Seems to have his own issues and not be a dependable boyfriend at all. I thought he was “the one” from the beginning. I feel like I’m in a nightmare, I feel even more depressed now than the first breakup. I feel humiliated, used, disgusted by this filth of a man. How can he do this to a woman while he has a young daughter! I now have to grieve this all over again but this time try to remove him from my mind completely. My heart hurts beyond words, this is too much pain in one year.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2n6mu/my_ex_comes_back_we_restart_then_in_weeks_he/

69,q2nk8x,1633536403,Should I as a guy disclose my hyperhydrosis to someone before a date?,"So for those who don't know that's excessive sweating. Not like ""oh I get so sweaty when I work out"" more like ""oh I'm a little nervous so my head is going to pour sweat for the next 10 minutes and there is nothing I can do about it"". 

This doesn't always effect me, but it tends to happen on first dates. It's triggered by social anxiety for me. It has happened on maybe 1/3 of first dates in the past. It's embarrassing and it's noticeable. 

I usually just hope it doesn't happen, and if it does I can just excuse myself to the bathroom for a few minutes and clean off a little. 

My question is (and this is specifically for the women here I guess) should I just mention it to someone I am going on a first date with. That way they would at least know what's going on. It is a medical thing after all. It doesn't impact most of my life it just gets triggered once in a while. It also stops pretty quickly, after 10 minutes or so. 

I just thought it might be better if they know, rather than me failing to hide how I'm pouring sweat. Don't know. I'm also talking to my doctor about it next week about possible treatments so it might not be a problem after a while.

The repeated opinion seemed to be that they didn't really care, but just for my awareness, Gemini = bad. This only came up in a teasing way when they were also Gemini. Otherwise the tone and delivery were all pretty matter of fact.

I'm not salty, my dates were still fine, and I'm happily off the market again few months later. But it did get me wondering... What gives? Astrology gurus, are there good parts to dating Gemini?

And I’ve been doing better about not looking, but I decided to check. Seeing him with this new girl just kills me. He’s treating her so well and they go on vacation all the time. It hurts because he treated me like a booty call. As you can see from my post history this has been a huge issue for me to move on. This guy (23m)  I dated wanted to have sex and I wasn’t ready, and then he ended things. He said I was an amazing person but that he wanted to focus on school (he wanted to move out of state) and wasn’t ready to commit. And then commits to her in just a few weeks later. So moving was just him lying to me. I have no idea what happened. The beginning of our relationship was so great and I don’t know how it turned the way that it did. He even said he loved me.  I feel like part of me was too closed off and that lead to the end of the relationship. I was just scared of having sex without him committing. I feel like I’ll never find someone. What was so wrong with me and why didn’t he commit? My friend also thinks my strict parents might have contributed to the break up. Being raised really conservative has affected my relationship with sex so this is just very difficult for me. I just feel crazy and like I did something wrong.

76,q2oe2k,1633538898,Is my friend interested in me?,"I've (20F) been working in a restaurant for about a month. There's a guy (20M) that I work with. He’s a friendly guy, but also a bit of a nerd. I consider him a friend. We know a lot about each other, and we've gone through very similar experiences. When we first started working together (he and I started around the same time), I would almost always be the one initiating the conversation. He'd answer, and he always asked me questions back, but he would almost never initiate. So I stopped approaching him. Since I stopped, he’s been the one coming up to me. Usually, I come into work later than him. When I come in and he's not busy, he’ll immediately come over to my work area and start talking to me, asking me questions about my weekend plans and such. There are even sometimes where he'll come over to me, but he'll stand next to me and won't say anything, so I initiate then. While he’s on good terms with our other coworkers, he’ll normally only greet them hello when they walk in and that’s it.He doesn’t have a conversation with them like he does with me; only about work related things with other workers.

He’ll also help me at work, to the point where he almost goes out of his way to do so. Of course, he’ll help other coworkers as well, but they usually have to ask for his help, and if he does help them voluntarily, it'll usually be when he's not busy. One time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and closed it, forgetting to give the customer their change. I didn’t have the code to reopen it, and I didn’t think he had it either, so I was about to make my way to the back to ask another coworker who had more experience. But before I could leave to the back, he stopped what he was doing and walked up to me and asked what happened. I explained to him. He tried to open it, but wasn’t able to, but he tried even though it was inconvenient for him to do so. Another time, he and I were both at registers helping customers. A customer asked for a beer, and without me asking, he got the beer from the fridge and opened it and bought it to me. I could’ve gotten it myself, and he was busy with another customer, but he helped me anyway. The same day as the customer with the beer, another customer asked for coffee. I was at the coffee maker station trying to fill up the coffee cup. Again, it was busy that time, so there was a line of customers. I tried pouring the coffee, but one of the machines was out of coffee and the other one was wasn't pouring. Even though he was helping package food, he took the coffee makers and transferred the coffees for me so that way I would be able to pour it. Even that in itself took like a good five minutes. Another time, a customer asked for a dressing for her salad, and I had to get it from one of the drawers. The drawers were only a couple of feet away from where I was, so I could've easily have gotten it. He was at the register, but he overheard the woman asking for dressing, so he left the other customer at the register and got the dressing for me.

Another thing that I've noticed is that he'll find little ways to touch me. I don't mind at all. When we work together, sometimes we'll be close to the point that our arms graze each other. While it could be accidental, he doesn't get as close to other coworkers. Another time, it was time for his fifteen minute break, and it was only the manager and I working. As he left to take his fifteen minutes, he lightly tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was going to head out. Another time, I was packaging food, and he told me that a customer wanted a specific dressing for the food. But when he told me this, he whispered in my ear, to the point where he was less than an inch away from me. Not that I mind any of this; he's respectful of boundaries, but I just found it interesting.

Tl;dr - when I come into work, he'll walk right up to me and being speaking with me. He doesn't do that with anyone else. He'll frequently help at work, even when it doesn't benefit him to do so. He also will find little ways to (respectfully) touch me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2oe2k/is_my_friend_interested_in_me/

I dated a woman for approx. 1 year about 3 years ago. She was about average affectionate wise and enjoyed sex. 
 We broke up but got back together about a year ago. She has stage 4 cancer now and her personality naturally has changed. The change that I have the toughest time with is the very little affection she shows toward me. 
 She complains about how I kiss her (which definitely wasn't an issue in the past), has ruled out sex of any type. I tell her often how beautiful that I think that she is but she does not let me kiss her body or even touch her body. If I kiss her on the neck more than once she has said that she feels like I am licking her (there was no tongue involved in the kisses and my lips were just moist.
We each live in our own homes and I stay with her on weekends. I do almost all of the physical work at her house, I buy every meal for us when we are together and sometimes for her adult son who lives with her as well.
 She tells me that she loves me and blames the cancer for issues that concern me (lack of affection, being physically distant). 
 I really don't think that she loves me, I think that she loves what I do for her. Maybe she just likes me as a friend or am I being used?

I wish I did not reach out…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2p9ma/i_the_dumpee_reached_out_to_the_dumper_four/

93,q2pj93,1633542270,"22M, Introverted working, alone in a foreign country. Searching advice","Spent  all my life on my own. 2 years of higher education degree in ""system  and networks administration"" (all men made a friend but lost contact  with him). Now in Malta, alone, my routine is to go to work return, then  thai boxing(going to training some days) in free time. I get along with  people but not much more(not really friend). After all these years  single, I realized something weird I am attracted physically to women  but not in personality, I don't get interested in the personality most  of the women the only exception are tomboys and similar. I am not very  manly person (by social standards). And to men I am not really attracted  physically.  In topics what usually help me to talk with people is  sharing similar interests, but with most I don't have much so I run out  easily of topics. I am into pc upgrading/repairing, tech and science  new, I assist in a friend's biotech project, enjoying videogames,  tabletop rol, martial arts, crafting and things like that. What should I  do? is it something wrong with me that I don't get attracted to most of  the girls in personality? What should I do for finding someone simmilar  in interest? I don't have experience, some people said I am good  looking but I am still a kissless virgin.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2pj93/22m_introverted_working_alone_in_a_foreign/
94,q2pkp2,1633542395,Boundaries vs Compromising,"I have seen people emphasize how both of these things are important. How do you balance them? I find people who are all about asserting strong boundaries have found a way to rationalize not compromising for their partner, and having no boundaries at all I guess leaves yourself open for abusers. I personally (m21), judging from observations on my behavior, seem to take a benefit of doubt + necessary corrections approach. So no boundaries unless they become necessary. This of course has some cons as you have to, every once in a while, evaluate whether the relationship is balanced. It might not be very healthy to keep a tab on your partner's contributions.

What are your thoughts on this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2pkp2/boundaries_vs_compromising/
95,q2plq0,1633542486,"I got a girls number, but I'm not sure how intrested she is back","I'm 16, so this is the first time I've legitimately done this. I got her number just a few hours ago, but I haven't called or texted her yet. We've only been able to talk in classes, so it's a mix of school stuff and joking around. She's quite shy and pretty quiet, but she's come to talk to me a few times and I see her looking my direction often. She didn't seem super excited when I asked for her number, so I don't have a good read yet.

My plan right now is to take it slow, and let her approach me a bit more instead of the other way around, but I was wondering if people had other suggestions

I kinda just want people to talk to about it lol my friends would not be good for the situation",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2plq0/i_got_a_girls_number_but_im_not_sure_how/
