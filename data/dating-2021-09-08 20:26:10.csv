It seems to be throwing them off when I tell them my views are more pagan.  Now by throwing them off it's probably because when they see me its boots,jeans and button ups.  This seems to be a turn off once I tell them because they expected something else.  I'm not one that pushes my views in public and if someone doesn't ask they wouldn't even be able to tell. 
So what advice could some give me that would allow me to let this be known ahead so it wouldn't be that awkwardness after followed by ghosting.

He would always flirt with me then 5 min later tell me about all the girls he thought were hot. Every time he did that I would cry for hours and self harm. After hours of him randomly telling my how much he loved me and how pretty I was he got a girlfriend the next day. After 10 days they broke up and he started flirting with me again then told me he liked me and liked me more then his ex. I told him I liked him too then never talked about it again. He continued to tell me how hot he thought other girls were and would not shut up about how much he misses his ex. I honestly feel stupid I want to block him and I want to cut him out of my life but I cant I care about him to much to do that.

7,pkoppb,1631154262,Need some advice/perspective on the way a guy is acting,"I’m 21F and he is 21M. Back in May, I started talking to a guy that I had been friends with for years. We had “tried things” before that, but it always dissipated on my end (I never really had feelings.) We were nonstop talking the whole summer, went on two dates but it was more of a friends with benefits kinda deal. I caught feelings but he started pulling away. I just can’t read him. Every single time I try and pull away when he pulls away (it’s hard, I do have feelings for him), he comes right back around and tries to continue talking to me and asking me how I am, etc. Our primary communication form is Snapchat (although I’d rather texting, but he won’t let it get that far.) There hasn’t been a day that we don’t communicate on there, but some days he will come around a few times and then proceed to leave me on delivered for hours on end while he’s active. Then I get frustrated with him, try and move on, and do the same. Then, it seems like he notices me pulling away and is all over me again. For example, today he told me Goodmorning, was being so nice and conversational all day, then dropped off around 5pm and has been active snapchatting other people ever since. Not to mention, last week he was on a date, tried to talk to me while he was on it, I didn’t respond, then he proceeded to blow me up the next day saying he wanted to see me. 

I hate these games and it’s frustrating because I like him. I’m also grown and don’t wanna deal with this anymore. I almost just wish he would cut me off but all he does is string me along and confuse me.

We go in for the kiss and she pulls back saying she’s super awkward at making out and meanwhile I have no idea what I’m supposed to do, we then go in again and our lips just touch and then that was that. Things get awkward, we say goodbye and go our separate ways. A few minutes after I dropped her off she sends me a text apologizing for leaving like that and tells me she had a good time and hopes I have a safe drive home. I then text her not to worry about it and that I had a good time too and would love to do something again sometime. Then with iMessage she loves my text.

15,pkp8qz,1631156199,I (25 f) have my first real date in a long time Saturday. I’m excited but nervous too.,"I’m going on a date with my friend Erica’s brother Hank (31 m) this Saturday. He and I never really talked much over the years that I’ve known his sister. With him being six years older than me our paths rarely crossed. I always thought he was really cute.

When Erica got married back in June I was a bridesmaid. Hank and I hit it off at the reception and spent most of the night talking, joking, and just having a nice time. We danced a couple of times too.  

At that time I was still dating my ex Kevin (24 m).  Right before the wedding we had a massive fight over money (of course) and he refused to go to the wedding with me. While I did enjoy my evening getting to know Hank a little I made it clear to him that I was dating someone.

At the end of the night Hank told me to remind my boyfriend what an awesome girlfriend he had. He hugged me goodnight and we went our separate ways. I was left feeling really confused. On one hand I had just had this wonderful evening with this handsome, funny and charming guy. On the other hand I had a boyfriend who I’d invested the last two years in.

I was determined to try to make things work with my Kevin though. Our first year and a half he’d been so good. I thought we could recapture that feeling. We tried, well I tried. But Kevin and I had one huge fight in July and he got so angry that he punched a hole through my bedroom door.

I broke it off with him right then and there. I went no contact with him and it’s been six weeks since I’ve seen or heard from him. So my mind kept going back to that night at Erica’s wedding. I wondered how Hank was doing and did he fell that spark I felt at the reception.

Last weekend Erica suggested I should call him. So I got his number and called him last night. We talked for 2.5 hours! We talked about our previous relationships. We both expressed interest in each other. We both also think it’s a good idea to move slowly for various reasons.

So I asked him if he’d like to have dinner with me on Saturday night and he said he’d love to. This is going to be my first real date in so long. Kevin and I never went out for dinner or anything since early in 2020. I’m really excited to see Hank again. I really am hoping that spark I felt will be there Saturday night. 

I’m also really nervous. I keep telling myself to calm down. I know he’s into me. He made that clear when we talked last night. I want to make it clear to him that I’m it doing this as some sort of rebound either. I am genuinely interested in Hank and want to see where things take us.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkp8qz/i_25_f_have_my_first_real_date_in_a_long_time/

I’m excited but I’m also nervous.,"At my friend Erica’s wedding I was a bridesmaid. I really hit it off with her brother at the reception. I had never really talked much to him. Him being six years older than his sister he never really had much contact with any of her friends. He was in the army until our junior year of high school when he came home. I’d see him from time to time and I always thought he was cute but at the time I was a teenager and he never paid any attention to me.

At the time of the wedding I was in a relationship that was on the rocks. I had a huge fight with my soon to be ex Kevin (24 m) right before the wedding and he refused to go with me. 

So I spent the whole evening chatting with Hank. We laughed a lot, talked a lot, and we even danced a few times. I realized that he was a really funny guy. Very charming. Much more mature than my boyfriend which was nice. But I also made it clear to Hank that I was dating someone and we were trying to work things out. He was respectful of that.

Kevin and I finally split up in July after a really scary fight where he ended up punching a hole through my bedroom door. I’ve gone no contact with him since then. Erica suggested last weekend that I should call her brother. So I did.

Last night we talked for 2.5 hours. We both talked about our previous relationships. Both of which ended badly. His from his girlfriend cheating and mine from Kevin just being immature and starting to lose his temper all the time.

We both admitted that we are interested in each other and we’d like to get to know each other better. We also both think it’s a good idea to take things slowly. So I finally asked if he’d like to get dinner with me Saturday night and he said he’d love to.

So now I’ve got a date for the first time in a long time and I’m beyond excited. I’m also really nervous. I don’t want Hank to think I’m doing this as some sort of a rebound. I’m genuinely interested in him. I keep telling myself that he’s into me and I’ve got nothing to be nervous about but I can’t help it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkpjka/i_25_f_have_my_first_date_in_a_really_long_time/

She happened to be 6 foot, I happen to be 6”5 and we exchanged a couple messages, I asked for her Instagram, she followed me, and it will probably end at that bc she lives 30 min away, but like it makes me think that my confidence is holding me back.

40,pkqqhc,1631161999,How can I best move the relationship forward with the person I am dating.,"I recently fell for someone, and we have been in a relationship since we started talking with each other. This was great because immediately I thought she was perfect. She is smart, witty, funny, and not to mention beautiful. As we have talked and texted our relationship has developed and grown so that we are inseparable and spend very much of our time together. This is something we both started doing in the relationship a lot and before we realized it we were texting every day seeing if we could put something together between us. The only set back is until now, our relationship is entirely online.

Here is where the relationship gets difficult, recently I offered for her to visit, and I could tell this was something she wanted to do but because of our relationship with covid guidelines this has become less likely to be able to do. I would like a relationship to happen between us but given the current situation we are in this has become more difficult to sustain and finding a solution is something we would both very much like. I will preface this by saying I am vaccinated and so is she. For now, we are taking extra precautions, so we don’t get our families any unnecessary exposure. 

I am trying to think of a perfect date for her that allows us to work within these boundaries. My initial idea was to mail her a gift and see if we could get a video call in place. We have mainly texted and snapchatted up until now where we both have admitted wanting to see each other more. The gift would probably be something considerate of our conversations that she could enjoy. As of now I haven’t figured out what this gift idea would be. Maybe an iphone accessory but there are tons of other ideas worth considering also, our conversations are always very vibrant so I know the more I think of something the easier this idea will be. I always take tons of time to listen to our conversations and think about what she may be interested in. 

Here is where we reach a standstill in our relationship: she makes little to no effort at going out of her way for me. I usually start and end all our conversations and where she does appear to be interested in dating me, she hasn’t gone out of her way significantly to give me the impression this is a two-sided relationship. I appreciate when we spend our time together and absolutely light up every time, I receive a message from her. For her to not take any steps to show me that she wants to continue or grow our relationship with each other, I have become hard pressed to continue to find my own motivation to start conversations.

What is the best way to see that she is interested without me always pressing the topic? We have already spent enough time to get an idea that we want to see each other, and I have asked her out on a date. She was jubilant about this when she received the message because at the least, she knew someone was thinking about her. I do want to send her flowers and gifts and she has agreed that she enjoys gifts such as this. Is a good idea to send her these items so as to make her feel more appreciated and respected without asking for anything in return?

I love face timing and video chatting with her as our relationship stands right now, I only wish we could move things further between us so we could have more of a relationship with each other in person.

44,pkr5wh,1631163766,Afraid to trust him. Should I?,"I met this guy at a party. He got my number and I hooked up with him and we slept together on our first date. He initiated everything and he is really smooth and confident that he can sleep with me. He did not seem nervous at all. I am thinking that he must have done this regularly.

I thought he would have dumped me right after the hookup because we did not really have sex (tried to but I am very inexperienced). He took me home the morning after and we went for a walk at the park.

I just texted him to say sorry about what happened last night and I am not looking for casual sex. He texted me and said that he is also looking for something serious. He came out two more times and hung out with me. One time during the day but the other time, it was at night. I think he was trying to hookup with me again that night, but he did not really pushed me to have sex.

He works in another city and after he left, he still texts me daily and check up on me. I guess that is one positive sign that he might be serious about me. I mean he is not getting long distance sex, but he still seems to put in the effort (very minimal effort). I ask him to call but whenever he calls, it is either him going to work. It never last more than 15 mins. I feel like if he actually wants to talk, he can call me after work when he’s making dinner and actually have a conversation. He also sucks at replying to messages.

I am afraid that I will actually like him back (I am starting to put in a lot of feelings) and he end up being a fuckboy so I do not respond to every one of his messages anymore. I told him that if he is busy, he is not obligated to text me everyday. He still text everyday to check in.

He is coming back to my city for work reasons next month. He offers for me to meet his friends. His parents are also here next month, and he offered me to meet them through Facetime. I wish I can trust him but he talks like a player (and calls me “sexy, hot etc”)...which sounds very sexual.

50,pkrno6,1631165938,I thought my guy friend liked me but now he is dating someone and i'm confused,"Basically i met this guy Joe, two years ago. We were both in LTR at that time. We were in the same group of friends but we became super close last year after both our relationships ended. At first i never considered the idea of dating him because i have dated people in my circle of friends before and after the break up it was pretty messy and awkward and ended up losing some friends.  Also he's not really the type of guy i usually go for. 

This last few months he's been really flirtly and touchy feely with me, and always finding excuses to hang out with me alone or touch me, he always hugs me, holds my hand or compliment me which i thought he did because he liked me or smth. We basically started doing all the shit a couple does (watching tv shows together, having brunch, long convos, picnics, going to the cinema) minus the sex. I was really hesitant to engage in this because i tend to get way more emotionally attached doing this kind of things than actually sleeping with someone. 

And boom, Today he actually told me he had started officially dating someone he was super into and it felt like a slap. I honestly feel like he's been leading me on without realizing it, because i never initiated anything between us , (He did) and he never even metioned he was seeing someone ( he started seeing this girl MONTHS AGO) , to be clear i have a lot of male friends and my friendship with them is very different and much more platonic. 

Worst part is the person he is dating is actually jealous of me and very insecure, which make things even more weird. I'm really considering putting some distance between us because all the flirting he made with me while he was seeing someone (that he omitted) it's very off putting.

I met her through a friend and were friends initially after a few meetings and once we were both single again, we hooked on a night  out. Had drunken sex that night.

A few weeks after that we decided it would be nice to see/date each other. And it was great for the first 4/5 weeks. She used to say things like how much she loves being in arms and just really touchy and affectionate. Talk about the future etc.

Fast forward a few weeks, One night we were having sex and I said to her if you were to give yourself to me I promise to never hurt you. I actually thought at the time that she was one person I’ve felt like I could be myself around and hence why I said it. She used to tell me how she can be vulnerable with me etc.

Post that night she cancelled our meet up the next day and although we hang out she has been extremely  aloof and not engaging or touchy anymore.

When I asked her she said she’s a ball of anxiety and wanted to take things slow. The sudden change of heart blew my mind.

 She still wants to hang out and take it at a slow pace while she goes to see a shrink.

I specifically asked her if she’d like some space to figure things out and she said no. I asked her if she wants me to stop being around and she said no. I asked her if she had feelings for me and she said her anxiety is overwhelming her. She couldn’t pinpoint what she was anxious about.

My biggest mistake was not going for a kiss, but she straight up said things like, “Well, next time...” and “When we hangout again...” So, I sort of figured I’d just play it cool and go for it on the “next” date.

She was pretty slow to respond, as these stories usually go. I kept it light, trying to use texting mainly for date logistics/planning. The thing is she was slow as texting in the week or two prior to us hanging out and even postponed the first one, leaving me hanging for five days before we actually met. Which was no big deal, just saying.

She often double or triple texts, so at least she puts in some effort, but after I suggested the following Friday, she said she may be out of town and would get back to me. Which seemed like the nail in the coffin, so I basically just told her no worries, worth a shot, no pressure. I figured I gave it a shot and left the ball in her court.

Anyways, that was over a week ago. I assume I’m as good as gone in her mind. She even paid for dinner, to which I insisted on the spot to cover half via Venmo.

65,pktnk7,1631175698,Social skills for an introvert just interested in “quiet” hookups?,"After having 2 longterm relationships and at 25 I want to change my approach just for a little bit and have some casual sexual experiences without commitment. I know I have the physical going well; I’m maximizing my looks and personal life. I’ve always made sure to do that so that part is easy. The thing I admit I completely suck at is social skills. I’m an only child and grew up pretty introverted, with few friends and preferring to be alone a lot and do my own thing. I’m no longer anxious about socializing with people…I can do it with confidence and maturity. The problem is I just have no idea how to actually talk to girls anymore beyond distanced, friendly or professional conversation. I don’t know what to say to spark sexual tension; I am so used to keeping to myself. I’m that quiet, calm and focused guy that you see all the time but who no one really knows. 

So there are plenty of other people who are also interested in casual hookups, on occasion, with no serious overlap of each other’s lives. That’s what I want to indicate without being obnoxious about it or building a social reputation for that but I guess I lack the social skills to do that, and girls do not really ever approach me but do tend to visually acknowledge attraction. My personality is also very serious and cautious, not funny or outgoing, so that makes it tougher. 

Do you have any tips that I could try to teach myself? Either to help me how to convey this in a normal way, or to have women speak to me first. Thanks in advance!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pktnk7/social_skills_for_an_introvert_just_interested_in/

I can't wait to give it to him. But lately we seem off and I feel like he forgot our anniversary since he is busy at work and preparing for his trip.

67,pkud29,1631179484,Ex dumped me but always checking in,"Hey guys
Just wanted some input 
I was dating this guy for about 4 months earlier this year and he dumped me about 4 mos ago. He never stopped contacting me and would check in on me all day every day, send me all these photos of what he’s doing and drop hints about us meeting up (eg I’m at a cafe near your work! I’ll be there from x time).
After a few months of this I agreed to catch up with him, and we never really talked about what happened. I’m over it now and have a new partner, but he still checks in on me throughout the day every day, and see each other once or more a week.  When I was struggling with the break up and was refusing to see him, I asked him why he was keeping in contact if he didn’t want to be with me and he said he just wants to be friends.
Now I’m seeing someone else and am comfortable with our friendship now, I don’t mind seeing him and communicating but why would a guy lay it on so thick if he dumped me in the first place? He even asks if he can drop my favourite foods (eg he goes to my favourite butcher and then text. Me to say he has some of my faves to drop over) but then only drops the meat and drives off. We go for weekly runs and visit cafes together as well, initiated by him 
What is the point? He has shown jealousy when it’s been clear I’ve been communicating or seeing other male friends but then he doesn’t seem to initiate anything beyond us hanging out??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkud29/ex_dumped_me_but_always_checking_in/

She asked me what I was looking for and I just been honest: not looking for anything in particular, but also open to anything, whatever happens. She seemed to agree that was the best way.

At the end of the date she tells me to text her if I want to hang out again.

Now she has my number but I don't have hers, given she did not write to my whatsapp I am assumed she lost interest. Why? No idea.

71,pkuxkg,1631182309,Why do you even love?,"Why do you stick with the person you love? I know this might sound both cheesy and cynical as hell, but hear me out. 

I’ve asked people in my life why they love their particular partners and no one has given me an answer satisfying enough that it would not be interchangable with other people. 

Sociologically speaking, if you name all the traits you love about your partner, it’s not unreasonable to find something similar or even better in other people. My sister has said she loves her boyfriend because, compared to all the partners she’s had, he genuinely cares about her. My parents stick with each other for practical reasons, like needing a place to stay, financial stability, etc. My frat brother has told me love just is. While this is the only answer I’ve found to be close to satisfying, it doesn’t justify why people choose to stick it out with their partners through the thick and thin.

Personally, my answer is that I have attachment issues and my girlfriend has helped me feel safe to be vulnerable. But then again, is the contrast with other girls because of a positive about her or is it just due to a problem with myself? Both? But if either of the two is true, I could always be able to find a safe place elsewhere. 

Generally, we can say that it’s our experiences with our partner that’s really unique. But who’s to say you can’t build other experiences? 

Ultimately, however - and this is both what scares and amuses me - I believe love is just a product of statistical probability. It’s just a leap of faith we take and that uncertainty is what makes it exciting. It’s like a game of Deal or No Deal, except you already know what your initial case is worth, you choose to play the fool and stick with the other person no matter what (for the most part), and you know they’re doing it for you too. That mutual choice is what makes the experience worthwhile.

For clarity's sake, I don't want to leave my girlfriend. Sometimes, though, it can just be hard. While I can hold on to this idea, I can’t help but think there might be something else more motivating. 

So humor me, why do people love? Why do YOU love?

She’s been my online friend for like… wow, almost two years now. Longest standing friendship I’ve had. We did fall apart just cause of busy life on my end and personal shit I was working through. We’ve recently reconnected. 

I was feeling a bit down recently and she went out of her way to cheer me up/distract me and I actually felt a lot better after the end. Usually when I say I’m down, on the rare occasion, most people say “damn dude, sorry.” and do nothing about it. She actually took the time to make me feel better, which honestly, only one other person in my life has done and they were a past partner. 

I’m starting to find myself liking this person. I know I’m just a friend to her and I think recently I stepped even more into the friend territory…. Recently, she showed me some items she wanted to buy and a few of them were very intimate. I pointed out one or two after she said she wanted to appear a little more.. sexy basically (in this context I just assumed for her boyfriend).

The thing is, being a woman who games, she’s constantly being hit on and she showed me some dms from some people and I felt sorry for her. I know I’m seen as a safe haven and someone she loves spending time with( talking like 3-4hrs online most days, hanging out in a voice chat, and I make her laugh.. A LOT - half the time unintentionally)… but I’m frustrated that now I’m starting to have feelings for her and I don’t think there’s a way for me to bring it up without destroying what we have especially if I’m to take her at her word (which I’ve done) that she has a boyfriend still.

The reason why I’m finding myself doubting this statement, is cause she works when she’s not studying for University. Then the rest of her available time is often spent with me.

I have been called beautiful but if we are being brutally honest I'm rather plain and he's a literal prettyboy.

He flirts with me constantly. Likes to boop me, make suggestive comments, fall asleep on me, hug me and I've kissed him once. He smiled and looked almost smug but did nothing. He also has decided to do a lit if nice things for me like by me food and acting a bit protective. He has also seen me naked once because he saw one if my nudes on my phone when he was walking behind me.  And said he thought I was ""definitely cute"".  Also I gave him a handjob when both of us were drunk and he seemed to like that. He also likes to lean close like he's going to kiss me or wants me to kiss him (he kind if eggs me on like he wants me to make the move)  but I never do anything. Why? Because I was always the plain girl at school.

He has a girlfriend that he's on again off again with who has mentioned she's open to letting him be polyamorous but im fairly sure he only has eyes for her. And he's mentioned he usually looks for someone who is more confident.  And I think he prefers girls who are more curvy if his current girl is any indication.  Although aside from body type she looks frighteningly similar to me - same haircut, complexion, dresses similar and us into some if the same stuff.

As I said, I was always the Plain Jane. People asked me out as a joke before.

I have been dating a guy for just over four months now. We are both over 30 and just after we met covid lockdown started so most of our dates have involved walks in the park. Before covid, we went dinners and managed to get away for a night. We have a strict lockdown so we haven't been able to meet each others friends or families  but where we are I am not sure if he is even ready for it.
My issue is, we meet each other once every week, even though we live 10 minutes away and he seems to be OK with it. Both of us still live with our families which is another issue but in our culture it is normal. I have mentioned it to him 2 months ago that it bothers me that we see each other once a week and he said we need to see each others more often but nothing has changed. He works nights sometimes which is fine but he had a week of and hasn't asked to see me once but mentioned that he met up with friends and slept a lot.
I have asked couple of times if he has told his friends (I know some of them and they know me but we are not friends just seen each other around) and he has never given me concrete answer. I think some of them know based on information he gives them when they call him but he never says he is out with me, gf or anything, just says he is out. 
He is a bad texter which is something I have raised with him so he now calls once or twice a week and we exchange texts here and there. 
We have chatted over fb but he hasn't added me as a friend and his status still says single. I never had a status on fb, mine is just empty.
He does tell me about his life and his family and his goals and asks me about mines but I feel like we are not involved in each other's life as much as we should be at this stage. 
We have discussed exclusivity and what our life together would look like and I feel like he is serious but he just seems a bit guarded about including me in his life and seeing me more. 
He was engaged about two years ago which broke off and he has admitted that it broke him but he is ready to move on. In my case I was also engage but mine broke off over five years ago.

I am F 27 and have been dating for a long time now, I had a few long term relationships in the past but have since realized that the men I dated were always less academically achieved compared to the SOs of my friends. 

I've dated two dudes who just had undergrads and one guy who was in basic retail. They were great people don't get me wrong but I just felt like they weren't that....smart? Talking to them just felt kind of basic at times. They would never elaborate about a subject, just go ""huh that's cool"" or ""oh that sucks, they shouldn't do that"". I just feel like that I was never intellectually stimulated enough. I only have an undergrad degree in media studies but I have a quizzical nature and I'm always eager to learn new things, so I wish my future partner to have the same qualities.

That all being said I just don't where to meet these smarter dudes, I live in a major city in Canada but all the guys I match with tend to just work odd jobs and some haven't even finished college. Other times I might match with a promising dude but they lie about their education and I eventually learn that they just work retail and smoke weed all day. 

I'm at my wits end because I really want a family but can't find the right dude :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkxtg1/how_do_i_find_a_guy_to_date_who_has_an_advanced/
95,pkxw3r,1631194364,OLD… is it really that bad? Try to convince me it’s not that bad…,"OLD… convince me that it is really not that bad out here… or that is just flat out sucks because my luck is little and I am just tired of swiping in hopes to be seen as someone decent who just wants his opportunity. 

I have been giving this a go since March between posting in different dating subs on here and with apps. A lot of people have turned out to be fakes, flakes and duds. 

I have only landed a few first dates (this is my first real stab at dating in my life) and one of them I thought was truly it for me and I still think about her. That one apologized for peeling out on me because a family member passed out of the blue and then she basically blocked me until recently when she signed up for a messaging app I am on. I want to message her but I am nervous that it will just lead to getting blocked there so I don’t bother. If you feel to convince me otherwise, please do so. 

And a little background on me… 34 years old, Male, living in Florida (will be 35 later this year)… a lot of me is feeling like that I am just too old for the OLD games and general dating games period. I don’t do well in a lot of social situations because of my autism (which I feel A LOT of women see as an issue… which makes me sad), but I am doing well for myself being self employed, having my own vehicle, and doing most general and basic things. Yeah downside is sharing a house with the folks (want to change that), but you do what you got to do. Of course COVID hasn’t helped and Florida’s real estate market is out of control right now. 

At this point I don’t know if I should just back off since it’s my busiest time of the year for work and just hope something comes about or if my standards I have are too high (won’t post here fully but if you are curious, shoot me a message and I can explain). 

Really I am just over this whole dating game thing. The good guys and the one trying to finally get in the game seemed to get screwed the most. Change my mind…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkxw3r/old_is_it_really_that_bad_try_to_convince_me_its/

It's not like I choose to be passive, but I don't really know what to do when when it comes to making that first step. Should I choose a particular setting or timing? Am I overthinking it?

98,pky4ml,1631195196,Any tips on dating a women who likes to be lead?,"So I recently got the courage to ask out a women who I’ve known for and been friendly with for almost a year now. She was open to the idea of hanging out after work, but made it very clear she wanted me to chose where we go because she kept implying that she wanted me to choose the place. With me being autistic and therefore really good at analyzing things, this told me that she’s into guys that can lead her.

She was really patient with me when I didn’t pick up on that social cue immediately, and I’m glad because I need someone who’s patient with me.

So how do I lead her? Can someone give me some examples of a guy who leads?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pky4ml/any_tips_on_dating_a_women_who_likes_to_be_lead/
99,pky5wk,1631195327,Rejection situations - ?," So I'm a 29 year old guy from Portugal, i don't consider myself bad looking, some girls even say I'm good looking but idk, (i have green eyes and girls seem to like that) but I'm not some Brad Pitt either. I'm not also very tall, about 5'8, and I currently don't go to the gym because i got tired of that routine. I was in a serious relationship between 2012 and 2016 and been completely single after that (5 years). Yea, I've met 1 or 2 girls and we kissed but things never moved on from that. I'm a bit of a loner, introvert, I don't have friends honestly and I live in a small town and I still struggle with depression and anxiety issues. But I'm an intelligent guy, I have a Master's in political science (so I'm no dumb guy, I pay interest to what's going on in the word, I like to read, I like to be informed, not only about politics but about many other things) and I have a certificate in advanced English from Cambridge. I'm writing this post 'cause I wanted to tell some of my experiences with girls (some on Tinder and I've been extremely unlucky with that, and one IRL) so you guys could give me some input of what went wrong, ‘cause I honestly don't know and when I tell my therapist about these situations she can't find a logic explanation for what happened. I'm only going to tell some of the situations that happened more recently, not all of them, otherwise I'd be writing here all day. Note: A notable former portuguese politician used to say that when logic can't explain something, then something weird is going on. That sentence is making more and more sense to me as time goes by.

1. Talked to a girl on Tinder. Conversation went well. Then we agreed to talk on Facebook. Conversation went well for a few days, I invited her for a coffee and she said yes. On the morning of the day when we were supposed to meet, I sent her a message saying: “So we're good for later for our coffee?” She texted me back and said she had met someone the day before (lol) and our date was off. I was like ""what happened?""? and she said she didn't need to explain anything to me 'cause we didn't have any type of commitment, we weren't in a relationship, etc. Yea, ok, but out of the blue doing that in such a cold manner? After that she blocked me on Facebook. This girl was not good looking if looks are all that matter here...maybe a 5/10 or a 6/10.

2. Met a girl on Tinder, we talked for a bit, conversation went well and then we agreed to talk on Facebook. She added me on FB and then she said on Tinder: “i'm going to have dinner but we can talk on Facebook when I get back” and also sent a smile. I said ok and also replied with a smile. After a while I said hi on Facebook, 1,2,3 hours passed and she didn't reply. Then I asked: “Are you still having dinner? Ahahah”. Then she did a like on my profile picture and I noticed that she had read my messages on Facebook but didn't reply...The next day I texted her asking if I had done something wrong and nothing. She never messaged me back until this day lol. Same as above. Not very good looking.

3. This one is tricky. I was still in college finishing my master's and I was invited for a dinner party with other undergraduate students, some were freshman. I was sitting at my table and in the table right in front of me there was this girl which was always eyeballing me (I'm not stupid, I know when it happens). Honestly we were eyeballing each other for a while. I asked my friend if he thought I should go there and make conversation and he said: yea, go ahead. So I went and the conversation went fine. Just a casual conversation about her opinion about our college, our course (she was a political science undergraduate), I told her what I was working on in terms of research for my thesis and she seemed pretty interested. Then I went back to my table and after dinner I went there again to talk to her. Her attitude was completely different, like cold, giving short answers and stuff. I didn't know what was going on but I don't like to insist when I feel that someone doesn't wanna talk to me. After the party was over I tried to find her once again, I didn't see her and then I asked her friend what was going on. She said: well, she has a boyfriend, etc and even this friend of hers who was real nice to me the first time I talked to her, was completely cold to me this time. I just said: ok, she has a boyfriend, so what? Is it forbidden to talk to her? Did she need to talk to me like that? Her friend just ignored me and left. I felt really horrible. When I got home I found her on Facebook and I added her. Well she blocked me right off the bat lol. After a few a weeks I saw her in college and I tried to talk to her. I was completely ignored, she didn’t talk to me at all and her friend literally told me to get loose. Wtf happened here? A bit more good looking.

4. I met a girl on a party (she was a law student) and actually she was the one hitting on me 'cause I was talking to a guy and she came, said I had pretty eyes and stuff, then she went back to her friends, then she came back again and asked for my name. I said it to her and she asked me if I wanted to go somewhere else to dance. I said ok lol. I wasn't going to say no, the girl wasn't bad looking and had a decent body. We drank, we dance, we kissed, etc. I was pretty wasted at the end. We went to her house but I was too much wasted to do something lol so we just kissed for a while and then we slept. The next day I asked for her Facebook 'cause I'd like to have a coffee with her or something. She added me, I accepted and then I said I'd text her later. She said ""ok"" and I left. Her facebook profile was a bit fishy (I'll explain this later) but I didn't give too much thought about that. We talked for a few days on facebook (she usually took hours to reply) and eventually she said that she had broken up with her boyfriend recently and wasn't ready to have a serious relationship with anyone at that point. After a while her profile had been deleted. A few weeks later I found out her REAL profile on facebook and it all made sense. She was in her 2nd year in law school but she was doing something that some students here do (it's like a tradition) of going undercover as freshmans. So they attend some freshman classes, create fake FB profiles, etc and basically that's what she was doing. She was toying with me. I added her real profile on Facebook and I just asked her why she had done that to me. I'm not going to tell everything she texted me back 'cause what she said was like a punch in my soul, not in my stomach. It was really really bad. Like saying that I didn't matter, that she didn't know me from anywhere, that she didn't have to justify anything to me etc. So basically I was just a toy to her..Then she blocked me (like I was expecting).

This kind of stuff really makes me broken. After many attempts with girls (i don't approach women every day, I'm not like that) I feel like it's better for me to give up at this point or I'll end up more broken with rejection after rejection. I don't approach women anymore. I appreciate any inputs.
