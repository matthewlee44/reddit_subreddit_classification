3,qhb2hw,1635382402,Help: Asking a girl out,"Greetings, 

Here’s the situation:
1. This girl I’ve know since I started college (2015) and I now work in the same town. I’m a band director, she works at the local music store.

2. I want to ask her out, but I only see her when I got to the shop. I know that it’s bad praxis to ask someone out at their place of work, as it normally makes them feel trapped. 

3. She’s a single mom who is recently divorced. 

4. I could as her out over text, but does that have good option? 

Please help. Thanks!

4,qhb3sz,1635382520,"why does it feel like i (27f) am the only one who becomes progressively more sexually excited about romantic partners the longer we’re together, not less?","TLDR lately i have been wondering how my sexuality &amp; aspirations toward intimacy plays into my dating &amp; relationship experiences. i think intimacy (trust, closeness) is more sexually exciting than novelty, but i feel like an outlier in a dating culture that puts so much emphasis on the courtship phase, &amp; little focus on building/sustaining a real bond. i’m wondering if any folks feel similarly &amp; can offer me insight or advice!

to preface, i am a very sexual person, &amp; my sexuality is an important part of my emotional &amp; spiritual identity. i don’t necessarily identify as demisexual, because i do experience attraction to people i don’t know well, but the type of sex i want a lot of is very intimate &amp; emotional. i want to feel like i am touching on something deep, real, &amp; true within myself &amp; another person when we’re f*cking.

as additional context, i identify as socially monogamous, but i’m pretty ambivalent about sexual monogamy as long as i’m having lots of passionate sex with my primary partner, i feel like i can trust them, &amp; i’m confident our relationship/bond takes precedence over other forms of sexual exploration. i have experience navigating a nonmonogamous relationship w a primary partner, ultimately we weren’t compatible for other reasons but i loved how radically honest our sexual bond felt. my favorite part of the nonmonog dynamic was going out on dates with other people, then immediately coming back to my partner &amp; feeling a renewed passion &amp; commitment to them (something about being in a strong, stable relationship where your partner cherishes you, respects your sexual autonomy, trusts your judgment &amp; loyalty, and you feel you can trust them to honor &amp; respect you in return is just… swoon)

all of this to say, i suspect that since intimacy/closeness is a higher priority to me than novelty, my “honeymoon phase” level of sexual interest in partners lasts longer than it does for many of my peers. people are endlessly interesting to me, i identify as monogamous bc i feel like i could spend a lifetime focused on one person’s interior world &amp; still learn new things about them all the time, &amp; that idea of “choosing” someone &amp; being chosen to do that work together excites me. 
 
don’t get me wrong, i definitely enjoy some aspects of the beginning stages of a relationship - i love staying up all night talking, learning about someone’s life &amp; telling them about mine for the first time. the uncertainty &amp; unfamiliarity of it all can be exciting. but even so, my initial honeymoon phase attraction doesn’t dissipate as months pass. getting to know someone better &amp; building a more secure, vulnerable bond feels incredibly sexy to me. granted, the longest relationship I’ve been in thus far was 2 years - I know attraction wanes over long-term relationships and I don’t expect to remain ravenously attracted to anyone for the entire span of our relationship. but I’ve encountered lots of people who seem oriented toward an exciting, all-consuming courtship phase, and then a normalization phase where the sex drops off. for me, that’s where it’s just getting started!

has anyone else experienced similar themes in their romantic life? have you found partners who can match &amp; reciprocate your energy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhb3sz/why_does_it_feel_like_i_27f_am_the_only_one_who/

I've noticed in recent years I have developed significant mood swings which I believe are related to my dating frustrations but I dont know if its something else.

Every morning I wake up energetic, positive, with confidence ready to face the day and whatever comes my way...

But something changes by mid day, idk if it's because I find myself in the same routine or something, but I lose all my positivity, which is replaced by irritability and anti social thoughts...

By the end of the day I dont want to see or talk to anyone and i just want to be alone.  And when I'm alone I drink, so I've been drinking every day now for 6 years.

And I always tell myself I'm only doing this to pass the alone time, I dont really want to drink every night alone, I'd much rather have someone to spend my time with...

I assume she's moved on considering she already had a new boyfriend a month after the breakup.  I never chatted with her after, and even wished her good luck with her new bf and said goodbye.

I shrugged it off and went to another section (the peanut aisle) and when I was done I turned again, and there she was again, standing at the end of the aisle looking at me. She immediately turned again and walked away.

 I felt absolutely nothing during the encounter, not a hint of attraction, didn't miss her, and absolutely don't want her in my life anymore.

Should I reach out and say something like “hey did you ever want to do something? If not I won’t be offended lol” or is this too desperate?

I (21m) have been going out with a (20f) and absolutely love her vibe, company and can be myself around her and she feels the same way!

We’ve been on 2 dates (one date a week with our 3rd coming up), but we text a lot  everyday basically. 

I’ve been trying to take things slow as we both haven’t been in relationships (haven’t even held her hand yet xD), and have never gone past the second date with someone, but with how much we talk and vibe with each other I’d be pretty confident to ask if she wants to make it official on say around the 5th or 6th date?

He would call me almost everyday and would usually text me first and start the conversation. We didn’t flirt heavily, it was very casual like friends and a little flirting here and there. It never got sexual tho which I liked bc I thought maybe he liked me for me not to get into my pants. When he would be drunk that’s when I feel like his true feelings would come out. For an example he asked me if my friends would like him and he would say things as if we were gonna be a couple in the future. I wasn’t used to flirting and talking to a guy for so long so I lacked in this. One time he asked me why I was still talking to him and I blew it off bc I didn’t wanna confess my feelings if he didn’t directly either. Side not , getting to know him I’ve learned that he’s been through so much. His parent passed away couple months ago and his grandparent passed the day of our date and on top of that he’s been through other stuff I won’t disclose. These past 2 months I developed a lot of feelings for him but since I didn’t know where I stood in his life I wouldn’t act on them. Im pretty sure he knew I was interested in him tho. We finally met in person and I thought he was gonna ghost me but he didn’t. He texted me saying he had a good time and even called me the next day to tell me about something. I thought okay he is still interested in me. But 2 days later he started acting weird. He didn’t call me but he would text me but it was off. We weren’t talking how we normally talk but he was still communicating enough for me to blow it off. But I couldn’t take it anymore after almost a week of things just feeling diffident. I asked him what we’re doing and he said that he was trying to figure that out too. He said that at the moment he was just trying to be friends till he figures out his life he wasn’t trying to rush in to something. I agreed and said the same because I wasn’t gonna pour out my heart if I didn’t think he felt the same. I also wasn’t trying to rush things, it’s just because he started acting different so I needed to know what was up. He didn’t text me back but I wanted to break the ice to show him we’re cool so I sent him some stuff on social media. And he sent stuff back as well. Then two days later he text me hey and asked what I’m up to and I told him and he just never texted me back. I was confused by this and just said whatever he’s not my boyfriend so he doesn’t need to text me back. I sent some more stuff on social media and he says that on social media. The next day we didn’t send anything on social media and didn’t text. Then the day after that he Snapchat me and we Snapchat a little bit and he sends me something else social media. Basically I’m just confused by all of this because I don’t know if he just saw me as a friend and he said what he said to soften the blow or he meant what he said and just can’t be anything more right now. My friend say that he didn’t Friendzone me because he still talking to me in a way and that guys don’t usually do that if you’re not interested in a person. But I don’t know what to think I thought about every different explanation of what went wrong and each one can be it. I still want to check up on him and be there for him but if he meant that he just sees me as a friend what’s the point if I’m not wanted.

I’m going through something right now, mainly some baggage from previous relationship if I can call it that. So I feel my wants and needs changing a bit and struggle with depression and anxiety now for the first time in nearly a decade. But despite all this I’m trying to stay true to my long term goals of being in a monogamous growing meaningful relationship. 

Is there any hope with those you work closely with? I’ve just started to open my eyes more to some people who I never gave thought too in that way before but now truly see their interest in me. 

One small part of me feels like I want to explore and be with woman even ironically enough since I never had that interest before. But the stable part of me thinks hell with these temporary emotions and feelings and thinks I should stay focused on what I’ve been wanting for years now. Which is to find my husband and build a life and future with him.

I feel lost and depressed and confused and conflicted when in these situations more recently just trying to shake it off. Anyway, has anyone had a successful relationship with a manger or coworker? Was it against policy did you hide the relationship, how did it progress?

52,qhfe8j,1635397186,Tales of an Overthinker: the Hot and Cold edition (Advice appreciated),"Met girl 45 days ago (me 29yo she 22yo). Been in 6/7 dates and slept together (she even stayed over last time). Last date she was feeling sick so we just watch tv had sex and talked for a bit at my place. It was a little weird but nice. She told me however how she thought it was weird that when she ran into my friend at a party, he told her i was there (wish i was). I asked why is that weird and she said i don't know.

So I assumed it was because perhaps she tough i was telling people that we were together or something so I told her after a weird silence of her not explaining ""Well its not like iim telling people you are my girl, he just happens to know that i saw you a few times"" to what she responded ""Its not that, i don't care about that"" and then she said ""let it go, it's ok"". So as i didn't want to fixate on that and she wouldn't give me an answer i just decide to go back to a more relaxed/fun mood. She left early next morning and texted me ""slept great thank you &lt;3"" to which I responded ""me too, now you know where to go to have great sleep :)"".

After that message nothing all day so that + weird energy of the night before + her comment about my friend mentioning us = bad news for ""us"". She did reach back at 1am that nigh (saturday) saying ""sry for the hour, I though of you :) and I have a lovely idea for something we could do next time we see each other"" + she added me on Insta. So after that I though i might have overthought everything from night before.

Now, i invited her out for midweek and she told me she would get back to me to confirm. She didnt and I didnt want to be pushy so i just made other plans. We still texted during the week (not mentioning our potential get together we talked about) but she takes always 12 to 24 hours to reply (twice already this week) but she is always online.

Depending on the day she seems super into me (kissing me all over, sending hearths, she does always responds, even if late, quite enthusiastically) or super distante (looong response time, not getting back to me over the date, weird comment about friend, seeming physically more distante at times). Last text was yesterday night at 10:30pm from her, I answered in the morning at 10 (asking her about why she has had a exausting week- which she told me she had) and now it 1 am and still no answer even if she has even posted stories on insta and been active all day on social media.

She is very independante and very busy as she work + studies until 10:30pm every night but i still dont understand this hot and cold thing... Any thoughts or advice?

54,qhffjo,1635397310,A bit stuck after 3 weeks,"I (28M) have been texting with a girl (23F) for three weeks. We also went out twice during that time. 

I really liked her in terms of personality even before seeing her IRL, and I had decided I was gonna try and make this happen unless there isn’t at least some physical attraction.  

First date (1 week in), I was a bit nervous as she was way more attractive than her pics made it seem which intimidated me a bit. I’m not a super confident guy. Later while texting she did let me know that I looked uncomfortable. 

In the second one (2 weeks in) I managed better and it went great overall in my opinion but she still thought I looked a bit uncomfortable even though I felt very good. 

She talks a lot more than me usually. I would consider myself more introverted and she’s definitely an extrovert.

She hinted that she needs time so I’m respecting that and taking things slow. This is one of those special ones for me so I’m willing to go through that. 

I also know she was never in a relationship (from a friend we share), and is a bit religious and (I guess) more conservative and cautious. I did let her know that I’m not religious and she didn’t seem to mind. 

Anyway, we usually say hi in the morning and wish each other a good day, then in the evening we text a lot, usually until she goes to bed for 3-5 hours.

For 3 weeks now, our conversations are very natural and balanced, and we cover a lot of different topics.  In the morning she wakes up way earlier than me and texts me first so she definitely initiates conversations. 

I really connected with her and I expressed to her how I feel and that I was ready to commit no matter how long it takes because I just felt different with her compared to any other girls I dated in the past. 

I don’t think she minds it, usually replies with happy emotes and reaction gifs, but she never really expresses her emotions to me in words. After three weeks, I’d assume she’s interested in me or am I wrong?

I tried being a bit playful and sending pics/selfies and she doesn’t really react to them but continues the conversation as if nothing happened. The pics she sends are never pictures of her, but usually places she is.

In the past 1 - 2 days I have noticed that she’s taking more time than usual to respond.

I asked her if there was something wrong and she denied it. Then I asked how is she feeling about our conversations, and she replies: 

“I’m just but lurking for more :)”

No idea what that meant. Maybe she didn’t exprsss herself well. English is not our first language but we use it communicate like 50% of the time. 

Overall, after 3 weeks I have no idea if she likes me or not (as a potential partner) or just found some friend she likes to talk and hang out with. 

I’m not sure what my next steps are. I don’t wanna pressure her, but I’m also afraid things getting cold here soon if I don’t do something more.

55,qhfo5p,1635398227,Does she have a crush on me? Please help,"So I’ve been going to this gym since March and I’ve noticed this girl always glancing at me. The first few weeks, i thought she was just a person trying to look how dumb i was using the gym equipment since I’ve never had experience using the machines and it was my first time at a gym. I would get anxiety whenever she looked at me. 

Back then, she also used to be accompanied by a guy who i assume was her boyfriend and she would still glance at me while her and her bf where working out. Though i didn’t do anything to get her attention during those days. 

Months went by and I’ve noticed around early June that she was coming to the gym alone and has been doing that since. So i assume she broke up with the guy.

During June and July, i was slowly getting a small crush on her. Those 2 months she made some obvious signs and here is what i observed. 

* She would come at the same time as me and same days as well 

* She would glance at me from far away with a serious look

* whenever I’m working out on a machine, she would sometimes walk around in a circle and then out of nowhere, she works out next to me.

* i like to go to the stretch area before my workout, i feel like she knows my routine since i always see her come to stretch area whenever i arrive first

*If i arrive late, i see her from a distance and she’s doing something else, i think “oh she might be done with her workout for the evening” so i go to the stretch area and prepare to stretch and surprise surprise not even 2 mins pass and she comes into the area and does her “stretching” also  (this has happened 3 times already. Third time happened yesterday) 

* Whenever I finish a warmup near her, i tend to curse because of some soreness and she does the same thing as well sometimes lmao 

* i notice her eyes checking me out in a non obvious manner 

* she sometimes likes to go to a corner of the building and observes me from a distance. One time, i could’ve sworn i had a feeling she was taking a picture of me.

* one night the gym was so packed that i decided to wait in my truck for like 15 mins until a few cars would leave the parking spaces. I was chilling in my truck until i saw her car driving behind my truck and then she slowly drove by the passenger side, i think she might’ve thought i wasn’t inside cause i saw her look at the passenger window and i think she saw me and she continued to drive to a parking space. Not gonna lie, that freaked me out a bit haha. I decided to wait another 2 mins. Once i turned off my headlights, she turned off hers and when i got out of my truck, she got out of her car and i was like wtf lol

She’s a really mysterious person and maybe thats what made me have some small feelings for her. I don’t even know her name. I really want to talk to her and get to know her. My gut is telling me that she might have a small crush on me also.

In this time, I found out that he doesn't even play lacrosse. He's only played with friends occasionally, and this was his first time playing in over 3 years. I took this as a sign of him being in interested in me, since he went out of his way (came to campus solely to play with me) to join me for a sport he actually doesn't even play. That weekend, I bumped into him outside of school and we chatted briefly. He mentioned that we should play again.

This week, I asked him if he wanted to join me again. I only asked because he'd mentioned doing it, so I thought he'd say yes. But he said no. He said that he didn't think he could play since he was super sore from a workout he'd done two days ago. Maybe this could be true, but it sounds like an excuse to me. But, he's the one who suggested we'd play again, so maybe it is true?

I'm not really sure if I should take this as a sign of disinterest, or genuinely he was just not up to it. He didn't suggest an alternative or anything, just said he was too sore to make it.

TL;DR This guy who I thought liked me suggested we play a sport together again, but then made what seemed like a lame excuse when I followed up",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhgg0k/he_said_no_to_hanging_out_but_it_was_his_idea/
61,qhgg3j,1635401364,26f date from hell,"3rd time hanging out w this guy (26m) I knew from high school who ive been seeing and I’m beyond freaked out. The other two times were normal then today it’s like he’s manic or on meth or something. He kept talking over me, even yelled at me at one point bc I wasn’t impressed w his delusions. He wasn’t acting affectionate and just played video games while music blared in the background w Fox News on his other computer. He kept saying the people on the shows were watching and reacting to us. I said we are not that special and no one is watching this. Then he tells me about his scheme to become a billionaire by suing a tech company for putting cameras in his monitor. He literally asked me for a bj bc he was getting turned on by a female character. I said no that’s not how this works. He also had a gun in sight. He was acting so paranoid that all his screens were watching us and going on about conspiracy theories. He also said that undercover cops see him and tail him and that he’s basically famous. I really think he might be bipolar and or schizophrenic but I’m no doctor. He was constantly smoking weed which he hadn’t before and I even asked him if he took his adderall today or something else bc he truly was acting manic. Jumping from this to that, changing the tv on the screen constantly. Just not right. He also kept ignoring the fact that I said I was cold. He had like five fans going. He kept interrupting me and not listening to a word I was saying and just brought it all back to himself. He also asked me about a fetish he has which I said no I would never do that. 

He’s already told me he loves me and wants to marry me. He could tell I was getting freaked out. I finally made the excuse to leave and he didn’t even get up from his video game. 

This was a hangout from hell and I’m clearly never talking to him again. Thankfully he doesn’t know where I live or the location of my work but I’m honestly so freaked out especially since he has guns. I seriously am taking a pause from dating bc this was a nightmare.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhgg3j/26f_date_from_hell/

66,qhh1sv,1635403922,"First time in 3 sum, question (serious)","So just starting out, me (m) and my partner (f) want to have 3 sum with my best friend(m). Me and my partner talked about it a lot and have set boundaries and safe words and my friend agreed to eventually have 3 sum. 

We want to start off with it being like a 2 way but with a + 1, as a friends with benefits kinda thing. 
However, my partner wants to have a small connection with him. Before we actually do anything. The goal is that at the end of this I can allow my partner to be solo and hook up with other people, but that’s a long time down the road. 

However, starting out, I agreed that I would have to be present when they do big things starting out since this is new for all three of us. But my partner wants to do small things without me there in person or on the phone. She says that it feels awkward for the both of them to do these small things when I’m around over the phone, which makes sense to a point. That point being I still get to set what they can do and I get a word for word recount of how it went. 
It’s new and different and I’m basically sharing my partner with my best friend so it’s I think a good compromise. What I’m allowing so far for small things includes, like massages(non sexual), teasing(playful back talk and tickling), talking about life, etc. nothing sexual just flirty teasing. 
However, me not being there make me feel left out. And like I should be apart of it even if it is awkward for them because this is still experimenting and I don’t fully know my boundaries and I want to see for myself what they look like together to get a sense of what I think is ok, because I over think things. since it’s my partner being there I have trust in the both of them not to push my boundaries but I can’t shake this feeling that it’s not right. 

My main question is, even if she get approval from me, about what she and him are allowed to do, and I get a word for word recap after the light flirting, should I be around when they do the light flirting even though when I am around they say it feels awkward for them to do anything? 
And it sounds like they aren’t 100% comfortable with me around them making this small bonding between them 
And
I know for a fact they aren’t going behind my back or anything because the have proven themselves trust worthy so it’s not that at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhh1sv/first_time_in_3_sum_question_serious/

68,qhhjtv,1635406146,Almost got friend-zoned but escaped - now what?,"I need advice guys. A couple of months ago, after 4 dates, a girl told me she just wants to be friends. I got some great advice on Reddit where people said to exit the friend situation asap. Thanks Guys! And, I did EXACTLY that. I respectfully told her I did not want friends and I wish her the very best and enjoyed getting to know her. I think she was surprised. I then thought back at my dates with her and realized I did a lot of stupid things like texting too much, being clingy, talking about boring topics like work and politics, and not making a move until the 4th date which resulted in a weird awkward kiss. 

For the last 2 months I have barely ever talked to her and she started commenting on my instagram posts and showing signs of renewed interest. So, I decided to just ask her how she was doing and I told her that I felt she seemed a bit hesitant and afraid of dating because of her past experiences (which she had told me previously). She said I might be correct and that she would like to hang out again and see how it feels. To my surprise, she reached out to come and visit me. I had once told her I would show her my law school sometime and she remembered and took me up on it. So, we spent the day together, had lunch, and walked around and it was fun and much better chemistry then previously but we were in public the whole day and I didn't feel there was a chance to make a move for a kiss or anything but I did flirt and suggest fun things like salsa dancing in the coming months and she responded with excitement and interest. 

This coming weekend she wanted to know if I was free to go to dinner at a cool new restaurant she wanted to try on Friday night in the city (we both live in the suburbs). Its a bit far away, around 40 min drive but I said yes. So, now the question is, how and where do I get to a level of intimacy? We have only had one awkward kiss and this girl is a shy type of girl in terms of physical stuff. She is not the type who makes it very easy by giving clear signals or anything so it makes it much harder. I was thinking maybe we can go to drinks after dinner and walk around and find a romantic spot or something? I need advice on how to make a move on a person who doesn't seem to be seeking the kiss but at the same time seems clearly interested. Also, my apartment is not the most impressive as the maintenance and landlord has not done a good job of keeping it up during COVID so I feel a bit embarrassed to bring her over to my place otherwise I could have just brought her back after dinner I suppose. At this point all we have had is one awkward kiss and I am just hoping this time, even if its only a kiss, it can be a longer one and a better one.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhhjtv/almost_got_friendzoned_but_escaped_now_what/

Like 99% of thr time there's a palpable tension and we have talked it through. The thing is last saturday we agreed we were going to have sex and we were really excited. We had dinner, we went to the cinema and since both of us live with our parents we went to a spot she knows. It was really nice, no one could have seen us and it was the ocasion. We bought some beer and headed there. We were just hanging out and we smoked some weed. But then I started to feel bad: I was tired, I had eaten a lot and I was sleepy because the movie was really boring. Then she started kissing me and I wasn't capable of bringing myself to do anything. We were trying the whole night and I was just not feeling good. The next day, we hang up again and things were as usual (we both were horny af) and we've talked about coming to my place when my parents were out.

The main issue here is this has only happened to me once before and it was because I was high as kite, like last saturday, but I took a lot of pressure in that moment and I started overthinking it a lot, to the point I don't know if I have some problem and I won't be able to do it or something.

I was genuine, empathetic and engaging. But he never asked me out again. I tried asking him one time and he said he was in the ER with his mom for some health scare. But he still kept texting throughout. A week later, he tells me he was bored on the weekend and met a friend. His texts by this point had started being weird and I started reading Reddit articles and discovered something called the “slow fade”. Started obsessively waiting for his replies, reading articles about how many shitty men/women exist in the datosphere that leave people hanging for no reason and are just jerks. One last time, I ask him again and this time he just ghosts. On. My. Birthday. As it goes without saying, I’ve spent the day introspecting and crying about how fucked up my life is.

I’m a 19M Asian guy who’s more attractive than average. I’ve had a couple girls have crushes on me in high school and sometimes I notice girls checking me out and giving me second looks. I can interact just fine with people of both sexes, and I usually connect very well with people, especially in one-on-one situations. However, I have little practical know-how on how to try for a relationship. Most people learn this stuff in high school but due to various reasons, I never did. I have some questions that I hope you guys can answer: 

1. How do I make distinctions between just wanting to meet someone as a friend and actually asking for a date? For example, how would I approach making plans with a girl I want to be friends with versus a girl I want to date? 

2. What amount of physical contact is expected on first/second dates, etc? I’m aware of needing to do things like gradually escalating physical contact to build up for a kiss, etc. on a date, but implementing the „theory” is for me seems like trying to learn how to drift before learning how to drive. This is coming from a guy who’s never kissed a girl before. I would like to know things like: Is it okay to touch her in a certain way? Is it okay to hug her or hold her hand? Is she open to a kiss? What kinds of feedback should I look for?

2a. What kinds of physical contact are okay in non-date contexts? I am usually very reserved when it comes to touching people, even my friends. Making physical contact is scary to me because I don’t know what will or will not be perceived as weird or creepy. For example, in what ways can I touch, say, a female friend, a female coworker, or a male classmate? (e.g. a pat on the back)

3. Following the above, how does sex play into a date? People do have sex on the first date. How is physical attraction built up during the date? I’m asking this because I have no expectation of problems connecting with someone intellectually/emotionally, but I am clueless how to connect physically. How would I know a girl is open to sex? Especially if we both are enjoying the date? Do I ask outright? Do I have to build up physical intimacy? 

Basically, on a date I could talk to a girl for hours. But how do I make the step from being a possible friend who’s a guy to being a possible boyfriend?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhjago/dating_for_someone_whos_never_done_it/

89,qhk078,1635417030,Am I (M21) too ugly and unattractive to date or to get a girlfriend?,"Hello,

I am a 21 year old male. This is my story. I have never had a girlfriend I never even went on a date or kissed. Why? Let me explain. 

I was 16 when I developed my first crush on a girl. At that time I was full of confident and asked her out one day. She rejected me and that did hurt. However I did not give up. Over the years I asked out and tried to socialise with other girls mostly at schools. It was fun, however none of them ever wanted to go out do something. I always got rejected in the end. Over time this destroyed my confidence and my ability to talk to girl. To a certain point that I was almost scared of them and I couldn’t this approach one anymore. I had the fear that they would always judge me and dislike me. At that point I gave up in real life, because I just couldn’t do it anymore. 

In 2020 I tried tinder after that, but after 3 weeks I just got 2 or 3 matches. Two of them never replied and the other ghosted me after a day. 

Then I realised that most likely I am just to ugly for tinder and I tried to make girls interested by just adding them on Snapchat or Instagram and tried to make them interested. I felt much more comfortable chatting and my looks weren’t important. And the succes rate was actually quite decent. I got a decent amount of girls interested and with some I chatted for days about literally everything. I really got some girls that were really interested in me. However at some point they want to know what you look like. Some even just sent a picture of themselves and then asked hey this is how I look like what about you? This is where it always goes wrong. I sent a picture of me and they just ghost me, instant block or just pretend to chat for a while and then get away. And you see some hours later that they blocked you. I mean if we had so much fun chatting and liked each other why then would they do this?

I have been in this situations with really attractive girls, but also less attractive girls. However I would never have rejected one of them just on their looks. Let alone block them or ghost them. 

I have read on internet that girls do not care about looks as much as men do. This is absolutely not true and I am the living truth of that. 

I didn’t even think I was that ugly, but after all these years maybe I don’t see it right. Maybe I am ugly and there is not a single girl but the world that would like me, date me or wishes that I would be their boyfriend. Am I the forever alone dude? Honestly at this point I feel that I am. Why would any girl date me when she can choose so many better looking guys.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhk078/am_i_m21_too_ugly_and_unattractive_to_date_or_to/

93,qhkli4,1635419409,Sick of having to ‘game’,"This isn’t a blow at women. It’s a blow at dating as a whole.



Shit was fun as a teenager, but as you get older cat and mouse bullshit has to stop. There are still people in their 20s and 30s doing this. 


Honestly if you love ‘the thrill of the chase’ you are still living in high school. Why can’t people just be serious with their intentions? Cut to the chase.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhkli4/sick_of_having_to_game/
94,qhkqt3,1635419964,Is it okay to do this?,"So I downloaded tinder on Monday night and now I have 3 dates either 3 different people coming up. I wasn’t expecting anything from tinder tbh but it went really well lol. 

I keep telling myself it’s okay because I’m only getting to know them and there’s no telling if any of them go well. But one of the girls I’m talking has made it clear she just wants to chill and have sex, I’m up for that but if the other dates were to go well and stuff what do I do? I’m not a cheater or anything and this situation is so out of the ordinary to happen to me lol, I need advice.

95,qhkr4n,1635420001,Is there a way to convince myself that I’m not worth it?,"This is kind of an unusual question but is there a way to make myself face reality and just give up? Because the longer I feed myself with false hope, the more I suffer. 

I’ve been in mental pain for the last couple of months which is a buildup of the last decade’s experience. I want to give up but at the same time, my brain kicks itself to try again as if it's asking for another chance. 

I’m not blaming men, women, the “system”, anything. It is a fact that not everyone is meant to date which I believe I’m part of it. I just want to be pain-free and focus on my studies. I have no one to talk to. I can't go to a therapist because of my workload. I just want to stop thinking about dating because it's not working. 

If I’m going to die alone, so be it. It's not that I felt alive when I’m around people, it's not like my current environment seem to be enthusiastic about dating anyway. Nor that I currently have a crush on anyone. 

I know what I need to do for both cases. But at the same time, I feel the opposite. Let's see what happens.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhkr4n/is_there_a_way_to_convince_myself_that_im_not/
