My ex GF and me broke up a month ago ago (she's 48, i'm 42). I miss her a lot, but we both didn't contact each other. We were dating for around 5-6 months. It was amazing. I loved her more than she love me, but i didn't care and we were dating normally and building a relationship (as far as i know).

We had a tough discussion, where we disrespect each other like we've never done before. Never, she punished me and i attacked her cause it hurted, i told her and she continue, that was annoying. I started very angry about issues in our relationship, and suddenly she wanted some time, we continue the discussion, and then she said she broke up finally.

I was very angry so i said it was ok for me (I thought that in that moment, and even that day, it was in the morning), but then i realize how i miss her.

She chose to follow her indepdent life... and it was the first strong discussion we have. For real. I suddenly realized that maybe she was thinking about the broke up last weeks, probably (i'm guessing, she didnt say nothing ever).

So my anger caused the breakup, but it was hide inside her, so I think i only accelerate the process. I felt really stupid. Why she didn't fight or at least why she doesn't want us to be friends, we never had an argument like this, it got all out of hand. She was affectionate and attentive as she used to do that day, I don't understand anything, she then was cold and distant and commenting on problems from the beginning of our relationship that I thought were more than solved and talked about. Really idiots things like i talked a lot about my ex gf and that annoyed her (but that was during our first dates, that was not to me another reason). She was like justifying the decision, when he could have not been hurtful and just said he didn't want to go on, period, it would have been just as harsh, but you don't get that bitter and unpleasant aftertaste, there was no need.

I don't know if talking to her would change anything after a month with no contact. My friends say that once a woman makes a decision like that, and she tells you that she has lost feelings, there is no going back. And that she probably won't talk to me because she is very proud (she is), and she will remember the things that hurt her or she does not like about me. She moved on, but inside me i feel like those things were avoidable and talking with care and intelligence could be solved.

And that is my doubt. If you contact her and ask her if she wants to talk. 

The thing is that I feel like I need to close the chapter and so it's not clear to me. Or maybe I miss her so much. I don't want to annoy her anymore and I'm not going to cry or ask to come back in a slimy and demanding way, just to know if, like me, she thinks that it was a bad time and that, despite the failures that we both have, there is something that unites us in the background and we can look for solutions.

If she wants, and if not, then chapter closed. I would like to know if someone who has been in this situation and the experience and if this is a wrong idea and i should move on and let this finish. I'm in love with her and this is so hard.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67428,public,self,Does it has sense to talk to her after a break up?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/srt19c/does_it_has_sense_to_talk_to_her_after_a_break_up/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean, we’re in the dating realm at forty years old for crying out loud. I’m sitting in my bathtub, steam rising all around me and my head is hurting because I just ended it with someone. Let me be clear- my head is hurting because I’m angry, not because I’ve been crying. Let me explain…

Trauma and triggers often go back to childhood. After the “end” conversation with this person I’ve had an epiphany involving my childhood and that may be a big part of why my head is hurting as well. I’ve been through counseling where these things have been talked about and analyzed separately, but I’ve never connected them before and neither has a therapist. So, be gentle because here goes…

I(45f) was an only child until my brother was born when I was five. So I have vivid memories of him being brought home, etc. Things were good until he started to walk. To put it lightly, he was rambunctious and constantly needed attention. My mom was a SAHM and my dad worked swing shifts at the time, so often if he was home he was sleeping. He would swing shifts for three weeks before he would get a week off and then go back to it. My mom was essentially a single parent. 

My brother did not nap during the day(I’m really not sure why) and ran full tilt from dawn until dusk with my mother, who was just beginning to find out she had a seizure disorder, running after him. I was in school most of the day,  but when I got home there wasn’t a lot of thought or time given to me. I was quiet, well behaved, and independent, so both parents assumed I didn’t need them. I was often left in my room for hours reading or playing with my dolls and horses by myself. 

However, when I did need them- they were both exhausted. My brother, as a toddler, locked my mom totally out of our house to crawl on top of a stove top to get to Halloween candy. She could hear the burners rattling, but could not get to him. He let her in when he had his fill of candy, so yah, he was  a handful. This was the eighties. No cell phone. The neighbors were all at work. She just had to hold her breath and hope he didn’t catch himself on fire. 

When I did go to her for comfort or needing help with homework, exhausted and going through a traumatic diagnosis, she would tell me I was being “needy”, that she needed a break and that I needed to be able to do things on my own. I was SIX!

Fast forward to my adult hood. I worked my ass off through college. Graduated, I often worked two and three jobs so I could afford my house(I bought it at 23) and maintain my independence at all cost. I never wanted to have to rely on anyone other than myself. The “don’t be needy” reverberating in my head over and over. 

Then came my ex. Now diagnosed as a narc(officially last year! Yes! I wasn’t crazy!) whom had very, very poor communication skills along with the whole gaslighting and lying and being cagey. We argued often because of his poor communication with me and he would often resort to telling me I was needy, a stage one clinger and that I would probably fall apart without him. He knew this was my trigger. I would get quiet, the fight would go out of me and for days afterwards I would feel the weight of these words, even though I had maintained and bought a home on my own years before meeting him. 

This brings us to today. The man I’ve been seeing sucked at communication and after telling him once that I needed this(good communication)in order for me to feel safe and valued in our relationship, I told him I was done when there wasn’t any change. He was upset and told me that anyone who needs this type of clarification was too needy for him anyway. 

So, now I’m sitting in my bathtub angry. I have finally realized that what I’m asking is not unreasonable and that he chose the thing he thought would hurt me most to justify his own shortcomings! 

From this point forward I vow that these words will no longer hurt me.

Great communication (daily texts initated by him) and humor. We didn't meet until January 2 due to holiday stuff. Great first lunch date. The next weekend we had another date. He disclosed he had a daughter (not on his profile). I wasn't looking for someone with kids but I was invested. He also disclosed he lived with his parents, not a dealbreaker since they were older and Covid situation. The next weekend, we saw each other on Saturday and Sunday. He calls me on Monday to disclose he's been to jail and that's why he's living with his parents. Again, not a deal breaker for me as he sounded remorseful. He also has not kissed me yet so I asked him about it. He said he's not dated in a long time and didn't know when. The next weekend, we hung out Saturday with a make out session in the car then he wants to invite me to his place Sunday to hang out and meet his parents. Great, I bring a bottle of wine and met his parents. I also realized he lives an hour away from me but we been meeting in what I thought was the middle but he actually is further out. We go down to the basement, we're making out. He lies there like a dead fish. He doesn't touch me at all. He doesn't really kiss me back either. Ok figure he was awkward and afraid that his parents would come down. I called him Monday and asked him what he was looking for in a relationship since I felt pretty rejected since he didn't even touch me. The next weekend I invite him to meet my friends at a Lunar New Year lunch. We came back to my place. I start kissing him and again he lies there like a dead fish. When I stop kissing him and move over, he would then reach out to touch me as if he didn't want me off of him. So after stewing on this I call him on Monday and discuss with him how I want to be touched when kissing. I asked if he was physically attracted to me since again he didn't touch me at all. We have not discussed sex yet so I also brought that up as I was looking for passion in my next relationship. So all week we had flirty texts and I was very open about my willingness. He also seemed he was interested in the next level. I invited him over today and cooked him a great meal for Valentines. He brought me a potted plant and complimented me on how I looked and the meal. We watched Ted Lasso, again I start kissing him. He touches my arm and back. We stopped kissing as it didn't lead to anything. He pulls out his phone and plays Wordle. What the HELL. We go back to kissing. Ended the date pleasantly enough. I called him and explained that I was frustrated and unhappy and didn't think things would work out. He said he understands, wishes me luck and hung up. WOW all that time and effort ended in a 5 minute call. I am now all up in my head thinking all the signals were there but he just wasn't attracted to me.

We are both divorced (me longer than him) and met online just after we’d both gotten out of short relationships. I was initially skeptical (as I would be with anyone), but he worked overtime to win me over: courting me, saying stuff like, “How are you everything I need in one package?”and wanting to spend lots of time with me. He was fun and handsome and affectionate  and available and charming the sex was great. 

By two months, he was starting to talk long-term plans. By three months he told me he loved me and was ready to meet my kid. 

One thorn: He was “friends” with the girl he’d dated before me. It seemed to me like she either still wanted him to be pining after her, or she was having regrets about dumping him—they’d only gone out for a month or so and she’d thought he was too intense—but he insisted it didn’t matter because he was much happier to be with me. I’m still friends with the guy I was with before him, so I let it be. He never wanted to tell her to just go away, he said, because they shared political views (we don’t) and had so many mutual friends.

Well, four months in I went away for the weekend. When I left, everything seemed fine/great. When I got back, we were done. He insisted he did l love me, although admitted he maybe wasn’t “head over heels” because he never worried about me dumping him. But he said he was now sure he didn’t want to be with me forever, and so it was better to break it off. I didn’t understand how one could go from “I love you” to that so fast. It had never happened to me before. 

Now, a month later, I find out he’s with that girl, and I feel hurt all over again. I don’t know if she made a play for him while I was away, or if she waited until a few weeks after he dumped me and that truly wasn’t in his mind when we were broken up. I wish I did know, but I am not even sure if it matters. Is there any way to protect myself better in the future? It was the first time I’d been in love since my ex-husband and while I didn’t necessarily think it would be forever, I also didn’t think it would be over so fast.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67454,public,self,How To Know If He’s Lying (Even To Himself),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ss9p6g/how_to_know_if_hes_lying_even_to_himself/,some_ads,7,,,,,,b50cbf0c-3935-11e9-a609-0e217b8f2048,Seeking Advice,,,,,,

I just wanted to say, I had to break up with him again and I am particularly miserable. After a week of not talking via text, or at all, he messaged that he missed me, and I wrote back saying, I know, it's hard! 
Which led to a barrage of texts, walls of text, trying to convince me to come back and of what he could offer. This is a man who does not speak my native language very well, and I don't speak his in a social way. I couldn't connect to him, whereas he seemed to not really be aware of a lack of connection (?) Or, he seemed blinded by the want to just be in a relationship. I tried to get him to see my side of things, but he was not able to. 
It was too late already! Part of what turned me off was the pursuing too much!!
It triggered me because my ex husband did that pursuing thing with me, and I often felt cornered.
So I had to tell this ex bf today, again, that it was over, and to have some respect for himself, - you shouldn't be trying to convince someone to stay with you, they have to want to be with you!! And to not rely on me for all his self esteem and happiness, and to essentially ...grow a pair?! (But not with those words) lol

We met about a year after I was divorced (2014- was a set ufor by a mutual friend) and I was enamored within a few weeks.  Having left a loveless marriage that had no friendship or romance, I found all of it in this man and became smitten.  I felt “addicted” to him, the way he doted on me, spoiled me, we traveled, he made me feel on top of the world, and the physical connection was amazing.  I ignored all red flags even from the very beginning (he seemed a bit narcissistic, a know it all) and also had an odd protective nature over his ex wife (who he claimed cheated and stole money from him). We loved hard and we fought hard and must have broken up 15 or more times over the years.  He was always doing the breaking up.  Would literally say I don’t want to be in a relationship seemingly out of the blue and “break my heart”Most breakups lasted a few days to a month once or twice but then one of us would reach out and cycle repeated.  I allowed him back in.
He has an aggressive demeaning gas lighting nature that triggers my short temper and I  would react.  He then used my reaction against me to tell me all I do wrong and I’m left thinking what a terrible person I am questioning myself!!!  I have been on this roller coaster on and off for too long.  I am 99.9% certain he’s cheated although he’s smart enough to never get caught - and just when I gather the strength to end it, he breadcrumbs me and pays attention to me and I give in.  I’ve been in therapy and I know it’s a self esteem issue on my end that I’ve allowed and put up with his narcissistic behavior and bread crumbing.  Here’s the plot twist- when I am now physically next to him, the rose colored glasses come off.  I’m no longer smitten or attracted to him mentally due to the years of mind f*cking and hot/cold behavior.  However I’ve been unable to put on my big girl pants and fully disengage because I don’t want him to give someone else what I once had from him!!! So much attention, affection, love, adoration.  I was dying of thirst and he gave me an endless supply of water in those early years but I see now the water was tainted.  I just can’t help but remember how those early years felt and how I was the happiest and felt so loved for the first time in my adult life.   I know this relationship is long over, and I’ve tried dating on and off but haven’t met one decent guy who sparked an ounce of interest.  I am smart, educated, people say I’m beautiful, I have a great job and am an excellent mother but I cannot dig deep and move on with dignity from a man who has truly messed up my mental well being.  I’m afraid of letting go.  Addicted to this man who now treats me terribly.  Throws me a bone by calling me.  I Wish somehow those early days/feelings could return because I thought I was so happy; now I wonder how much of it was a charade on his part, to win me over then the narcissist came out.
I want to move on and give dating a fair chance.  I just cannot seem to fight the demons of jealousy and let go of this man.  Any advice is much appreciated.

I couldn't believe my eyes! I mean, finding someone in real life?!!!! After my failed attempt in OLD. (I just encountered ghosters (after months or few dates, sex or no sex the guys just disappeared)). I decided to simply quit dating altogether.

This was refreshing, I went without even thinking I'll meet  someone. We had a lot of things in common, he talked a lot, shared and we seriously had a great time. 

We decided to go out again, first dancing and then listening to some live music for the next date.

He walked me to my car, he was hugging me, holding my hand and then he asked me if he may kissed me 😂 (never got that before).

So we kissed, talked a bit but it was cold and also late. In my way home, he send me several texts just after I left and one with the ""looking forward seeing you in 2 weeks for dancing"" (I have my kid this weekend). He never been married or had kids.

Anyway, texting him it's like pulling teeth. He responds after hours, I mean 5-6 hours... And basically it's just like a ping pong game. I ask something he responds. His interest level went from 100 to non existent. 

I saw he was more of an introvert, I'm an extrovert. I know I  barely know the guy... but this person ""texting"" me (if we can call that texting) is a completely different person I met.

I'm mirroring his interest, I tried to make the texts engaging and leave a door open for discussion. But to be honest I don't think he's interested at all.

Met on Facebook Dating the day after Christmas and went on our first date 2 days after matching. 

She has a good government job,, loves what she does, owns her house and is pretty well off. Kind of has her shit together. Openly admits she was in a shitty 14 year marriage with a guy who didn't want to work, was an alcoholic and abusive. They've been divorced 3 years and she's talked about other past relationships that just didn't work out since then. I don't know specifically what ended them but her last, longest was just about a year. 

I, have a decent job that I moved 18 hours away from my kids for. It's definitely a dream job and love what I do. I'm much more paycheck to paycheck and literally rent a over priced room and am struggling but still manage to make it happen. I'm also divorced from a 17 year marriage, separated just over 2 years before the divorce became final July 2021. 2019 was not a good year for me and it helped lead to my divorce. I've been through therapy and done the work to better myself and try to be a better person everyday. I haven't really dated since my separation. Spent the time focusing on getting back into a better place

Things between us hit off really well. I start staying at her house and almost living together for about a month, only going back to my place to do laundry or nights she went out with her friends. We have good conversations about our days, but thats about it. We don't really have a lot in common other than shared interest in sports and certain TV shows.... 

While staying here I've pretty much picked up the normal dude duties and make real effort to help cook, clean and all the other things that she needs done. I try and help out as much as I can and be the best partner/boyfriend/ whatever you want to call it, I can. 

She has told me, and it's obvious she's very independent. Which I think is great to be honest. She had made a comment on one of our first dates that she can't figure out why she can't find a good guy. I don't know why, but it just stuck with me. Of all the things we talked about that night, that really just sticks out in the back of my mind. There have been other little things like that along the way. 

Relationship wise, I feel is kind of one sided to a point. To save time explaining, she's almost always cold. Won't approach for hugs. Not really showing much affection at all.

 Sex is the same; one sided. It's really about her. I'm always the one to hold her until she falls sleep. Like not even lay on my chest. 

I've tried talking to her about walls and moving forward but it just doesn't seem to be working. I've been open about past and current situations. It just seen so one sided and I'm not really sure what to do next. I noticed the other day she's still getting notifications from FB Dating but I'm not sure if she's replying to those or not. I don't want to come to conclusions or overreact to something that's not there.

We both know this is a serious relationship with a view toward marriage eventually but are giving it at least a full year together before considering getting engaged. However, we have been discussing potentially moving in together at some point.

Both of us own our own places and we live less than a mile apart. Right now has been on the easier side because I currently WFH with my job. So I’ve been spending the night with him and the weekends with him almost every night. (He has a considerably larger house and I have a smaller condo I like to keep as my space).

Where I am struggling is I had a relationship a few years ago where we moved in together quite early and things went terribly wrong. Granted, my ex was a bad alcoholic (something it took living with him to figure out unfortunately) but in retrospect I really didn’t know him either and went too far with emotions instead of practicality.

In this relationship I’ve spent a lot more time getting to know my partner but lately it is a tad bit frustrating to be going back and forth. Because I don’t want to seem like I’m moving in prematurely, I keep shuttling things like clothes and cooking ingredients and some toiletries back and forth between the two spaces and also dog things. And even though we spend so much time together I haven’t been as assertive about doing MY things (like reading, or projects at my house) and instead doing HIS things, which I feel is a function of more feeling like a guest at his place (because I am).

My boyfriend is a rare gem who keeps his house in order and will not let me help beyond things I insist on helping with like the dinner dishes or making the bed but he has also pointed out all the room he has in his bedroom closet and all the room in his kitchen cabinets where I could leave the things I bring back and forth for cooking.

Lately I’m feeling a little all over the place with this pattern but I guess I’m still so scared of committing to this kind of thing too early. I had planned on keeping my condo even if we do marry as a rental as it’s in a good area but I think also to give me an out. I’m very worried with returning to the office next month and a commute, how that is gonna put additional pressure on the relationship but I’m having a hard time articulating what it is I actually need here.

Has anyone been Ina similar situation where the timing felt kind of too early and yet too late at the same time.

I've been seeing this gentleman for about 8 months now. Going to preface this by stating that he is the Ying to my yang. He is the most considerate, awesome guy I have ever met. I could go on and on, but I'll spare you. 

In the first few months we always spent a night or 2 at my place and he never brought a toothbrush, but his breath wasn't offensive. I also thought maybe he didn't plan ahead to bring stuff for a sleepover. As we are getting more serious, so does his breath. I've brainstormed some ways to broach this, but reallllllllly need advice. I want to make this work, and I feel it should be an easy fix.. but I want to make sure I do this right. 
My options...
- buy him a toothbrush for my place and mention I noticed he never brings one... 
- straight up say in person that I need someone who brushes their teeth
- say it after sex
- text it

I default to keeping things respectful even after a woman escalates things.  I generally don't have a problem in person and don't have a problem ""making moves.""  

In person, I can respond to her signals and body language and that is much more comfortable for me.  Over text, I seem to get a bit stuck in ""don't be a creep"" mode, or ""this could be misinterpreted,"" which I think comes across as more friendly than showing her I'm into her.

Some examples:

If a woman texts me, ""Hey sexy!""  I generally don't reciprocate with a pet name or anything.  I'm still a bit stuck in the mindset of ""women don't want a 'hey beautiful' or 'hey gorgeous'.""  But that's probably not correct if we've already been out a time or two and kissed, right?

A woman texted asking what I was doing.  I told her I was at the gym.  She said she was betting I looked hot while working out.  I responded with some silly workout GIF.  It was either that or a dad joke about them refusing to turn the fans on in the weight room.  Seems like a confident/cocky response may have been more in order (like ""Yeah, I kinda do) or even the dreaded gym selfie so she could see.

If she sends an explicit picture, I'll typically respond with, ""Wow, so hot!"" or ""How am I supposed to get any work done now?""  If she sends an explicit text like, ""I want your \_\_\_\_"" I'll typically respond with something like, ""I can't wait to see you too.  We're going to have fun.""

Anyway, I kind of get the feeling they're a bit disappointed in my responses.  What do you think?  Once there's been some level of intimacy established, do I need to dial up the sexy flirting a bit?  If women (generally speaking) are used to guys getting too sexual too soon, do I run the risk of having her think, ""What's wrong with this dude?""

I have set clear boundaries since separating &amp; have made it clear there is no future for us romantically, but that if we can be amicable for the kids, it would benefit them greatly.  He continues to cross boundaries by;

- sending texts asking me out for drinks
- sending ‘you look sexy’ texts after we see one another due to kids.
- bought me flowers &amp; choc for vday
- texts me in the middle of the night to say ‘I was lucky to have someone who loved me like he did, but I threw it all away’
- tries pick stupid fights/make passive aggressive comments by text, which I don’t respond to.
- created a profile on tinder &amp; tried to match with me.

He has a temper and gets worked up when I tell him to stop, but ignoring him usually keeps things peaceful and him at bay.  Im trying to set gentle boundaries and keep him calm because he can be an ass, but I know how to ‘manage him’.

She dressed up. We walked in the park. Then we enjoyed a romantic evening in a wine bar. This is the nicest date I’ve ever had with anyone. We expressed our mutual appreciation.

Two days later I received a long message. She told me it was a wonderful date. But she was disappointed that there were no flowers or other tokens like chocolate. She said all that in a nice way. But she was also direct. She said it is one of her love languages. She expected it for Valentine’s and was upset about it.

We are still somewhat new to each other. We have been seeing each other about 5 to 6 times in two months. I find her special and like her very much. She has expressed similar admiration.

I have mixed reactions to this. I admit my style falls short on the romantic gesture. While this can be interpreted as demanding and a rebuttal of me, I also appreciate her directness. If it were my ex-wife, she would become sullen and passive aggressive. If I ask her what she wants, she would be offended and shocked that I cannot even read her mind. In contrast, the way she communicates her dissatisfaction is also what makes her special.

Hi everyone:  I wanted to update this sub after posting my shock almost one year ago.  Before this post, I had grown comfortable with the idea that perhaps I would not find ""the one.""  Sure, I still felt like dating and perhaps developing a relationship, but any idea of finding a soulmate was absolutely out the window.

We are celebrating our first anniversary on Saturday.  Whether this relationship lasts five years or fifty, it is by far the healthiest relationship I have ever been in.  We communicate openly about our interests and needs.  We support each other.  Perhaps \*because\* we met in our 40s instead of our 20s and 30s, we can make this work and be open about what we need to make it work.

I want to share some thoughts and encouraging words for those who might need them:

* Yes, there is someone out there for you.  There could be several ""someones"" out there.
* No, you have not ""run out of time.""
* To correct my original post: No, you are not ""too old"" to find a real connection.
* No, not ""all the good ones"" are taken.  
* If it's worth it to you to look, keep looking.

I (45m) met a 33(f) on bumble on Christmas Day. She is originally from my hometown and was here visiting family but lives in another city six hours away. We had a wonderful date and spent the last couple days of her vacation together. Things got hot and heavy and we definitely liked each other and decided we would keep in touch.

So, we’ve been keeping in touch with phone calls at random times and three weeks ago I invited her to a concert that is going to be happening  in a city that is in the middle for us. She quickly said yes and was super excited which felt great. In the weeks leading up to the concert we chatted and both are really looking forward to seeing each other.

Yesterday, we talked again and everything was great. She even talked about staying a second day with me just hanging out in the city. I didn’t expect us to be spending two nights together so I was pleasantly surprised but did not act that way surprised.

Today, I sent her a text message with the hotel information. She quickly wrote me back saying that she was excited. Then, she said by the way I forgot to tell you that I’m going to have to leave on Saturday before 2 PM to because I forgot I purchased a ticket for an event with some friends and was reminded about the event today.

I want to trust that she is telling the truth but my Spidey senses tell me that she may be telling me a little white lie. Truthfully, I didn’t expect to spend tonight so just seeing her one night and going to the concert with her was all I had ever planned. 

A part of me wanted just to call and cancel the whole date because I felt she was being inconsiderate.

So I am back to online dating . I am a woman and I have seen in many posts and in my own experience there a many men who are on online dating just for sex and will lie about their intentions. My last post on a different subreddit was a post asking when would be the appropriate time to visit a man’s house with dating, and that was very revealing to me as well because many men chimed in on the post and said that they expected women to have sex with them by the third or fourth date. These men seem to have little regard for prioritizing womens safety and comfortability and they were more focused on their own sexual desires. When I brought this to these men’s attention, the men seemed to justify their entitlement by saying that they needed to check for sexual compatibility. 

I think many women would be uncomfortable having sex by the third or the fourth date, Spending three or four hours in total getting to know a person over three dates does not tell you if this is a person safe enough to have sexual intercourse with. It’s just crazy how men have created these rules for themselves that are very self-serving.

With that being said, I believe I have spent a good portion of my 20s dating men who are more interested in my beauty and the sex that I could provide rather than the other things I had to offer and we’re not dating with intention but dating for conveniency and lust. I was able to figure out what they were about after sometime, but it was sometimes difficult to figure these things out and some men were very good at pretending. To give you some examples, there was a guy I dated for two years and after we broke up he said “thanks for all the sex” rudely. Another man that I dated for sometime when I questioned him about his previous relationships he told me that he dated a woman for a year only to realize that she was too old for him. How do you not realize someone is too old for you? It was fishy . I think he found someone else he was more interested sand wasted this woman’s time. 

Another guy tells me that he dated a woman for a year and when she asked him if he had any plans to move in with her he said no my job is here and I don’t ever plan on moving. He also knew that she had no plans of moving since she owned a house with three kids. He strung her along for a year it sounded like. It was clear that he was casually dating this woman and was always commenting on how attractive she was a reason why he liked her. I accused him of being a casual dater and of course he denied it. 

The amount of men that I have encountered with online dating for clearly trying to be something there not just to impress me to probably sleep with me speaks volumes. I am very concerned about wasting anymore of my time and youth on men like this.

One poster on my previous post suggested that I wait until marriage to have sex again. It would not be from a religious standpoint and I am not a virgin, but it would be to rule out these types of men. I am interested in if it would be successful. Some men were commenting on my previous post saying that they believe that they need to have sex at some point before committing to a serious relationship in order to find out sexual compatibility. In my experience men are not very picky about sex compared to women, so I kind of think for a lot of men they could use this as an excuse as why they need to have sex early on or at all. However I have an idea if this is really an issue for men, and I do agree being a woman that sexual compatibility is something that I need for myself. My idea is that I would properly vet men for 1 to 2 months and explain my situation of how I would like to wait to have regular frequent sex until married, But that I would be willing to have sex with them a few times after vetting them for any red flags to make sure that we are sexually compatible. I would then say if we are on The same page and we would both like to find a person that is a life partner and get married, to have regular sex we would need to move on to marriage. Do you think that this is a good way of ruling men who are casual dater‘s and more interested in the sexual part of the relationship?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67662,public,self,Weeding out those just interested in sex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sv5amz/weeding_out_those_just_interested_in_sex/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I texted him and said we need to talk about something tonight (last night). He asked if I'm pregnant, I said no. I wish that was all it was. He ended up calling me when he was alone and it took me awhile to get it out (including tears because I really didn't want to hurt his feelings), but I said basically... its a deal breaker and I noticed he doesn't brush and it really turns me off. He instantly apologized and explained that he lost his toothbrush in travels and just hasn't made it a priority. He was embarrassed that he let it get to that point. He told me I could have just handed him a toothbrush and he would have understood... but that I couldn't have said it in a nicer way if I tried. I started to over-explain, as I do, and he told me I didnt need to say another word. He understood the assignment. He instantly went out and bought a toothbrush for home, and when he got to my place he brushed with the little man kit I assembled. Today he casually mentioned he has a dentist appt for a cleaning on the wknd. I'm satisfied and I feel really good about his reaction and things moving forward. 

This is a huge lesson in not giving up on people because of one flaw. If he had of reacted different or refused... it would have gone south... but some men do have a brain and compassion and I feel extremely lucky.

First time poster. 
Gonna get straight to the point. 
I was recently introduced to a guy who owns a car repair workshop. Then I also gave him my car to fix.

The first time I met him he mentioned a girlfriend, and then a few weeks later he told me the same story but this time about his ex-girlfriend, so I assume they broke up.

I absolutely have a crush on him. And in the chats we had, I felt like we had a connection. I made some jokes about road trips, he told me about the ones he had been on. And vice versa. It kinda felt like the interest was mutual. 

I sort of told him it would be cool if he came to eat at my friend's restaurant, which was supposed to be a kind of back handed invite, but he neither said yes nor no. I don't actually remember what he said, but it felt non-committed. 

His mobile is on the invoice, until now I only had the number of the shop.

Would it be totally inappropriate to send him a text along the lines of: ""Hey xy, I hope you don't mind that I took your mobile number from the invoice, as I wanted to ask you if you would like to grab a coffee with me?""",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67691,public,self,Asking my mechanic out?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/svj2i9/asking_my_mechanic_out/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,
