2. Secondly, for me being a introvert is really hard to make sense of what to do and how to approach considering I might only see 3-4 times(that too for a hi-hello) before I move out of the current job.

Me and my gf (both 14, both lesbian) have been dating for 4 months now. We go to the same school and even though we'd only been friends for a year, we realized that we often saw each other in the hallways and had a massive crush on each other for years. I'm very much in love with them and I'm pretty goddamn certain they are too. I've never felt so loved and safe in someone's presence and they mean the world to me. However, there's something that's been troubling me for a while now.

Let me introduce their best friend. Let's call them O. Now O has been best friends with my gf for over a year now I think. They're very close and they seem nice. But I'm so jealous of them. And I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. The reason for this feeling was that first of all, my gf was in love with O for a very long time, but O wasn't interested in a relationship. If I wasn't aware that they were in love with them, I'd have confessed to them ages ago. It was only like 2 weeks before we started dating that they told me they got over O and I felt like I could shoot my shot. And whenever my gf hangs out with O, they seem so much happier.

O is tall (I'm tiny) and funny (I'm dry asf) and lives near my gf (I'm pretty much in a different city than them) and everything I feel insecure about. Even tho my gf swears otherwise, I feel like they feel bored with me and would rather spend their time with O (tbh this insecurity stems from my previous relationship where my gf left me for their best friend even after swearing that they couldn't think romantically about her at all). I know my gf is happy with me, but both the fact that they used to be in love with O and how they're so close makes me feel slightly uncomfy. I feel more like a third wheel between them. My gf is aware that I'm insecure about O and there's nothing either of us can do about it.

Another thing is that my gf is still friends with their ex, let's call them A. A is in the same school as us and just like O, is in the same bus as my gf. I've no problem with my gf being in contact with their ex but in this case, something feels off. As per my gf, A isn't a bad person but was a bad partner. They constantly body-shamed them and ghosted them. It's not like my gf is still particularly fond of A but it makes me feel uncomfortable because in the early stages of our relationship, they told me how A still meant so much to them and the only reason they were alive. People in their bus constantly ship A and my gf together and it makes both of us very uncomfortable.

I know my girlfriend is now in love with me and me only but I can't help but feel so possessive. The reason I'm posting this today is that on Christmas, my school is hosting a celebration and even though it's like an optional thing, my and my gf planned to go and hang out after that later, like a date. But apparently, O is coming along as well and I'm not sure how to feel about it. It's not even like I can say anything about it to my gf since O has no other friends attending and they'll be left alone. But I really wanted to have some alone time with my gf since we had planned a sleepover for months but had to cancel it. I'm so sure I'll feel left out with just O and my gf, I asked if my friends, who will also be hanging out in the same place as us, could come along. My gf said they weren't comfy with my friends but said they'll do it if that makes me feel happy and I feel so terrible. I feel like a possessive and jealous person for feeling this way about O and my gf. I feel like I don't trust them enough and like a toxic and bad partner. At the same time, I wish I could be more honest with my gf about my feeling since I'm tired of myself compromising my feelings all the time, but I can't do that since I can't distance them from their loved ones who probably make them happier than I ever could.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140006,public,self,Am I toxic to my partner?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn0i26/am_i_toxic_to_my_partner/,no_ads,0,,,

I am an inexperienced 22M who was seeing a 19F in college for one month. We went on 3 official dates and hung out a few times outside of that after running into each other on campus. I was denied a kiss on date 2 because she was not comfortable yet, but she still invited me out on date 3, where she said her grandfather died. Thus, I did not try to be physically intimate so I wouldn't be viewed as taking advantage of her emotional vulnerability.

Well, ever since the grandfather died, she canceled a lunch date the night prior to see her professor and sort of became aloof. I gave her time to grieve while I focused on finals, and then we started texting again recently. I asked to FaceTime since we are home for break, but then she took a day to respond, only for her to say she was tired from her new job. Two days later, at the high point of a text convo, I suggested we hang out over our winter break, only for her to wait another day and say that text ""overwhelmed"" her given everything going on in her life: a new job, death in the family, moving home after her first semester in college. She said she's ""still figuring things out.""

I am lost. One week ago, after she did cancel lunch, we did run into each other and got dinner, which she said put her in a really good mood. Now, a week or so later, this happens. She said she sees a therapist for anxiety, and I don't think she's experienced in dating either because we both confided in each other that we struggle to make connections in college. So I am not sure where I went wrong. I think our connection was/still is real, but she does not seem ready right now. She did NOT say the classic ""I am not ready for a relationship,"" but she did say ""I'm still figuring things out. Everything going on in life has made me on edge. I sincerely apologize for how I have been acting.""

So there you have it. If life truly did get to her, then I got screwed over by terrible timing. Also, it does not help we just went home for winter break. If she was letting me down gently, I don't know how things went awry in just one week. Maybe she reaches back out or maybe she doesn't. I won't wait around, but I think she was being truthful about life getting to her considering everything started to fizzle out once the grandfather died like the flip of a switch.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year (feb 2022 will be a year). I am with her, not because of necessarily how I felt, but more because I feel comfortable around her. I can share most things and I feel like she’s not super judgmental. In some ways she is, but other ways she compassionate. We don’t fight much and we’re good at resolving issues. She listens and is attentive. I’m not with her because of how I feel, it’s more because it just works and I can trust her. But I’m afraid that it’s not fair to her. Like shouldn’t I be head over heals for her? Isn’t that how love should be? Shouldn’t I feel butterflies and euphoria with her? For me, it’s more like she’s a partner in life. I love her and and I’m protective, but it’s not this overwhelming feeling, nor has it ever been. It’s been a gradual admiration. Past loves we’re different. I was irrationally head over heals. They never lasted and we’re very toxic. 

We both have extreme trauma from abusive parents, so I don’t let myself fall in love the way I used to.

If i ever do consider pursuing a girl i like this leads to an endless cycle of  finding more reasons to convince myself that she would never be into me. If a girl seems like she likes me i’ll convince myself that she is just bring nice or its platonic. Another issue is that i am way more comfortable with girls in relationships because i know they are taken and i can just be myself without them thinking i am hitting on them.

My name is Callum, Im 18 from the south west of the UK. Thought id make a post to try make some friends in the community as i dont have any i can have good talks too relating kinks etc or maybe find someone for a long term dynamic.  Im a submissive and masochist.   
  
Im in college at the moment but while not there i enjoy playing video games or chilling with my dog. I want to try get out more but with covid is a bit of a sticky one.Some of my main games at the moment are dead by daylight, halo infinite and valorant. I enjoy watching tv. I usally go for a mythical/fantasy based show that has real life features like vampire diaries, the order, lucifier or more crime based shows like criminal minds and S.W.A.T.   
I listen to a lot of music. My taste differs i just mainly listen to the lyrics and i add a song to my playlist if i like the voice of the artist and the lyrics of the song. Some of the main artists i listen too are The Kid Laroi, Giveon, Lewis Capaldi and Finneas. My humour in my opinion is good. I tend to laugh at most things quite a dark humour. My coping method for things is to laugh and i like to joke about myself a lot.  
Kink wise im into most things im more of a try it before you judge it person but i can list some personal main interests of mine: Facesitting, pegging, humilation(SPH, etc), Degradition, Feminization, Body worship(Armpits, ass,feet,etc), Orgasm control, Ruined orgasm and more i just cant name them all as theres so many lmao. Limits are only really illegal things. My main thing is getting pleasure from my significants others pleasure so in them terms i would try any kink if its what gets them off.

Sometimes it feels like you’re the only one getting rejected, while you’re looking in at others who are embraced by society. This simply isn’t true. Everyone has experienced harsh rejection in their lives.

- Those who imply or claim that they never get rejected are lying. Plain and simple.

- You have to embrace rejection if you want anything in life. It is the principle of seeking pleasure vs. avoiding pain. If you seek out things you desire, you will encounter frequent roadblocks

- Everybody has insecurities and shit they’re dealing with. Even the most attractive, seemingly socially desirable people are insecure about something. Someone’s public face doesn’t always align with their internal struggles.

- Those who are rude to others usually have internal strife, or other insecurity. If someone is rude to you, don’t take it personally. Those who are at peace with themselves and are happy treat others with respect.

- Remember the people who care about you. There are hopefully people out there who care about you for who you are, and love being around you. You only want to pursue those who feel the same way.

We had really good chemistry over text. He told me that I was really hot, and the cutest guy in town, and he was very attractive too, being a former model. We went on a first date after a week or so of texting, going out for lunch, and it went well. He lived an hour away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd consider dating someone so soon after he got out of a two year relationship a few months before, but that there was something about me. We made out and he held my hand for a bit as he drove me home. 

We made a plan for a second date and kept texting each other. He started going through some stuff, him and his family having to move unexpectedly and him trying to take out a loan to get a new house for his family, and I'd be there for him, sending encouraging texts. He told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that no one else is as smart as me except for him, and that he might be my perfect match. I have difficulty socializing, so I've never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. No one's ever said stuff like that to me, and I was so happy to hear that this guy really likes me.

 He said that he wanted to have sex on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. He said it had to be in his car, since his family was having to leave their house and I lived at home too and wasn't allowed to have potential romantic partners stay the night . And it also had to be unprotected. I told him that I was nervous to be penetrated since I'm a virgin, and I wasn't sure how I felt about my first time being in a car, and he said that I just had to get over it. He eventually said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that is being in a relationship would be delayed until we had sex, because he wanted to know how good it would be. I was going to go through with it, but a few days later I thought that we wouldn't be sexually compatible, and we went our separate ways.

 I've been having trouble moving on from him since it happened, going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who saw a future with me. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked if he really did like me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he said that he did really like me at first but that I ruined it.

 I've been thinking about it recently and did I ruin it or did he? He liked me enough to see himself spending his life with me but was very insistent on having unprotected sex in his car on the second date, even though I was uncomfortable with that. And we'd only be boyfriends of the sex was good enough. That's a lot of pressure to put on a virgin, and he knew that I was one.

34M, never had a relationship last over a month, usually dies around the time sex happens. Main reason being I can only get turned on by kinks, namely being submissive in the BDSM sense which is a really shitty problem to have considering most women aren't very kinky and those who are are almost always only interested in subbing. It'd be nice if I could make do without it, but the cravings for it get extremely intense and I know it's an itch that needs to be scratched if I'm going to be content long term in a relationship.

FWIW I'm also willing to do vanilla sex acts with women too, it's not like I need (or want) all kink all the time, and I can get into vanilla stuff emotionally, but so far never sexually, at all. So fingers and mouth can happen, but PIV is off the table due to physics. *That said*, I suspect if I got really comfortable/close with someone things might change since I do find I get a lot more interested in vanilla sex if I'm starting to develop feelings, but that's hypothetical since, again, never gotten in bed with anyone I feel sexually comfortable around yet.

That raises another issue though, which is that I suck at creating sexual chemistry because I don't really care about having sex and tbh want to avoid bringing it up precisely because I can't have sex. But I also know you have to do that stuff if she's going to have any interest because she is, after all, dating not looking for friends. So I try to fake it as best as I can, which I guess works well enough judging from the results, but turns out you really can't fake sexual interest even if you are interested.

Now unfortunately I've tried the IRL BDSM community for years and they're just not my people, so that's never come close to panning out. There are kinky dating sites, but you're lucky if you meet even one real person on there much less someone you're actually interested in. So kink first doesn't seem viable. Which is fine, kink is just one of many aspects of a compatible partner so it can wait, but that leads to my dilemma: When and how to tell women I'm dating about this?

I don't want to bring it up before we've gotten sexual because it seems like putting the cart in front of the horse. OTOH I feel like waiting until after a shitty sexual experience to bring it up isn't much better. And it's not like I ever get a chance to wait out the shittiness, they're gone soon after. And because why should things be simple, I *also* have a history of trauma which I have gotten a lot of therapy for and made a ton of progress with but some of my intimacy issues stem from it too, so that's something else I feel like is probably best brought up before sex to provide an explanation for some of the awkwardness.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140067,public,self,How and when to tell people you can only get off to kink?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn658c/how_and_when_to_tell_people_you_can_only_get_off/,no_ads,0,,,

The last years wasnt the best for me. I realized that i have anxiety now. I would like to change that. In the past when i saw a couple kissing or in a party i didnt had problem with it. Sometimes i did that too. I felt the balance. But somehow times changes and now i have this feeling when i see a happy couple i instatntly feel that im a less person becouse i cant get anyone. I had several rejections but somehow i went through thoose. But now the last 2 rejections hurted more. And i dont know why maybe i was in love with them for real. But this brings up the problem that i fall in love easily. I just would like to know how should i change myself ? or which parts. Becouse the rejections without explonation doesnt help me that much. Or it can be that i found bad girls ? So yeah im between this situation where i try to find whats the problem with me and is there even a problem or its just unluck ? I would like to improve myself. And kill this anxiety about the dating. Becouse i know that its not serius abaout being angry for other couples. So can this be real that this 2 ""relationship"" totally broke me ?. Or there is something more behind it ? Before this i had nothing like that i was like okay next time i will be successfull. Why i lost that ? I think that i was so close with this to be a good couple and yet i failed that. And i think this is the hardest part for me. I felt like that i failed in the finish line. And i dont know the reason. Btw i went to a therapist severalt times becouse i thought it could help. So the question is where should i start ? I should rebuild my confidence somehow.

I (31m) started seeing someone (27f) I met on Hinge in early September. Instant connection which continues to spark and get better as we continue to deepen things-moving slowly but surely, and always so excited to see each other again.

As things progress she tells me she has feelings and she’s trying to make me her boyfriend. She’s planning dates and even wants to know if I want to rent a cabin with her and have a romantic New Years together. I’m in!

We’re both from hometowns near each other and agree to drive back for thanksgiving. She’s all smiles the whole way, hours pass like minutes and we cap off the drive with dinner before going out separate ways.

We spent the weekend following the holiday together, dinner, drinks and meeting my friends while she’s telling them all how much she’s into me and hopes I am too. (Spoiler: I am smitten)

After a physical night together in a hotel i got us, We drive back together and she’s a bit quiet. I ask her why and she admits her friend (female) admitted her love for her and she’s sad she has to cut her out of her life because there’s no attraction. I console her and she holds my hand and all is well again.

Once back, we make plans to see each other before I head out of town. Don’t hear from her much which is odd but I don’t think much. I check in to see if we’re still on to hang out and… silence. Nothing on a follow up the next day either. I give her the weekend and enjoy my weekend out of town.

Still not hearing from her, I call her out for ghosting and ask when I can get my stuff back. We arrange a time to meet and talk.

She explains she just needed time to think (I gave her a week without bothering her) and was planning on responding after a time. She thinks we’re not right for each other because I’m close with my family, love kids and celebrating the holidays, and she’s the opposite. (???) 

She also says she’s worried about dating long distance when she starts doing a work abroad in 6 mos (even tho we had already talked through me visiting during that time).

I explain that’s all understandable but I wished she’d been upfront instead of going ghost out of the blue. We end amicably, she kisses me and walks out the door. I take it on the chin and move on as best I can.

A couple weeks later, she blocks me on social. I immediately realize she hasn’t been honest, but what can i do?

But my friends aren’t so forgiving and she didn’t block them. Eventually they see what she’s hiding. Turns out, she’s posting make out photos of her and that very same female friend she was “cutting out” of her life. They’ve been in a relationship for at least a month.

With my first partner, we were together 2 months before i was finally comfortable enough and was able to get it up. after the first time, i never had another issue getting an erection again. with my second partner, it was the same story. The first 3 times i tried to get intimate, again, i could not get an erection. The way i solved the problem for that though was taking 25mg of selendifil. After i solved the issue with the selendifil, every other time after that was completely normal. I thought if maybe i got some of my own stuff similar to selendifil, in the future i wouldn’t have this problem again, so i ordered some tadalafil online. I never had the need to use it until recently. Me and this girl have been friends for about 5 years now and have always been really close. 

out of nowhere, we both seemed to have sparked interest in each other. Well, a few nights ago i stayed over at her house, and when getting intimate, i again couldn’t get an erection. i didnt think this would be a problem this time around since i know a lot about her and we’ve been close for so long, but i was wrong. Tonight, again, tried to get intimate, but same issue. Only tonight, so i could be safe, before i went to her place i took 20mg of the tadalafil so i could ensure that i could get it up, only i was not able to fully get an erection no matter how much i tried.

I’ve had a male friend for years and he’s always had a flirtatious personality. All of his friends are women. I confided in him during one of my breakups since my ex cheated on me, and we got closer. I started to find myself falling for him, even though he had a girlfriend. I never said anything to him that flirtatious but he was always the first one to lurk my social media or like my posts so I called him “my biggest fan” jokingly. That’s as far as it went from my end. Looking back, I feel guilty about this because I don’t think I should have flirted like that. While his girlfriend studied abroad, he always said “I don’t trust myself around you that’s why I don’t say hi anymore in class” or he would invite me over at night saying she won’t know. I denied every single advance he made and I told him that if we hangout, his girlfriend needs to be present so she knows I’m not attempting to try to take her boyfriend. During their relationship, he berated her and said she nagged him a lot. He had sleepovers with his girl best friends and said she wasnt okay with it, but his logic was he was an individual and can do what he wanted. I always argued with him for that. Told him it wasn’t cool what so ever. He called me hot while he was at work bartending so that was the final straw and I admitted my feelings to him and ended the friendship because I didn’t feel comfortable speaking to someone knowing they’re taken. I’ve had guy friends in relationships before and was completely fine, but for some reason I felt creepy about this? Like I’m doing something extremely wrong? Anyways, he didn’t respect that and kept trying to message me. Very shortly after, they broke up for unknown reasons and a couple of months after that, we slept together once and he ghosted me forever. I want to know if I’m a home wrecker. For some reason, I never behave this way but I feel like I did something extremely wrong here. I have an incredibly large guilt complex. Like I have trauma from childhood and I’m naive with peoples intentions. I’m wondering what I did to bring this on myself and to keep me from behaving this way again. Any insight is welcomed.

I noticed a few days ago she didn't have him on social media anymore and was debating just taking a shot and asking her out. She then posted a story about how her boyfriend broke up with her and blocked her on social media because he owes her money and wants to get out of it and that she doesn't really care about the money but just wants her bunny back and the stuff that's hers. She just wanted to warn everyone about him and warned other women to avoid men like him. I just responded hoping that things work out and saying that she's a good person and will come out stronger one day from all this. I would have asked her out if it wasn't for all the other stuff she's dealing with and I just don't know if it's insensitive to ask her out and when.

I have no idea if she just broke up with him or if it happened a while ago and I want to be respectful of her situation.

We are pretty friendly with each other and would hang out occasionally in our friend group outside of work. He is a cute and goofy bi guy and exactly my type. Unfortunately, the fact we were coworkers and that he has a partner and kids made me feel super guilty and anxious, leading me to conceal how I really felt about him. 
Despite this, throughout the time we worked together, at times it seemed like he was flirting with me, some examples being: calling me cute, a snack, and baby, joking about kissing me, touching my arm and thigh when laughing, and saying he wants me close to him while he was drunk. It wasn’t a constant thing but happened enough for me to notice. 
When it happened I would always just laugh it off instead of flirting back because of how nervous I got not knowing his intentions. The logical part of me figured it was all just a friendly joke to him and that I shouldn’t read too much into it, but the dumb hopeless romantic part kept clinging to any crumbs of affection I wanted so badly from him. 
As of now, we no longer work for the same company, but we still hang out sometimes and my feelings are just as strong. I think I’ve done the right thing up until now by not flirting with him since he’s in a relationship. But going so long suppressing my feelings without telling anyone has led me to feeling very depressed and isolated.
