Original post: [BF Birthday and blowing up his life](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qglo2l/bf_birthday_and_blowing_up_his_life/)

* My transfer was approved 2 weeks ago.
* Email last night from Corp. He has not been shortlisted for the position directly above him. 
* His current position will be eliminated. 
* Position below him is open; he is, in fact, conducting the interview with an applicant later today

In the month since the first post, we talked ""around"" our relationship and moving in together, but decided to wait until  we are in person at Christmas.

This is what I said last time:

&gt;Now, he's being weird.  
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't promote him into this specific spot. Says he'll move to another country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship. When we spent a week together in the beginning of October, he expressed concern about his future as he ""approaches 40"" -- he would like to change companies and countries, but ""doesn't know what to do about me.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 6 hours-- and letting him vent about workplace issues. Asking him about his corporate future. NOT mentioning me or us.

and, this is how is it now:

Now, he's being conversational.  
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't ""fix"" the mess created by eliminating his position. Says he'll move to another city in our current country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship.   
I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 12 hours-- and letting him work through workplace issues (including that today he has to interview a person for the spot below him, which technically he should consider!?). I sent him a lengthy email which laid out how I see his choices, and how I feel about each. Verified that I want what is best for him, don't want to pressure, but absolutely want to be in his life. He hasn't read it yet; I'm so much more secure now than I was a month ago.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,62316,public,self,"Update, and a twist -- no promotion, current position being eliminated",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r1qekq/update_and_a_twist_no_promotion_current_position/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So there are a lot of reasons why dating is really, really hard for me and why it’s pretty unlikely to happen that often. I’ll spare you for now and cut to the question. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m often the only one in my friends groups, for the past few years at least, who’s not actively dating anyone, never married , etc.  

I have my reasons, like I said. But it just kinda sucks and makes me feel kinda broken and alone the older I get. I feel like I’ve sometimes kinda lost friends to relationships, even if that’s not their intent. For example, I try to meet up with friends at shows and then they bring a date and don’t want to hang out. Or I start seeing way less of them once they’ve “found someone.” I feel like I know people who are almost afraid to be single..? I don’t know what it is.  

But it’s just kinda wearing on me to always be the only single person, the only one going out alone and leaving alone. I am not actively dating, in the sense that if I meet someone in meatspace and things click, cool. But otherwise it’s not a huge priority for me…and I hate how isolating that can be. 

How do you guys deal? I’ve kinda defaulted to being alone and single for really most of my post-college life, for various reasons, and it makes me feel so behind my peers sometimes, or like I will be perceived as being stunted or defective somehow.

UPDATE: we went out last night and came back to my place after a few drink &amp;amp; ended up getting more physical but we both mutually stopped before having sex. He said we didn’t need to rush things &amp;amp; I expressed my boundaries if he’s not ready to date. He explained that it’s more him having his kids nearly full time &amp;amp; wanting to focus on them and doesn’t want to only make time for dating the infrequent times he doesn’t have them. That he’d want to invest more. We kind of left it as we both want to still take it slow and spend time together when we can. I do feel he is being genuine &amp;amp; honest with me as he’s a strong Christian man &amp;amp; I believe stands by his convictions. Would love any opinions on this.
For the record. I’m not putting my life on hold to wait for him. I’m not on a mission to find someone to jump into a relationship with, more about building something healthy &amp;amp; strong. This is by far the healthiest getting to know someone.


Over summer I met a guy on Instagram. We live nearby &amp;amp; have mutual friends. He had just gotten out of a relationship &amp;amp; we both mutually wanted to take things slow &amp;amp; build off a friendship but did express interest in each other.
We talk/text pretty regularly &amp;amp; have gone out a few times. Recently he express the reason he hadn’t kissed me yet was because he wasn’t ready for a relationship but could see himself in one with me.
The next time we went out, we ended up cuddling &amp;amp; kissing a few times. 
We have a lot in common &amp;amp; really connect. I honestly thing that might be what scares him… I want a solid foundation. I’m in no rush &amp;amp; im not closed off to meeting others at this point.
I want to let things happen but at the same time, I don’t want to progress physically if he isn’t really ready to date.
There’s that fine line between taking it really slow &amp;amp; fwb. But I have a strong sex drive so TBH I’d rather go without if the physical isn’t frequent.
I just don’t know how to tell him this.
Basically I’m happy to take it slow &amp;amp; more of a friendship &amp;amp; as much as we have chemistry, I don’t want to be physical unless/until he’s ready to date.

In the beginning, I was guarded because of lovebombing experiences in the past, but recently felt that I am opening up more emotionally. His communication is consistent and I am not seeing major red flags. We have not (yet?) said that we are exclusive, see each other once a week and often on another weekend night. First sex was rather awkward because I had too much to drink. This was totally on me. He spanked me after I said I liked it and was very dominant. Has lots of experience with that. Overall it was fine, but here is my problem:

Now he stopped sleeping with me after that one time. Only cuddling two times in a row. He says he feels pressure to behave a certain dominant way, we probably started on the wrong foot, BDSM stuff needs more trust, wants to get to know each other’s bodies better. 

That seems ok but he did not really answer the question if he is sexually attracted TO me, just said “I think you’re attractive”, then mentioned what else he likes like being smart, which sounds kind of different. We could also have vanilla sex instead?!

Great intellectual and emotional connection besides that, but now I feel rejected and insecure, which I told him. There is also a power imbalance in regards to money and age (I am much younger, early forties to his late fifties, and dirt poor compared to him, though happy with what I have and do). 

He has no problems getting it up and I am sure he has people to sleep with. That thought annoys me too because I am not even one of them atm and would also like exclusivity at some point

we all have a past and we're all dating because it didn't work out with our past partners. we did share our 'trauma', for lack of a better word right now, so I know it was bad for them.

Women are too picky. Men are too simps. 

Women are looking for a prince on a horse with financial stability while they post arse pictures on dating apps. Where men don't do jack sheet with their lives and choose to play video games all day without purpose. 

Do you have a dating app? Feels like you can just swipe through people and hope you get a good husband/wife from that. But we all know that both genders talk to at least 10 people on it lol dirty as hell.

Storytime:

I met this chick one time on a dating app, went out with her, and both had a great time. We exchanged numbers and socials. But all of the sudden she went ghost on me. I was being a little beach and freaked out about what went wrong in my head. But then it clicked. She mentioned in one of the conversations that she's too busy all the time, but when I asked with what, she just replied ""I'm just busy"" red flag? Prior to that we had long conversations that never stopped, we talked about anything really, we laughed, we talked serious and silly topics. Sometimes she would be online but chose to not reply. She mentioned multiple times that she lives alone with her dogs and cats and usually just watches TV on her free time. It almost felt like she just wanted attention from a dude whenever she was bored lol The last message I've sent her was, look it's getting too late, if you wanna hang out again, hit me up and we'll plan something out. She seen it but no response.

Then after a while I started working on myself and giving my hobbies more time instead of basically chasing. I posted my work on socials and got great responses from my friends. Then as it seemed she started posting pictures with random dudes in restaurants, which she never did. As a joke I liked one of the pictures and commented ""he must be a great father of yours"", which I got laughs from people. At this point I moved on, worked on my projects, and to my surprise started receiving texts from girls from high school that I used to know. And went with couple to hang out and actually enjoyed my time. Point is, when I stopped concentrating on people and putting them on a pedestal, others would start concentrating on me. Just because I found a purpose to be happy with myself. 

For the girl, I still have her as a friend on social. Why? I'm not sure. We haven't talked at all. I don't seek no ""revenge"" or interested in minding her business. But I see her looking at my stories and such, which she never did before, I was surprised. Do I want her to text again? Kind of. Just to know the reason, but actually don't mention it. But do I want to just move on? Yeah.

We are both single parents and our oldest children are the same age.  She has expressed to me many times that she wants me in her life and that she wants to grow older with me.  We have even joked about getting married and cohabitating together in the future.  All 3 of our kids are best friends and talk with each other almost daily over FaceTime while they play a game called Roblox.   All 3 of our kids have had sleep overs and we have all gone on day trips to the beach as one big family.  It is not like the kids are strangers.   

Now here is the problem.  
She has put so many hard boundaries on me lately that it has become impossible to try and keep track or respect these boundaries.  She only lets me come over when her kid is with his father.   She won’t even text me anymore when her son is hime, which is most of the week, as she has full time custody of her son.  She comes home from work all of the time now and complains that she is exhausted and that she is busy at work.   While she is at work, I see that she is online messaging most of the day as I can see the little green dot that shows she is using Facebook messenger.  
All this changed this year when school started back up in our local area.  
Our relationship now feels like a long distance relationship than what we had just this past summer.  We hardly ever see each other and when we do, she plays on her phone the entire time talking with her BFF girlfriend.   
As I push and try to get back to the close relationship we had earlier this year, she tells me that I am crossing her boundaries and needy.  
I can understand about respecting boundaries, but is seems that we were closer at one point and that she has systematically distanced herself just over the last few months.   I have tried to express my desire and respectfully brought this up in conversation a few times.  And every time I try and talk about this, she brushes me off and dismisses my conversation.  

Am I being unreasonable for asking to continue being as as we once were?

I’m single and annoyed. I’m jealous if the people who seem to have their stuff together. I used to think I was one if those people. I don’t want to get into a relationship at this time of year.  I wonder if I’m too broken to date, but also find myself wanting to spend time with someone who would appreciate a good guy.  I wish there was a way to get through the holidays and not dealing with happy family and friends, and being asked if anyone special is in my life.  I know why the holidays are tough for some folks.

It's been over a year, it was going extremely well until a few weeks ago when several new and some pre-existing factors worked against us. I'm still in the processing stage and expect to be for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

Before that I was in a LTR (over 12 years) with the father of my kids. I ended that when it became obvious the dynamic was toxic and wasn't going to change. I felt like I did a lot of work coming out of that (counselling, self-reflection etc) to understand my part in in, and that did help in this current relationship in terms of speaking my truth, even if that hastened the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk about transitional relationships. I get a lot of wisdom from this sub, and remember ppl talking about the first relationship after a long term one. That we can gravititate towards someone who is the opposite of the traits we found so difficult in our ex. So in this case I went for a calm, gentle, emotionally aware, understanding and compassionate man. However, in delighting in these qualities and the relationship we created I missed (buried) a few red flags - avoidance, fear around commitment, different financial perspective from mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also read that the grief when one of these relationships ends can be overwhelming. I've definitely been there this last few days. Why is that I wonder? Is it something to do with feeling ""this had to be it"" as it was so dissimilar from the previous LTR. or that you'd finally met ""your person""?

Tell me about your transitional relationship and what you learned from it.

After being a widow for over a year, I started dating again.  I had a lot of fun, and it really taught me who I am, what I bring to the table, and what I need from a partner.  I have also realized what I am looking for in a person and what ""mistakes"" I have made in the past I don't need to repeat.   

Here it is 5+ years of dating and I am ready for a relationship again.  I thought I found the one when I started dating this guy (42M).  He is a great guy, and we had a lot of fun, but it wasn't love.  We broke up initially because he thought I couldn't make him a priority (single mom that is also finishing her degree). After a long talk, I realized what he wanted, was something that he was never going to provide for me.  I know how you have to juggle both your children and your partner and put their needs when it is needed.  He never had children didn't understand that.  After all that is said and done, I think he was scared.  He had said every relationship he ended came down to whether he thought they would make a good mother.  Now that I am a mother (which he constantly was telling me how great of a mom I was) he didn't have that excuse.  He also mentioned many positive things about me, and when it came to an end he listed a couple of very superficial reasons.   

After a few days of everything settling, I realized I loved the way he treated me, but not him.  So we talked again, and we became great friends.    I even brought up some of the superficial things he said and how he himself was no better.  (one of them was he couldn't be with someone that wasn't healthy... I have a minor knee issue that will require surgery here soon and then I will be good as new..... he on the other hand has a brain tumor that isn't causing issues right now, and he refuses to get it removed, but it is growing and could cause issues down the road)   He admitted that was lame!   

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am great and know what I want in a man.   The point to this post (I swear I'm getting to it) is every man I start talking to seems to disappear or finds a reason not to take it to the next level.   Many friends and their boyfriends agree I am a catch,  I have my life in order, I hate drama and don't create it, I'm honest, upfront and there is no BS to me.   I don't believe in pressuring anyone to be in a serious relationship.   I am better than that and shouldn't have to beg.   I even had to end a friendship with a man because there was always interest in each other but due to being in different states, we couldn't commit to each other.  Unfortunately, he told me he wanted commitment, but after 24 hours he rescinded.   Then after a couple of months, he text me how much he was an idiot and wanted to try.... then 24 hours he changed his mind. So I said bye!  We can't even be friends if I open myself to an emotional relationship on;y for him to get cold feet, twice!

We met online, chatted lots week before, he seemed super kind and enthusiastic via text so I was excited. When I tell you this man talked incessantly…it was intense to say the least. I heard his entire life story within the first 30 mins. He kept saying, “oh I wanna hear about you” but never let me talk. Then when I finally did he’d keep interrupting to say something my thoughts had reminded him of. He was very nice and I thought maybe he was just nervous so by the time we got to the second—and last—spot, he was really grating on my nerves. He talked and talked and talked and talked. I am extremely gregarious and this completely shut me down. Apparently it was so bad that when I finally managed to get to the bathroom a woman followed me in to make sure he wasn’t my ride. We laughed about it and then I realized i wasn’t being judgmental, he was obnoxious. He walked me to my car and went right in for a kiss. I pulled back and said I had to go and he was raving about how great this was. He texted me when he got home and said he can’t wait to see me again.

The backstory on this is very long, but I'll summarize as best I can to take us to the present,..

We met online 13 months ago. We're both single parents of 2, her (F, 43) kids are a little bit older than mine (M, 45). We've had a few stops and re-starts along the way, but we've always stayed in touch, seemed to always have a connection. In the last several months we’ve grown more intimate, have had sex several times, but we have not defined what we are. We have not met each others’ kids, families or friends, though that might change in a week or so if she doesn’t back out of a Christmas party being thrown by a longtime friend of mine. Obviously, her coming with me is a big step.

With her birthday less than 2 weeks away, I am looking at the big picture of how she’s shown up in this relationship. I have reached a point where, I’m not sure I feel like giving the acknowledgement of it much effort. For example:

* Her main method of communication is texting, and she is a notoriously slow texter, even when she initiates (which is pretty steady that she reaches out to me). A phone call is rare.
* She has only initiated a date once, and that was for my birthday this summer. She is an INTP personality-type and hates to plan, and wound up leaving it to me to pick the place and try to make a reservation last minute. She wound up stepping up and getting it done, and we had a great night. I will admit, she never says no when I ask her out.
* Mother’s Day, I gave her a nice, potted flowering plant, and a card. Father’s Day—I got a text.
* When a few weeks had gone by without us seeing each other, I sent her bouquet of flowers, just because. To date, I’ve never receive one thing.
* When we hit 1 year since the date we first met online, I sent her a card I made to acknowledge it. She loved it, but she didn’t even realize we had hit one year.

I want to clarify, she has not stated any expectations of me to do something for her birthday. This is all me.  There’s the half of me who adores her, then there’s the half that’s frustrated with her.
