After that my anxiety and depression got really bad so basically I never dated and never had a gf after that. I'm 25 now and while I enjoy being alone, recently I've been feeling very lonely.

Currently I have 4 different dating apps installed (started about a month ago), I think I'm not ugly, maybe slightly above average and have pictures where you clearly see my face and I described some of my interests in my bio. Surely there is room for improvement but I think you get a good impression of me from my profile.

I get almost no matches and the few ones I get, it is really hard for me to start a interesting conversation. I can have great conversations but my SA makes it so that it takes a longer time for me to open up. Idk I kinda have to know if you're the right person to be myself around and I can be a bit of a nerd. So often I come across as boring or weird I think and I get ghosted frequently.

I am not the guy who uses pickup lines or jokes to start a conversation. I  always try to find some interest of her, in the best case it's a shared interest and try to start a conversation about it but idk I somehow it just doesn't work in most cases. I had a match recently that was into photography and I tried to start a conversation about it bc I think its a cool hobby but she ghosted me already on the second message. And with some girls I have a good conversation but than we have a different opinion on something and.. ghosted (one even unmatched me). And sometimes it feels to me that some girls are so annoyed by the other 1000 guys that message her probably every week that they come over as very uninterested, only give short answers and seem to don't ask questions about my interests. Than I also lose interest in the conversation.

Is this how dating works or are my social skills just bad? I gotta admit I am a bit of a sensitive guy and I am trying to get used to the rejection but honestly recently it's very frustrating and I'm starting to think that dating just isn't for me.

I have yet to kiss her. Hell, the only thing I've done is touch her arm while talking to her. She's reserved with her emotions, even admits she isn't emotional, and because of that our dates have felt ridiculously platonic. She shows no interest romantically, just interest in me as a person.

But we have talked about a ton of stuff, including where we want to live, life plans, children, etc. So clearly she sees a possibility of a relationship....? Enough to keep going on dates? I can *feel* her interest, she just doesn't show it, so I'm at a loss.

Assuming we go on a third date, I want to kiss her. If i don't get any sort of romantic gesture or even physical touch reciprocated I'm probably just going to end things because it just feels weird.

So how do I go about kissing a woman on a walk where she's reserved with her emotions and treats me platonically? I don't want to make her uncomfortable, but I want a relationship and not a buddy.

Do I just stop mid-walk, grab her face and lay one on there? Do I just ask her if I can kiss her (it sounds lame but it guarantees consent?).

I knew this girl from high school for several years an acquaintance. In college we met up a few times and got closer, to the point where I asked her out on a date. Nothing ever really came out of that and we stopped talking and things just fizzled out. 

Now, over a year later I see her at minimum 4/7 days a week for various classes and extracurriculars. In the span of 2 months we have never made eye contact or spoken in person, but we have been texting on and off the whole time. 

And the thing I don‚Äôt get was that she was the one who reconnected over text. She‚Äôs been the one initiating conversations over text. It‚Äôs just in person where nothing happens. 

So its just confusing. We will have a text conversation one night, and then the next day ignore each other in person. 

I‚Äôve sorta come to the conclusion that the only way to end this cycle is to approach her myself and verbally say something like ‚Äúwe should catch up in person over food‚Äù or something. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm also just tired of pretending she doesnt exist lol. It‚Äôs made for some strange social interactions already where 2 people in the group just dont talk to each other.

I'll meet someone new and it's pretty obvious to both of us that we're both interested. We'll chat and get to know each other for a while whether it's at work or school or the gym, whatever. I don't do anything that can be seen as creepy like ask for her number too soon or try and set up a date or anything like that. Just a good wholesome chat about light-hearted stuff.

THEN, the next time I see these girls, they do a weird retreat. Some of them will smile big and wave when they see me, but they have very little to say and act like they're busy and need to do something elsewhere, away from me. I take it as a polite rejection so I don't push it after that but it has me seriously questioning my whole life now haha. 

Here's my best guesses as to what's happening. 

1. She's still interested but now she's more nervous to talk because she feels some kind of tension?
2. She was interested at first, but after talking with me initially she lost interest and doesn't know how else to tell me?
3. She feels like I must not be interested in her because I didn't ask her out or get her number during our first conversation?
4. She wants me to ""chase"" her a bit more so she doesn't come off desperate?
5. I somehow creeped her out at first and now she's afraid of me?

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously have no idea what could be the case but it's a recurring problem so it must be something I'm doing wrong. What is your take? has this happened to you? I cannot stress this enough I'm a pretty keen socializer.

Decided to end things with my FWB today, I don't know how to feel about things right now, but I knew it had to be done. To start off my story we were acquiescences and our relationship grew to a friendship and he ended up kissing me. Our FWB lasted 6 Months. We had conversations where he stated he just does not want to be in a relationship at all and prefers to be in an FWB which I understood because I wanted the same thing at the time. He told me cares me for as a friend. He is the type of person who is emotionally unavailable and I notice in time that his texts would soon turn into one-worded text. I notice he distanced himself away from me also.

I started to feel like crap and stressed out since my feelings started to grow stronger for him in time, but I knew he just does not want a relationship.

My issues in finding a girlfriend are:

1. No friends/social circle - I can't find a girlfriend through friends that's what I mean. I moved from a village a few years ago and I still haven't made any friends in this city, and really I didn't have any proper friends anyway.
2. Country - a small, conservative country. Picking up girls randomly on the street or at bars and such isn't really a thing, I tried and it just doesn't work.
3. Can't do online dating - There's only 2 sites for online dating in this country, and I tried both for several months, it went beyond bad.

Anyway, what can I do guys? I'm really desperate. How do I meet women? I've thought about maybe joining some activity, but there's not a lot going on in this country. There's dancing and sports only, I might try dancing once the pandemic is over but tbh the option probably won't really succeed for me for multiple reasons but I WILL try for sure, cause I'm that desperate. Meetups dot com isn't a thing here, literally no results for this area. So what can I do?

So.
I'd just finished an evening shift &amp; driven home, it was about midnight &amp; we were texting. He *really* wanted to come over ""just to cuddle"" because ""he was lonely"". Lol. I was pretty tired &amp; said so, but still eventually consented &amp; gave him my address. We've known each other for years, and talked, but had only just gotten flirty recently. 

It was the dag end of winter &amp; so I'd lit the fire as soon as I'd gotten home, while we'd been messaging. We hugged when I answered the door &amp; I'd led him into the room. I went to sit on my bed, he stood with his back to the fire talking to me. It was awkward. I'd expected things to go a bit quicker? But instead he was just talking kind of casually, about why he didn't want/have a job at the moment &amp; how his teenage daughter was starting to skip school &amp; he didn't know what to do with her.

All kind of a turn off? I just wanted to get laid &amp; go to sleep. The more I heard about him &amp; his life the more I started to think about whether this whole thing was a good idea or not. Instead of just getting my rocks off &amp; thinking about all that later as things started to go wrong (or right, I suppose it is possible lol) anyway instead of just doing it, I was thinking about it. Not a good idea. He was still talking, with a few unenthusiastic ""yeah"" &amp; ""uh-huhs"" from me thrown in. Seemingly completely unaware of how dry I was becoming. 

Eventually I cut in - ""uhh, (name) - I'm getting kind of tired over here? I'm going to have to go to sleep soon..."" 

He replies ""Oh, uhh, yeah, uhh... I'm just waiting for an invitation...?"" 

In shock, I say the first thing that comes to mind. 
""Dude the bed is literally right here?"" &amp; instead of moving over to the bed/me.. there is just an awkward silence. 

Then he just, keeps talking.??? I honestly can't remember what he said now, the whole thing is a bit overpowered by the memory of what came next... 

After blinking a few times I decided that nope, that was it. I was done. But er, not being the most mature &amp; assertive type in the world? I also (for whatever reason) chose in the moment not to actually just fucking say that &amp; kick the poor man to the curb. Nope. Instead, I decided to ""play possom"" &amp; pretend to go to sleep. 
I know. Not a great move. I don't have a good defence on why Past Me did that. I sure did though. And it is a bit scary actually, to pull this move because... well. Frankly you've got to rely on the other person not being a creepy rapist? And actually behaving appropriately in the situation.

Well. What happened was (after a good 5mins of continuing to talk, not noticing I was ""asleep"") he did come closer to the bed, I could like... feel him doing it? I was trying to breathe naturally &amp; everything. I felt him sit down at the end of my bed, near my feet. I could hear him breathing heavily, almost clumsily &amp; I could imagine him just staring at me intently. It was weird. This went on for at least a minute. 

I was so afraid to open my eyes, even a little bit. I didn't know what was happening? What he was doing?

Then he began to... To bounce. Yep. To ""bounce"". He was sitting at the end of the bed, next to my legs, &amp; his whole body was bouncing. I could hear the springs (it's a cheap bed) &amp; I definitely didn't want to open my eyes now.

This went on for a good 2-3 minutes before finally he became still. The whole time I focused on just trying to breathe like a sleeping person, because holy shit I sure as heck could not ""wake up"" now could I?! Finally he got up &amp; I could hear him walking towards the front door.

I waited until he was definitely in his car (I heard the slam as he got in) before I dared to open my eyes. I still didn't actually move from my bed until I was sure he was driving away, was on his way out &amp; would not be coming back. That was when I got the fuck up &amp; went to the kitchen to pour myself a very strong drink &amp; try not to think about what had happened.

I waited until about midday the next day, before sending something like ""hey sorry haha warned you I was really tired"", he replied ""yep you did"" &amp; I then proceeded to leave him on read. A week later he blocked me but hey it's a small town &amp; I hear that he has a baby with someone else now so all's well that ends well? I guess?

I would like to get back into the dating scene but I am scared about several things:

1. I don‚Äôt ever want kids. Ever! But it seems like 75-80% of the population want kids so I think that would limit my dating pool a lot

2. After my first relationship, I got my heart broke twice. One was a recovering alcohol i who I was friends with for a year but he friendzoned me and recently started dating another dude (he‚Äôs bisexual). Another was a coworker who just simply wasn‚Äôt interested. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily help my confidence with feeling desirable and makes me scared to jump in there all together.

3. I am not ugly but I am still rather‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.plain looking: https://www.instagram.com/p/CWBwbuUPzFR/?utm_medium=copy_link. I am scared that will limit my dating pool as well.

4. I still with my grandparents. Granted I am currently saving up to move out but there is still a stigma of people my age living with their parents so i don‚Äôt think it would look attractive to most guys while I still living with the old folks.

Whenever I think of relationships, those are the emotions I feel.

I‚Äôve been single my entire life, and every time I‚Äôve been close to escaping this endless void of loneliness, some wild shit happens. It‚Äôs happened like four times this school year ALONE (it was more last school year). The first time, she said she was interested and started dating some random dude the next day, the next time I‚Äôm about to get into, the third time we were going to homecoming together but then she last minute changed plans, went with some other guy who asked her out and uploaded a TikTok of them dry humping on her car,  and then one girl just straight up lied to me about a whole bunch of shit which I don‚Äôt even want to explain right now.

I‚Äôm getting more pissed off about this because this girl who we will address as ‚ÄúHannah‚Äù since there‚Äôs no personal information allowed (but I would name drop her if I was able to because I‚Äôm fed up at this point) and what she‚Äôs doing with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúMelvin.‚Äù

Hannah told me she liked me because some guy asked her out and she said yes, but his number was under my name for some reason. We both agreed to not do anything official or anything because I knew her ex. She accused her ex of emotionally abusing her and getting his brother and his friends to bully her as well. Then I found out she was lying. How did I? She was flirting with Melvin, who I‚Äôve known since elementary school and we‚Äôve been hella close over the years.

But anyway, we both stopped talking to her. I even abandoned her at the lunch table I used to sit at and she had to sit alone lmao (don‚Äôt fucking play with me.) But today, I saw they were walking together after school and based on Melvin‚Äôs Instagram story‚Ä¶ they were on a little date. They went to Pet Smart and Mod together‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall see why I‚Äôm frustrated about this? And I was already kinda starting to dislike Melvin because he (trigger warning for this next sentence: sexual assault) forced his ex to give him oral sex which is never a good thing. 

Like I understand I‚Äôm 15 and a sophomore in high school, but this shit happens way too often. I‚Äôm tired of it, I‚Äôm ready to give up.

I have never been kissed, been on a date, never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, and never had sex.

I have been in love with many different people at different stages in my life only with women who weren't even my own age. They were all 30-40 years older than me. I just convinced myself that they loved me when they actually didn't. I assumed they loved me even under the most innocent circumstances. I gave more meaning to their compliments and kindness more than there actually is. After meeting with them and after a few interactions, I would think about them for weeks, months, years. They were on my mind as soon as I woke up, and before I went to sleep at night. I always needed to have my heart set on somebody and somebody to think about. I was in love to the point where they occupied every space in my mind. Even while I was doing something, they were always in the back of my mind. When I listened to a romantic song, they popped in my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about them no matter how hard I tried.

I built up these fantasies and I would play out many different situations in my head over again a thousand times, imagining what my life and a relationship would be like with them. As much as I imagined how they looked to me. It wasn't like I was only attracted to them. I had a longing for them. I would yearn to see them in person, even just being in their presence. They would make my heart beat fast and give me butterflies in my stomach. I relied on them for my happiness, to the point where my life revolved around them, when I saw them I was so happy, and if I didn't see them for a while, I became sad.

I have been asked by many guys to go on a date, and I kept saying no, no, no. I refused to try real relationships because I wanted to remain faithful to the women I made fantasies about in my head because I would feel as if I were cheating on them. I was also very jealous, to the point where I couldn't bear the thought of them loving someone else and having sex with someone else. I also got jealous when they interacted with people right in front of me. I wanted them all to myself.

I think part of my fixation comes from me being lonely inside. I have no dad, I have no friends, I have no siblings, I have no relatives. The only person I have is my mom. I just go to work and go home and I don't go anywhere else or do any activities. It doesn't seem like the people at work even want to be my friend.

But this is how I want to live my life. I don't want to change anything about it. I want to be a virgin for the rest of my life and continue having fantasies. I don't want to ever kiss anyone.

The woman I am currently dating is almost at her limit. 

I suffer from ED and performance anxiety since I was sexually active (19) it embarrasses me and puts me into negative thought processes, while for her she is suffering from a lack of self esteem because of this. It has severely impacted how she looks at herself and her eating habits. 

I am ashamed of myself and feel quite useless and emotionally raw right about now. 

Today was the first steps towards trying to address the issue. I have contacted my local medical clinic, talked to my therapist, booked an appointment on sexual therapy and seeing a psychiatrist on my birthday. I truly love this woman and want what is best for the both of us. 

I am currently on antidepressants and while it can impact sexual performance and libido, I have had sex while not medicated and still had the same outcome‚Ä¶

Yes I take viagra and while helpful it does not address the roots of my problem. 

My question is fellow sufferers of ED and performance anxiety, what were some things that you found helpful to ease the stress and emotional pain you suffered from? Is there any reading material or podcasts you would recommend?

I really want to get better for the both of us not just for the sake of sex, but I want to be able to express my love for her in all ways, not just some. I believe deep down that she is the ‚Äúone‚Äù  and I want to show her that I am committed and express to her in an emotionally healthy and mature way. 

I look forward to hearing your comments both positive and negative.

Started talking to her a few weeks ago now in a dating app. We have been in 3 dates technically now. First one, she came over to mine we had dinner and watched a few films, was a nice time and she ended up staying the night and we ended up having sex. 
2nd was an impromptu do you want to come over tonight, enjoyed the night and nothing sexual happened and she left after a few hours as expected. 
3rd date we went out to a sporting event together which was a lot of fun, and again came back to mine after and she ended up staying again. 

I'm usually someone who doesn't feel that attracted to someone until I get to know them better and have more of a connection. 

I am just kinda looking for advice / your experience with these situations as,  she is great in so many ways. She is nice, caring, we clearly share interests and get along great and I have never felt so comfortable so quickly with someone. No awkwardness when she is around, we'll happily cuddle or whatever for hours, we communicate really well and neither of us are uncomfortable asking for anything or discussing different things that typically people feel really awkward about. I do like her and like spending time with her. 

But I feel like something is lacking? I don't have that "" I want to see you all the time"" feeling.  I enjoy talking to her, and look forward to the dates. But I feel like a spark is missing.

And she has clearly told me she is very much into me and really likes me.

So the twist is that I don‚Äôt drink for philosophical and personal reasons but I‚Äôm not completely opposed to it. 

1. Would it be weird to buy wine and then not drink it with her?  
2. Would it weird to buy wine maybe have a sip or whatever and then not drink the rest? 
3. Would it weird to have her keep the wine since I don‚Äôt drink. 

Also how much would be appropriate to spend on this first ‚Äúdate‚Äù or whatever, I have no clue if it‚Äôs a date I just asked her to join me on my birthday and she was like ok.

Or maybe I seem emotionally unavailable and cold, but I‚Äôm pretty open and am very considerate on dates. I got to thinking about this after I had this date with a girl who seemed so emotionally healthy despite knowing she‚Äôs been though a lot and I was impressed. We get to fooling around and she‚Äôs telling me how she wants to have meaningless sex, and she just unleashed this sexual frustration onto me (which is cool and all), but I felt objectified and like a piece of meat lol.

I actually told her this while we were messing around bc we were drunk, but I don‚Äôt remember what she said in return, I think she just stayed quite but I can‚Äôt remember. She was throwing herself at me and she wanted me to overpower her, and she was doing all this dirty stuff and this was our second date. It felt absolutely great in the moment but I don‚Äôt really get any pleasure out of it after, bc to her it seemed like I was just attractive enough to make her feel desired and wanted, and I‚Äôm not sure if she wants to even see me again. 

I don‚Äôt get it, I don‚Äôt even like her physically that much, but personality wise I‚Äôm extremely attracted to her. I‚Äôve known her for like 4 years and this was our 2nd time hanging out, and I feel like I did everything right yet still she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship. She was my highshcool crush and 10th grade me dreamed of being with her and there I was choking her and spitting in her face (a request from her), but maybe it‚Äôs more of an ego thing to say I fucked my hisghcool crush.

I thought about how I‚Äôm providing value for these girls and while having sex used to be something I would be psyched on, I‚Äôm at a point where I would take a meaningful relationship over sex or just fooling around.
