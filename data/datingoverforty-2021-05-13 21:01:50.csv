5,nc0rzt,1620968430,That First Time with Someone,"I am wondering in the case of the ladies out there, after your first time having sex with a guy, if it didn't live up to long-period of waiting and anticipation, did it kill your attraction for him? Here's my story...

Last Saturday, a woman I've been seeing on an off during the last 7 months came over. We got dinner, and had great conversation. So great, the time flew by and it got to a point where she was going to have to leave in about 30 minutes because her kids were home alone (they are 11 and 13). Leading up to this date, we had done a lot of texting with sexual innuendo and I felt confident this would finally be the night we'd have sex. Alas, it was slipping away. 

When it became clear she'd be leaving soon, I initiated a kiss that quickly became a passionate makeout session that after some time, lead to our first time having sex with each other. I know it was uncomfortable for her being on her back on the rug (she commented ""rug burn"" at one point). I felt like our bodies had a hard time getting into a rhythm. You could say it was awkward. I'm surprised because our previous times of getting sexually physical, when she was staying the night, we seemed to be hitting on all cylinders. I know in the back of my mind, I had the clock going and worried about her being able to get home instead of enjoying this experience and being in the moment. Of course, I ""finished"", she didn't. She then left about 15 minutes later as now she was running pretty late to get home.

Since that evening, we've been in touch, though it's been more me as the initiator than her. While our texts have been a lot of fun, flirty, with sexual innuendos,  I haven't been getting those good morning/midday check in/ late night texts before bed from her like I did in the past. We are getting together for our first ""day date"", going kayaking this Saturday. It's unlikely we'll have a chance to have sex again for at least another 2 weeks, as we're both single parents. This really bugs me because I know that first experience could have been so much more had I just taken the lead earlier in the evening. It didn't have to be rushed.

Could the hurried first time be impacting her attraction for me? Do I ask for her take on that night, use it as a springboard to a discussion to find out what she likes in bed? I really would like to see things continue on because I see a lot of potential here. I sort of lost her once, and really hate to lose her again. I just don't want to come off insecure, thus further killing what appeal I might have left.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nc0rzt/that_first_time_with_someone/
6,nc0uj3,1620968724,Is the car that someone drive important?,"I'm 42M. I recently had a heated exchange with my friend on what I drive and I'd like to get other people's opinion, especially from the ladies.

To give you little background, I am divorced and my 5 year old lives with her mom 80 miles away, and I  bring her over to my place every other weekend. Couple months ago, I dropped off my child to her mom's house and on my way down on the freeway, my car broke down (10 year old Mazda, just over 100k miles). Thankfully it was not a serious issue (spark plug) and I was able to take streets and drove under 30 mph to get home safely. I repaired the car and it runs good now. 

I told that to one of my friend and he recommended that I should get a new car. His reasons are because I drive long distance with my child and it could put her in danger if my car breaks down again. Also if I were to date, it would be more attractive. I don't make a lot of money but I make enough to pay bills, child support, and save, etc. I guess I can buy a car but then it will put me under debt, which I prefer not to. Right now, I'm focused on saving to buy a house and getting into another debt is a no no.

Now this friend of mine keeps telling me I'm cheap and the woman I will date thinks I'm cheap and driving better car will make me look better.. and his shit talking continued (I don't mind that.. we're best friends for 30+ years and we talk a lot of shits to each other). I think otherwise. My car has been pretty reliable except this one time. I rather not spend money on car and either save or go out for a nice dinner. Driving better car may make me look like I make decent money, but it doesn't change my income.. it actually decreases my net asset. 

So does the car that someone drive make you think different of that person? The change I'm talking is like from 10 year old Mazda to something like Tesla Model S or Tesla Model X, which I had the slightest temptation to purchase after my car broke down. That means $1,000 - $1,500 less savings per month.

At the start of the relationship she seemed ready to get into something serious (I told her up front that I was looking for a serious relationship) and it looked like it was heading that way until 3 months ago. We went on weekly dates, spent a weekend together,  talked all the time., and I sense real potential that this was the start of something good. 

Then things changed... she went away for a weekend with her kid and the communication sort of tapered off from there.  I called her out on it and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and purposed we be friends with benefits. 

2 weeks later she changed her mind and said she didn't want to be just used for sex and to hang out. I gave her some space and told her to call whenever she figured out what's she wanted. 

About 3 week go by, before she reached out again, and told me she's been super stressed because she was helping to.plan her best friends wedding and that she had a cross town move to plan and didn't see how I'd fit into her life. 

We talk for a but and I express how I didn't feel.liek having a relationship was a priority for her and that I need someone who puts as much effort into a relationship as I do . For example.I planned a romantic trip for the 2 of us early in the relationship and I all I got for my birthday from her was a ""hey happy birthday"" text and nothing else. 

Fast forward to last weekend. She calls me as shes getting settled into her new place to help move some stuff and being the guy I am I agreed. She tells me how much she misses me and asks why we don't go on dates any more. I tell her that she seems to always be busy or working and that I don't feel like I'm a priority. 

Anyway, now she wants to have a define the relationship conversation and discuss how to introduce the kids.Honestly I'm not sure if I want to commit seeing how the last few months have gone. 

In a way i feel like.I'm leading her on because I have told her that i like her, but I also don't want to be selling myself short and settling for a just ok relationship where I take a backseat to her friends and the work drama she always seems to have.

Came home almost two months later for the same daughter and son in laws college graduation then she goes right back. 
When we first lived together we had a heated argument over me deleting my Facebook account (got tired of it) and she misunderstood and thought I deleted HER.

Quickly on what’s happened since:

The woman (F40) - let’s call her Svetlana - trickle truthed the length of her trip out of the country that she surprised me with - what was supposed to be 10 days ended up being over a month.  The reveal came every few days.

She came back from travels and then was friendly but sex dropped off. Or more accurately, we had sex twice in a month - each time was amazing, but the frequency was absurdly low compared to prior. And this was even as she was staying with me while her flat was being renovated.

I broached the sex question directly, she said she didn’t have a frequency # in mind but ‘with the right man \[she\] can stay in bed all day’.  (realization: I wasn't the right man)

We had plans for a particular event that only happens once a year, and she did nothing to protect the evening and scheduled work calls, so blew me off. We had made those plans a month in advance. 

We had plans for the following evening and she insisted that we didn’t and that I should switch to the next day, because she had made plans with a friend.

I stopped texting and suddenly she began showering me with texts and emoticon kisses.  

I remembered what it was like to be with a woman who genuinely is into me, and this isn't it.

I'm going to break it off at dinner tomorrow night.

She had said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship; also she said she has depression &amp; anxiety and isn't good with relationships.  Without knowing her well, I wasn't sure how bad that was.  We really enjoyed each other's company &amp; conversations though, and I got to really like her.  She said she really liked me too (and at one point, we said we were developing feelings for each other).  I thought she was giving me mixed signals too.  However, when she realized how much I felt for her, she backed off a bit and said she isn't ready for a relationship.  She explained some bad trauma she's dealing with (and is talking to a therapist) that makes it hard for her to accept love and affection.  She said she can't reciprocate and thought it would be best to just be friends.

After that, we hung out at her place one time, watching TV and having something to eat.  At one point I asked about what she had said, and also asked if she might be open to anything in the future.  She said ""what do you mean?""  I said I dunno and just left it.  We watched TV some more, and when I was leaving, I asked if she'd want to hang out again the next day.  She said she'd text, and she did text the next day saying she didn't feel really well and needed to rest.

My male colleagues expressed their surprise that I have had such bad luck dating. I am far from perfect, but they kindly pointed out that I am employed, educated, low-maintenance, and honest. Like many women, though, I have been ghosted, cheated on, strung along, etc.

One colleague “B” stated the issue must be I am “giving it up too easily”. While I have never fooled around with someone before several dates, my stance on sex is that it should happen naturally, with mutual respect, when both parties are ready. I don’t withhold sex for a set time, or use it as a device to dredge respect out of men.

Am I mistaken? Is the “making him wait” trope effective and valid, or is it as outdated and sexist as I think it is? I would not call myself a feminist, but this idea seems ridiculous to me. I would think being a confident, kind, decent person who treats others with respect, would garner me some respect from a male partner - not making him wait for sex like a dog balancing a biscuit on their nose.

B has had trouble with women in the past, and this isn’t the first time he’s said something about women that was sexist, hypocritical, etc.

For context  I (48M) separated 18 months ago, been divorced for about a year. 7 months ago I met my girlfriend (43F) on OLD. We are really going strong it's a very solid and amazing relationship so far. 

I told my 3 teenage kids very early on (1 month in) that I had started to date someone which was hard for them to hear - but at least I did not introduce her until two weeks ago. For the kids the divorce was unexpected and they did not take it well, especially my oldest son. My GF now met 2 of my kids and that went well enough. Only my 16 YO son did not want to meet her and stayed in his room. I so want to take away his pain of the divorce but I can't. I am not forcing my kids to spend any time with my GF and we already decided we will not move in together as long as we both have kids at home - but on the flip side I also no longer want to hide her from the kids. I feel they need to at least start accepting that she is a part of my life.  

Shortly my birthday is coming up. If this wasn't a COVID year I would be inviting 20+ people including my GF, my parents and a bunch of friends including my ex-wife with whom the contact is amicable. But now it has to be only close contacts and I find myself overthinking on how to manage the situation wtih my GF and my ex wife. I would like to invite my GF to join along with my parents - but my GF has not even met my oldest son yet and so it may be very awkward for both of them. The kids on the other hand are definitely expecting that their mother will also visit. I set a precedent because I visited my ex-wife on HER birthday last month (after all I am friends with her), and that was just me and the kids. Now it would be super weird to invite my ex but not my GF - and my GF is not fond of that idea (I agree with her). But if I only invite my GF it will create drama with the kids and not quite sure how to explain to ex. I am thinking of inviting both my GF and ex, with my parents as ""neutral"" in the mix. My GF and ex have briefly met and that went well - but that was like 5 mins not a full afternoon. I feel so ABSOLUTELY STUPID for not being able to make up my mind over something seemingly so simple.

Yet, it seems the guys I’ve run into so far aren’t very good at the whole “asking out” thing. I don’t mind doing the inviting, and have, but it’s feeling a bit one-sided. I’ve been out with one guy several times, and like him, but I’m to the point of hey man, you need to show a little effort in the planning department. Another will text and call but make no invitation. I made the first date and want him to take the initiative on the second so I don’t get a repeat of guy #1. 
I’m not talking about doing something that requires spending money. Invite me to a park, on a walk, to the batting cages... something.  Show a little effort. 
So here I am asking about this after bemoaning a lack of conversation skills just a couple of days ago. I fear I have some difficult expectations. Is this experience normal?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ncot7a/whats_your_experience_with_who_invites/

31,ncqyd8,1621053809,Did anyone do phone dating in the '90s?,"Before there was internet dating there was phone dating. For those who don't remember or never heard of it, there were a few variations. The first one was you could leave your phone (usually for free) and then people could call a 900/976/other paid phone number to hear messages and get your number. The second way was you could call a phone line (sometimes free, sometimes not) to join a ""party line"" with other people. The third was you called a number to leave a message and got a password and box number to retrieve the message others left you. I'll admit I did all of the above with varying results. 

1. I left my number on a 976 number for free and several called me. One of the most memorable incidents occurred when this guy called. We spoke for months and he told me he was going to come and meet me. In the meantime he kept telling me he was a stockbroker, owned a condo in downtown Chicago. I was a bit young and naive (I was 18 and not very worldy) and believed he was legit. Eventually he came to meet me and we took a ride around. He kept mentioning about me moving in with him and he couldn't wait. He then asked me for a date that night at the Signature Room, a fancy restaurant in Chicago on top of the Hancock Building. He then gave me his address and phone number.  I was so excited and waited patiently for 7pm and it passed. I figured he was running late but eventually I realized he never was coming. The next day I called his ""number"" and found out it was disconnected. I then sent him a letter to the address and it came back ""no such address"". I honestly have no idea what he was up to and why he did this. I was very pretty and very thin (I had just gotten medically discharged from the navy). Did he expect sex or something? He didn't even try to kiss me! 
2. I had been talking to this guy on a party line for months and we decided to meet up. We had exchanged photos and it seemed like it was a sure thing and I was excited. I brought a friend with and he asked if I could pick up a friend of his who lived near me and I agreed. He met us at a local museume with two of his friends. Both of his friends we met there were friendly and spoke to us more than he did. While there he kept avoiding me which i thought was odd. Long story short, on the way home his friend told me he told her he had no interest in me. oesn't end there, the next day I started getting calls from the party line, seems he started giving my phone number around and saying how ugly I was. I could handle him rejecting me but this was cruel? He did this for months and I ended up changing my phone number. 
3. General freaks. I had guys show up at my house and so many lied about what they looked like. I did date two guys I met from these but neither one is special I want to brag about.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ncqyd8/did_anyone_do_phone_dating_in_the_90s/

39,nd1hgy,1621092786,I Think I Know What Happened.... should I let it go?,"I recently turned 50. I've been on my own for over a year and my divorce was recently finalized.

I started a texting conversation through an app last weekend. She's 41.

I asked her after a day or two if she'd like to meet this next weekend and she said, yes.

A day or so later, she gave me her last name and I gave her mine.

As we continued texting I alluded to the fact that I'm somewhat well-known for some of the things I get involved with in the area. (This is hard to explain without going into TOO MUCH detail and I'd rather not, just in case - you never know who is reading.)

Fast forward another day or two and things are going good with occasional texting... when suddenly I could tell something was off. I asked her 3 questions - 1 of which was about plans to meet - and she only answered the other 2 questions. Hmmmm.

I then asked her another question about something else and the answer was short and to the point.

Then the next day I noticed she had unmatched me on the app.

I haven't heard from her since.

I THINK I know what happened:

She Googled my name and there are numerous sites online that have my brief bio write-up and it mentions me being married.

Look, I'm fine with it if she's changed her mind.....or is no longer interested.....or found someone else.........BUT it's driving me crazy to think she thinks I've lied to her, especially since there's always the chance that we cross paths some day by chance.

I'm half tempted to text her (assuming she hasn't blocked me!) and ask her if there's ""something else"" she'd ""like to ask me."" Thoughts?

PS - no, we didn't go into many details about our pasts because it's hard to do in text. I planned to explain more in person and, likewise, ask for more info from her.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nd1hgy/i_think_i_know_what_happened_should_i_let_it_go/

You can be this way all week long but.... Be nice to the preacher on Sunday and give your tithes and all will be absolved..

I've found dating people of faith as long as they're open minded about it rather easy. As a Ashiest I dated devout catholic briefly which didn't work for obvious reasons though that was the only time it'd ever come into play. I also was in a relationship with a Protestant as a Pagan it was complicatedly interesting but it worked.

He is still in contact with his two exgirlfriends on a regular basis, calls, texts, even sees them. He doesn't know but I snooped on his phone last night to see his texts with them, he was just at one of their houses last night getting food from them even though he knew I was cooking dinner. This bothers me to no end, makes me feel very insecure, like he's keeping his options open keeping them around. I have confronted him about it in the past and says that nothing is going on with them but if that's true why does he hide the fact that he is still in touch with them? He said it's because I get upset about it, well yeah, if you know it makes me upset then why do you do it? I just feel disrespected and heartbroken, like I'm not enough for him.

I've tried the whole OLD scene and figured out it's not my cup of tea. I've dated since my divorce 5 years ago and met some really nice women but they weren't for me in the end. I'm not sure if I'm to picky or if I have to high of standards. It's more likely that my kids are a bigger role in why things don't work out. We all have a story with our pasts at this age in our lives, some are just longer than others and mine is long. I don't blame people when they run away or stop showing interest in me when they find out my story, I might do the same in their shoes. I'm not scared of being alone but it's not what I want. We all want happiness, and most want love and affection, and to find someone who can bring us to a new level of happiness in our life. Some people are destined for it and some aren't, maybe I'm not destined for it who knows. I've always lived my life by doing what I think is right in my eyes no matter if it made my life more difficult or challenging. I have no regrets nor do I wish that could change anything.

70,ndymdv,1621200988,Why do I bother?,"I am not really active on dating sites anymore, but left my FB profile up for shits and giggles. 

A few days ago, a guy messages me and we chat a bit. He was a little eager, but not love bombing, just saying he’s excited to meet me, he likes me, texting me all day for a few days. 

He texted me on Friday to say that his shift is probably getting canceled Sunday (today), and did I want to meet? I said I couldn’t because my parents were coming to my house to help me with gardens, patios, etc. 

Yesterday morning, he said to let him know when they left to see if there was time to meet. Then he didn’t really text much, and when I texted him last night, he said he was really tired and going to bed. I said goodnight.

This morning I texted him to say I couldn’t see him because I didn’t know the plan. I didn’t want him to waste his day off waiting around. He said that’s ok, he’s at work today, so not sure why I thought we could meet? I’m like because you told me you weren’t working. He said he must have been confused. I texted ok, well have a good day whatever you’re doing. 

Worked most of the day outside. Saw that he texted me right after saying I must be confused. Sent him a quick text that said I must be. It was delivered, but my second text that just said it happens, never got the “delivered” tag.

I went on FB, his profile and conversation are gone. A couple of times he sent me texts that were out of context, and I asked if the text was meant for me, so I think he was talking to someone else even though he said I had his full attention. Fine if he was, but don’t lie about it. 

And they say women are confusing.

-I’ve never been married. Or proposed to. Longest relationship was 4 years.     
-No kids and don’t want them.     
-Disabled mostly due to mental health/trauma which is going to come up because people will ask why and then inevitably I have to worry about mental health stigmas and “she’s a crazy one” BS. I get it enough from doctors, I’m not excited about getting it on OLD.     
-I don’t own a car, I can’t afford one-and I can’t afford an Uber all over town because Disability keeps us all below the poverty level.     
-Disabled so I don’t have a job and I feel like people will see me as a failure, or baggage, like someone they can’t plan a future with because I am not financially successful.    
    
I also worry about connecting to people my age. I mean, I have an animation degree-I am a huge kid at heart and I’m afraid I will connect with people younger far better than people older. I still want to geek out over Marvel movies, play video games and my hair is currently pink and purple. Dealing with mental illness since I was a kid makes me appreciate things that make me happy that much more.     
    
But I feel like all that I am on the surface is just going to make people turn away immediately. Or that I’ll be seen as immature and “too much”. But I  am starting to miss loving someone.

I realize people are going to say get the haircut that makes me happy, but I have had my hair at all sorts of lengths throughout the decades. Everything from a buzzcut (had an autoimmune reaction that caused my body to attack my hair. I buzzed it since it looked awful and chunky at any length. Thankfully the reaction reversed and my hair grew back) to down to my lower back.

79,ne5aqz,1621221298,Ready to start dating *again* at 40(f),"I have been single for 2 years now (almost to the day). I am one of those people who had never spent any time just being single, so even making it a year was a big deal. I worked a lot on myself and came up with realistic expectations and goals for my life. Now that I’m at 2 years, I would like to have someone to enjoy my life with.  I now own my own home, have a fantastic career, I have a huge heart and family is important to me. My friends would say I have my shit together. 

After a run of bad relationships, some short, some long, I figured my picker was broken so I decided to take a break. The current problem is, I live in a very small town where everyone knows everyone. Not too many singles around here and the ones that are, there’s generally a reason. The nearest town is about 45 minutes away but it’s pretty small there, too.  I am scared as hell of online dating, mostly because I am afraid I will know half the men on there (not from dating them LOL), but partly because I am terrified of rejection. Also, I want to meet someone the natural way - like starting an innocent conversation in the produce section at the grocery store.  Is that so unrealistic?

There is very little to do here, even in non covid times. I don’t drink, and don’t think I want to find my future partner in a bar anyway, but that’s about the only place to go to meet new people. Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a creative, non creepy way to meet people?

81,ne62kq,1621223793,I just don't know what to make of it....,"I have been talking to this guy for a month and a half now. We haven't met in person. How we have even started talking is a very long story. We have a mutual friend who ended up in a situation and, to put things in a nutshell, that is how we got started talking. I At first, I was really just talking to him about how we could help our friend. He suggested we stay in touch and I thought why not. So, we have been talking a lot and he texts me every day, almost all day long about the details of his day, humorous commentary, all kinds of stuff. 

After speaking with him many times, I have discovered some very wonderful things about him and have found myself most certainly attracted to him. When we do talk on the phone, we talk for HOURS and it is never dull. We talk about everything under the sun and I enjoy every minute of it. He is sweet, funny as heck, super smart and just an all around great guy. 

I had a birthday recently and my birthday plans fell through. When he learned of this, he began researching plane tickets so he could fly me to where he is and we could go have dinner. Tickets were super expensive last minute, so it was not a good idea. Way too much way too soon. So, he has never told me he is interested, but he acts like he is and has dropped hints. He texted me once and told me he thinks I'm ""pretty awesome"", pays me different compliments at times, points out things he likes about me and giggles at my quirks and tells me he appreciates them. 

The reality check I had this morning was discovering he hasn't really called me that may times. I call him way more than he ever calls me.  As I mentioned before, he does text me all day long, every day. Not just stupid texts - like conversation texts. So I don't quite understand it and wonder if he is just enjoying the benefits of the conversation and the idea that a woman is paying him mind? He does live on the other side of the country and so it could be he just doesn't want to express his interest prematurely? After all, it has only been shy of 2 months since we've started talking. But he was looking up plane tickets!? 

I don't know what to make of it. Here is an example of something he does - he was telling me this long story via text. After awhile, he said ""this is certainly something for a phone call"" and I thought - why won't he just call me?? I said ""you are welcome to phone me"" and he just kept texting his story. He then said again ""this is for a phone call"", but I never bothered to say he could phone again. I had said it once already. After a bit, I said, ""do you have time to talk?"" and then he called right away. ?!?? Like what the heck??

Our kids hit it off, started chatting and so did we.  We were both happy to have met another single parent with a young kid who lives in the neighborhood.  I also found him attractive.

Long story short, we started spending time together, mostly with our kids, and getting to know one another.  He's great, his kids are great (he has a teen too that I later met).  We got to know each other decently well, talking about all kinds of things, and our dynamic with our kids and us was wonderful.   
 However, the timing of our meeting was TERRIBLE (in terms of something romantic). We met the day after my boyfriend had unexpectedly broken up with me (becoming and on and off drama for a few months after that), one of my closest friends died of cancer, and my custody with my son changed dramatically.  Plus I'd been working in COVID for public health and that was the most stressful thing I'd done professionally.  Basically, I was a ball of emotions, stress, confusion, fear, etc.  I was not ready to even think about something more than friends at that time, but cared about him and his kids.  


He had expressed feelings for me, and when I decided to go back to my boyfriend, we decided to take a pause on our friendship.  I did have feelings for him, but,  looking back, I  was longing for something that felt familiar and secure (my ex) and wanting to see what was still possible with my now ex boyfriend.  I was chasing the ex, as I'd always done.  


I have since learned a lot about myself, and I find myself thinking about this guy a lot.  We had a recent text interaction that indicates he still has feelings.  


I'm not quite ready yet, but when I think about the kind of person I want to be with, he keeps showing up in my mind. I miss him in my life.  We also had some of the most emotionally healthy conversations I've had with a close male in years.  


Would you reach out, or let it go?  Sometimes I wonder if 'things happen for a reason' and the timing was bad b/c it's not supposed to be anything more than a passing friendship, or if that's just the cynic in me.  I felt I could totally be myself with him and we 'got' each other, maybe b/c there was no pressure of dating and I wasn't chasing him as I've done in the past  in relationships (learning every day more and more about my patterns).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ne7abr/to_reach_out_or_to_not_reach_outwhat_would_you_do/

93,nekd5t,1621267978,Should I or shouldn’t I?,"First post!

I usually just lurk here.

I’m 40M, divorced two years, been using OLD since then.

In my early 20s, I met a woman. She was great. Fun, smart, easy to talk to, hot.  We dated six months and then my ex came back into the picture. I cheated on my girlfriend with the ex (stupid I know) and, to no ones surprise (except mine, because, again, I was a dummy) my girlfriend dumped me and I never heard from her again.

Until Saturday night.

A friend from work invited me to a cookout at his house and there she was, the girlfriend I cheated on 20 years ago.

The short story on her (42F) as I learned last night. She was married for 15 years, he died two years ago. She has three kids, twin 13yo girls and a son, 10. She and her late husband are / were good friends with my coworker and his wife, and their kids. They’ve hung out together for years, went on family trips together that sort of thing.

She and I spent a lot of time together on Saturday night. She didn’t bring up the past and neither did I. We talked about work, life, the kids. She’s fun and easy to talk to, just like she was 20 years ago. As far as I could tell from the conversation, she’s not seeing anyone, not using OLD and she doesn’t seem to hate me (or if she does she hid it well).

Partway through the evening my friend dragged me to the garage to smoke cigars. I don’t partake but thought it would be rude to decline and by the time we came back to the main party she had gone for the night.

Do you think there is any path forward here? Im not sure how to connect with her. I could give my number to my friend to pass on to her but if feels like a lot to ask her to reach out to me considering our history. I’d like to apologize for my behavior twenty years ago. My wife cheated on me, it felt like shit and knowing that I also did the same thing to a girlfriend, I would like to make that right as best I can at the very least.

I’d also like to see if she had any interest in giving us a second chance. We sparked twenty years ago and I think we sparked last night (she’s outgoing so I might have misread) and it’s not like OLD has been particularly successful.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nekd5t/should_i_or_shouldnt_i/

It seems like people who were married with kids in their 20's and 30's who are now divorced aren't really dealing with issues that *may* have been put to the wayside when the distractions of family and career got piled on (and the possible causes for the divorces).  

Is it societal pressure that makes people desperate to be with someone even though they are miserable and being mistreated?  Do you really not love yourself enough that it is so unbearably lonely for you?  I don't even want to be around myself sometimes, how could I expect someone else to be around me?  Don't tell me it's about companionship.  Yeah, I get that and it's pathetic.  The last time I felt truly lonely was when I was with someone—it was a relief to finally get away from this person.

I know people who are in unhappy marriages.  They are still together for the kids, for fear of ""looking bad,"" fear of being alone, or pure denial.  It's depressing to witness.

Am I bitter?  Maybe. I just think if people really took a hard, honest look at themselves, they wouldn't drag people into their shit because they're trying to be something they're not and/or are desperate for a warm body next to them.  If they tried harder at accepting and loving themselves, learning to love being with themselves, they'd be much happier in life.  

I'd rather read a good book and/or watch a good movie, learn a new hobby, etc. than deal with some of the pathetic bullshit I've dealt with trying to date broken people who refuse to evolve (or don't even know how to) and reading the horror stories on here.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/net82m/not_everyone_is_meant_to_be_in_a_longterm/
98,newdo7,1621297690,Considering switch from serial monogamy to FWB,"Anyone ever had success / find happiness in abandoning the search for another monogamous relationship in favor of taking a regular and satisfying lover, without the frills etc of a relationship?

I’ve been in relationships continuously since I was 17.  Never much break, until I happened to end a 5 year relationship right before COVID.  Took 5 months off but then started dating late last summer.  

My last relationship (6 months total including a small break at the 5 week mark) just ended.   After a frenzied few days of OLD for distraction, I deleted all the apps.  I had plenty of attention, but I realize I really don’t want to date and try for another relationship right now.  

But I am a very sexual person.  My last boyfriend and I had amazing sex.  And I really helped him explore new things.  But we broke up because he didn’t feel we could take things to the next level.  

I am considering finding a regular lover — not just a bunch of random hookups.  Someone I can trust, but none of the relationship-y things like texting and phone calls and planning dates and wondering about a future.   And yes, I am considering pitching this to my ex but I gotta make sure this is not me trying to get back together as a couple.  

Has anyone been able to make this transition?  If so, how did you approach it? 

Even if I decide to explore this, I realize finding the right person(s) may be just as hard as actually trying to date.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/newdo7/considering_switch_from_serial_monogamy_to_fwb/
