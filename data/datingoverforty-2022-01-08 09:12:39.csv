5,rzd28n,1641683994,"I feel eternally lonely, depressed, &amp; hopeless. Almost like a ghosts with no home, just wandering around this earth until my time is up. Now that I‚Äôm getting older, I‚Äôm starting to feel like I will be alone forever. I just want to find my best friend, lover, protector.","Hello friends, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right area to post this, may post somewhere else, forgive me if what I write here doesn‚Äôt fit.

I‚Äôm in my early 40s and I am going through a divorce. I was with my husband for 20 years and discovered his secret lives to say the least.

For half my life he was my best friend, my lover, my spouse, my other half. We grew up together basically. I would have followed him to the ends of the earth. Then one day, my world shattered when I discovered that he basically had hidden secret lives with other women.

The marriage wasn‚Äôt perfect and he was abusive at times, well, really emotionally neglectful and mentally abusive at times and towards the end, it was out of control.

I decided to leave and it‚Äôs been a year and I still want to cry EVERYDAY. He‚Äôs moved on to his other girlfriends he had behind my back and I‚Äôm just here‚Ä¶.on earth, depressed.

People say that I did the right thing to leave but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how things used to be, how much I miss my husband or who he used to be or who I thought he was. I‚Äôm so depressed, all I want to do is sleep.

Pro say to get out and do things and meet people, but I‚Äôm not 20 years old anymore. I‚Äôm average looking so it‚Äôs not like guys flock to me either. I scared to date online as I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs full of narcissist and I‚Äôm not trying to find another one.

How does one average 40-something ‚Äúolder‚Äù woman find their forever love? I know people say that you shouldn‚Äôt look for anyone, work on yourself, bla bla bla, but that‚Äôs just not me. 

It‚Äôs been a year already, I‚Äôm kind of an introvert, haven‚Äôt met anyone I‚Äôm semi attracted to to would even seem like their interested in me or looking for the same thing.

God I‚Äôm so depressed and lonely.
I wish I could have a lobotomy and erase every memory of my ex. It‚Äôs hurts so much to be just basically abandoned by the one who you thought you were gonna grow old together, by the one you you‚Äôre to talk to everyday. No longer have a home. Just barley scraping by so I‚Äôm not homeless.

No skills because I was a house wife for twenty years. My job was making him happy and making him a happy clean home everyday. That made me happy. I was the happiest when I was in his arms. That was my home, not a building. Now it‚Äôs all gone.

I‚Äôm just wondering if any of you guys ever went though this and how did you get through it. And please don‚Äôt flag this, I‚Äôm not going to hurt myself or anything, I‚Äôm way to chicken sh*t to do anything like that. I‚Äôm just expressing myself and trying to see if anyone here has had any similar experiences and see if you got through it.

Thank you for your time.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rzd28n/i_feel_eternally_lonely_depressed_hopeless_almost/

13,rztjox,1641740674,It really isn't you.,"Something happened recently that I thought could maybe help someone else. When someone rejects you or stops talking to you, 9:10 it's not you, it's them, and often a very trivial thing. I decided to try the OLD game again. I was talking to a guy the other day. First conversation. Mostly small talk about work &amp; humorous banter about driving skills. As we were saying good night he called me ""dear"". For me that falls right in line with ""hey gorgeous"". Not something I like as I find it way too informal to use terms of endearment after a brief conversation. For me, that is a person who's gonna want to move too quick for my taste. Now, that might be something Susie finds adorable. She would be a much better match for him. Should I give him another chance? No. I know myself well enough to know I'd be wasting his time and that's not fair. (Of note, I live in an area where you don't generally strike up a conversation with strangers waiting in line). If someone unmatches me I always try to remember it could be something just as petty. Who knows, maybe they like women who let their grey show, and that's just not good happen.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rztjox/it_really_isnt_you/

I had no idea what this was until he gave me a tiny accidental tip off the other night that he's reading a book by Robert Greene which led me into a really gross place on the internet. 

I'd say I'm about 70% sure that he's been deliberate in his communication (or lack thereof), how he's planning/not planning our time together, and things he says to me. It works! 30% of me is so hooked on him that it's desperate for this not to be true. There's still a possibility that he's really bad at dating, scatter brained and closed off emotionally.

Either way, not a great guy to keep dating, I get it. I need to stop seeing him but these two scenarios require different exits:  
If he's playing me (!!) using some freaking internet guideline then 100% I should ghost/block/burn it down  
If he's just a lousy romantic partner, I think he deserves a conversation or explanation.

I should repeat that I am extremely interested in him. I'm a grown woman who thinks about a guy  ... every 2 minutes. Breaking up with him is not going to be easy for me either way (I failed the first time I tried to do it after my last post here-- he talked me into giving it more time to see)

After that I ended up ghosting the dude. But it was compiled by other things. Focusing on my physical appearance and sexist comments about women , that were all red flags. 

But for me , not liking animals or understanding them is a deal breaker. I get if someone had been bitten by one , being scared. But not actively disliking. Makes me think you‚Äôre potentially a sociopath lol.

82,s2n6hi,1642038526,Is dating worth it?,"I waited for over two years after ending my marriage to start being open to dating. I was super disciplined about it ‚Äî even kept a placeholder ring on my left ring finger (an old gift from my aunt) to discourage being approached. No OLD yet, just accepting the occasional date when interested. Here‚Äôs the thing: the past 2+ years have been calmer/ less stressful than any one of the prior 22 years of marriage, despite the end of a marriage, moving to a totally new city, loss of a parent, child going to college, changing jobs and starting a company during this time. That‚Äôs how unhappy my marriage was ‚Äî this ‚Äúlife‚Äù stuff is easy-peasy compared to life with my ex. Then I noticed just in the last few months that moments of heightened frustration, stress or feeling ungrounded in general reappear. And then I realized, those moments are all linked to the dating thing. Just navigating it all is so unnatural to me. I mean, the flakiness alone is just‚Ä¶wow. So now I‚Äôm kind of thinking: why am I doing this to myself? I have an amazing group of people I love, respect, admire and genuinely have fun with ‚Äî men and women alike ‚Äî of all different backgrounds and passions and interests. Do I miss the intimacy, yes, but is it worth the BS? I‚Äôve never been a casual dater so automatically opened the door with the intention of LTR, but what if I just let go of that ideal? 

I‚Äôm curious: have others here decided just let go of the whole concept of ‚Äúcoupling‚Äù and find success staying single with casual but safe intimacy on occasion? Or do you run into the same frustration with flakiness and general ick? I know it has only been a few months, but I feel like I‚Äôm losing sight of the whole point. At the same time, I was pretty much alone the last 12 years of my marriage, and I don‚Äôt remember genuine closeness the first 10 either. I can barely recall what it‚Äôs like to be in a relationship anymore.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/s2n6hi/is_dating_worth_it/

When I told him later in a different conversation that had nothing to do with anything but with implications to that, that private messages on instagram are tacky when they can just come in on text or Facebook.

Around a week ago, he stopped initiating texts. Which is when I picked up. He had been reaching out to me daily before then. I don't mind being the first to text, especially as we've been seeing each other for a bit now. 

He told me he's been ""working lots"" this past week, working 17 hour days (he's self employed, so goes through periods of being relatively free and intensely busy). I know 

I've never dated someone this much older than myself, and have never had this issue where the person is so busy they can't (or forget) to reach out for a few days. I stopped initiating to see how long it would take, out of curiosity, and it was 3 whole days. 

I plan on communicating this next time I see him, but for now, just need a 3rd party perspective.

97,s35zyd,1642098299,Deeply in love,"

I‚Äôve been dating a man 45+ for a year. I‚Äôm deeply in love with him. I enjoy spending time with him we talk daily and see each other often. 
We were both previously married to other people for a long time we are now divorced. 
Here‚Äôs where the concern is. 
He doesn‚Äôt want me to help him with anything. He is extremely hell bent on being independent. He won‚Äôt let me cook for him or clean for him. He is going through some health stuff and it‚Äôs causing him to withdraw from me emotionally. He won‚Äôt really let me help with that either. 
I‚Äôve talked to him about it and asked him what could I do for him he says nothing. It‚Äôs not my responsibility. 
I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I‚Äôm feeling like I can‚Äôt help him and this is now a burden on the relationship. This is both of our first serious relationship since divorce so we are both just learning about what works together. I don‚Äôt want to go anywhere but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if he will ever let me truly become part of his life.  I want to marry this man one day so being able to be a part of each other lives is extremely important to me.
