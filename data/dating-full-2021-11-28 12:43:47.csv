Connections), became distant the exact next week. 

After multiple attempts to see her, be there for here, she told me she was working through some things and needed time alone. I couldn’t protest or anything, I can’t force it if she isn’t in a place to be in a relationship and respect that she needs to grow. 

Fast forward to now (3 months later)- this past week I got weak and reached out to tell her I’ve been thinking of her and missed her. 

Met with a big nothing. Superficial response. “Hiiii! I hope you are doing well”

Blocked her Instagram to symbolize To myself I could move on. 

Then she texts me about me blocking her. We were far more than friends, our sex and chemistry was unreal yet she’ll claim “I tHoUGHt wE wERE fRiEnDS”. In her mind we were just Fuck buddies. I thought we were dating. Or that’s just what I’m seeing. 

Friends don’t just abandon friends. So I put my stake in the ground (hoping this would wake her up to come back to me), so I said I am in an amazing place in life and can’t wait around for someone who can’t be there for me.

I laid it out how i want her in my life, I want to support her- not tell her what to do, not to give her advice, just support and hold her up while she discovers herself.. And how she needs to open up to me and let me in  because I want to be there to support her, and it legitimately hurts to not be with her. 

She said she’s still in a weird headspace and needs to focus in herself. 

I know she’s “working on herself” but what does that mean? Fucking other guys? Do I stick around?

I did this via text (was really bad for my part i know) as she was out that week and I couldn’t wait to tell her as I was seeing she was less interested than normal. She decided she needed a “break” to think about it as she has always been saying we are just meeting each other and see how it goes. After 10 days with low contact we decide to meet and talk about it. This time also helped me to low how attracted i was to her as everything happened so fast and I also needed to think about it. 

Fast forward we talk about it and we are good as we are but I don’t know that if I want more she will be going at the same pace as me. Last week was the first time we slept again together but we went to a party and we were just too drunk. I wanted to spend that the and the following day with her talking and having fun but we were not feeling well after that much alcohol from the day before. Also we had things to do for that day so she just went to her house after waking up. 

So I am here wondering what to do and how it will turn up. We have decided to flow and don’t overthink these things but these past days I don’t see her really interested. Maybe it’s how I see it.

Did I do something wrong here?

There were some issues that made me doubt: 

\- His low self-esteem, he was always doubting himself and putting many things in a negative light.

\- He wants to make a career in the military, which would mean moving every few years and likely putting my own career aside.

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dome and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways.

I am 20 years old guy who never had a girlfriend and have almost no experience with girls. I am good looking, smart, and a really ambitious guy (I am the straight opposite of so-called ""needy"" guy but when it comes to interacting with girls I cant show my self and I think I seem to them like the really awkward guy )and can talk with my friends or other people about any topic with ease very naturally but when it comes to girls especially girls who I like I can't speak a word properly and feel super awkward and nervous.

I somehow know where is this coming from. Throughout school, I was in a really toxic environment. My classmates would make fun of people who spoke with girls and they were really judgemental. I think this had a really big negative impact on me.

Now, I am really self-conscious in social situations and I cant approach the girl I like in front of other people as they were judging me. Even when I am alone with her I do not know what to say and seem really awkward.

Last week I meet that girl who I thought was cute at work. I started talking with her a little bit at lunch. Then the next day I meet her again and said hi and smiled she smiled back. I felt like she was also into me. But another day, when she was sitting alone I gathered all my courage and decided to ask her out. I was so nervous and didn't really know what to say and I could feel that she was feeling that nervousness. Although I got her number and asked her out it was really kinda unnatural, she said she was not sure. During the week when I bumped into her at work a couple of times I wanted to say something but I really did not know how to behave and what to say and I am sure that it seemed really awkward. Yesterday I texted her asking her out but she said she had something to do, and when I proposed another date she made an excuse again. I am pretty much sure that I acted like a ""needy"" guy although I am a pretty good guy with my own goals and ambition but I think my interaction with her killed all her attraction to me. Although her rejection hurts me, the most painful thing for me was my inability to interact with girls properly at my age. Especially in front of other people I cant do anything. It seems to me everyone is judging me. 

I am so sorry for this long text, but I want to get feedback from people who went through this kind of situation or just from people who have more experience. What can I do to improve my social skills especially with girls I like. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130562,public,self,I have social anxiety with girls.

We mainly had a sexual relationship from the very beginning. We met at a musical festival, and instantly hit it off. We’re making good conversation, I’m a bit tipsy and have my friends with me. As we go on and making jokes with one another He then starts asking for my number or social media. We exchange fb info and our personal numbers. Shortly after He needed to be somewhere and had to leave early, and mentioned he also didn’t want to bug or impede with my friends and the music event. Which made sense, I respected and appreciated that. After about a week of meeting each other he starts messaging me asking me how I’m doing, telling me he was so happy to meet me and that he’d like to hang out the coming weekend or the next if possible. I said yes this coming weekend would work perfectly based on my schedule and such. 

Well I didn’t expect him to get straight down to the dirty in the bedroom when we first hung out…….but I also didn’t mind it. As I was going through a lot in my life at that time, and who doesn’t like being desired like you are some delicious cake? It felt nice to be desired in that way, especially shortly after I came out of a long term relationship. Let’s just say, it easily got super steamy, and passionate! And bang, he was now the best I ever had! With great size, lion personality, the sexy hot looks, and a huge heart to show for it all. After the first time, ooooh damn, I couldn’t get enough of this guy! Annnd I hated that fact because obviously I didn’t want to look desperate….

Anyways, shortly after our first time together a few weeks passed by and it was getting closer to the busy holiday season- which ofc people get lonely around this time and i obv wanted more of him! So the SECOND time we hung out, I was the one that initiated and he was completely happy about saying yes and inviting me over. This time around we did more than the last time, and we did it longer too, with multiple rounds! It felt like a half-night marathon! It was fantastic! From this point in time we have talked more, texted more and have had a couple phone conversations. This lead me to believe he was perfect dating material and I actually see a future relationship with this person. We seem to have similarities in personality, despite the ten year age gap. But we can’t ignore the fact that there’s great chemistry. Of course the universe wasn’t on my side for this steamy romance; the worst news came to light and he was telling me he plans to move to the east side of the state because of his new job offer, which was a middle school teaching position in his home town! Of course I was happy for him. It’s always a huge accomplishment starting your new career, it’s rather thrilling as well. Okay okay, if I’m being honest, I was also very sad to hear he was permanently moving 5 hours away. 
This of course meant that there were going to be less frequent visits with each other, but we could still occasionally see one another if one had time to drive over for the weekends. Luckily he still had a part time job (the bar down town from where I lived), which made it convenient for us to see each other, On the days he was in town to do weekend jobs. This leads me the third-and-forth time we hung out. 


The THIRD time we hung out he was the one that initiated and asked if I wanted to go see a movie the night he gets into town. I said yes, and he payed for everything(despite my offer to pay half). After the movie he brought/invited me back to his place and I ended up sleeping over again. YES, it was as steamy as all the other times. (And Yes he was still paying for the place in the west until the lease was officially over).
The forth time played out similar to the third. 
  
About 3-4 days after seeing each other last he gets a call from me crying about some issue I am having with my ex(baby daddy) and that there’s some hostile exchange of emotions between the two of us based on my dating actions and how it’s unfair for me to go out and date while we are still living together. (Of course living together was our only option at the time, based on financial reasons). Let’s just say, we both were still grieving over our 5 year relationship break up. This occasionally made it complex and toxic to be around each other. Welp, from there the guy I really liked and was still technically dating, had nothing but understanding and supporting words to say. At this time In the phone conversation I instantly felt guilty for even calling him about the issue. 

We still talked for about a month or so after that phone call. But than he started getting more busy and I started getting more busy and eventually I applied for college out of state and moved about 5 states away…. In this process I got back with my ex to try to make our girls happy and attempt to build a happier Family than the dynamics before. 
1 year later we open our bedroom to add excitement to our relationship. This was a rather thrilling change on both parts. He found a few women that he really liked I found a couple guys I enjoyed, eventually this made us want to do threesomes and swinging. This eventually lead him wanting me to be extra pleasured by the guy I was seeing before we  got back together.(Mainly because he was always on Business trips and he wanted to ensure I was getting everything I needed physically until he got back home) 
So he flys me to Oregon to see mister steamy for a few days.  This goes over well- I’m happy and I’m satisfied and I go back home. In the course of the next year or so we mainly did this with people we knew in state. Than this year right before Halloween, my partner flys me up again to stay with mr.steamy and this time our chemistry only grew stronger. I tried ignoring this as much as possible because I didn’t want to fall for another guy and because I loved my partner….


All that brings us to today. Currently my partner and I are broken up…We both realized that this was going to happen eventually simply because the lack of meeting each other’s wants and needs in the relationship… some jealousy was felt, unhealthy communication was at hand, busy schedules got busier(On both parties), and lack of self-awareness was all contributors of the break up, so I believe.  (Another major reason why we weren’t working out was because I wanted a polyamorous relationship and he wanted to close-the relationship based off jealousy and uncomfortability.) And sure it hurts me we didn’t work out especially over these types of circumstances. But at the same time I feel more like myself since the break up. 

This brings me to the question I’m always asking myself. 

What do I do next?!

I’m obviously going to focus on Me, my Masters degree, our kids and rebuilding who I am as a person, as well as working on gaining independence again. 

But is it wrong for me to want Mr.Steamy?! As a long term FWB or even possibly a committed partner if that’s what we both decided on?

We were never together together, more of a situationship. I asked to DTR bc it felt like we needed to decide where this was going since it was getting longer that we were seeing each other. He’s not in a place to take on a serious relationship, so we stopped seeing each other (more of a timing thing, the sentence makes it seem like he strung me along, but there were various factors that contributed to this decision).

It’s been a little over a month now and I feel like I’ve had my time to wallow and started dipping my toes back into dating. I’m wondering when/if to reach out back to him to open the communication line again. 

When we were talking &amp; breaking things off, he suggested friendship and I said I couldn’t do that rn since it was so fresh and I needed time to remove myself from seeing him as a partner. Now I feel like I’m ready to have him back in my life as a friend, I genuinely don’t think we’ll ever date again, but I do miss his friendship. 

The other hard part is the holidays. I think he’s going back home soon for a while, so idk if it would be dumb to open communication again, then both of us be preoccupied with fam time and holiday things - so maybe I wait until the new year to initiate? All I was going to ask is if he wanted to catch up over coffee as friends.

I’ve talked to some friends about this and some think it’s too soon whereas others say everyone is on different timelines/you know yourself best. I know there is a camp of people who believe you can’t be friends with an ex and say to leave it, but I’m not so sure.

Certain people have said it’s in my head because I’m actually handsome but I also don’t have any experience of talking to women at bars because I’ve never approached since I always assumed I’m just too ugly. 

Now that I’m getting older. I want to just go out and have fun and talk to people. But I get anxiety and panic when some of my friends tell me to go and approach a woman that’s standing at the bar. I’d love to but I just think a lot of the time they’re too attractive. I’d say 90% of the women i see at bars are too attractive and I’m just too ugly to approach them. 

So I have this horrible issue where I can’t approach because I feel I’m too ugly. And I can’t get better at talking to women unless I approach. But I have no experience and need experience but I’m too ugly to even talk to them.

I am an 18M in senior year of highschool. My ex and i broke up about a year ago and we had dated for a year before the breakup. We met through the grocery store we both worked at. We broke up because she wasn't in a place where she could date and it really killed my self esteem because i thought she just didn't want to spend time around me. (im like the stereotypical nerd in movies)

After we broke up i lost what little confidence i had in myself. I constantly feel lonely and I've been diagnosed and medicated for generalized anxiety disorder and depression.

For some context, i went through a massive amount of trauma in my early teen years which forced me to fully mature at least mentally in my mid teens 15/16.

I think this is why i always am looking for long term, loving relationships. I have been interested in girls since then but when i start talking to them, they never reciprocate and always seem to either ghost me or in some cases move seats in class away from me. This will happen like once a month and than I'll move on a few weeks later to the next person who i develop an interest for.

I find myself watching those cute couple and relationship tiktoks and youtube videos. Essentially i want to have relationships where the person likes/loves me for me and not just because I'll spend hours listening to them cry over facetime like what happened in my previous relationship.

Is it even possible to find what im looking for anymore?  Does Anyone have experience in this area? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Im actually trying to make friends and find a group, so I approached dudes too and they we’re so chill about it.

I had another women start dancing with me and talking about shows and shit too. She asked for my snap but I’m not 19 so I gave her my Insta.

Then another girl was watching me like 10 feet away. She came up to me and yelled over the music “you look adorable!” And then just went on her way. I know some people would be annoyed she didn’t stop, but to me it just made the compliment even more genuine. 

Also had a girl at the bar make conversation while I was getting drinks. Didn’t get any contact info, but again, just nice to know I’m capable of socializing and I’m approachable.

My advice: go somewhere with your specific interest. So much easier to make conversation and find people that are your type that will also find you attractive. Also, I’m sure everyone could tell I was having fun!

To start with we kind of had a thing in school or maybe that's how i viewed it.
We asked eachother out for farewell, he initially agreed to it but later one month before the farewell was not responding to me and things eventually faded away.
However, we reunited after five years at a friends party and started talking again.
We would meet 3 to 4 times a week for atleast a month and a half.
We flirted alot during that time, him and I both, and i thought that he liked me.
He asked wether I'd be okay if he'd kiss me and took my consent on text
To which i said yes
However, he hadn't asked me out on a date and when i conveyed this to him he said that the next time we were to meet, it would be a date however, I'm not ready for a relationship yet.
I called things off, because i wanted a relationship and he didn't. 
Initially i kind of got mad but later clarified that I'm not mad at him not wanting a relationship but for leading me on and making me believe that something could happen with the way he would act.
After that we grew distant we would occasional text.
He texted me a couple of days back
I assumed that he wanted help with his assignments.
Previously, i had helped him w a couple of his assignments.
And i straightup declined saying that I'm indifferent towards him and i don't care about him now. He said that he never wanted to hurt me and for things to go this downhill.
I was very cold towards him but he was being very vulnerable and insisted i stay  friends with him.
He didn't really push alot, mostly just responded to my messages.
When i asked him why he wants to stay friends 
He said he doesn't want to lose friends.
Now idk what to do 
I feel like staying friends with him might just allow him to manipulate me in the future.
And i can't let him exhaust me emotionally.
Idk what my feelings are towards him
I feel like i don't really care about him and i have come to terms with the fact that he doesn't really care about me.

To start with we kind of had a thing in school or maybe that's how i viewed it.
We asked eachother out for farewell, he initially agreed to it but later one month before the farewell was not responding to me and things eventually faded away.
However, we reunited after five years at a friends party and started talking again.
We would meet 3 to 4 times a week for atleast a month and a half.
We flirted alot during that time, him and I both, and i thought that he liked me.
He asked wether I'd be okay if he'd kiss me and took my consent on text
To which i said yes
However, he hadn't asked me out on a date and when i conveyed this to him he said that the next time we were to meet, it would be a date however, I'm not ready for a relationship yet.
I called things off, because i wanted a relationship and he didn't. 
Initially i kind of got mad but later clarified that I'm not mad at him not wanting a relationship but for leading me on and making me believe that something could happen with the way he would act.
After that we grew distant we would occasional text.
He texted me a couple of days back
I assumed that he wanted help with his assignments.
Previously, i had helped him w a couple of his assignments.
And i straightup declined saying that I'm indifferent towards him and i don't care about him now. He said that he never wanted to hurt me and for things to go this downhill.
I was very cold towards him but he was being very vulnerable and insisted i stay  friends with him.
He didn't really push alot, mostly just responded to my messages.
When i asked him why he wants to stay friends 
He said he doesn't want to lose friends.
Now idk what to do 
I feel like staying friends with him might just allow him to manipulate me in the future.
And i can't let him exhaust me emotionally.
Idk what my feelings are towards him
I feel like i don't really care about him and i have come to terms with the fact that he doesn't really care about me.
Idk
Any advice would be helpful 
Thankyou.

They have degraded my risks in life. They wanted to risk piercing their own ears, I told them not to and just see a professional for that. ""What risks have you taken in your life? Or do you just let your anxiety rule you?"" When I told them I've speed on four wheelers and gotten hurt, they told me ""That was with your family, that's different."" Like that somehow removes the fact I took a risk.

Last night they apologized for that, I told them it was okay but it still stings a little.

Some of the things he did which I find normal for platonic friends: lend his jacket, take the seat next to me, accompany me to appointments/places I've never been, come over to his apartment if I need something, etc.

I guess the closest he got to being romantic was when he asked if I wanted flowers on Valentine's Day, which he quickly claimed as a joke. This guy also replies late to our casual chats, so I don't think he's interested in talking or whatnot.

Our friends kept on ~shipping~ us and it really bothers me at this point. I asked one of them why they think there's something going on between us, and they said it was in ""the way he looked at me"". Now I'm more confused.

At that point she wanted to stay friends, which I have to admit knocked me back.... again.

Since then there's been a pandemic and we've both stopped working together completely. The last time we spoke there was an argument over the evenings plans (I said about going to the movies, she said about food so I booked a table but I miss-read what she meant and so I got a big angry text message). This was back in June.

Cause i'm a larger lad (a fat F\*\*\* if you will) i've started on a proper diet (posting healthy food pictures on the social medias etc) and hitting the gym more, (7 pounds in a fortnight, go me!) now out of the blue she messaged me last night (6 months after we spoke last) saying ""I miss you.""

Whenever we used to interact this is how it would start, then when deciding what to do I would be the one making all the plans with little or no input from her (unless I get it wrong, see above).

Anyway, I said I was going to the gym this morning and could meet her after, today comes round and now she's decided to put up the Christmas decorations, offered to help but she didn't accept or decline, just dodged by asking if mine were up.

So yeah, I like the girl and i'm pretty sure she likes me, but I don't know how to continue with whatever this is, or whether I should cut my losses and stop talking to her.

PS: She talks to her parents about me (not sure if relevant)

PSS: When were together we both feel relaxed and she laughs at some of the stuff I come out with.

TLDR: Every decision is taken by me with no input from her, after an argument and no contact for 6 months she messaged me last night ""I miss you,"" Arranged to meetup today but she's been dodging my messages.

In summer 2016, I had just graduated college and moved back home. One Saturday night, I went clubbing with some friends and family members. This one guy in particular, we'll call him Kelvin, who I knew for several years prior and is friends with my brother's girlfriend at the time, came out with us. That night, I was having fun and doing my thing at the club, and was getting approached by several guys. I let them buy me drinks and they gave me their phone numbers, but I had no interest in them because I was in a relationship. My relationship, however, was hanging by a thread and I had contemplated breaking up almost a year earlier but stayed because I was mainly focused on getting done with school.

So back at the club, I'm doing my thing, and close to the end of the night, this one guy is super drunk talking to me and acting kinda creepy, so Kelvin swoops in and pushes the guy away. I tell him ""thanks so much, he was being super weird"" and Kelvin is like ""yeah, no problem I got you"". So Kelvin and I start dancing, both having drank a bit, and eventually kissed. Kissing Kelvin made me realize that I was seriously done with my relationship so I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of days later.

2 quick notes: Kelvin knew my ex-boyfriend years before we had gotten together. After the breakup, my ex-bf started stalking and harassing me, and Kelvin was around to see how much it affected me.

Since the night of the club, Kelvin started pursuing me and we hung out for close to 1 year. We would go on dates at least once a month (though he would call them 'outings') and we were almost intimate a few times, but I would tell him no. From what friends and family would tell me, including his sister and his closest friends, Kelvin would talk nonstop about me and would tell them that I was the nicest girl he had ever been around.

Kelvin and I continue hanging out for a few months, and around the fall, Kelvin and I talked about how it would be difficult if we got into a relationship because his friend and my brother were dating. We figured that if they ever broke up and Kelvin and I were together, that it would be too much and we would probably break up anyway from all the drama and stress. 

About a month after, he stayed over at my place one night and I told him that I thought it would be best if we didn't pursue something more serious. I could tell that he was hurt or taken aback because he didn't say much. This is where things took a turn for the worst. Despite the conversations we had about not being together more seriously, Kelvin and I clearly still had a thing for each other, and his friends and family would constantly approach me asking when we would make it official because we would still hang out like normal and people could see how strong our chemistry was.

That November, Kelvin and I went out to lunch like usual and he confessed to me that he had a crush on one of his coworkers, let's call her Brianna, and was going to start pursuing her since we had decided not to move further. To say that hearing that didn't hurt me would be a lie, but I played it cool because he was right. Later that month, he had a get-together at his place to which all of our mutual friends, his sister,, his close coworkers including Brianna and myself were invited. The whole time, Kelvin acted as if I wasn't there and was ALL OVER Brianna - to the point where our mutual friends and his sister approached me asking what the f was wrong with him. He embarrassed me so bad that night,  and his friends were equally puzzled.

After that get-together, Kelvin and I continued hanging out and a few weeks later he told me that Brianna and him decided to remain friends because she wasn't interested in him. We continued spending time together up until about February/March of 2017. 

In March, several of us in our friend group, including myself, had birthdays and we all went out one night. That night, Kelvin and I were hanging out like usual and out of nowhere, I blurted 'f you' at him. He looked at me confused and asked why I said that to him. A few moments later, we got into an argument and I told him how I felt about him embarrassing me at the get-together back in November. During the argument, he apologized and told me that he would be with me in a relationship ""if he wasn't such a f'ed a'hole"".

After that night, he and I hung out one last time where he told me that he couldn't give me 'what I wanted' and that we were better off not trying anymore. Once I heard that, I decided that it was best for me to move on and we never really saw each other again except once at an event that summer but we didn't really speak. I ended blocking him on social media.

After all of that, in addition to other things, I went to therapy and worked on a lot of things. One thing that therapy helped me with was communicating more effectively. Since then, I kept having this urge to reconnect with Kelvin to smooth things over and let go of any grudges. I eventually reconnected with him earlier this year, and told him that I was sorry for everything and would love to speak with him either over phone or in person. He thanked me profusely for reaching out and agreed to meet up, but leading up to the day we agreed to meet, he left me on read and we haven't been in touch since.

I did see that he moved on and I fell in love again a few years ago. My motivation for reconnecting with him wasn't to try rekindling anything, but rather to sincerely move past what happened and be on better terms. It does hurt that we fell into such a dark place over a misunderstanding/miscommunication, and that we didn't even get a chance to talk things out.

I'd love to hear any thoughts about the possible reasons for his behavior, and how I can come to accept that I may never get to talk things out with him. &lt;3",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130611,public,self,"""I would be with you if I wasn't an a'hole""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r49oe1/i_would_be_with_you_if_i_wasnt_an_ahole/,no_ads,0,,,

One year ago today, I posted on Reddit that I had come to the realization that I was falling for someone, and I didn't know how to handle it. I was seeing a therapist to help deal with my intimacy issues, and I was still very very unsure if I could handle being rejected by him, because that's happened before where I misunderstood their intentions and their feelings towards me. As I was writing the post, I realized that all I wanted was for him to read the post. So I finished writing it, called one of my girlfriends, sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes trying to work up the nerve to call him, and then I called him. I asked him to read what I had written , and call me back. 20 minutes later, he called me back and told me that he was feeling the same way. He came over to my place, we spent the rest of the day together, and we've been dating ever since.

Yesterday we celebrated our one-year anniversary. This is the happiest, healthiest, and most loving relationship I've ever had. It's not perfect, but he is perfect for me in so many ways. He is a loving friend, Father, partner, and we share so many of the same interests while still being able to have our own distinct life and identity. I feel so blessed and so lucky to have been able to spend the last year with somebody who makes me feel so safe and so loved and appreciated.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that crowd (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

I am a 21-year-old woman. I don't have a lot of experience. I have been on dates and I have had one relationship that lasted a year. I have never had sex.

Last may, I met a guy online and we have been dating since July. He is 22 years old and he does not have a lot of experience. He has never been in a relationship and I have feeling that he is also virgin, because he is very shy and told me that it takes him a while before he feels comfortable with someone.

The dates have been lovely. We have talked about our interests, serious topics etc. The thing is that we haven't gone any further. We haven't kissed or anything. I have been afraid to make the first move because he is so shy and introverted even though he has told me that he feels comfortable near me. I don't want to hurt him or rush him. I feel like this also bothers him. We have talked about the fact that we both feel pressure to be more intimate, but  I have -since he struggles with that- told him that we don't have to rush. We have time. I just did not think it would take this long. I want to at least kiss him, because I feel like intimacy helps with getting a deeper connection. Right now, it just feels like we are good friends. 

There is another thing that has been bothering me. A couple of weeks/months ago we were talking in his car and I told him that I was still using the dating app lowkey simply because we weren't (and aren't still) exclusive/offical yet. He reacted surprised and told me that he does still have the app but that he doesn't use it anymore unless he gets a push message. He must have forgotten that I -because I still use the app- can see when he has been online. I am not stalking him or anything but it does bother me that he can't be honest. Why not say that you are still using the app? We are not exclusive (yet). Do you think he was being dishonest or it is indeed push messages?

Been seeing a lot of people complaining at the moment so thought I would share my strategy I have developed over the time I used old. 

This advice is for if you are looking for something serious btw. 

So first off you get an initial match. In my opinion you should be asking for a social as soon as the first conversation comes to a natural end. Almost use it as a segway. Like “yeah I like zebras too, what’s your number?” 

This is personal preference but instead of a number I prefer an Instagram. Reasons, easier to spot a catfish. You can get a better look at who they really are etc. it’s my personal preference so just do you. 

If they are willing to give a social/number it tells you that they are at least partially interested. 

The next step is to ask them on a date. 

Personally I believe that 3 days of talking is optimal.  But I would say just go with the flow of conversation. Also note that the date could be whenever. Could be the next day or could be two weeks away. 

If they agree to go on a date then it answers the question if they are interested or not. Obviously there is risks of cancellation and all that but you know at that given moment that they are somewhat interested. 

I would also suggest asking mid day/early evening people are more likely to agree something late at night and then realise in the morning that they are actually not interested. 

When you get a date confirmed simply for to it. Keep conversation light. Don’t get too invested and have a good time. 

This is coming from someone who use to want to get to know a girl a bit more before meeting them however it is so much easier mentally this way. You don’t get attached to anyone that isn’t serious about dating. I’ve saved a tonne of time speaking to only serious people as the people that are not serious just cull themselves. 

My number one rule is don’t get too invested. You can easily think that a person is perfect for you based on interests/philosophy of life but what I find it comes down to is the vibe. Are you attracted to the vibe of the other person?

I thought I loved her before then, but damn was I wrong. I fell so hard for this woman. She is just so genuine and sweet, helpful, kind, smart, goofy as hell, and I just can’t fathom losing her. About 2 weeks ago, she went through my old phone. I don’t remember doing it, but evidently I tried to cheat on her and searched for hookers near me.

I apologized to her and talked it over. After a little bit, she was feeling a bit better but self conscious, understandably, and she asked me to not watch porn for a little while so I could focus on making her feel attractive/wanted. I don’t want to say I’m addicted to it, but it is very difficult for me to stop. When I watch it I don’t even like it, and when I’m done I feel like shit. I had done well though so far. About 3 weeks into living with each other and I only had once after a particularly horrible day at a new job.

I wanted to stop for years now and it was a lot easier now, so I said I agreed. A few days later though, I smoked a little bit and was feeling sad and that’s usually what makes me want to. So I watched it. A few days after that she asked me if I had watched porn since she asked me not to. I knew if I told her I did it would hurt her, so I lied and told her I didn’t. 

She had went through my phone though (I told her before any of this that she freely could because I really didn’t remember the attempt at cheating so no she wasn’t being nosey she was doing something I gave her permission to do). When she did, she found I had lied about the porn, and found even more from the cheating thing from a time before that was pretty early in our relationship. 

One she found just looked very bad and wasn’t cheating. After seeing it I recognized the account (Seeking arrangements). Fresh and Fit were found on it and Aba and Preach said it was going against what fresh and fit preach, which is how to be desired by women but keep your self respect. I loved both channels. I didn’t grow up with much of a father figure so learning how to be a man from them helped me a lot. I wanted to see which was telling the truth so I made an account, saw aba and preach were telling the truth, did nothing beyond that on the site, and unsubbed from fresh and fit. 

The issue is that is a really hard story to believe, even when dates for the videos and the account line up along with my YouTube watchlist. What made it even harder is I apparently went for Ashley Madison and several other hookup/affair sites at the time. I do not know why I have these accounts. I literally never used them, but having them ruined things. We are now broke up, but still living together. 

I have no intention of seeing others, and neither does she. She has my heart. Even if she didn’t in the past, she does now. I am going to try to get her to take me back after I get over the porn thing, but I don’t think she will take me back and honestly I don’t want advice on that. I just want to show her she is still loved. I am going to show her in every way possible so she doesn’t have to feel the feeling of being unloved again, but I will eventually have to repeat ideas so I would like some ideas from everywhere else. 

Please don’t tell me how horrible I am btw. I know I fucked up and I fucked it real bad. I don’t plan on trying to convince her to take me back until I get over the porn. Please help me help her. She deserves it more than anybody right now.

And earlier he told me that I should keep my options open when finding a good man during our talking stage. And he said that he doesn't want me to ""wait"" for him. Ever.

I told him that he doesn't have to mind me when it comes to this because I know when to let a man inside my life and that's not easy for me. I only talk to one guy at a time.

And I told him that if he thinks he should do it, then he can. Totally. But he told me that it's not easy for him to let a girl in as well.

So I asked him to go straight to the point. I'm confused because it feels like he's very into me. He updates me with his daily life, he confides in me, he's the one who keeps the conversation going, we talk a lot, we sometimes spend 3hrs in a video call. just earlier, he kept sending me videos of his visit to his parents.

He told me that he drank too much. I don't want talking to him whenever he's drunk. But I am really bothered right now. 😒😒

It feels like he just doesn't wanna hurt me because I'm a sweet girl who doesn't know how to get mad (I'm sorry I need to say this 😂)

Earlier  this year meet this girl on OKcupid... yes I said girl cause she was 20 yrs old I believe. She already has a kid mind you. Normally I don't really care about woman having kids simply because now a days it's pretty common to run into a single mother. But yeah I meet her on OKcupid, I wasn't blown away by her looks or anything. She only had selfies on her profile. She was OK at best, but I try not to be shallow and dismiss her solely based on looks, I gave her a chance.

 At first there were a ton of red flags we rarely talked on the phone, needless to say never video chatted, you know normal catfish vibes. But something told me ""she may not necessarily be a catfish, but she is definitely hiding something"". About a month later we meet in person and um... well she was the person in her pictures, but the pictures were a little miss leading and she was extremely malnourished it seemed. Before I get into my thoughts about her I just want to say overall she was a very nice girl, kind hearted and means well. 

First sight I knew sexual chemistry wasn't going to be there. Like I said face okay! body? Mmm she maybe weighed 60 lbs wet. I consider myself (fit). I like my woman fit, with a nice physic, and curves to her. She had the body of a dike respecfully. I didn't want to leave her and disrespect her or anything, we spent the weekend together getting to know her. Decent girl, so I decided okay fine let's give it a shot. She lived in GA I live in NC so we always didn't see each other but she'd drive to NC every now and then. I appreciated that showed effort and determination. Now throughout our time ( dated for 6 months) I never really formed that sexually chemistry with her, I think she sensed that. What she did was what really drove me to leave her.

Never have I ever asked a girl to buy me anything, and i mean anything. When the xbox series X/S came out I mentioned it couple times didn't think anything of it. Week later she claimed she bought it and it's on its way, me being in surprised and excited but also skeptical I started to see why I stayed around. Couple weeks go by no xbox, she swear up and down she bought it. I ask to see the receipt... never seen it. So by now I knew she lied but I was over it, but she continued to play alone saying oh the post office or mail carrier lost it 😊 yeah ok. Skip forward a month or so once again I mentioned I wanted to buy a Nissan Titan 21, same exact situation happened now I ended up believing her a little bit. She was so persistent about it. She claimed she made the down payments ( multiple of them) it was custom built, and it was sitting at her house in GA. Told her to send a picture, there was some excuse to why she couldn't. 3 months this truck was an issue after the 3rd month from when she told me about ""buying it"" to when it was ""delivered "" I told her I don't care no more I'm done with you then I broke up with her 

She used material things to keep me around. Even though I'm not materialistic at ALL. Never asked for these things but if you tell you got this stuff for me I expect to see them at first I told her "" no don't buy expensive stuff for me"" but she was hard headed or so I thought. Point is don't always feel obligated to lower your standards. What makes a person ugly is how they treat people and what they do to get what they want.

I don’t know why I’m not clingy I’m very nonchalant i have a bmw I’m attractive but what the heck is wrong with me i get very awkward so barley talk because I’m so self conscious so i studder is this why? I’m fit 4’11 cute but once guys chill with me boom nothing. Maybe because I’m an introvert i don’t have friends idk starting to feel like maybe this generation isn’t for me… or maybe after my ex there’s just no one for me?

They don't have contact anymore, since my brother graduated a few years ago. My mom knew how nice his kids were, specifically his son, who I will call Bill. Bill is a few years older than me, and he was dating someone else at the time my mom knew his dad. I used to see him around town but we never talked, the last time I saw him was a few years ago. My one friend was dating this guy, who was actually friends with Bill, which I found out right before my friend and her boyfriend broke up and stopped talking to each other/seeing his friend group. I saw him on social media and we have a lot of the same interests. He isn't on any dating apps, but he is single (and he has that he is interested in women on his facebook). I added him on linkedin since we had a few mutual connections (he accepted), but that has been the bane of our contact with one another. His instagram is private, but would it be weird to a) request to follow him, and then b) message him? I have heard of a few couples getting together that way, but that just seems super weird to me and I really wouldn't know what to say. But I really like him (from what I know, of course).
