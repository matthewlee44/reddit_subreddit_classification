I met my boyfriend (we're both 19) in november and we started dating at the end of december so it's only been a few weeks. Everything is going very well but I'm extremely confused about my feelings because he's my very first relationship.

He's a very good guy, I like him a lot, I love spending time with him, I love cuddling and kissing him, he's handsome, funny, respectful, we like the same things,... he's basically almost everything I was hoping to find in a partner. The thing is that I don't think I have any ""strong"" feelings for him.

I don't know how to explain it but I've only had one crush in my life and the feelings I had for this guy were super strong. I had butterflies in my stomach almost all the time and I couldn't stop thinking about him (dw I got over this crush a looong time ago and I don't have any feelings for him anymore). And I just... don't have that with my boyfriend, even if I'd like to. I sometimes have small bursts of butterflies when I think about us kissing or whatever, but it's rare and not nearly as strong as what I felt with that crush.

So yeah it confuses me a lot because even if I really like my boyfriend I feel like I'm not *in love* with him. I also feel like I'll never get that strong feeling I had with my old crush back and it kinda saddens me because it felt good.

He's my first boyfriend so I obviously have nothing to compare him to except that crush so maybe I'm a bit biaised, and I thought I might need some time but at the same time the feelings I had for my previous crush came almost right away so yeah I don't know. Maybe just I don't fall in love easily and that crush was just a stroke of luck ? Will I ever get these feelings again ??

Do you guys have any advice or experience to share on this ? At this point I just don't know what love is anymore lol

If he backs out last minute then I have my answer. He even told me he took several days off of work for this. He lives about a 10 hour drive away. We have talked everyday since we first started chatting. Usually all day long. We have intentions to date after meeting in person, one of us will move closer to the other. We have talked about the future and all that. Like meeting parents, work, etc. We have talked about how we are both long term people. We video chat, call, and text on the regular. He‚Äôs been pretty great so far. I mean we have so much in common and he‚Äôs easy to talk to. To be clear, I have verified his identity. In addition to video chatting, we Snapchat regularly. I found his sister‚Äôs social media and pictures of him on his family‚Äôs accounts too. Everything checks out. I have no reason to believe he‚Äôs a catfish.

He‚Äôs been leaving me on read or delivered for hours on end and his responses are pretty lackluster. He isn‚Äôt as consistent in his communication and he‚Äôs usually super responsive. Maybe he just wants to save some conversation for our in person meet. This is odd because earlier in our conversations he‚Äôd joke if I left him on read for an hour or two.

I am kinda chaotic politically but for simplicity's sake, I am very libertarian, sorta centrist between left and right but leaning right, BUT I do have some quack opinions on certain issues that might make her hate me, nothing ideological just very nonstandard stuff that most people would hate me for before I could hope to explain myself.... But I am very open and agreeable and love to learn about people's political beliefs, when I see someone who opposes me politically and or morally I don't try to change their opinion but instead, I try to learn all I can and evaluate if some of the stuff makes sense. I don't believe in anything that doesn't make sense to me and I am open if what you say makes sense.

In short, If she and I were to date and politics comes up how should I handle this? I just want to be able to talk with her and disagree or agree wherever and still continue dating but from my searching online most people would never even consider dating someone who opposes them politically :/



I don't want to ruin what I have with her but I also want to go further with it, (I'm almost certain she does too).


Am I screwed?



An example that gives me hope was when she was and a classmate (we are in college) were talking minor politics and you could see the ideology demons start to flare up when she just use her charisma to make the whole thing into a laugh, both her and the dude (and me) were laughing by the end of it and we all made a group chat because we got along so well, But perhaps that was just because he is a classmate and not a romantic interest... :/



TL;DR

Me and lady friend disagree on some politics but might be in a romantic relationship soon, would our potential relationship workout?

I've written here in the past about my dating experiences and thanks to a lot of advice from here and soul searching within myself I feel like I am in so much of a better place.

I am a 22M asian and over the last year I asked out a large number of women who pretty much all rejected because I was too short, or too nerdy or not rich enough for them they would often tell me so I finally decided to embrace the heartbreak and just focus on being the best possible version of myself. I am focusing on building lean muscle, becoming a web developer and I want to make some indie games as well when I have time and I feel so liberated from not having the pressure I put on myself to find a companion. I have just accepted I think I am better off staying alone and if I meet someone I will be overjoyed! But it's not something I want to spend time actively looking for like I used to.

I don't hold any kind of bitterness towards these girls, I understand why they thought the way about me, being a brown guy living in the UK could be a bit intimidating for women especially when they have so many other options of guys who have a similar race and upbringing to them whereas I don't drink, smoke or party. I just like to code, go the gym and play some halo so I understand why women don't find that appealing.

It just honestly feels so refreshing and I can't help but smile when I see how much growth I have made over the person from being insecure and feeling like I needed a girlfriend to now being very comfortable with the idea of dying alone.

I always see him when I meet up with a bunch of people outside. In the beginning he used to always hug me, up until the end of December. He used to come up to me to say hi and he would always hug me. He's always very drunk, tbh I think he has an alcohol problem. He would often randomly ask for hugs or touch my hair or arms which I was btw fine with and he would always stand around me.

In November I found out he has a girlfriend but I never see him with her. I only saw her one time and she gave me dirty looks. There was this one incident at night in the end of December, he told me something like ""hey it's weird you're always first place on top of my stories"". Later that night I was walking with some people I met that night and I was gonna tell them bye because they had to leave. He was walking towards me and I noticed he was extremely drunk and he started hugging me a lot. I asked him if he's okay and it sounded like he was crying and he was like ""yeah never been better"". Then he asked me if I love him. I was drunk too, he hugged me like 10 times then he held me really hard and walked me backwards to the rest of the people there. He sat on the floor and I sat a little away from him because I was so confused. About 5 minutes later he left and he came down to hug me bye and he let himself fall on me

Then after this night nothing happened, only once. I asked someone if my hair smells like smoke because someone around me was smoking. The whole time he was around me, then when he stood next to me he stared at me and asked if he can smell my hair too. Now the past times I saw him, he always immediately leaves when he sees me.

So it's absolutely fair game for me to be asking how much debt you have (and how much progress you are making on paying that off), what your degree is in, how much you make and if you will be a financial asset or liability. Love can only take a relationship so far and if you're not on a similar financial situation as your partner your relationship will derail and one person can take down the relationship without much effort. 

The truth of the matter is that while I'm not ""money oriented,"" you do need a certain amount of it in order to survive in society, have a little bit of fun, and not be stressed out to the max all the time. If my partner is deeply in debt, how am I going to enjoy vacations that I've saved for, fun planned activities, buying nice food, etc.

Now, I'm not going to say you need to make 6 figures, that's unrealistic, but I do require the women in my life who I am dating to at least have a full time job

He texted me nonstop morning till dark. I felt so incredibly special, a connection I had never felt before. 

I left my town this past weekend, and he agreed he wanted to keep dating even though I was going to be gone. But as soon as I left I felt a bit of a dip in his communication. He stopped being so flirty, and I definitely noticed a huge difference once I got on that plane. 

We‚Äôve still been texting every day, back-and-forth and he keeps telling me he can‚Äôt wait until the next time he sees me and that we will have to meet up whenever he‚Äôs in my city and that I need to let them know when I‚Äôll come visit there. I asked when is the next time he‚Äôll be coming up because he vacations here a lot and comes for work and he told me he has no idea. This was just a couple days ago.

Well, apparently he‚Äôs not very smart because he shares his location with me and he‚Äôs in my city right now. Like on a trip this weekend right where I live and didn‚Äôt tell me. And I saw because I was trying to find my friends iphone, and see his little icon hovering near all my other friends. 

It‚Äôs the most insane thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Because he‚Äôs texting me like everything‚Äòs normal. He even blocked me from viewing his stories but isn‚Äôt apparently stupid enough to block my friends. Oh, and he‚Äôs 27. I‚Äôm just so blindsided at why somebody could do this. And blocking me from seeing stories, really? At the very least he could‚Äôve told me he was gonna be here but didn‚Äôt have time to see me this weekend or was worried about xyz and that‚Äôs why. He literally could‚Äôve just told me the truth that he was up here and that he just didn‚Äôt have time/want to see me!! But instead he has to lie and be sneaky and tell me about how bored he is at home. Sending me smiley faces and trying to make small talk.

But he‚Äôs been lying through his teeth  He even called me on the phone earlier about how ‚Äúbored he was‚Äù. Yet he‚Äôs posting pictures all around my town behind my back. He‚Äôs been texting me every single day since I left my hometown btw. 

I should be done with him right? I don‚Äôt know why somebody could lie to my face like that. Or, over the phone. I thought this was something he wanted to continue and that he was going to let me know the next time he was here, I didn‚Äôt think it was going to be literally the next weekend. I just don‚Äôt understand how somebody could do this after a month long connection where he treated me like a queen. And then do this and then lie about it. It‚Äôs extremely hurtful. I‚Äôve never had a guy lie over and over like this before or go behind my back like this. And I know we‚Äôre not officially  bf/gf, but he was the one that said we‚Äôre dating and exclusive and he‚Äôs the one that came on so strong in the beginning so it‚Äôs still incredibly hurtful. He has been backing off the past few days but still insisted on wanting to see me soon. I‚Äôm just so confused and hurt.

Im in a large city in southern california and over the last year gone out with a lot of girls. I'm 28M, have a good job, educated, generally pretty athletic, etc.  Does anyone else find it hard to date without alcohol being involved.  I cant tell you the number of girls who will literally only want someone to pay for their drinks. I like doing tons of things outdoors, there are museums, a world class zoo, beaches, that I have planned really fun dates to go with. However many girls want someone just to pay for their drinks and then drop them after a couple dates. Over the last year, I've met girls at different areas - work, through mutual events, dating apps, etc so I try to be fair about not generalizing. But many of the girls seem to be interested only in having things paid for and putting no effort into any part of the date.  Literally one girl showed up to a movie premier I had gotten special tickets for us 30 minutes into the movie and then afterword became annoyed when I wouldn't go out and buy her drinks.  I dont drink/smoke and I keep it pretty obvious (its on the dating apps, and when I meet people in person and it comes up naturally I mention it).  Another girl I met through work, I bought tickets for an event we were both looking forward to, then when the day came, she had ""plans come up"" an hour before. So I went by myself because I wanted to go. Then halfway through the event, she called and said she was now free, and I could take her to dinner.  Another girl I went out with, I got tickets to the zoo and brought her, we went to dinner after and I paid.  There was a christmas village event with many food stalls along with entertainment. She said she wanted to get drinks (she already knew I didnt drink, so I figured she just wanted something for her), we waited in line and when we got to the front she turned to me and said ""you are going to pay for me"" and ordered a $30 drink.  

So I guess this is a two part questions:  First, how do people who dont drink deal with those who seem to make it the only thing they want to do? 

Second, how do you deal with flakey girls who seem to only want to be entertained, flake out, or just have money spent on them.

Late last year I met a guy who I ended up casually seeing (explicitly both agreed that we were not dating) for about 3 months, meeting once every week or every other week, and all of our meetups except for the first few ones, we would hookup. He was my first. He was very patient about that. We didn't just have sex everytime, but we would cuddle and watch something, we would order food, he made dinner, we saw a show together, I slept over a few times he would give me kisses and hold hands when we slept. I was of course enjoying his company and since it was the first experience of this casual thing, I just went with all of it.

In the beginning I told him I wanted something sexually exclusive where I could explore and have fun because I'm new to all this. He agreed then, but the last time we met I wanted to confirm that we were still sexually exclusive (mostly looking out for my sexual health as he has did not use a condom a few times) just so we were still on the same page. He assured me that it was still the case. Additionally, he was always open about who he was hanging out with, and told me he was going to visit an ex he was still friends with over the holidays. After that conversation though, he was not as responsive. I've reached out a few times after that, but I only got very lukewarm responses. Definitely not the same as before.

It has been a few weeks and I haven't heard from him so I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to continue our setup anymore. Now I know there could be a million reasons for fading out: got back with his ex, just lost interest, got busy, whatever. I've been moving on, hasn't been the easiest thing but I think I'm doing a good job (please congratulate me haha). I've been doing well of just not reaching out because he's obviously not into it anymore, but like I said, I was new to all of that so, after those months, after things we did, is it just a normal thing to fade out like that? I know ghosting happens all the time but I think we got along as friends. I don't want anything confrontational, just like hey so that was a thing we did and it's fine if we're not gonna do it anymore. Or should I just continue what I'm doing of leaving it alone and we're just never going to speak again?

Then I found out he was still following his former ex, who even doesn't follow him back and in relationship since few months ago. I told him I feel uncomfortable, and he unfollowed her saying he understood.

Then since this Monday, I felt something is different with him. We were long distance who can meet only on weekends. So seeing him distant for days on text and calls was killing me inside. 
I mentioned this last night and found out his depression got severe this week. And we had a deep on the phone for 1.5 hour. We found out we wouldn't work out so we decided to break up.


After breaking up, he deleted his IG pics, profile pic, bio and unfollowed around 50ppl last night.(He still follows me tho) Then he posted a moody meme on his story.
Even tho we broke up, I still care about him and his mental health, so texted once in the morning 'Hey, you ok?'.
Then he never replied. It was fine until that point.

But I just found he ran to his former ex's IG account and pushed likes on her posts uploaded last night, while still unfollowing her.
I wanna throw up. I was there for him at his darkest moments, kept trying and trying to not to give up and gave us opportunities again and again for months. But he just did that right after we called it a quit.

When I created my profile again, I used photos that showed me well-dressed, in social situations, and doing a few different activities. My bio described my hobbies, where I went to school, and that I was looking for a serious relationship. The results? In 3 weeks, 12 likes on Tinder and 6 matches that went absolutely nowhere despite my best efforts at starting a conversation. In fact, only two of those matches even responded to me. I went on a single date with one of the matches who responded and tried to take it slow and be respectful during the date, but she unmatched and blocked me afterwards. 

At the start of this week, I tried something completely different. I made my first photo a shirtless photo, made my bio a single sentence joke, and deleted a couple of my other photos. The results this week? 40 likes and 20 matches, including a hookup on Wednesday and another one that will most likely happen tomorrow. Instead of trying to start a conversation, I would make my opener something sex-related without being too over the top. I got way more conversations and interest from girls once I started using the shallow fuckboi approach.

On one hand, I'm thrilled with the attention I'm getting, but on the other hand, I feel like I'm not being my true self at all. I want a relationship more than hookups, but it seems like the only way to get any kind of engagement from girls is to be a chauvinist. I guess I'm technically looking in the wrong place for a relationship, but I really don't have many other options in the area I live. It's an extremely expensive region and most young people my age leave after college or move here already married.

Do any other guys feel pressured to be inauthentic and shallow on these apps?

There's another way to get women!

Wait. What?!? No way! Really?!?

Yes. Really.

Just so you know that I know what I'm talking about, here are some facts:

\- I've been married for 25 years.  
\- I am 50 years old.  
\- My wife and I have had an open relationship for the last 15 years.  
\- In the last five years I have dated over a dozen different women. By ""dated"" I don't mean dinner and a movie. I mean taking them home or going home with them. You figure out the rest.  
\- In the year immediately before lockdown I ""dated"" seven different women.  
\- I'm not especially good looking or fit. I'm pretty average looking. I have glasses, a beard, and I'm a HUGE nerd.  


Ready for the other way to get women?

Are you sure?

Here goes...

Talk to them.

I said talk TO them, not AT them. Ask questions about their likes and dislikes. Ask them about their goals and aspirations. Listen to their answers. Relate to them when you can. Don't assume you're right, and FOR FUCKS SAKE (here's the big one) don't assume that they are wrong about ANYTHING. If they are wrong about a fact and you KNOW they're wrong, just let it go. (Unless it's literally life-or-death.)

Human beings (yes...women are human beings) want to talk about themselves more than others. Resist the urge to talk about yourself. Encourage her to talk about herself. Don't try to show how smart you are or how strong you are. And DON'T SHOW YOUR DICK UNTIL SHE ASKS!!!!

Here's another secret: Women don't care what your dick looks like. All dicks look pretty much the same. Half the population has one. If she wanted a random dick she could get it. Yours isn't that impressive to her. She's seen bigger.

Do the thing that the other guy didn't do: Show some interest in her directly.

On the second date we had sex (initiated by her). In between the second and third date, she let me know she passed out and ended up in the hospital. I sent her some flowers saying ‚ÄúHope you feel better soon‚Äù.

When she received the flowers she said she really loved them and they were nice. When she ask why I gave them to her I said ‚Äúseems like you have had a rough few days and thought it would be nice‚Äù. I never mentioned the flowers again in any future conversations because I honestly didn‚Äôt expect anything in return. 

We went on our third date and it seemed to go well, well I thought it did. Unfortunately, she ghosted for a little over a week after the date. I initiated the conversation again because I left my watch at her place after our second date asking if I could get it back. During this conversation she broke it off with me saying she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel a connection‚Äù and that the flowers made her feel ‚Äúvery pressured‚Äù because we only been out a couple of times. 

Making her feel ‚Äúpressured‚Äù made me feel horrible. When I went and picked up my watch I apologised for making her feel pressured, that wasn‚Äôt my intention and wished her all the best for the future.

So I have a very close friend who is a girl, for about 1.5 years we were very close friends and I didn‚Äôt look at her in any type of romantic way, I‚Äôm not sure how but probably becuase I was always at home by myself working due to the pandemic and all we would do is talk to each other all day.

So around June last year I started falling in love with her hard but I just knew she didn‚Äôt feel the same, and her behaviour changed a lot. Talking about herself way more, telling me about the guy she was infatuated with etc and I felt like I never got to talk about myself anymore and it was all about her.

We‚Äôre in Australia so we had a 3 month hard lockdown when this happened so the hole I fell into was so much worse because I literally couldn‚Äôt do anything and all I would do is talk to her and listen and it killed me. I lost about 12kg in 3 months becuase she made me feel sick, I couldn‚Äôt eat, had no energy to work out.

So that went on for months. Fast forward to end of lockdown. She broke up with the guy she always talked about which kind of made me sad becuase it‚Äôs sounds so selfish but the fact the she was at least only seeing one person gave some sort of stupid security that at least no one else could have her.

After she broke up with him, becuase I became her emotional tampon of sorts, she told me when she was going dates with other guys and I tried to hold myself together and not explode. Until she went on a date with an acquaintance of mine who I‚Äôm not very fond of and I let my emotions get the better of me and we fell out, she sent me voice messages how I was a bad friend and that im not acting like a normal person and that I was exhausting even though I pretty much listened to whatever she had to say for months on end.

The worst part about all of it is, I fell so hard for her that I literally couldn‚Äôt find any other woman attractive. So fast forward, we stopped talking which was really great for me, because lockdown ended and it must‚Äôve just been not talking to the person, not constantly wondering what they‚Äôre doing or where‚Äôs they are. I got my appetite back, started hitting the gym hard, talking to girls going out with friends etc, I felt awesome.

A couple times whilst we were not talking she sent me messages saying she missed me which I dismissed because I felt like she was just trying to reel me back in to be her emotional sponge again. Recently I saw her  at a New Years party as we share lots of mutual friends. I felt fine at the party, we talked alot and it felt like how things used to be, we walked to the beach arm in arm and left each other with a hug at the end of the party. I still felt fine the day after, but a few days later I texted her to come see me. I live about an hour away just for context. She obliged to see me that weekend and we texted a whole bunch during the week and about just fun stuff really nothing like it was months ago.

I‚Äôm not sure if I was getting the wrong impression but i feel like some of the texts did have a kind of flirty undertone. And she was sending me photos of what she was going to wear and how excited she was to see me.
So she caught the 1.5 hour train to come see me and she really made an effort to look pretty and presentable.

So we get on with our meeting/date (idk what to call it). I took her to two nice bars one which she was really pleased with as it included one of her hobbies (won‚Äôt get into that). Conversation is flowing nicely. I get brave and put my arm around her and she doesn‚Äôt resist. She says something along the lines of she can‚Äôt remember the last time she did this with a guy and how she loves me more than any other guy she‚Äôs dated. And how she wouldn‚Äôt have come all this way if she didn‚Äôt care about or love me. We go get dinner after and walking with my arm around her most of the time.

We say goodbye with a long hug, no kiss unfortunately. So everything pretty much the same as last week, talking having fun etc. yesterday we were texting and she gives me a hypothetical question of which person I would choose to date and she lists 2 people with different qualities one of them pretty much describing me to a tee. Conversation goes from there and again we get to the topic of how we missed each other and how she cried but we both just moved on blah blah. But she really made a point to outline how much she cared and missed me.

Anyways we talk again today. And I asked her yesterday if she was busy tomorrow night and she gave a maybe so so answer so. I took the hint and left it alone, I mention whether I can come see her again today and now she‚Äôs apparently going on a ‚Äúkind of ‚Äú date with someone. I‚Äôve falled back into the hole and worst thing is I arranged for. Flowers to be delivered to her on Monday with a message saying how happy  I am that. She‚Äôs back in my life and for her to make sure she‚Äôs free Friday night. And now I‚Äôm just stuck an emotional mess again. See how she‚Äôs reacts to the flowers I guess.
