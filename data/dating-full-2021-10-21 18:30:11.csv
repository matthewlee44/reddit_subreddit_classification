But as we are really not possible, I often turned him down on meeting up although upon his insistence, we did meet up a few times and we were intimate. Perhaps to say we had sex is more on point as he was always seeing multiple people and mostly only wants sex.

The last time we met before I left, he seemed to get a bit emotional and ended it because again, we are not possible to begin with anyway. So for the last months, we haven't been communicating at all until a few days ago, I received his text again. He basically wants to find out if i will come back visit soon. He seemed to kinda have a gf but he never mentioned so I didn't press further.

I guess my question is, does he like me a bit? Or are men like this, even if you're thousands of km away, they will still try their luck to see if they can be with a woman?

I've only been in one relationship and have been on a handful of first dates in the year since my breakup with my toxic ex. None of those dates have even progressed to a kiss. In my last relationship we met at a college party and slept together by the third date, which was the first time she came over to my place.

Fast forward to the actual story, a few weeks ago I met this really fun, cool person through Hinge. We'd had three really good dates over the span of 1-2 weeks. The progression was a single kiss, to multiple kisses, and we started making out by the end of the third date. Now on the 4th date, I invited her over to my place where I surprised her with flowers and we spent an hour at the nearby aquarium before we went back to my apartment where I cooked dinner for her, we got high, and watched a show on my bed. She had an open invitation to spend the night (because she lives far away) and seemed to be down as she came with an overnight bag and talked about getting ready the night before. While we were watching TV, we started making out again and I let her know ""if anything I do makes you uncomfortable, let me know"" which she agreed to before I started touching her. After a bit of light touching (never went anywhere near her pants but unbuttoned her top a little) she suddenly told me that she should probably get home tonight. I ended up walking her to her car, we kissed one more time, and I asked if I'd be seeing her again to which she replied ""maybe, I can be convinced"" in a flirty sort of way.

Now I've been confused for the last few days because she's seemed kind of distant, posted about a date with another person (totally fine, we're not exclusive), and kind of blew me off the two times I tried making plans with her. Last night it all finally clicked that I was probably going too fast and even though I let her know to stop me she probably felt pressured to keep going. I'll admit that my hope was to get a little more ""physical"" but I think I got so caught up in my excitement of dating this frankly amazing girl that mixed with my inexperience, I didn't realize that it only seemed like I wanted sex. I looked up some r/AskReddit threads after I came to that realization and saw that most people don't even talk about becoming exclusive until dates 6-8! I thought I was taking it slow but apparently my definition of ""going fast"" was as fast as a bullet. I feel absolutely terrible and I want to apologize to her but I think I've already come across as clingy enough. I don't want to mess this up, even though I probably already have. I'm not exactly looking for advice (unless you know a way I can fix this lmao) but some support would be appreciated. Man I feel like such a douchebag :(

“ is it because you don’t want to be a home wrecker? “ and I said “ no I just don’t like you”. Hurt his ego so bad he blocked me, and unblocked me just so he can call me again ,which I ignored.

I felt like I could be honest, open and gradually trust someone again. It was an amazing feeling. I felt as if we were building a foundation for something really slowly, but good things take time right?

It came to an end when they messaged me saying that they didn't know what they wanted and that they felt awful, but still wanted to be friends.

I've been beating my head against a wall, trying what little I can to change it. But I've been having some confidence problems as of late.

It stems from the fact that I haven't gotten a single date after all the effort I spent. And it mostly stems from the fact that I haven't been able to meet anyone. IRL, I go to events all the time and try my best to make connections, but the people I meet are never consistent and most people I meet never come back. And the worst part is that I'm a geek who likes anime and games so not a lot of girls show up to those events anyway. It's hard for me to even consistently make in person friends, let alone meet a girl IRL

I tried online dating and that didn't help either. The same problem occurred, no one was willing to talk to me. I kept mulling over why no one was even willing to talk or even attracted to me. Was it the fact that I'm 5'6? Was it the fact that my face and voice look and sound like a kid's? Was the fact that my room is always a mess somehow indicated on me in some way? It eventually got to the point where what little confidence I had in myself was gone

I've been trying to find some kind of scaffolding to climb myself out of this hole and love myself again. But every now and then, something sneaks into my Youtube recommendations or I see something on the street that shows other people's success in dating and it just makes me bitter inside all over again. Plus it feels like a lot of my qualities have already died out in some way anyways. I always tried my best to be kind to others, I'm learning how to be more consistently funny, and I get relatively good grades. I was even an All As and Bs student back in high school. But every now and then, something happens. I see other couples on the street, something pops into my recommendation that shows people and even my favorite content creators having a dating life while mine is empty. I end up becoming bitter, resentful and jealous of them. To top it all off, as unhealthy as it is, I end up feeling rushed. If it's this hard to find people at the college level, then it's only going to become more impossible as I get older

Honestly, I just want confidence and hope that things will become better for me. This is something that I really want and just can't seem to let go. I can't gain any dating experience to train my awkward self into being able to attract girls, I lack any confidence in myself which is further reinforced by a year of ghosting, and I can't even find a lot of girls with similar interests, let alone ones I'm physically attracted to.

I met this guy on tinder 1 month ago. We met two times and really had a great time. (We did not sleep together)
So, the last three weeks he has cancelled all our dates, perhaps 8-9 times. He cancels and then engages in meeting every single time. I’ve always waited hours for him to show up, and then he disappears from every platform and doesn’t answer until hours later. And never shows up. I know I’m good damn stupid and weak, but I guess I’m weak to physical abuse ‘cause of trauma. 
Anyway, when I’ve told him several times it’s enough and I block him from everywhere, he still finds a way to contact me. He called me, drunk, and asked to meet. I told him no, not after all that canceling+ the feeling of making me feel stupid after waiting hours for him, several times. He then said I’ve treated him badly and it’s all my fault. That I am crazy and selfish, and I had all this coming. Though I haven’t really done anything 
So we’re still in contact, and once again he ditched me this night.

My problem is that I get addicted to him. And I don’t even know if I am the problem since he won’t meet me, or if he actually is a narcissist using me for his own ego. Should I just run?

One day we met again two weeks after we met first time. I was too emotional on that day. Somehow I couldn't reach my friends(5 people) to go outside and take fresh air with them . Then I decided to call him to have a drink. I was pretty sure that he would not ignore me. He immediately accepted to meet me. Afterwards we went to his place which was very close to the place where we met. I was crying on his shoulders and hugging him. Tbh it made feel also good to be hugged by him. When the time came up to leave his place, İ kissed him from his lips. He was very surprised and he also kissed me again. Maybe I just took advantage of his attention on me.

Many people around him is aware of his happiness. Even her mother understood from his joyful voice. Those things make me feel responsible.

This girl, however, was really pretty and genuinely seemed to like the same things that I did. I considered it a win that she even responded to me to begin with if I'm being honest. 

Fast forward a bit and we meet in person. It was a killer experience. She seemed very sweet and shy, but still was a lot of fun to be around. We walked around the zoo and talked a bit and by the end of our first date we agreed that we'd like to do it again. After I'd walked her to her car, I mentioned that I felt like we'd met before. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something about her seemed really familiar. She smiled at me and said ""We have.""

Turns out that the girl I'd just gone on a date with was somebody I went to high school with, albeit a much different version of her. She was a grade below me, very unkempt and riddled with behavioral issues. She was suspended several times for hissing and biting at people. Since she was well known for being obnoxious and an all around scrub, I steered as far away from her as possible. 

I couldn't believe her when she told me. What made the experience even more interesting was her willingness to talk about her high school days. She explained to me that there were some outside factors and a pretty rough home life that had caused her some serious behavioral problems for years. She explained that she had hated how she acted in school, but it was brought on by legitimate mental health issues.

Have been dating around for 7 months now with some good success and a few duds. Almost had a relationship with a nice nerdy cute girl but she had some issues for whatever reason when things started to look like committing. The same thing happened after a few months with another girl, who wasn’t as emotionally troubled and confused with their life but was VERY busy. So it’s pretty realistic they just didn’t have the time. 

It’s only been 3 weeks with this new girl… but it’s like we’ve known eachother forever. Can stay up all night (literally did on the 4th date) and talk about nothing. Have the funniest and most random things in common. She’s also drop dead cute and beautiful. 

We have talked about “us” some and she told me that she hasn’t told another guy she liked them in at least a year. So as long as we keep it up, I can see some good things happening.

The problem is she doesn’t text as much as I’d like and initiate conversations. I kinda mentioned it but told her I understand she’s busy and she said “thank you”.

Anyway I should probably just do my best to not seem needy and bother her too much, but with how well we get along… after only a month I kind of want to ask her about being exclusive even though I’m seeing a few other people here and there too. With some of them, if I go off the radar long enough they always initiate “hey why are we not talking let’s hang” like I’d like her to.

I do want to settle down and start a family, but it's hard to find that someone. There's good things about me but I know there's things I need to work on.
TLDR, I need my own place and lose a bit of weight before I'll be taken more seriously in dating. Does that sound right? 

Career
I'm a software developer and I make fairly good money. With a bit of graft I know that my earning potential can be even greater. The IT industry as a whole is mostly male so its unlikely I'll meet someone through work. 

Hobbies/lifestyle 
Music is my passion and is a huge part of my life. I was in a band up until May of this year. I left for a few reasons, but I now realise how that was making me very one dimensional as most conversations would be centrered on that. Also, it was a massive drain on my time and finances. I started a promotions company nearly 3 years ago and that's something I'm immensely proud of and passionate about. I also manage 2 bands. This keeps me in touch with people in the music industry, and makes me feel fulfilled. I'd have thought I'd met someone at a gig by now. It seems that most girls I meet are either taken, too old.. Some have shown interest in me, but like I say they're much older. I did meet someone not so long ago but I asked her out and she wasn't interested. 
I like going to the gym, cooking, some retro gaming, and art too. I've been told I can hold a good conversation. 

Living situation
Probably a deal breaker. I did move back home in May of this year. I lost my job and to be honest it hit me very hard. I am going to be moving out soon though, once I'm settled in my new job. I do think I'd have better luck if I moved to a different area too. I live in a small town and dating was much easier when I lived in the city. 

Physical appearance 
I'm about 5ft9.. Can't change that. I have long hair. I was a lot more successful with women when I had shorter hair, so maybe I need to cut my hair if I'm serious about finding someone. I do need to lose some weight too, I'll admit. I did lose about 30lbs over lockdown but there's still work to be done. The long hair is like marmite to women I've found. 

I've used dating apps before, I'll admit I've been too reliant on them. I feel more confident talking to women at concerts, but that's the only place I really meet people to be honest.

So after my most recent separation a few months ago, I decided that I'd try and hold myself to a higher standard and only pursue someone who I genuinely thought was attractive both physically and mentally. And let me just say, wow it's tough. 

I guess maybe my standards are too high, I really don't know. I don't really have too many issues getting first dates but almost nobody lately has wanted a second one. I'm naturally an enthusiastic texter so I usually try and hold myself back from over-texting them and try and match their general conversation flow.

This woman who I was very excited about going on a 2nd date with on Sunday just canceled and told me she wasn't interested in pursuing things further. Which honestly didn't come as a shock, since her energy over chat was not incredibly enthusiastic. But dammit I thought we vibed during our first date.

We kicked it off great and saw each other a couple of days later and hung out for 6 plus hours in her neighborhood. We had good conversations and even ended up kissing and messing around a little towards the end of the date. She held out on having sex because she said she liked me and I respected that. She asked me if I wanted to see her again and I told her I did and was upfront with her about my current situation about being unemployed but that I'm actively interviewing for new jobs on a weekly basis and she was fucking cool as shit about it and incredibly supportive and told me we would be cute together. Fast forward to our second date and everything was going perfect again. This time around we ended up having sex and it was awesome. After when we were cuddling I told her how happy I was that we met and she agreed. We hung out two more times and it was all going perfectly. I even asked her if she was seeing anyone else and if she was I was cool with it, I just wanted to know for respect and honesty reasons - she said no. After our 4th date, everything was still going smoothly. We went back and forth about how we missed each other and she even invited me to hang a couple of times but I wasn't up to it. Made up some white lies to get out of it but it wasn't out of not enjoying her company, I just felt like not doing anything on those days she invited me out. That weekend after our 4th date everything was still good, we were texting and I was being sweet and telling her I miss her and want to cuddle her and kiss her and she enjoyed it and said the same. That Sunday is when things got weird. She texted me in the afternoon asking what I was doing and I told her I was just hanging out watching football and it almost seemed like it bugged her to an extent and the conversation kind of turned for the worse in terms of the energy I was feeling going back and forth. We texted until the evening time and I asked her if she wanted to hang out again this week and I got no response. The next morning I shot her another text asking if she was available to hang that night and she said she had plans with some friends. This went on all week. She was being very vague and that Friday she sent me a really nice text when she was out with her friends. We ended up seeing each other for a 5th time about a week later and when I got to her place her energy felt weird. She was all over the place and I even got her a dozen roses but the response was kinda bland. We continued the date and kissed and even cuddled and watched a show we both like and after we started kissing and she said she wanted to be honest with me and that she had sex with someone else and wanted to continue to see him - she even pulled me in close and started cuddling me again and we had a decent convo about what to expect moving forward. I told her I still wanted to see her and she agreed but it felt like she was doing it out of sympathy. I was gutted, I'm not gonna lie. We continued the conversation and she recommended that we don't text every day anymore and that she felt the connection was wearing off. A couple of days later I shot her a text saying I understand and respect your decision to not see me anymore and I truly did enjoy every minute I spent with you and I hope she finds what she's looking for. She responded with a long text saying it wasn't anything I did but the whole wanting to hang out with someone else. Anyways, it's been about 3 weeks and I'm still thinking about her nonstop. We still view each other's stories on IG whenever we post and each time I get this incredibly sad feeling that I won't be seeing her anymore. I want to text her but I know that's a horrible idea and this feeling will eventually wear off. The shittest part of it all is I have good intuition and the whole time we were hanging out I had this nagging feeling about her but I continued to ignore it and decided to be optimistic. I don't know what the purpose of this post is but I guess it's just for support. I really liked her and I honestly have never felt that way about anyone. I'm a good looking guy, 6'4, blue eyes, and have a great face and atheltic body (not trying to be egotistical) I'm overthinking about her every day and wanting to text her but at the same time I'm holding on to this little bit of hope that she will eventually change her mind and I'll get this text from her admitting she made a mistake (I know, this is dumb).

But are they the one? I had the opportunity to sit down with some friends and discuss the top 5 Red Flags that we have noticed after dating around.

1. Love Bombing; Love Bombing is a type of narcissistic tendency that can ultimately develop into an abusive relationship. Personally, I have seen this. The relationship feels like it’s moving a bit TOO fast. Love bombing is not just dropping your pants too soon. Love bombing is a form of manipulation that an individual will utilize in order to influence the other individual through demonstrations of attention and affection. A good example of this is saying “I love you” right out of the gate. There is no fine line with when certain things can be said or done in a relationship, but if you personally feel that things are moving a little quick, take a step back and reevaluate the situation. Are there any other red flags you have noticed?
2. Controlling; Another example of a toxic tendency in a relationship is the attempt to control the other individual. Whether this be through telling him/her what to wear or who they can/can’t hang out with. At the end of the day, a relationship consists of two individuals. A relationship does not signify the loss of your personal identity. Oftentimes, two people will become so intertwined with one another, that they forget the life they had before meeting this person. Although you are now in a relationship, you are still your own person. Your significant other’s opinion should not be the end all be all. When your partner is attempting to control you, this is a red flag. There should be a mutual understanding that you each have your own individuality and can still enjoy life without your partner breathing down your neck.
3. Bad relationships with friends and family; This can also be a major red flag. Yes, everyone experiences issues with their friends and family, but typically a mature adult will be able to have open conversations with the important people in his/her life. If you notice that your significant other has bad relationships with what seems like everyone, maybe this is a testament to how your relationship is going to develop. If he/she cannot maintain a healthy relationship anywhere else in their life, how are they going to pull it together for you?
4. Talking about their ex-partner WAY too much; banter about past relationships is normal and actually healthy. It is helpful to discuss past relationships that may have failed due to certain issues arising. When you and your partner both feel comfortable to have an open conversation about your past, do so. However, there is a fine line between healthy banter vs. demonstrating an obsession with your ex-partner. Oftentimes, someone who is constantly venting about their past relationships, is still not over their ex or has not found contentment in themself as an individual. This is a red flag and is often hard to deal with because it can become draining. You feel as if you have been shoved to the back burner. So, avoid this! Find someone who is comfortable with themself.
5. Being flakey; last and not least is a personal tell-tale for me. At the end of the day, what separates a good partner from a bad partner is reliability. In every relationship that has failed, thus far, I was bombarded with excuse after excuse. We would make plans that would fall through, not to much of my surprise, as I almost expected it every time. Find a partner who wants to be there for you. Find someone who enjoys helping you out, not because they get something out of it, but because they care for you. Did they promise to go to an event with you and then flake at the last minute? Oh wait, that happens every other weekend? THEY ARE FLAKEY!!!! Date someone who you trust your life with. Someone who you know, will always have your back, and until then, surround yourself with people who do love you and learn to love yourself first before giving someone the power to love you.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1085693,public,self,TOP 5 RED FLAGS,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd4gd8/top_5_red_flags/,all_ads,6,,,

I don’t take that many photos of my life but I did take a few and they got me some matches (about one per day or so) but the conversation was almost impossible to properly begin, let alone organise a date. 

I experimented with forwardness, quirkiness, trying to funny, trying to just say what came naturally to my mind, but alas: no sauce. Most of the conversations fizzled out or the dates I went on didn’t have the chemistry.

So I tried the old school approach. I started building a group of friends at my rock climbing gym and we’ve taken some steps to get more social. The issue here is that the vast majority of the girls we bump into at the climbing gym are either spoken for or swarmed with male attention. 

I’m not super forward naturally, and I can play the aggressive forward guy reasonably well but only for so long, it’s exhausting otherwise not being me me. 

When I’m just me, I don’t naturally catch the eye of many women, to be honest I feel kinda invisible most of the time.

We seemed to have hit a bit of a dead end. With the Covid precautions still in place it’s tricky getting the guys to meet up outside of the climbing gym, and I’m stuck figuring out what direction to go.

Im a 19\[M\] and the following is what I ecounter on a daily basis with online dating. I primarily use Hinge due to the profile creation of prompts and creativity of sending messages. Plus I often get more matches and convos.

I match with a nice girl, I start the conversation and make a funny joke in regards to her hobbies, I talk to her about my hobbies. She thinks I'm funny and asks for my Insta.

We both follow each other and have more conversations. I flirt a little (Without being pushy or needy) and a day later I set up a date for tea and a walk in a public park with my two dogs.

She confirms and gets excited to see me and I loo forward to the date.

The day before the date I confirm and ask if she's still down. She still confrims. great.

The day of the date she texts saying ""I won't be able to make it, something came up.""

I reply to her and keep it cool and say ""thanks for letting me know, we can reschedule another day.""

I never hear from them again. Why do girls flake like this last minute? Im genuinely curious as to why girls emotions change the day of the date and if I did something to throw them off. What makes you want to cancel a plan last second? This has been happening on 95% of my dates and matches so far and it's super fucking exhausting.

      I knew it was wrong, but I thought I was protecting myself. In reality I hurt the ONLY person who didn’t abandon me. I’ve lied and I’ve cheated. Our relationship is over because of me. Someone I love is hurt because of me. Because of me all this happened. 

      Because of me my whole world crashed and burned around me. I deserve this. This is what I get for hurting her. She’s cordial. Surprisingly. She’s gracious. 

    She wants me to go to a therapist and “wants to see how this works out for me”. I need help. Please no judgement. I already feel like shit and am on the edge due to this and a recent suicide of a friend. There’s nothing you can say to make me feel worse. Any help?

Texted a little throughout the week and he asked if I wanted to go to this restaurant with him and we agreed on Wednesday. On Wednesday night he didn’t text me until 6pm asking if we could reschedule because of work… at first I was really annoyed but he seemed genuine about wanting to make it up to me and reschedule. We rescheduled for tonight and he was texting me all morning! Finally at around 5 I followed up and asked what the plan was for tonight. Now it’s almost 9pm and no response. I sent him a text saying “thanks for wasting my time” because I just couldn’t take the silence. I’m so upset. I was really looking forward to a 2nd date with him. I’ve been on 10 first dates in the past month and haven’t clicked with anyone, but I felt like I clicked with him. Now I’m fucking back to square one. I just feel really upset and like I want to give up on life.
