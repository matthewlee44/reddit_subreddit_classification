I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a few months now. We were friends for nearly a year before he confessed feelings. I knew I’d always liked him but found it weird he never once made a move.

I recently joined social media and checked out his friends list, as well as click on suggestions of who to follow based on who he does. I saw he consistently liked photos of 3 girls in particular (in our town). Most of the likes came from sexual/sexy photos with them in little clothing.

It’s got me feeling like all the time we were friends he was really wanting these other women and came around to me when it didn’t work out. Is this something I should bring up?

white men in their 30s and 40s, black short hair, super nerdy, average male height not too tall or too short, not a buff body kinda muscular not too muscular, some stubble on face like shaved off beard like around their whole mouth up to the ears cheeks, dark eyes like brown or black, like a pointed nose i guess, black eyebrows. Skinny man hands. They must wear glasses like clear oval glasses or like rectangular black frame skinny glasses. Almost like a teacher appearence or a nerdy like professor.

I have two male crushes in anime Mr.Mikisugi from Kill La Kill and Levi slightly from Attack on Titan and from My hero academia the teacher Aizawa. Those men are kinda my type.

Masturbation- I pleasure myself before bed and watch porn and hentai. I use my index and middle finger and rub my kitty area in circles near my clit. Touching my clit directyly is very sensitive and kinda painful so i stopped doing that technique. Im afraid of fingering my hole completely so i avoid the technique. It feels really really good and a escapism technique i use. It feels good for like 30 minutes to pleasure myself but after im done climaxing i feel so empty. I feel empty cause its just like drugs its escapism. Its just temporary feeling good time. I also get very sleepy and helps me sleep after i orgasm and I have wonderful dreams of older men arousing me!

seeing a teacher or an older man that meets my criteria seeing his boner bulge is the sexiest thing ever! I stare at guys boners in the store and its just so frikin hot!

I have been seeing this guy for three months we are both in our late 30s He was kinda casual and we saw each other one a week the most . I really liked him and always offered to see each other more often or do something but he wasn’t very interested, yet he did call me every day and texted me every single day we could talk hours on the phone. However he would never invite me when he went out with his friends. 

I understand that it’s too early but I can’t do casual so after a month or so I started to ask him what’s the issue and why we don’t spend more time together to which he never replied clearly .We had a few arguments about it but always made up. 

I asked him numerous times if he’s interested to date and didn’t say no or anything, I even said that I want out of this if he’s not into it and he asked to stay and that  he’s sorry and that we will do more things together.

When we are together we always had a blast. He started to get kinda distant. No really open with me. Recently I really got tired of this treatment so I confronted him and he said he’s not ready and scared that he doesn’t think we will work out , that he cannot give me what I want and a relationship, and that he’s not in the right state of his mind and life . 

He said I’m one of the best girls he ever met but he thinks it’s not working , I said why he just couldn’t be honest with me rather than wasting my time and drugging me for three months . He said he was thinking it will work . Bla bla He does seemed to be interested at the begging but still was kinda casual . 

I even asked why he never invited me when he went out with his friends and he says he doesn’t want ppl to think he’s in a relationship. He told me many times that im fun , nice and beautiful I really don’t get what’s the issue. 

And he today  texted me “hope you have a good day “. Why he’s texting me the next day after we split ?! 
Should I even respond to this text?

TL;DR He said he can’t give me a relationship but he wants to be friends  and hang out And see , maybe even something will happen , he said that he wants me to go out with him and his friends as his friend.

When we finally went out, things were great. We see each other regularly. 
Anyway today I sat down and realised we’ve seen each other about 16x since September. He still hasn’t asked me to be his gf. We’ve talked a few times  about how we’re both looking for a relationship and it was in our dating bios on bumble. We haven’t slept together yet because I told him I only have sex with people I’m in a relationship with. Despite knowing this he’s tried to initiate sex a few times. And I’m starting to feel that’s all he’s after. Yesterday he said “the main guy thing is to hope it turns to something more” and clarified he meant sex. We talked about relationships yesterday and he said he likes the pace things are going at. 
Last week he said he wanted to be exclusive and not see other people (and I stupidly agreed), this is after he noticed I had a few notifications from tinder/bumble. 
He’s never been in a relationship. He says he’s had sex once. He’s not traditionally good looking, in fact a lot of people say he’s unattractive. But I weirdly like him. I feel I’ve invested so much time into this man and I’m having my time wasted. I have more dating options than he does, we both know this and he doesn’t want us (I.e me) to see other people but yet he doesn’t want to become official. I’m so confused.

I met this guy and we have been in the talking stage for about a month now. I rarely get to see him because he is so busy but he does make the effort to see me when he can. We have probably only seen each other in person about 5 times in the past month. Thing is besides the first date,  we haven't really had any other dates where we weren't hanging out at each other's place. I feel like this is the stage to put in effort into wooing me, taking me out on dates, buying me flowers and showing romantic gestures. He does none of that. 

I'm honestly not quite sure if this is because we are in a talking stage and not officially dating and I don't know how to bring this up with him without seeming entitled to his money. I know he can afford it but I also don't know if these are realistic expectations at this stage. 

I'm doing quite well for myself and can afford to initiate dates and pay for them but in my past relationships, I've always been the giver. It comes very naturally to me. I'm already thinking of buying him a Christmas gift but I'm thinking I need to hold back because I always initiate the giving and they hardly reciprocate. 

Considering it's a very slow talking stage as we have not seen each other a lot in the past month due to his busy schedule, am I overthinking things?

And this kills me everyday…. 

Because here I am, having a perfect boyfriend… that really have everything I really want… but he just don’t give me this feeling and happiness, like this guy does….

And on the same time, this other guy, he don’t have a education, he’s only working. He’s gonna start education next summer.

I'm in very good shape, I'm well educated, and I've grown as a person both in terms of emotional development and hobbies although I admit Im still working on improving that. Unfortunately however I haven't figured anything out dating wise, and I need a few ideas! 

So far I've had 1 date before over the 7 years or so of trying, and haven't had any opportunities for hookups, even though I'm in a very young, dating focused city. It's become a running joke/mystery among my friends; I try apps, for which they help me with profiles, but I get no likes whatsoever. I've been to many speed dating events, where they leave you feedback anonymously afterwards. It sounds a bit silly, but I don't really get negative advice or feedback, just stuff like great listener, sweet/funny but not my type, along with no interest for a second meet. I go to a lot of social events to meet new people but nothing has ever come of it. I think I'm alright looking, I'm tallish, athletic (competing in amateur sports as a hobby) and my friends at least compliment some of my looks fashion wise.

I know that whatever the issue is, it's got to be my fault in some way, or something I can improve in myself, but everyone I ask tells me how surprised they are that I'm single and that I should keep doing what I was doing. Personally I know one habit I have that might be a problem is I ruminate. I'm only posting this because I run over problems like this, things I could have done better, over and over again when I'm by myself. Sometimes it helps, but I think with this it can become an unhealthy habit.

Maybe I should trust my friends more, but eventually I've gone to therapists and relationship coaches to try and nail down the problem, but they've told me that they can't find anything wrong with how I'm approaching this at all, alarmingly enough!

I'm really starting to get worried now. Is there some kind of approach i can try to meeting people or way of finding out what I'm missing or not working on? Is my concern even warranted? It feels like a red flag to have had no real flirty interactions after over half a decade of looking for them, and I worry that my inexperience could come to hurt me later. I want to be able to work on this area of myself, because I really feel that Ive been ready to start dating for a while now.

Unfortunately, over the course of my life I have not been exposed to too many successful long term relationships.

I am in the process of putting my life together after a rough ride through my twenties, so I'm not planning on starting dating tomorrow, but I will eventually. I have gained weight from psyche medications which I am going to address. I just got back to work full time as well and plan to finish an associates degree, then move on to bachelor's

I would like to date someone outside my culture (I'm American).  I prefer someone who is ambitious and works hard. Looks mattered way more to me than they should have when I was younger so that's not a high priority as long as I'm attracted to them. 

I was always pretty cynical when it comes to relationships. If I don't find anyone and remain single I would be okay with that. I would like to give it a shot again someday though. 

I should mention that I am a bi male. I've never had a relationship with a male, only with women.

I have had an issue for boundaries my entire dating life and men have been aggressive, pushy with me to get sex, make a move. There have been plenty times when it was mutual or I was making a move, but more times than I’d like to count I’ve had men I.e. boys forcing themselves and not taking no for an answer. If I assert my boundaries well enough, sometimes they stop but they will turn sour and project onto me which is extremely unattractive. I am 33 yo female and at a point where I really want to find my person, I desire a long term commitment and possibly children. I took a break from dating to asses the reasons I keep attracting these guys I decided no matter what, next time I date I will go very slow and get to know them, then out of the blue I met a very interesting person at an event that I live going to weekly. He asks to continue the conversation and we set up a date for the next day, great conversation, good vibes, light hearted, lots of similar interest and life goals (not knowing about family yet) then at the end he tries kissing me, I say no I want to take it slow but I’m interested in getting to know him more. He seemed taken back by it and uncomfortable. Next day he sets up the next date a few days later, we go on a hike, great vibes again, I’m really really starting to like this guy, later we hold hands and I feel good about that. Then later, we had to stop at his house and I was about to leave that’s when he started trying to kiss me again, he kissed my neck without checking in with me, very uncomfortable then he kept going for more and once again I said not right now, I want to take it slower. He seemed weird about it again and then kept going for it, basically I eventually caved in and we had sex. I stayed over and It didn’t feel right. I really like this guys for a lot of reasons but I feel very disrespected and like the purity of the energy between us is tainted now, I think it could have been a lot better, when I was actually ready for him, if I decided we would be a good match.

We got pretty close. He’s very wealthy and intelligent and he knows it. However, he has major baggage. He’s a double orphan, and by that I mean his biological parents are both dead and his adoptive parents died in a car crash when he was 22. It’s awful, He doesn’t have *any* living family. 

He’s very wealthy, so the people that surround him aren’t entirely genuine. It makes me quite sad. Our relationship didn’t work out because at the time he was very selfish and unwilling to be a caring partner. But I know he loved me, at least for awhile. I even spent time with him and comforted him on the anniversary of his parents death. He said that nobody had ever done that for him before, even though they had been dead for five years. He cried in front of me and confessed how alone he feels in this world and how he never knows if somebody is truly his friend and that he wishes more than anything he had family. It broke my heart and I think about it all the time. Even though after that conversation, he never brought it up again.

Since our fling ended, I have moved away across the country for work but I still think about him almost every day. He reached out to me and asked to see me again and said he would come visit me. I told him I would be back in my hometown in a few weeks. It had been nearly 8 months since I’d seen him or heard from him. 

We met up tonight and he was completely arrogant, complaining about the wait staff and getting up to smoke every 10 minutes and even tried to get up and leave our table without paying, claiming he “forgot”. I don’t know why I felt the need to see him. I feel like somehow I need to help him or save him but I don’t know how. He was incredibly mean to me and negged me about my new job the entire time. Trying to make me feel small.

I asked him if he had plans for Christmas and he told me no. I tried to change the subject. He kept talking about his business and money and didn’t ask a single question about me. When I tried talking to him about my new city he would go on his phone and pretend not to listen. He invited me back to his apartment and pretended to be all sweet again, but I quickly left. He then called me annoying and told me that I always do this, that I’m like an annoying mom and that I can’t just be normal. Why after all of this do I still think about him and feel guilty? 

He literally treated me like crap and then still expected me to go back to his apartment. And he’s 30. But I just worry about him. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t deserve to be treated this way but I think about him almost every single day even now. I know he’s very depressed and needs help (he is addicted to certain drugs) but he doesn’t care, he doesn’t want to listen to anyone. And 99% of the people in his life aren’t genuine because he is wealthy and people are there for the wrong reasons. But I’ve had people close to me commit suicide and I guess maybe I have some sort of savior complex feeling like I need to prevent the worst from happening that I need to work on but I really do feel quite bad for him because I’ve been very lucky to have a good family and I don’t know what it’s like to not have people to spend Christmas with.

He flew away, I went by my life. A couple of months later we started talking again. But this time we became really really good friends. A little flirting here there but nothing too serious.

Don't get me wrong, you should open up to your partners and you should be there for your partners but the guys I go out with talk only about their problems and it's like they talk to me only because they can talk to me about their problems.
 I get that it sucks and it must be nice to have someone listen, but I want a partner who knows how to deal with his emotions instead of expecting me to do it. And I know I should be establishing boundaries but I feel bad because I essentially feel like I'm telling them I don't care.

Maybe it's because guys are never taught how to process emotions and they don't talk to each other about it but I remember don't want be your therapist, I'm not qualified nor do I want to.
I just want a partner. How do I establish boundaries or make it clear that I cannot be an emotional dump yard?

I hooked up with this guy from Tinder on our 2nd date. There were signs he just wanted casual sex quite quickly, but we still enjoyed each other’s company, watched a movie for 3 hours before anything. I thought - this might be a start for a good fuckbuddy or FWB! We talked on snapchat daily and he seemed to be into my life.

After sex he kept saying many times how we should do this again, and how I should come over. We cuddled at night and talked quite a bit. However there were a few things I didn’t like: at night he mentioned he could drop me off home in the morning, but when I was leaving in the morning, he didn’t say anything about it and I just left by myself.

I didn’t get a snapchat from him until 3 days later, which wasn’t “normal”. For example after the 1st date he kept messaged me the same night, and we kept talking throughout. Maybe he just kept going to keep me interested for sex, that’s what I assume.

Anyways he hit me up 3 days later, and it seemed like it was something he’d send to a lot of people simultaneously - a video of him watching a movie and eating snacks, with a text “yum”. I replied with a selfie, I get back a pic of his legs, that’s it. No conversation, so I left it there.

A little over a week goes by of silence and I get a snapchat from him saying “so if you still wanna meet, let me know”. I told him “Sure I’d love to meet again :)” He replied “Yay that’s great”. However It was Sunday had my period starting soon, I couldn’t meet the next week yet, so I told him “just letting you know that I’m quite occupied the next week so can’t do then yet” He replies “sure that’s fine, let me know then when you know”

I was happy! I’ll message him whenever I know my plans, and I didn’t stress being in daily contact with him so it was fine. A week goes by and I notice he has unfollowed me on Instagram (which is a big deal over here where I live - you don’t just unfollow people you talk to). And no, he was still on the dating app, not taken.

I thought, maybe he thinks I’m not interested as it took me over a week to let him know about my schedule and I still didn’t contact? So I shoot him a message saying “hey so if you still wanna meet up I could do next week? :)” He replies “Yup why not, that should work” I reply “That’s great!” and expected him to at least offer a day that could work for coming over to his place, but nah, I just got an emoji back “😇”. I think planning is a two way street, and he doesn’t show much enthusiasm about it, so I didn’t respond. I didn’t hear from him anything afterwards, so I just assumed it’s some new girl in the picture.

3 weeks of silence goes by and I get a snapchat from him. I assumed he’d be explaining why he left me hanging or offering a new day to meet. NO. He sent me a picture again, that’s probably sent to many people simultaneously: a pic of his dog with some Santa Claus hat and a text “doggie looking 5/5”.

This weak my girlfriend ended our 11+ year relationship. We still like each other very much, though she definitely doesn't like me in a romantic way any more. I am honestly devasted. To put this in a little bit of context: I still love this woman. I was planing on proposing to her... Also, I am currently in education, so I have not a lot of income right now. My live in the next few months will involve me moving out of our home (which I mostly organized) and finding a new place to life within a very limiting budget. Most of my social life is shared with my now Ex. Also, I don't have a lot of friends for basically two resons: First, I don't make friends easily. I don't like to go out in the traditional sense (I neither like clubs or pups). Also, I have moved 8 (soon 9) times during the past 11 years and never settled anywhere during that time... Well, apart from the home I am in right now... Ah, yeah and Covid doesn't make it any easier to find new people. 

I am really afraid about how my life is going to be in the next couple of months.

One thing, that isn't really pressing, but that is bothering me much, is: How tf do you actually date people? I have never done that. My ex and I got together in school. We met through friends and had a nice time in that group, before we actually became a couple. But now, I am kind of lost, when it comes to actually interacting with anyone.

When I contacted her again, she told me that she was not interested in meeting a second time. A friend of her told me lateron that I could have had sex with her on that day...

Another example, I met a girl on my Birthday party (friend of a friend). We made out but had no sex because she was having her period on that day and uncomfortable with anything more.

It happened a few hours ago, and it is both my first and probably worst date. We matched on Tinder and chatted when I initiated that we hang out. He agreed and we made plans for dinner at a restaurant near him. He doesn't have a license, so I had to drive 30 minutes to pick him up plus another 10 minutes to the restaurant where the meat in my dish was still raw and *heavily* overseasoned. It made me really nauseous, and watching him scarf down shrimp curry like someone was gonna take it from him didn't help. After dinner, we went for a walk and we held hands which was nice but then he kept putting his arm around me or my waist and it kept throwing me off balance so I was more focused on not falling than talking. We make it back to my car and I thought that was it for the night but then he pulled out his phone and we started watching tv in the backseat of my car. Because nothing says sex appeal like watching old episodes of Tanked in the backseat of a Toyota. He had been giving me eyes all night, like he wanted to kiss me, but I hadn't kissed anyone before tonight. It was truly, blatantly obvious. I don't even know why we kissed, I think I just wanted to get it over with, but my God it was terrible. His breath still smelled like shrimp and up close he *reeked* of old/fermented food because he had worked all day but I thought he would've showered beforehand. So at this point, we're making out, I'm *really not into it* but I'm honestly disassociating a little bit because I don't know what to do when I feel something hit my cheek. At first I panic, like *oh god my nose is running*, but then I remember my nose isn't under my eye. He started crying while we were making out. I don't even know why, I didn't ask, I'm pretty sure he said something but I couldn't hear anything over Tanked. Now every time I think about us kissing, I smell shrimp and old food and feel like I'm on the verge of vomiting. 

Essentially, my expectation of a first date is to talk and get to know a person and his was... not.
