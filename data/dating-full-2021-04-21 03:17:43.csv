If the women weren't there, then the men wouldn't be as incentivized to go. He also said that women must like to have the sexual freedom to be permitted to show their nearly naked selves off to the world and many likely go to show off. Is any of that true?

Personally, I go to swim, be with friends, and get sunlight/views. Maybe it would be different if I had friends who liked prowling for men on our outings?

Why I'm asking:
Anyway, for 27 years now, I have been going to the beach in my little bathing suit thinking that the world dresses in skimpy, tight clothing already, so getting glanced at at the beach should be just as negligable as anywhere else. If somebody looks at my body in a cafe, they're still only there for the coffee, usually.  Not the same at the beach? My bf said it was because of the bare skin and buttcheeks and because the girls want to show off.

To clarify, I don't want to show off or check anybody out. I want to splash around and get some sun lol.

I was so amazed though! What was I not noticing?? Lol. I don't see man buttcheeks at the beach, so maybe that's why I don't go there to take DL pics and check people out?? üëôüëÄ

Personally, no part of me goes there to show off to people other than my boyfriend. If anything though, I dress nicely for him and for myself, so I don't feel like I look less attractive to my bf than the other women. Also, if I was single, I usually wouldn't try to find a man at the beach at all, and I really don't check them out. Maybe if I was with a thirsty friend. Men sense my eyes, so I've learned to not be looking. If I heard a guy getting roasted or picked on, I'd probably look at him to make his friends jealous though. All minor details. 

Side note: A tip for getting a girl at the beach:

Also, just my take on this, if you go to the beach to try to find a girl, I suggest just looking like you're clean and have nice stuff. My boyfriend has like yeti brand stuff and name brand glasses but doesn't have his own apartment etc, and I think theses things are a waste of money, BUT it is attractive to me. Like, it indicates obvious attractiveness, like when a girl wears a very obviously pretty dress. You just recognize it as a symbol of attractiveness. Not about the bodies that much to me. Try focusing more on social cues like that about your reliability as a person and about how much you fit into a respectable/stable social group. If that sounds shallow, well, so is a pretty girl wearing a bunch of nice dresses then. :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,727774,public,self,Why do people go to the beach?

i think one of my issues is that i genuinely believe he's too attractive for me. i'm talking mad attractive, like i'm getting heart palpitations just thinking about it, which also worries me because truth be told, if i was having the conversation i'm having with him with anyone else, i doubt i'd be interested in continuing it/meeting up. i have a feeling that he knows full well he's attractive and therefore doesn't have to put as much effort into his interactions. the whole interaction just feels like i'm back in high school fawning over the popular dude, who is potentially only returning the attention to clown me. which is absolutely ridiculous, considering he's younger. on paper, we both appear to be looking for the same thing. on paper, there is potential here. but in reality, i don't know.

Instantly the connection was back, we talked for 7 hours through the morning (I got stranded with him but it felt like luck) we also hooked up.

He ended the morning jokingly saying ‚Äúokay let‚Äôs start looking for apartments‚Äù (we joke about being twin flames and moving too fast all the time) He said how perfect I was, beautiful, and how much he missed me. 

When I got home he basically begged to see me ASAP, and we planned to have a sleepover on Wednesday (e we met up on Sunday) Wednesday comes and NOTHING, Thursday. NOTHING. I messaged him how I felt confused and hurt, I did call him an a** and all he said was ‚Äúokay‚Äù.

Before you ask no I'm not fat and yes I do take showers. Now that's out of the way I can start by saying I've never really had any real attention from girls that didn't go past friendship. I've had my fair share of female friends throughout my years so I don't think I'm coming off as creepy. Anyway I don't wanna turn this post into me whining about how I've never had a gf cause I've already posted about it at least a million times by now.

Point is how can I not feel desperate and self conscious about myself given my situation? Think about it this way, if you were playing basketball and you airballed a bunch of 3 pointers would you feel confident in your jumpshot? Hell no so I don't understand how someone like me is supposed to be fucking confident with girls if every single time I try to find one it ends in failure. Out of all the people I know I only know two people who have never had a gf but both of them has had sex. As far as I know I'm literally the last person I know to never have sex. How am I not supposed to feel desperate about that? Of fucking course I'm gonna be desperate. I'll take anyone at this point other than fat girls and by fat I mean landwhale status I don't mind if they are a little on the bigger side. I find 80-90% girls my age attractive. So the problem definitely isn't my standards being too high.

The question I have is how can I not help but feel desperate and self conscious about my situation? I know those are the two things girls hate the most for whatever reason. I don't really understand why those two things in particular tick off girls so badly? We all have our problems and demons we struggle with. We just have to accept people for who they are. I just wish they were more understanding. I just hate it when people just say ""be more confident"" or ""don't let it get to you so much."" Like you really think it's that easy. I can't just flip a switch and then tune out all the negative thoughts. You don't think I don't already know my lack of confidence is causing problems? I can't just pull confidence out of my ass I would have done that a long time ago if that were the case. If girls love confidence and high self esteem the most which I have neither then are guys like me meant to be alone forever? It is just a big cycle of being turned down and then losing confidence until eventually I lose the confidence to even approach girls in the first place.

Recently I've dated some doctors &amp; engineers. When I go on a first date with them it feels like they are there but not really present (I know it could be lack of interest, but to clarify, they have reached out to meet again after the first date). Kind of like they are stressed from work (most say they work a lot, on even said she felt stressed in life currently).

Maybe it could be first date nerves on their side, its hard to explain, but I get this feeling that their mind is more black/white, logical.. For instance if I try to be playful and ask a question as a joke they sometimes look at me like I've presented an assignment that they need to break down, some of them answer like its a test (some in a playful way, others in a serious way). Some of them got great humours though, but still I get the thought back in my head that they are having a hard time picking up social cues. + work is main focus of their lives.

Previously I've only dated women with less 'demanding' jobs and from my experience they seem more emotionally available &amp; can read social cues better. When they look me in the eyes I feel that they are present in the moment.

I met a girl on a dating app, went on two dates with her. We had good chemistry, many common interests and views on life, it was really fun and exciting to hang out with her.

The second date went in a similar way, we also walked in the park, drank alcohol, had a good time and went to my house. There we again kissed and hugged a lot, I was very aroused.

I didn't try to delay her or persuade her to stay because she looked terribly frightened. I was confused and did not know what to do, I just asked why she was leaving. She said she would explain later.

After leaving, she wrote to me in the messenger that she did not like that I began to persuade her to have sex so quickly that it was not in her style and she felt like she needed to leave ASAP. I apologized, explained that I didn't want to create a stressful situation for her and she accepted my apology. However, after that we did not communicate for a whole week.

In fact, up until a few months ago, I only ever saw one person at a time. In the aftermath of my last relationship, my best friend urged me to take things slow and meet lots of people. So I put myself back out there via apps. I've seen 4 women since I got back into it:

Woman 1 - Inicated interest, but was super flakey. She ghosted, haha.

Woman 2 - I've been on 3 dates with her, we chat a lot, and we have kissed. I was excited about her at first, but I have noticed over the last month that her interest levels are difficult to read. She just doesn't communicate them directly or on her own. She responds to me sharing my interest, but I would like more. I am also the only person who takes initiative to see each other. Otherwise, we share similar values, politics, etc., and we can talk for hours at a time (dates lasting 6+ hours).

Woman 3 - I've had 2 dates with her. We've had fun, and she shows the initiative lacking with Woman 2; however, I don't have any strong feelings yet.

Woman 4 - one date, and she seems super interested. I am (hopefully) seeing her again this weekend. The excitement is there, and I really like her.

So here's my conundrum. I want to be respectful of my time and their time. I am thinking about ending things with Woman 3 - having gone on 2 dates, is it unreasonable to do so through text? I don't want to give her the impression that I'm planning a date with her just to say I don't want to see you anymore =/

Then there's Woman 2. I am open to still seeing her, but I definitely want to have a conversation about interest levels and expectations if we have date 4. I like her, but I haven't been over the moon (granted, I don't rely on feelings in general, so the slow burn isn't a fed flag for me). Or do you think that missing that ""spark"" that I found with Woman 4 means I should stop seeing her?

Or am I over-thinking this altogether? I've only been on one date with Woman 4 - should I ride it out and see if we continue to click before making any decisions?

The funny thing is that last night we had a talk about all this kind of stuff, social networking, relationships... and we have a very similar (conservative) opinion, but now she goes and drops this on me.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm telling you, she has never given me any sign to be suspicious or anything like that. What's more, she's learning Spanish, cooks Spanish food, sends me what he learns about my city and reads things about the country... 
well, overall seems to care about everything around me. She has even introduced me to his family, who also proposed me to go to his country this summer. They have a group together and sends them pictures of us when we are together, etc.

I noticed that she removed his Whatsapp and Instagram profile pictures after our conversation.


That night, before going to bed and after the video call, she wrote to me:‚ÄùI love you more than you could imagine, so much that my heart hurts"". Twenty minutes ago she asked me if I loved her (she usually asks me this).

I also have to say that the day before yesterday I told her that I had to tell her something and she started to cry, telling me not to leave her and that I promised her that I would always be with her. Last night we talked and that's when we had this conversation I've related in the thread.

Three months ago, one night she was with this friend of hers and another classmate (guy) who her friend had slept with and she told me on Whatsapp at 4.00 that she was scared:  the guy had started touching her. In the morning I called her, she explained it to me and I was the one who contacted the police from my country. On Tuesday she started going to a public psychologist there and he stated to her that she was suffering from post traumatic stress (as a result of the abuse suffered).

What should I do?


I will update the thread as new developments arise.

Ps: I am 20 years old; she is 22. She has been my first everything. We were both virgins.


Yesterday we talked but I couldn‚Äôt tell her why I‚Äôm cold. Now I‚Äôve seen this message of hers in a shared note of Iphone:

&lt;I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE&gt;
I don‚Äôt know when you will see this message, let it be a little surprise! My heart was tore apart thinking you feel a bit off, I fallen into pieces watching you try so hard to get up. As you said, it is normal to experience down time, so give yourself some time, and no worries to fall, I‚Äôm here, always, catching you! Like a crazy trust fall game. I got my eyes and ears on you! When we finally be next to each other in few weeks, I‚Äôll hug you tighter than ever! And in one year, when we live together, I‚Äôll be able to give you warm hugs right away! TE QUIERO ‚ù§Ô∏è

OK hear me out. This won't resonate with everyone, but as someone living in a large metropolitan city full of busy professionals, navigating dating can be tricky. The ""what are you looking for"" question is one of them.

I've been dating casually for a year or so and this is what I've learned. We always talk about clarifying our intentions before spending (or wasting, lol) time with someone. But I found this question more counterproductive than it's worth. Some reasons:

\- A lot of people freak out when they hear ""I'm looking for something more serious"". They won't tell you that outright, but I've gotten that vibe. I kinda do too, even though I eventually want something long term. Maybe there's a better way to phrase it, but it puts a lot of unnecessary pressure early on.

\- People lie. Regardless of the answer they give you, you'll find that people still lie or don't actually know the real answer. Yes, yes, I know the healthy way is to actually figure out what you want before putting yourself out there. But we all know the reality. For your own sake, don't take their answer too seriously (I've been burned by this).

\- You don't even know if you like this person yet! Why so serious?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't take this question/answer seriously anymore. Instead, I'd rather:

\- Focus on getting to know the person + see if there's chemistry

\- Focus on having fun

\- THEN re-visit the question after 1-2+ months of dating (even then, mention it casually)

The problem with this question is that it puts you in this ""I need to find a life partner"" mindset, instead of ""I'm having fun meeting people"". I learned that the more you treat dating like this mission where you have to ultimately find a life partner, the less fun it is. You place a lot of pressure on yourself and get anxious.

Once I freed myself from the outcome and told myself, ""I had fun with this person. If it doesn't work out, at least I had a great time"", I started having a lot of fun. That's what dating should be! I admit it takes a while to get in this mindset, but it's worth it. If it's not fun for you, either take a break or move on to a new person.

This got us arguing a bit and I didn't texted her after that anymore for like 2 days now.

During that time, he didn‚Äôt want a relationship for a variety of reasons (going abroad for a year, past relationship stuff). Yet, we did so much ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô-like stuff together; cuddling, holding hands in public, meeting his friends, taking me out to dinner, going on road trips and daytrips etc. 

I started to fall in love with him but I knew it was clear he didn‚Äôt want a relationship, so I thought I would just live with it for the month we have left before he goes abroad. Well, a few days ago I got drunk with him and cried to him about how much I would miss him when he went abroad. He finally asked me out properly to ‚Äòbe his girlfriend‚Äô then.

I was so happy but when I sobered up the next day I realised he probably did it as he felt bad for me, rather than because he really wanted to. I tried asking him about this and he videocalled me to talk about it. On the videocall he admitted he had asked me out for the wrong reasons. Summed up, he basically said he would miss me so much too, he felt really close to me and really really liked me but didn‚Äôt feel like he was in love with me, and didn‚Äôt think a relationship without love could work. He was crying whilst saying all this.

I was heartbroken and confused (to me you either like someone or you don‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt really understand this in between. I had also never said anything about love previously, he just said that out of nowhere), but I knew i couldn‚Äôt now carry on in the ‚Äòcasual thing‚Äô and resolved myself to end things then. I asked him what he really meant and what he wanted to do, to which he replied he didn‚Äôt know. He only wanted to come over to talk to me face to face. At first I said no, (what more was he going to say that he hadn‚Äôt already?) but he kept asking so eventually I agreed.

Well, he took the next bus over, still crying, and I got mentally ready for him to say the same thing again and for it to all be over. But instead he told me again how much he would miss me, how I had been the best part of his year and he realised on the bus that he had been a coward all along for not admitting his feelings to himself. Then he told me he loved me and he wanted to try to have a relationship with me.

It‚Äôs been a few days since this now and I feel emotionally spent. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust or believe his love is real, or if he‚Äôs only saying that for fear of losing me. We only have a few weeks left before he goes away for a whole year. Idk what to do.

 Well, i am kind of guy who can let you play with his hair, if it is soothe  please accept this letter as my formal application for your open ""boyfriend 'position. With an experience of 5 years, I'm currently working as marketing executive in India where mostly I promote my Pharmaceutical products.  Apart from my work life, Im a sports lover who likes to play cricket, badminton and basketball. For my personal life, I am listed as single on all forms of social media. With a few experiences of short and long-term relationship, let  me tell you that i have a set of skills that make me an ideal boyfriend candidate. These skills include being an amazing listener, handling mood swings tallking about random things ,amazing listener, and an average cook.  I also maintain a great sense of humor.  Other skills which makes me an great boyfriend material are as follows: 1. Expert in making random plans, 2. Can do multi-tasking (texting while working) 3. Can drive more than 10-12 hours a days (car or bike)  .  4. Self-taught computer engineer (a rookie only) can set up your wifi router, printer, etc.  5. Can solve rubik's cube 6. Movieoholic and  series fan 7. Always hungry 8. Know general skills with the ability to fix anything (at least I can try to fix them) I have been told that I am a good kisser, great  cuddler and hand holder, but I am sure you would rather rate those abilities for yourself.  I do posses some of weakness like: - not judging on looks, clothes or on jokes, not an expert in gifting things, keeping up with dates, etc.  on which I'm working to improve looks, clothes or on jokes, not an expert in gifting things, keeping up with dates, etc.  on which l'm working to improve them.  I certainly hope to have an opportunity to speak with you further, ideally during a first date.  I further hope to have a future with you where you can fulfill your big and small dreams.  If you accept me as your boyfriend, not only will you be receiving a ride or die companion, also someone who will let you to play with his hair (luckily I have hair on my head).  I firmly believe that my past experiences, education, work profile and skills will make me a perfect fit fulfilling boyfriend who knows his duties.  If you decide to take this application to the interview portion (first date), then you will get someone who is not only loyal but also communicative and occasionally funny with a track record to prove it.

So I recently befriended with my ex‚Äôs ex on Instagram, we knew each other way before too, just not on social media. When my ex bf &amp; I were in our early stages of the relationship, he would tell me he does not go thru his ex‚Äôs profile. Has no idea whether she post a pic or not neither has ‚Äòliked‚Äô any of her pic, if she has any. Recently, I came across her picture on my ig feed and he ‚Äòliked‚Äô her post. Then i went to her profile and saw she has 6 posts, all of it was ‚Äòliked‚Äô by my ex. I do not have a prob with him liking or following her but what upsets me is that he couldn‚Äôt be honest with me. Does he think I am that scary? that he couldn‚Äôt be honest me, all while he would tell me how I am the one not trying to be close to him. I trust that he is faithful and wouldn‚Äôt talk to his ex just like that but the fact that he lied to me, even when i ask him properly makes me think bad about myself, down with self-pity and how I‚Äôve invested 2 years of my time with him only to find him still being dishonest with me. I am just sad. Did i do anything wrong while i was with him?

Because it makes women look beneath their man. Income is a sign of superiority, age is also, height, im quite tall myself, all of that signs of superiority, that why men who older, tall, richer are more likely to be in position of power

Now that I live in north america, I notice the same trends but in a free form way, men date down to make themselves feel masculine, and women date up to make themselves feel feminine, that is stastically true

I'm not saying that having preferences is wrong, or your a bad person for having preferences, but that doesn't change the fact it does have a serious effect on society, dating is the biggest interaction between men and wen

If men date women who are smaller in general(fincially or physically) , then men will be seen as dominant gender because they are seen as big in general 

If women date bigger, then women will be seen as beneath men, whether that be physically, fincially, or socially 

Again I'm not saying you should date this and that, I don't have the power to do that, but what can say is that we as a human species have genetically flawed

Eventually the swerve came out: She's not only just a single mother, but she's the single mother of a 4-month-old baby. From what I deciphered, her husband, whom she'd been together with for several years now, cheated on her while she was pregnant because he still wanted to continue living a life of leisure and going out for drinks as she prepared to make a home for her growing family, and now that whole situation is complicated.

For me, personally, this was a dealbreaker. A 4-month-old baby is on a whole different level than being the parent of a 5-year-old or even a 16-year-old, and even then, I have learned time and time again that single parents have such a different lifestyle than myself where finding time is incredibly difficult. There's also the ex factor. With a new child in the picture, might her ex eventually attempt to reconcile? She hadn't indicated she was properly divorced yet, so my guess is that situation is not fully resolved.

It did make a little sad, though, realizing I wish had somehow met this woman before she met the wrong person, seeing that her ex blew up her life plans and made the landscape of her relationship complicated from there on out. She didn't ask to be cheated on, and it sucks to see that this woman -- beautiful, smart, a good career, and pretty sexy, too -- is probably going to face a lot of challenges and different priorities in the dating world now as a new mother and a probably divorcee.

In a different time, she could have very well met myself (or someone else) who'd have not left her with that amount of baggage, and that reality of the risks we take with dating is very unfortunate.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,728722,public,self,Do you ever wish you met someone before their ex left them with a ton of baggage?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mvjb1s/do_you_ever_wish_you_met_someone_before_their_ex/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
