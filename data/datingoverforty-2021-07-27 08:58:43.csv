About 2 months ago we had the relationship talk and I asked him if he had any concerns and he came clean that was planning to move. His friends moved to SC and offered him a job doing what he went to school for. He‚Äôs from an Indian family and is extremely family oriented. We decided that it was worth going forward because you never know what‚Äôs going to happen. In all honesty, I never thought he‚Äôd leave his immediate and extended family. His aunt and uncle from NYC are even house shopping up here at the moment..:I never thought he‚Äôd leave. 

So last night I brought the subject up again and he said that he‚Äôs visiting his SC friends soon and ‚Äúthe move‚Äù will become more real. That to save feelings, mostly on his part, but on mine too it would be best to take a break or hang out less with no sleepovers so the hurt isn‚Äôt so bad when it‚Äôs time for him to leave. He did say he didn‚Äôt want to go through heart break again and the pain would be less now than later on. 

I can not move with him right now because I have kids. I asked him to stay a few more years so I could come with him and he doesn‚Äôt want to wait.

Well after texting me for 4 hours after our date on Sunday including let‚Äôs pick out a Netflix show to be ours &amp; I‚Äôm deleting my OLD to concentrate on you plus daily good morning texts the last 2 days as well as others I just received another text from her. 

She decided that SHE wasn‚Äôt feeling the chemistry &amp; wished me well. I of course told her that she is a good lady ( which I believe she is) &amp; that she finds someone in the future that she meshes better with. 

I think it‚Äôs sad that what I‚Äôm feeling most is relief. I have MANY faults but not being honest with a lady or leading her on is never been one of them ( nor will it ever be). I had been thinking about the situation for a few days &amp; just knew it wasn‚Äôt there. 

So as many here will tell you go with your gut. Give it a second chance if the first date wasn‚Äôt awful and/ or you think there might be chemistry. If not be true to yourself &amp; kind to the other person. In this instance I‚Äôm very glad she wasn‚Äôt as into me as I feared she was. 

I will continue to move forward. Hoping &amp; looking for that special lady to complement each other‚Äôs lives. But if it doesn‚Äôt happen while I may get down momentarily I will be in good spirits as I‚Äôm comfortable in my own skin. Not only do I love myself but I try every day to make sure I‚Äôm the right kind of person so that I can continue to like myself as well. 

Never give up hope folks. You never know what may happen tomorrow.

19,ot41wj,1627452254,From Content to Concern,"Hello fellow forty-somethings! 

So, here's the tl;dr, I'm worried we're waiting too long to meet the kid.

Recap: bf and I both 48 have been dating about 14 months. He has a 12yo son. When we met he was 4 months into divorce. Dating newly divorced or separated is not usually my m/o, but... I made an exception because 1) he had already been with another woman, so I figured the revenge sex was out of the way and 2) he'd been seeing a therapist for a year since he found out his wife was cheating. He's very clear about being done with her and moving forward.

We talked about meeting the son at 6 months in. That was around the holidays last year. I said it wasn't a good idea. So we waited. Then bf decided the closer it got to Feb and his divorce being completed, why not wait? Why risk passing her off at the end and making trouble for him. I agree. Well, here we are, approaching August. The divorce still isn't final. Just one signature is between him and freedom! I had thought I'd have the summer to get to know the son. Nope. And now school is starting soon. Then we're back to the holidays. 

Is there ever going to be a good time? I guess we could talk ourselves out of it for many more months. But, I had hoped to be spending the holidays with all of them this year. Not sitting on the sidelines. 

I do love that we've had all this time together sans kids, getting to know each other, building a strong relationship. I've read every book I can find on step-coupling, etc. I just want to do right... by everyone!

Everything else in the relationship is spectacular. I do worry though that we're screwing this up.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ot41wj/from_content_to_concern/

From what I could learn in one date I really like her and would be ecstatic if she agrees to see me again (I feel like her agreeing to a 2nd date is such a bigger deal than the first.) Question is, should I send her a nice text along the lines of 'You seems smart and pretty and I'd like to see you again' or call her, briefly ask how it's going and then ask if she'd like to go out again? What if I get voicemail? What to do then? 

Of note, she's a super busy nurse who has her young kids FT until the 2nd week of August so maybe texting is better? I hate overanalyzing these things but like I said, she's gorgeous and kind and smart and just *swoon.*

I've only used OkC so far as one app seemed like plenty to start and it seemed more profile oriented than just pic oriented. I've taken it pretty slow as far as sending out likes, gotten a few matches that led to conversations that kind of ran their course, and one that has led to a few dates and is a still-developing story.

I'm curious how people generally handle profiles they see where there seems like a chance the person might be a good person to meet, but you aren't entirely sold. I've generally only hit like on profiles where I really saw content that ""sold"" me per se (strong mutual interests, seems like a good person, no red flags), and the pictures seemed like someone I'd want to meet. I've run across a handful that were in the ""close"" range - like, I'd need more information, maybe something in the profile was a mild yellow flag, or maybe I didn't feel the pictures showed me someone I found attractive but that could change if I met them. 

I realize that profiles are very abstracted from the person themselves in the end - the one person I've been dating I would say their profile didn't do them justice, there were a lot of pleasant surprises - but I'm not sure I want to spend both my and the other person's time if I feel there is still a somewhat low probability of a real match.  

Anyway, just wondering other perspectives on how you've approached this. It seems like maybe a ""hell yeah"" or no thing, but then again it seems like maybe we are dealing with real people here and profiles are only the tip of the iceberg and it may be worth finding out more (that's dating, after all, right?).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/otb4xf/newish_to_old_how_do_you_handle_the_kinda_sorta/
27,otdhy2,1627489906,How to Balance matches/activity on OLD,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm sort of at a loss on what to do.   I loaded into Bumble late Thursday night, after a group of friends got together and we all critiqued/fixed each other‚Äôs dating profile.    Since then, I‚Äôve had about ten matches.   I have three on-going conversations.   (The rest have all died off in app, and just never got anywhere.).   Two of them, we have escalated to texting. 
 
Now, here‚Äôs my dilemma.  I keep looking and swiping when I have downtime.    Do you do this?   Do you take breaks after you start getting matches?
 
My other issue, I have my daughters every other week.  I can‚Äôt really get away too often when I have them, so it will be more than a week since a couple of these conversations have started, before I have the opportunity to ask someone out.  Is that going to an issue for most women?    Should I go incognito to give more time between matches?

32,otkhxz,1627510881,Contact Location Flair Letdown,"Tricky title here but let's get right to the backstory;

I know a guy (from OLD) who organizes all the women he has connections with in his cellphone contact list by their name and then 'flairs' it with their city or state.

So an example would be:

Carrie WY

or..

Rachel Oak Hills

Interestingly enough, the GUYS in his contact list don't warrant such specific details, lol.

Often when either of us answer the phone, he'll say to me, ""Is this...Eustacia from....La Quinta??"", as a joke. Even though we are just friends, it is a wise ass play on being just a number, or somehow easily forgettable amongst all the other fillies in the stable. We both like it, it's a running joke.

Cut to modern day and the real story;

Last night I was texting with a long distance love interest that I have been involved with for a year.

He lives in another state, (which is no big deal to either of us), and we have met already in person. In about a week, we have plans to meet again for several days.

So, we are texting about plans, and he sends me a screenshot of our current conversation (because my text came through in Chinese font, if you must know...)

As I peruse the screenshot he sent, I can easily see the way in which he has saved my name in his Contact info:

Eustacia Cali

Eustacia is not my real name, but for the purposes of this Post, I'm using it because my name is very, very unusual.

It is so unusual that I can't imagine having to denote what state I live in afterwards, as if there are possibly more than one of us in ""Cali"", much less his contact list.

Yes, I will live.
But I have to admit the surprised sinking feeling I had with that statehood flair affixed to my name. You..don't know me? Just from my name? Aren't..sure of.. who I am and where I'm from at this point?

In the end I am made to feel like one of many, to be separated, organized, kept straight, lest a text gets fumbled, or a message missent. When? I kinda thought I was the only one.

On the flipside, I have done this myself with people in my phone who I do not know well that have very common names. For instance, 2 men with the name John, etc.

And when I did, I lost most of my ""friends"". The divorce basically ended any other remaining friendships. In fact, I had one ""friend"" bluntly say, ""You can't trust people who stop drinking."" Alcohol was the social lubricant in all my friendships. And, I think this is true for the vast majority of over forty singles. 

I don't think I'm a recovering alcoholic. I have no issues with everyone around me having a few. It's just that I'm choosing to not drink at this time. In fact, I'd love to have a taste of what you're enjoying. But, I just want a taste and not a glass. Not drinking tends to be a nonstarter, a relationship killer. 

On the flip side, if I post that I don't drink, I tend to get people who don't drink for religious reasons and I'm not religious. I'm not interested in converting to their belief systems.

Or, people believe I'm a recovering alcoholic and they feel that drinking in front of me is tempting me or disrespectful to me. It's not.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/otxk9p/what_are_your_first_thoughts_about_men_who_dont/

He explained that his past few dates haven‚Äôt been good and that he would like to chat and be open to meeting. I felt that was open minded. 

Truth is though, I‚Äôm really down right down, but I am losing my mind being alone. I got divorced right before the pandemic and I lost everyone- including close family. I have a one ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who I see on a somewhat regular basis but even that‚Äôs making me feel like crap. 

Back to OKC guy. We have only exchanged a few short non substantial texts. He asked if I have been to a very expensive restaurant and I said 15 years ago, so I guess I could say no. His response was ‚Äúit‚Äôs $200 a person (IDK what the hell he‚Äôs eating &amp; unless your buying really great alcohol, but I don‚Äôt drink and I never want another alcoholic in my life), so it‚Äôs like a once or twice a year thing‚Äù. Ummmmmmmmm I know how much it costs. He then said he would like to meet up his treat. 

He‚Äôs already talking about money which is triggering for me because of the controling crap my ex husband would pull.

In any case, I matched with a 54/M who I was instantly attracted to, I appreciated his assertiveness and readiness to move things along from the app so within days we were on the phone every night for hours, the first night we met for dinner we were extremely comfortable with each other and the magnetism was so strong by the end of dinner we were practically sharing a chair‚Ä¶ he pulled me in for a kiss which was amazing and we spend the rest of our time together pretty much entranced with each other, that night once we were home we spoke on the phone until after sunrise.

Our next physical date we had already expressed our mutual desire to have sex so we met at his place and had an amazing night and subsequent morning together our chemistry translated well into physical intimacy.

The next 5 wks things started changing up a bit.

From this conversation on, I felt he always seemed to be in a ‚Äúmood‚Äù with me - he would scrutinize the things I would say, even things he once found cute or funny. He cancelled plans and was less available for phone conversations which he always initiated before.  I understood that things were picking up now post CoVID and he was back at the office dealing with very high pressure situations but I did confront him about the change he at first denied anything being different and wondered if I maybe was just acting insecure  and that nothing had changed but then one night after me making a silly comment he blurted out something about you aloofness being the reason he feels he had to put his guard up bc he was to close to the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù  (note: from our earlier convos I had noted this was his way of saying ‚Äúhead over heels‚Äù) but when I asked him to clarify what he meant we ended up on a tangent and never got back around to it.

I'm getting the feeling that it's a sign of her being emotionally unavailable or she has some other issues she needs to work out. Which really sucks because I like her.

98,ovhhwm,1627774588,Another OLD Story,"Matched with guy this afternoon. Sent a few messages over app. He sent phone number asking to text or talk. Ok. I text, say hello, tell him I‚Äôm doing things around the house and running errands so can‚Äôt talk right now, but here‚Äôs my number. He says he‚Äôs also running errands around town and will call this evening. 
I put the phone down and continue about a business. I pick the phone up again and go to the app where I have a message exchange going with another person. Notice dude I texted with is also online. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Means nothing other than he‚Äôs online. 
My text messages ding. Dude has sent me a selfie at some point while I‚Äôve been away from the phone. The new ding is him telling me I didn‚Äôt respond to his selfie (I was painting a bedroom) and now he sees me online on the app. Says he‚Äôs a quality guy and is now discouraged. He unmatched me. 
What the hell? You‚Äôve known I existed for a matter of hours, we‚Äôve exchanged less than 10 messages and texts total, we‚Äôve agreed to talk, and you‚Äôre already stalking and judging? Rather than quality I‚Äôd say controlling and insecure. 
Glad I dodged that one very early. 
The other person I‚Äôm messaging with still seems very interesting.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ovhhwm/another_old_story/

I ask him to call me Ubers to his place (it‚Äôs like $40 one way &amp; I can‚Äôt afford that)

Before I get too many ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just using you‚Äù responses.

He clearly is terrified of intimacy &amp; I can see him getting nervous around me (which I think is very sweet)

We‚Äôve been hanging out once a week for like 8 weeks, texting regularly exc.

I know the age difference seems like a lot but from my perspective, he‚Äôs never been married &amp; doesn‚Äôt have kids (same as me) so that makes us in the same category.

Just Im really into him and would like to see him let his guard down a little , I  see some many posts on here from people who say they‚Äôre exhausted with dating , but I want his energy so how?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ovi706/me_35f_him_49m/
