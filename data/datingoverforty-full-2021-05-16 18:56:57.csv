A few days ago, a guy messages me and we chat a bit. He was a little eager, but not love bombing, just saying he’s excited to meet me, he likes me, texting me all day for a few days. 

He texted me on Friday to say that his shift is probably getting canceled Sunday (today), and did I want to meet? I said I couldn’t because my parents were coming to my house to help me with gardens, patios, etc. 

Yesterday morning, he said to let him know when they left to see if there was time to meet. Then he didn’t really text much, and when I texted him last night, he said he was really tired and going to bed. I said goodnight.

This morning I texted him to say I couldn’t see him because I didn’t know the plan. I didn’t want him to waste his day off waiting around. He said that’s ok, he’s at work today, so not sure why I thought we could meet? I’m like because you told me you weren’t working. He said he must have been confused. I texted ok, well have a good day whatever you’re doing. 

Worked most of the day outside. Saw that he texted me right after saying I must be confused. Sent him a quick text that said I must be. It was delivered, but my second text that just said it happens, never got the “delivered” tag.

I went on FB, his profile and conversation are gone. A couple of times he sent me texts that were out of context, and I asked if the text was meant for me, so I think he was talking to someone else even though he said I had his full attention. Fine if he was, but don’t lie about it.

After a run of bad relationships, some short, some long, I figured my picker was broken so I decided to take a break. The current problem is, I live in a very small town where everyone knows everyone. Not too many singles around here and the ones that are, there’s generally a reason. The nearest town is about 45 minutes away but it’s pretty small there, too.  I am scared as hell of online dating, mostly because I am afraid I will know half the men on there (not from dating them LOL), but partly because I am terrified of rejection. Also, I want to meet someone the natural way - like starting an innocent conversation in the produce section at the grocery store.  Is that so unrealistic?

There is very little to do here, even in non covid times. I don’t drink, and don’t think I want to find my future partner in a bar anyway, but that’s about the only place to go to meet new people. Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a creative, non creepy way to meet people?

We haven't met in person. How we have even started talking is a very long story. We have a mutual friend who ended up in a situation and, to put things in a nutshell, that is how we got started talking. I At first, I was really just talking to him about how we could help our friend. He suggested we stay in touch and I thought why not. So, we have been talking a lot and he texts me every day, almost all day long about the details of his day, humorous commentary, all kinds of stuff. 

After speaking with him many times, I have discovered some very wonderful things about him and have found myself most certainly attracted to him. When we do talk on the phone, we talk for HOURS and it is never dull. We talk about everything under the sun and I enjoy every minute of it. He is sweet, funny as heck, super smart and just an all around great guy. 

I had a birthday recently and my birthday plans fell through. When he learned of this, he began researching plane tickets so he could fly me to where he is and we could go have dinner. Tickets were super expensive last minute, so it was not a good idea. Way too much way too soon. So, he has never told me he is interested, but he acts like he is and has dropped hints. He texted me once and told me he thinks I'm ""pretty awesome"", pays me different compliments at times, points out things he likes about me and giggles at my quirks and tells me he appreciates them. 

The reality check I had this morning was discovering he hasn't really called me that may times. I call him way more than he ever calls me.  As I mentioned before, he does text me all day long, every day. Not just stupid texts - like conversation texts. So I don't quite understand it and wonder if he is just enjoying the benefits of the conversation and the idea that a woman is paying him mind? He does live on the other side of the country and so it could be he just doesn't want to express his interest prematurely? After all, it has only been shy of 2 months since we've started talking. But he was looking up plane tickets!? 

I don't know what to make of it. Here is an example of something he does - he was telling me this long story via text. After awhile, he said ""this is certainly something for a phone call"" and I thought - why won't he just call me?? I said ""you are welcome to phone me"" and he just kept texting his story. He then said again ""this is for a phone call"", but I never bothered to say he could phone again. I had said it once already. After a bit, I said, ""do you have time to talk?"" and then he called right away. ?!?? Like what the heck??

Our kids hit it off, started chatting and so did we.  We were both happy to have met another single parent with a young kid who lives in the neighborhood.  I also found him attractive.

Long story short, we started spending time together, mostly with our kids, and getting to know one another.  He's great, his kids are great (he has a teen too that I later met).  We got to know each other decently well, talking about all kinds of things, and our dynamic with our kids and us was wonderful.   
 However, the timing of our meeting was TERRIBLE (in terms of something romantic). We met the day after my boyfriend had unexpectedly broken up with me (becoming and on and off drama for a few months after that), one of my closest friends died of cancer, and my custody with my son changed dramatically.  Plus I'd been working in COVID for public health and that was the most stressful thing I'd done professionally.  Basically, I was a ball of emotions, stress, confusion, fear, etc.  I was not ready to even think about something more than friends at that time, but cared about him and his kids.  


He had expressed feelings for me, and when I decided to go back to my boyfriend, we decided to take a pause on our friendship.  I did have feelings for him, but,  looking back, I  was longing for something that felt familiar and secure (my ex) and wanting to see what was still possible with my now ex boyfriend.  I was chasing the ex, as I'd always done.  


I have since learned a lot about myself, and I find myself thinking about this guy a lot.  We had a recent text interaction that indicates he still has feelings.  


I'm not quite ready yet, but when I think about the kind of person I want to be with, he keeps showing up in my mind. I miss him in my life.  We also had some of the most emotionally healthy conversations I've had with a close male in years.  


Would you reach out, or let it go?

I usually just lurk here.

I’m 40M, divorced two years, been using OLD since then.

In my early 20s, I met a woman. She was great. Fun, smart, easy to talk to, hot.  We dated six months and then my ex came back into the picture. I cheated on my girlfriend with the ex (stupid I know) and, to no ones surprise (except mine, because, again, I was a dummy) my girlfriend dumped me and I never heard from her again.

Until Saturday night.

A friend from work invited me to a cookout at his house and there she was, the girlfriend I cheated on 20 years ago.

The short story on her (42F) as I learned last night. She was married for 15 years, he died two years ago. She has three kids, twin 13yo girls and a son, 10. She and her late husband are / were good friends with my coworker and his wife, and their kids. They’ve hung out together for years, went on family trips together that sort of thing.

She and I spent a lot of time together on Saturday night. She didn’t bring up the past and neither did I. We talked about work, life, the kids. She’s fun and easy to talk to, just like she was 20 years ago. As far as I could tell from the conversation, she’s not seeing anyone, not using OLD and she doesn’t seem to hate me (or if she does she hid it well).

Partway through the evening my friend dragged me to the garage to smoke cigars. I don’t partake but thought it would be rude to decline and by the time we came back to the main party she had gone for the night.

Do you think there is any path forward here? Im not sure how to connect with her. I could give my number to my friend to pass on to her but if feels like a lot to ask her to reach out to me considering our history. I’d like to apologize for my behavior twenty years ago. My wife cheated on me, it felt like shit and knowing that I also did the same thing to a girlfriend, I would like to make that right as best I can at the very least.

I’d also like to see if she had any interest in giving us a second chance. We sparked twenty years ago and I think we sparked last night (she’s outgoing so I might have misread) and it’s not like OLD has been particularly successful.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,48250,public,self,Should I or shouldn’t I?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nekd5t/should_i_or_shouldnt_i/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

I've chosen enough wrong people that I question my judgment, decisions, ""picker"", or whatever.  

I read posts and comments on here and I don't see much difference between dating in our age group than younger people dating.  Same shallow issues.  Unless an individual really looks into what their unresolved issues are, one ends up being just another ""walking wounded"" looking to pair up with another broken soul.  It seems like people who were married with kids in their 20's and 30's who are now divorced aren't really dealing with issues that *may* have been put to the wayside when the distractions of family and career got piled on (and the possible causes for the divorces).  

Is it societal pressure that makes people desperate to be with someone even though they are miserable and being mistreated?  Do you really not love yourself enough that it is so unbearably lonely for you?  I don't even want to be around myself sometimes, how could I expect someone else to be around me?  Don't tell me it's about companionship.  Yeah, I get that and it's pathetic.  The last time I felt truly lonely was when I was with someone—it was a relief to finally get away from this person.

I know people who are in unhappy marriages.  They are still together for the kids, for fear of ""looking bad,"" fear of being alone, or pure denial.  It's depressing to witness.

Am I bitter?  Maybe. I just think if people really took a hard, honest look at themselves, they wouldn't drag people into their shit because they're trying to be something they're not and/or are desperate for a warm body next to them.  If they tried harder at accepting and loving themselves, learning to love being with themselves, they'd be much happier in life.

My last relationship (6 months total including a small break at the 5 week mark) just ended.   After a frenzied few days of OLD for distraction, I deleted all the apps.  I had plenty of attention, but I realize I really don’t want to date and try for another relationship right now.

Someone I can trust, but none of the relationship-y things like texting and phone calls and planning dates and wondering about a future.

He usually comes over for about 2 hours. We cuddle and talk or briefly nap afterward. 

We’ve gone out to eat a few times. We’ve hiked (back when I declared I didn’t want any type of relationship or dating or boyfriend, etc...). We’ve sat on my porch and had drinks or just hung out. We went to his hometown and spent a weekend with relatives. Up until now it has been super casual. No pressure from either of us to do more than any of this.

We talk about future things we would like to do - watch a beach sunset; movies that the other loves that one hasn’t seen;camping this summer. We even talked about my dream retirement plan of hopping in a camper and just traveling whenever and wherever and he agreed it sounded wonderful. We have agreed to only have sex with each other, so we are exclusive in that way.

The thing is, I don’t feel ready for a relationship. I like spending time with him, but I have so much damage from my marriage and I have JUST started to recover and start working on myself (with the help of a fantastic therapist!). He knows all of this and agrees, no need for labels or relationships or any of that yet. Maybe down the line, who knows? But right now, even the idea of calling him my boyfriend just stresses me out.

But I’m having trouble defining what we are. I’m not sure why I feel the need to define it, but I do. So what do you think? Is this your definition of a relationship? A regular hook up? FWB? Something else? I’d like to hear your opinions.

She is now 25 years old, living in another city with a long term boyfriend in her last year of University.  For context, her boyfriend is only four years younger than I am.  I really like him and, accept him as a part of my family.

I live in a small village.  There are roughly 1,200 people here.  I go to a small village gym.  There is this one man who comes in.  He is very tall, like 6'4"".  He has a baby face though.  Honestly, the first time I saw him at the gym I thought he was a really tall 16 year old kid working on building muscles for the little girls at school.  I hadn't really spoken with him but, have nodded acknowledgement at him a couple of times.   

About two weeks ago, he added me as a friend on Facebook.  I didn't think much about it.  I know who he is.  We have said hello so, I accepted his friend request.  I know he is older than sixteen now, he is a conservation officer in my village.  

A few days ago, this man approached me at the grocery store.  He was very nice.  I could tell he was nervous as his voice was a little shakey.  He ended up asking me if I wanted to hang out and have a coffee with him sometime and, asked for my phone number.  I do not look like a forty year old woman.

There's a lot of history here. 

When I was 26, I went cold turkey on men after a date turned violent and traumatic. I gave up completely. No sex, no dating, nothing....for the next 20 years. I felt I was better off alone.

In my youth - I'm 46 now - there was a boy I loved, though we were best friends. We had moments, meaningful glances, and - at fifteen - a hot, brief make out session in a hotel room during a school trip. There could have and  should have been more, but I was young and scared, and he was the preacher's son. 

I moved away and we didn't see each other again, but I kept him in my mind for over 30 years. He's always been my one that got away, the one I compared other people to. It wasn't fair, I know. Nothing competes with that. But when Facebook put us back together as ""people you might know,"" it felt meant to be. 

We're halfway across the country from each other, and after a lot of very fervent and passionate conversations, we decided to meet in the middle. Once in the hotel room, the clothes came off and my 20 year drought ended just like that. It was the best night of my life, and the sex was incredible when he could keep up (twenty years is a long time to stay thirsty).

He was supposed to be with me two days, but left the next morning. I stayed another night and flew back the next day. TSA folk were visibly uncomfortable as I sobbed in the body scanner, sobbed during the pat-down, and sobbed putting my shoes back on. I couldn't stop it, and it didn't ease up for two days.

Tuesday night, he went on FB and posted some pictures of scrap he'd brought home in the back of his truck. The caption said it's from his father-in-law's house. I did some stalking and found his ""real"" profile. Pictures of his wife, who has a debilitating illness. His friends, his congregation, his buddies. I asked for an explanation and got a text that read 'I am not a good person.' 

I've been beaten black and blue, but nothing's hurt like this. All I want is to mourn the boy I loved and try to forget what he's become, but I can't bring myself to block him. It's just a button, and it's the best thing for me, but I cannot cut this cord.

He has two kids—one in pre-school and another younger than 10. The kids split time 50/50, and his ex has a new infant with her new bf. With all that said, I have not met his children, and I think that is appropriate for now. He mentioned that he didn’t want the news getting back to his ex that he was dating because he’s afraid she will try to ‘do something’ like not allow the kids to call him. I don’t quite understand how this works, I do not have children, but I know it would be smart to wait at least a year to make sure the relationship is stable and we fully know each other. Tell me how you deal with this? I haven’t asked anything about this yet. He does tell me everything that is going on in their lives and about their character.
