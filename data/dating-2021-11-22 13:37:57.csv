We have already done the grab beers date, a romantic out-to-dinner and cocktails date, and a hiking/hang out all day + cook dinner at home date.

She ended things with me suddenly after 5 months of dating- things were going well, I thought, so was surprised at the time. 

We’ve hung out a handful of times over the last couple months, just as friends but I told her early on that I still had feelings. She had just ended things with a guy she was dating for only 3 months but was upset about it.

Well, last night we were hanging out at my place and after a few drinks we started making out. She told me she loved me but was scared— I didn’t probe that at the time, so not sure what she meant; maybe scared that any relationship between us would be serious? Or scared she would hurt me again?

Anyway, it was super intense and passionate and quickly led to sex. She spent the night at my place and it was an amazing time- I was on cloud 9.

Well, half an hour after she left this morning (we had sex again right before she left) she texted me saying that we probably shouldn’t have done that, and that she was still messed up over the last guy and she “needs time.” She also said her feelings for me come and go. I couldn’t believe it. I don’t expect us to immediately jump into a relationship, but it just seems inconsistent with the passion of the night before. I want her back and feel like I’m still in love with her. If this was any other girl, I’d ghost. She is not any other girl though and I’m committed to trying with her. 

What should I do? 

Tl:dr still have strong feelings for my ex gf, and last night we had sex, but now it seems like she regrets it and “needs time.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qztupx/trying_to_get_my_ex_back_things_were_going_great/

6,qzu7yf,1637611079,To the men out there…,A lot of you need to accept the reality that women aren’t going to come to you. You need to go out there to go get the women. If you see a girl you like go and talk to her. Most women don’t want to meet their lovers on the internet but organically in person. Look the best you can and shoot your shot. The worst that could happen is that you get rejected by a person you’ll most likely never see again. A lot of women here are going to say you shouldn’t do it but Reddit is mostly filled with antisocial women anyway.

I’ve never been good at short relationships and I tend to be picky with who I date which probably helps. However, now that I’m 26, single, yet again. I just can’t continue in this dating world anymore. Each relationship I have ever had has lasted 2-5 years. I’ve been cheated on by multiple girls. The last one ended because she ended up being depressed and no matter how much Effort and support I gave it wasn’t enough and so like every girl before. I was back to square one feeling like I wasted so many years. Currently I’m in present day. Dating someone and finally falling in love which is a hard thing for me to do. It’s been a solid 5 months. At least I thought it was. Found out she was cheating on me and I once again feel so much distraught. Emotionally I’m drained. (Sidenote I tend to date girls who are very different) I’ve realized no matter who I’m dating people tend to be very trashy, loyalty is a rare quality, giving up when a bump comes into the road is now just the norm. I’m so exhausted. I do not use dating apps anymore because honestly 85% of the girls are not quality people. In person I’ve come to realize it’s the exact same. I can’t keep wasting my time on people who I give 110% to. I’m the type who will try no matter what just because I love someone. Unfortunately it’s usually one sided and I have never been good enough to be chosen. Each girl I dated we both thought and expected to get married. I’m at my breaking point. I’m tired of dating.

11,qzul2m,1637611992,Do You Attempt to Punch Above Your Weight Class?,"Since I've been here I've noticed several people asserting they have a hard time getting with someone they are attracted to. The last time I heard this was all the way back in college. My gamer friend was okay looking. Skinny, glasses, lots and lots of body hair, unibrow. Sometimes girls in our circle would like him, but they'd get rejected--too chunky, too flat-chested, black. 

Then he told me about his crush. The most conventionally attractive girl on our dorm floor. She woke up every day two hours before classes to do her makeup. She rushed a sorority as soon as she could and dated frat guys. I'd listen to him bemoan his inability to 'find a girlfriend'. If only the girl he liked would 'lower her standards' and see he was the better choice than those frat guys with their six pack abs, expensive cars (and interests, hobbies and lifestyle that matched her own). And I'd sit there chanting to myself ""focus on the feelings and not the problem."" And then be like, ""Awwww, that sucks. How unfair for you.""

So when I hear these things now, I can't help but wonder, ""Derek, is that you?"" Just kidding. So, do you attempt to punch above your weight class?

Me? I'm all over the place. Above, below, to the side. My deepest attraction comes from certain personality traits I can't tell a person has until I interact with them anyway.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzul2m/do_you_attempt_to_punch_above_your_weight_class/
12,qzutwi,1637612603,Been talking on a girl on snapchat for a month. We can't find a chance to meet. I don't want her to lose interest. Please help.,"Hey I'm back here. If you've read my previous posts you might be familiar with the situation. I'll try to keep it short but rn I need to vent and I need advice as well so it might be long post I'm sorry. 

I'm 21m. My gf of 2 years broke up with me in September. Out of the 2 years we dated 1.5 years were LDR. Things got messy. I basically didn't get any interest, excitement, affection, reassurance, reciprocation, intimacy shown towards me. Even after explicitly asking for all this. Ik no one should have to ask for these bare minimum things. Asking for that is a disrespect in itself. But I still tried to make it work but it didn't. Now I've been left so empty. Without even bare minimum things.

Anyways, in October I started talking to this cute girl [20f]. We planned to meet but she cancelled on me 5 times. All legitimate reasons I don't blame her. No issues there. We have talked about a lot of stuff from interests to physical stuff. Idt she's very good at having text conversations. But I try my best to talk more and more. I've told her that I'm interested in dating her and she says that she's interested in dating as well. But she needs more time to decide. Obviously given that we haven't even met yet I dont blame her. She shows interest in conversations like even talking about sex/physical stuff. But she isn't a good conversation initiator. I can see that she's trying. I have asked her twice and she says she's interested in dating. We flirt back and forth a lot too. We just can't find a chance to meet. We were supposed to meet last Friday but her sister had to be taken to the hospital so we didn't (this was the 5th time our plan was cancelled). Now, I have my exams till 1 Dec which means we can't go out till then. By then I have to try to talk to her to keep her interested at least but idk what to speak. Like I enjoy talking about sex but constantly talking on that same topic would be a turn off. 

What can I do here? How do I keep her interested? Or atleast have good conversation with her. I want to date this girl. I'm not trying to get into fwb/hookups. If we don't date then I might suggest that but not rn. Because I miss dating. Going out for movies, eating at new places, beach walks, making out at movies, staying in and watching movies/tv shows and cuddling. I miss every aspect of that. I've missed out on so much in my last relationship. I'm trying to find all that again. I haven't even been touched in a year. I'm still a virgin. I feel so drained. I need someone to show me interest, show me some excitement, some affection. I haven't felt anything in so long. I am tearing up as I type this. I can't have another person lose interest in me. I feel so undesirable.

I'm so tired. How does it feel to wanted? To de desired? To have someone who wants to touch you? How does it feel when someone shows interest in you? Does it feel nice? Do you feel safe? How does excitement feel? I don't know any of this. I'm so tired. Please help me.

Which led me to assume he was gay. Anyway I’ve since gotten to know him fairly well and hang out a lot because of a mutual hobby, and found myself really falling for him. Me and some friends sensed that he liked me too, so… without mentioning the Tinder thing, I took a chance and asked him out! His response was that, although flattered, he’s straight. And I was absolutely floored by this news. I’m not into pining over straight guys, so I’ll let it go, but… I mean, the Tinder thing makes me suss. I don’t see any other straight guys showing up on there. We’ve hung out since and he’s totally fine, in fact he acts EXACTLY the same way, which is awfully confusing. I’m so perplexed and would never dare bring it up with him as that would be disrespectful to his privacy, but I’d love some insight to what on earth this could all mean. I have some ideas already, but it’s haunting my thoughts (against better judgement). Despite this rejection, I do still really like him.

15,qzuzf9,1637612990,Having preferences is fine...as long you are the one benefiting it .,"So for the umpteenth time,  I saw a post where a woman(I rarely saw men doing it by the way ) complaining about not attracting the men she want . She attracts a certain demographic that she despise but would like to attract another one . I would not give name of these races but let's put it that way,she want the demographic who is presented as ""good people "" but not the one portrayed as ""bad people""(and even if I don't give,if you spend few times on reddit you will see clearly which races she is talking about ) 

So here the arguments I hear each time with this type of posts :

- I grew up around a predominantly ""bip"" community. That's why I am attracted to them.

Hum Ok .Fair enough . But many people  grew around a particular community but are not attracted to them at all . So this argument is not enough because the counter argument can can be found easily .  I agree we are all individuals who are different from each other . But at the end of the day,there are patterns that bind us . And my argument is a proof of that . 

- I can't date them because I see them as brothers/father 

If everyone follows your logic,the concept of race itself would disappear . So allow me to see this argument as very weak . 

- I had a bad experience with them 

Sorry for your experience . But I have a question for you . Would you like to be subject to a discrimination by someone else just because this person has a bad experience with people of your  "" type "" ? I guess no right ? So I am not saying you to date them ,but giving them the benefit of the doubt at the very least will be cool .


I am not saying that because I want people to give chance to what they are not attracted to . And I am not this sensitive to the point of crying because a girl don't want to date x or y race . But when a particular race ,more precisely here on reddit , is always being "" denied "" allow me to speak about it  . 

The hypocrisy coming from these women is very strong . These 15 last years in the Westernized world has been marked by an acceptance of all type women. 
Over-sized,Tall,non-white,bald etc. I am not against it . Women beauty come in all forms and I support it . But when it is their turn to accept it for men, these arguments above are brought on the table . 
All excuses are good for that . 

"" I want to my preference to be attracted to me but other type of men aren't worth it because they are my preference "" .

We both set boundaries, but the one boundary she mentioned that was important to her was exclusivity.

At this point, I don't even know what to say, given that this is what happened after a few days of initiating conversation with him and asking him out to go on a date *multiple* times before his dry ass agreed (which should not have had to happen given that he presumably was attracted to my profile):

\- He asked me to send a picture of my school ID card to him on a different platform because he thought I was lying about my school (I happen to go to a prestigious school that I had the ability to work my ass off for). So, I sent him the ID picture. A few days later, I check his rewritten biography, and I see that HE was the one fucking lying about his school. What the fuck?! Now I don't even know what to say to him because I had asked him many times about his school (let's call it X). Like, ""hey I'm going to be in your city on the 26th, so do you want to go on a date near X?"" And he NEVER said anything like, ""oh, I am lying about X! I don't even go there!"" No, he never fucking corrected me. I honestly don't know why that's okay at all, and I WOULD confront him now (fuck patriarchy), but I'm purposefully waiting to confront him after or subtlely during the date because I hate to say it but I really do want to just experience one naive first date for fun since I have nothing more exciting during my break this weekend. Btw, I have a feeling he lied about his school to seem more prestigious, which is so disingenuous and superficial. I don't care what school he goes to — I just care that he doesn't LIE (which is often a precursor to cheating)!

\- I am now also worried about the whole ""hypogamy debacle"" as I am technically ""dating down"" if I were to date him. As you all likely know, spoiled men are more likely to be insecure if the womxn they are dating are more conventionally successful than them. I am lowkey worried that he might try to do something suspicious to me based on the difference HE perceives in our educational backgrounds. I am well-prepared for any of that as I am used to always protecting myself well, but I'm just tired of all this fuckery and clownery that a lot of us genuine, awesome womxn have to go through, if even to have some fun. It's so tiring that I lowkey placed him on a pedestal when I first chatted him up just so I could secure his attention since I thought it was rare for me to have access to such a handsome man.

I’m not sure what I’d do with the information.  I mean like I said it’s difficult for me to focus my attention multiple directions but I also wouldn’t want to be the fool trying to date one one while being just one of several options for them. 

TL:DR curious how many people most would date at once/how long",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzvvri/how_many_people_is_common_to_date_at_oncehow_long/

She's brought up in the past that she thinks I don't care about her which is untrue. I care about her, just not in a bf and gf kinda way. We're both getting want out of this which is amazing sex. 

We are very attracted to one another.

She'd go on trips with other dudes and although I was bit upset I wouldn't voice it bc like I said I don't wanna be in a relationship and it's her right. 

On her most recent one she'd send me snaps of her and saying ""he wants to fuck me but this Is all yours"". When she got back she mentioned how weird it was bc she didn't wanna go alone and knew she didn't wanna have sex with him bc our sex is amazing

So she invited me to Nashville over the long Thanksgiving weekend and I made sure again to tell her I'm not interested in a relationship and she said she knows and we're on the same page. So should I go?

He said he truly liked me for me and wanted to get to know me better and go from there. We sobered up in the morning and he said everything he said was true. He puts in the effort, snaps first, makes plans and actually seems interested. 
However, we hung out Saturday and The vibes were off. He was a little rude and obnoxious to me. He kept snapping other girls in front of me and talking about other girls that like him. He was going to a party that night and obviously I couldn’t go because it was private invite. So I said goodbye and I thought it would end from there. I decided to ignore his snaps, not even to play “hard to get” or anything, but because I just got the “ick” from how he was acting. (I would never ghost someone after they say they like me, but by he was acting i thought he wasn’t interested).
But then, he snapped me the next day saying he couldn’t stop thinking about me at the party. He said he had the worst day because I wasn’t responding to his snaps. So he took action to come talk to me to make sure I wasn’t mad or anything, and I said I just don’t really check my phone (which is true), and he was still rude awkward. He keeps saying he likes me and just wants to see me but by the way he acts it’s so confusing!

61,qzyhpv,1637622159,"I (22M) keep being left on read, but she (23F) is super interesting in person and engaging in text."," 

Hi!

I came to this subreddit because I have conflicting thoughts about how to go on with the girl I'm dating.

I'm   a 22 years old male and she a 23 years old female has matched up on   Bumble and hit it off. She is really genuine, fun, intelligent, and   pretty (not a 10, but who cares, I'm more of an intelligent/nerd women   type of guy).

I'm starting my masters - I have 3 classes per week, a total of 6 hours - I do have to commute 2 hours a day, sometimes more.

She   on the other hand is in an internship in my country, working from 9 am   to 4 pm. She also loves to engage in social events, mainly cultural  ones  with fellow Erasmus students. She is staying until the end of  February.

So now the main part:

The   first few days we talked through the app, so we would talk at the end   of the day, and we had a great start, got a date set and it went pretty   well. Had a hug at the end and after a few texts a few hours later,  she  immediately said she wanted to have one more date - though she  calls  them meet-ups, I will try to explain how I perceive her point of  view.

We  moved to Instagram after  the date had been set, so far so good, right?  Well when I send her a  text she usually sees it in the first 2 hours,  but won't reply until  sometimes hours after, like 14 hours sometimes!!  But when she does, she  is always very engaging, fun, asks questions, and  shows interest.  But  it's killing me, the anxiety is tremendous and  though I want to do  what is right for me I also don't want to push her  away with the ""I  don't mean to be rude, but you sometimes leave on read  and that really  works up my anxiety due to past traumas, ghosting and so  forth."". I'm  also aware she works, she has to cook her meals, do  everything that's  related to her day-to-day, and she wants to enjoy the  country.

Last  Saturday we met up  and had lunch, went to a museum, talked more about  ourselves, overall  both of us were a bit more open, witty and some  flirting happened - this  last part was really subtle. During this date,  out of the blue, she  said that she never dated anyone, she has always  been focused on her  passions, namely architecture and cultural events. I  sensed that because  she was very vague about compliments, always very  shy emotionally wise,  but I kept being me. I began to be closer to her,  to make small  compliments, like how easy it is to talk to her and she  answered along  the lines: ""We have the same interests, we are a good company"".

She  also said that she  has mentioned me to her close friends, how she found someone so  interesting and nice in Bumble because she never tried it in  her home  country and is happy to have such a good experience with me.  During the  date, she said she is bad at texting, and out of pure romanticism -  I'm silly -  I didn't mention anything - though now I know  I should've  done it in person.

At  the end of  this last date, she was the one who sent me a message asking if everything was alright if I had arrived safely and opening some more about a few things we talked about, namely her family. There was some   back and forth and I felt maybe she saw a face I made when she said ""I'm bad at texting"". BUT then again she spent a whole two days answering   me, I felt really bad, because I have mentioned I had past traumas and   some ghosting episodes. I guess I should really send a voice message to   her explaining this? I don't want to sound rude or push her away. I   genuinely think she is a good person with no experience in dating and   maybe naive? It's no excuse.

My   friends say either say it or stop talking to her for some time so she   understands the game can be played by both sides, but I don't like this   kind of game, especially with someone's feelings.

So, there is that girl that i like a lot (for simplicity I will call her Eve - that’s not her real name) that I met at a friend’s party.

We talked all night (from 8PM to 4AM) and we walked outside at a moment to see the stars.

When we were outside, she gave me her Snapchat so that we could play together later.

So it’s been 4 weeks now that we are in contact with Eve and last saturday (20th) I send an e-mail to my local cinema so that I can have the posters of some movies including 007 : No time to die (i think it is the english name for the last james bond) 

So I send it to Eve to make fun of my movie obsession (as a joke ofc) and she replied something like « omg 007 i wish i could have a poster of 007 too »

So i asked her if she wanted me to ask the cinema for another and she said : « well if you could it would be awesome » 

I then sent Eve a screen of a second e-mail i did to the cinema asking for another 007 poster as a birthday gift and told her that I hesitated to say in the mail that it was for my girlfriend to have more chances to have the poster.

She replied with « maybe you should have it could have add something » (idk if her response is understandable again, sorry for it) 

But i do not know how to take it…
Does she really want her poster ? Did she understand that it was a risked message ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzylep/i_tried_a_risked_message/
63,qzyryj,1637622939,Not sure how to handle this situation with the girl I'm seeing,"I've (25m) been feeling uneasy and really down today over the exchanges I've had with the girl(21f) I'm seeing over the weekend. For context we've been together for 1.5 months and up until this point everything has been good, I'd say we're very personal and coupley with one another. I haven't doubted her once and I wanted to make things exclusive with her.

On Friday we went on a double date with my friend and his girl and we all had a really good time. The next day I dropped her off and she ended up getting upset at something unrelated, I tried to be there for her but I had a friend visiting from out of town, and she started texting me a bit cold. She didn't text me until 6am the next day which she said she went to a city over with a friend and she finally came back. She doesn't drive, and when I asked what they did she dodged the question. She later said that she didn't feel good and we'll talk tomorrow (today), but kind of in her normal cute way. I asked her if everything was ok and she didn't respond. I later saw that she viewed one of my stories. 

It's now the next day and I still haven't heard from her. This is so uncharacteristic, I don't know what to make of it. I was thinking of calling her later tonight to try and find out what's going on. I'm honestly having a horrible day at work and this is eating me up inside. How should I approach this? Also, we never had a conversation on exclusivity but I had felt that we were on the same page. I'd like to go about this in a way where I don't come off as insecure and needy. We've been unprotected everytime we've been together so if there's someone else I'd like to know for that as well.

65,qzyv8e,1637623196,Text her (28F) again or take a hint and move on? I (28M) don’t know what I’m doing...,"**TLDR**: Should I text a girl I know through work about meeting up once more or take a hint and move on?  

Being 28M with zero dating/relationship experience I’m quite anxious and over analysing with this stuff but last thing I want to be is a guy that can’t take a hint. Thought I’d ask / r / dating advice for an opinion.

**Some Background:** 
Met her through work when I started there some 4 years ago, I know many say don’t ask co-workers out and I would normally agree but we do work in a big organisation where its pretty common to go long periods without bumping into each other. We had a mutually friendly but strictly platonic work relationship first few years but since early this year after starting to message her outside of work on a semi-regular basis I’ve taken more of a liking to her. She pretty much always responded quickly and seemed to make a bit of an effort to keep the conversation going, including initiating texts herself so asked if she was keen to hangout. 



We met up twice to go for a walk and get coffee together which seemed nice enough but I admit didn’t really turn flirty and/or escalate as I didn’t pick up any real signs of interest from her. There were a couple times as well when I texted her about grabbing some food or coffee together but replied she was unable to and didn’t suggest an alternative. 

Continued texting each other afterwards with her still occasionally initiating some. I wanted to meet up with her once more and make my intentions absolutely clear this time but before I could I had to go away for work this year for 6 months. While I was away I only texted her once and she texted me once asking how I was going. 



After getting back from being away I texted her Monday last week if she was free for drink later in the week, got a reply saying she would love to but wasn’t 100% sure if she was staying in or out of town with family by then and would “have to let you know” (bad sign correct?) although she asked what day I was working next. Didn’t hear anything from her all week (second bad sign correct?) then today she texted me about something else unrelated (A week since I last heard from her).
 
Would I be correct this is likely a polite rejection? Like I said at the start I have zero dating/relationship experience so I can safely say I have no idea what I’m doing, just want an opinion if it would worth texting once more before cutting my losses.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzyv8e/text_her_28f_again_or_take_a_hint_and_move_on_i/
66,qzyzch,1637623518,Is this any coincedence?," So to start things off, Ive decided to get back into dating after 6 years of being single. During those 6 years i was mostly working and getting over an ex while hanging casuallywith  women but didnt really have anything happen in terms of actually dating or hooking up with eachother. after a while I realized that i didnt feel like i was trying(mainly because im in my 20s and dont even have any dating apps) so i recently had gotten on tinder to see what would happen.when i did that, i could feel myself start to resonate with someone but i didnt know how to explain it. At the point when you see it, youll know right? after about a month, this knock dead gorgeous island girl comes up for a swipe and my interest suddenly peaked, but i got a little busy at work(yeah i swipe at work who cares)so i quickly took a screenshot of her name and insta, swiped right and kept my day going. a couple of days later i have some time to myself so i decide to look this girl up and what ended happening was nothing short of mind blowing. Now just so you know, Im someone whos extremely in tune to the world around and when life puts out signals, i hear and see them loud and clear. I go onto this womans page and start looking through her reels. This was Clue Number 1: in the first couple photos, Shes wearing a hoodie from one of my top 3 favorite animes of all time. Now i hadnt watched it for a while and had been feeling the urge to so i have..not to mention i adore wearing hoodies.. then this happens. Clue Number 2: Lately at work ive been hearing songs from the album ""Brand New Eyes"" by Paramore play randomly on pandora. the music is great but not whats important here. The album cover has a butterfly on it, something that always pops up or something i always see when im happiest(random i know but its my life lol). as i go through the reels a bit more, I come to see that SHE HAS A BUTTERFLY TATTOO. OKAY... So at this point im starting to realize what i was beginning to resonate with some time ago. Clue Number 3(not as flashy but still important) As i start looking through the rest of her page. Shes wearing an abundance of yellow and scarlet, my life colors. And not just in 1 or 2 photos...like alot. Hard not to be convinced of something yet right? Well here was the final icing on the ""universal sign"" cake. I click on one of the most recent photos and see everyone wishing her a happy birthday. I look at the date.. And its my birthday. WE WERE BORN ON THE SAME DAY. THE SAME FUCKING DAYYYYY. NEVER BEFORE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HAVE I MET OR EVEN SEEN SOMEONE WITH MY SAME BIRTHDAY AND TO HAVE IT HAPPEN NOW? LIKE THIS!??!

70,qzz9jr,1637624318,I (33m) feel awful after ending a 6 month relationship. Can I get some perspective on how I acted here?,"I (33m) feel absolutely awful about how I have approached a relationship of 6 months. Could do with some perspective or thoughts. I guess I'm just wanting to get it off my chest too.

Initially when I met her in April '21, I was so excited. More excited that I had been in a long time about someone. All of the boxes, from the outside, ticked. Same niche interests, absolutely gorgeous, witty and very smart.

About 2-3 months in, I started getting the feeling that something just wasn't clicking. That unshakeable gut feeling and it just felt like we couldn't go any deeper on our connection and that the chemistry just wasn't there. There were so many times when I wanted to dive into deeper conversations and talk about the world together but our interactions felt more surface level, civil and a bit light. I really wanted it not to be the case and I tried to keep an open mind that things could change, or that perhaps I needed to get another perspective, learn or compromise.

At the end of Month 2, I almost felt like I wanted to call it off. Instead, I expressed how I was feeling and that whilst I really enjoyed her company and that we had similar values and aspirations, that I had some reservations about the depth of our connection. About this time, she went away for 2-3 weeks which gave us a chance to reset a bit and regroup. We decided to go on a camping trip when she got back and we had such a nice time together and things just kind of carried on as they were.

What followed were some of the most stressful months of my life. In June (Month 3 of our relationship) I lost my best friend to a car accident and had to watch an online funeral &amp; deliver an online eulogy on the other side of the world. In July, I nearly lost another good friend to suicide. I also bumped into my ex-GF one morning out of the blue (our break up 2 years ago ruined me), which kicked up a whole lot of dust. Icing on the cake :) In August, I decided to do something about my stagnant job of 5 years and started interviewing around with 5 companies each with 3-5 stages. Nearly every waking hour was consumed with doing or preparing for job interviews, all whilst keeping a full time role.

She supported me through all of this and we continued on the relationship. I very much enjoyed and appreciated her support through this time and we continued to enjoy each others company. I remember this time being really confusing. At times I saw glimpses of a stronger connection and told myself that the relationship could work if I just gave it some more time and room to breathe, but I think I also still felt uncertain on some deeper level.

Eventually around month 6, I got the opportunity to take some time off from work (3 weeks) before I started the new job. The prospect of taking a 7 day trip together came up and one part of me thought this was a bad idea given my uncertainty, but the other part thought that perhaps a break away and some space away from all the stress might just give us a platform to build something stronger. She could sense my uncertainty about taking the trip and we discussed the strength of our connection and that we were still figuring out if this might be a multi-year relationship, and we decided to push forward with it in any case.

She was so excited to go on a trip together and I think she felt it might be the making of something long term and very special. She posted a picture of us together for the first time and was so happy to be spending some quality time together. We had some very special moments together on the trip and she was so patient and great to travel with for a week. When we got back home, I posted pictures of our trip and I know she was so happy about that.

On the trip, I knew deep down that something still wasn't quite working, but a part of me rationalised it and I tried to remind myself to keep open about the possibility of something growing stronger.

We returned back home and I kept getting this growing sense of urgency to call it off. She was keen to jump into further milestones like meeting the parents, spending Christmas together and hinting at moving in together next year, and the mention of these I think became a catalyst for action so as not to make anything worse than it needed to be.

Ultimately, I broke it off with her this weekend. She lives outside of our city (2 hours away) and I firstly suggested that we should meet up and go for a walk to talk things over, but we had a couple of phone calls instead.

I feel absolutely awful for breaking it off so soon after our trip and for going on the trip (when I should have probably called it off earlier) too. I think she feels like I have led her on a bit, or that things were going a bit better in her mind than how I saw them.

I know it must have come as a shock to her too. I guess I just didn't want to prolong any suffering and to prevent further hurt later down the track. Part of me is still coming to terms with the decision and I'm hoping that it's the right one.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzz9jr/i_33m_feel_awful_after_ending_a_6_month/

Anyways my ex and I haven’t been on good terms for about a year now. The last time I talked with her she said she was in a happy relationship so I cut all ties and just left her alone. 

Fast forward to now, for the last few months are so she has been constantly checking out my Instagram stories…literally every single one; versus never looking at them before. 

So from my point of view either she’s single again and trying to signal me to initiate something, or B she’s just bored/curious. Let me be clear though I would never get back with her romantically, but we did hookup a lot and had great sex. That would be literally the only reason I’d hangout with her again and she probably knows that.

She ended up getting into a huge fight with my other friend who I still know and moving schools, I was a bit resentful toward her and cold to her after that.

Im not into hook ups or one night stand.” He answered “its really weird that we have an attraction and you dont wanna have sex” I left it on read I didn’t know what to say.

86,r00g72,1637627775,Should I stop to see my fwb?,"
I officially have a fwb since one week. We saw each other last week, spend the night at his place. I wanted to do sexting with him (we did one time last week while he was at work). I panicked bc he didn’t replied fast to my message. I saw that he actually read it hours after. We only talk when it’s needed (when we are horny or about to meet each other). I was about to send him a message to tell him « Okay, I get it, you don’t want to have anything to do with me anymore, but please I’d like to get my item back. After that, I will never talk to you again I promise ». Yes, I forgot my item last time I was at his place, and I told him a couple of days ago if he found it and he told me yes. I tried to be wiser and tell myself he might be really busy today, maybe he met customers, had meetings, spend time afterwork at a bar with his workmates or friends (he’s really outgoing). Maybe he finished work late…. 

Please don’t tell me about his wife or gf, he’s officially single and he is not looking for a real relationship. I am not too, since I have to heal from social anxiety, I have huge trust issues when it comes to men. I actually wanted to be fwb with him bc I wanted to explore my sexuality with a person with who I feel safe and I’m attracted to. I thought that sex could help me to be more confident, accept and learn how to embrace my body. I admit that I have some needs. Except I want to do it with only one person until I heal and find someone with who I could be in a real relationship. It’s been 5/6 hours since last time he saw my message (it’s 1AM where I live), no reply. 

No, I am not in love with him, I don’t know him well yet. 

With what happened should I stop this fwb relationship. What would you do if you were in my shoes? 

Also don’t tell me, that famous phrase « he’s not that into you », I don’t expect him to be my husband or something. 

Maybe I should give up on any kind of relationship with a guy, bc I don’t understand them, I don’t trust them. I have to accept that the only contact I will have with them is for work. I promised myself to never go on a dating app (should I call it hooking up app)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r00g72/should_i_stop_to_see_my_fwb/
87,r00mxo,1637628346,My boyfriend and I are having problems because of a coworker,"So I (28F) have been dating my coworker (32M) for about 4 months now. We have only had one argument &amp;amp; it was about our female co worker. I didn’t have a problem with her until he kept making comments about how hot she was in front of me. I found out he had a crush on her for years, but I do trust he’s over that. She texted him at 6 am one day &amp;amp; this built up so much curiosity I checked his phone to see how they communicate. We got into a huge argument that basically ended in don’t bring her up ever, ever. 

Fast forward to today. She begins messaging me at work, talking to me about him like she’s his best friend. Literally telling me his mood &amp; his stressors &amp; how she’s so close with his best friends. She said she thinks we make a great match, for now. And she’s glad I’m making him happy to remove stress from this job until he moves on to something new. I didn’t even know how to feel because he has made me feel so shitty for even feeling anything towards their strange “friendship”. The only thing he said about today was her messages were odd but it’s not his fault she said those things and that’s the same thing he said about her texting him at 6 am that she misses him. When I showed emotion, he said oh great we are going to fight again. I just stayed quiet, cried to myself a little and then left. Am I overreacting? Or Is she overstepping?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r00mxo/my_boyfriend_and_i_are_having_problems_because_of/
88,r00nl2,1637628402,Sexting / Flirting not working fast enough?,"30yo guy here.
I use to be real good effortlessly at flirting / sexting when I was a teen (and currently my ex girlfriends I can give them full orgasms just by making them super horny over texting)

Why is it hard for me to make it spicy with random women online on social media sites trying my HARDEST secretly?

I follow every single sexting rule their is for me: good selfie, no dick pics of course, no rude or vulgar comments and no asking for nudes. Strong compliments, flirting and interest. The only time i remember getting a nude lately out of few 100 women is one I paid for lol..

I normally give someone a week but after that I feel like it’s a waste of both of our time.

Do I need to try more on dating apps for flirty convos?

90,r00oe6,1637628473,"""See you around""","Hello everyone! Just need to vent somewhere because I think all my friends are tired of hearing about my dating drama. In the past month or so, I went on three lovely dates with a very nice and good looking guy that I met through OLD. On Sunday, we went for a hike and watched a movie. I felt like we had a pretty good time and good chemistry. He left something at my house and stopped by to pick it up this morning. It felt a little awkward as we stood by the door and I handed him his stuff and we engaged in a little small talk. When he was going back to his car he said, ""See you around."" I just smiled and said ""see ya around"" back to him.

To me, ""see you around"" means noncommittal/whatever/the person is not interested in actively seeking you out anymore. While I know this is fine and he doesn't owe me anything, it still feels like a punch in the gut. To be honest, he's way out of my league and more outdoorsy than me so I anticipated him losing interest sooner or later. It just sucks having to start dating someone new again from scratch.

I know the best thing is to be direct and just ask him if he is still interested in hanging out, what he is looking for, etc. But he is going out of town for the holidays so I don't want to bother him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r00oe6/see_you_around/

95,r00rpu,1637628751,"Dating For the Sake of Finding/Developing a Healthy, Lasting Relationship","I see a lot of posts and comments talking about how to not be too available, and how to “keep things interesting”. 

The truth of the matter is pretty simple and straightforward, if someone is into you, then just being yourself will be interesting, being yourself will satisfy their curiosity and it’ll also prompt them to ask more questions if there are things they don’t know or understand, but want to learn about you. The same applies to how you might look at that person. 

If you want a genuine, lasting, healthy relationship, then both you and the other person have to be willing to take a risk in being vulnerable and honest with one another. The people who put on a face or play the aloof game are only in it for the attention and manipulation because it strikes their ego while they give minimal to no effort. Be yourself, and if you and that other person aren’t a match, either be okay with it, or decide that you’re gonna adjust/compromise in order to see if it can work. 

Healthy &amp; lasting relationships require a commitment to work on each other’s behalf and with each other’s best interests at heart. Be yourselves and may you grow together organically and see how your roots connect within the same garden.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r00rpu/dating_for_the_sake_of_findingdeveloping_a/
