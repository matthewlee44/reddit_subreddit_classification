This is making me wonder whether I am not seen as traditionally ""good-looking"" (which I am well aware of and trying to lose weight, making excellent progress) or whether places like Tinder are just generally trivial in terms of appearance so that the bar is quite high.

The explanation I can think of for this is that when somebody matches with you on a dating site, perhaps they build up an idealised version of you in their head before they meet you. That idea them might be appealing (sexually or otherwise), and then they find that upon seeing more of you that this idea dissolves. This actually happened to me the other way when I was definitely ""up for it"" with a girl I was messaging from OKCupid, and although we got on well, the pictures she provided did not completely reflect what she looked like in person (i.e. she was a bit larger than I was expecting - not necessarily a deal-breaker for me but just ""different"").

This might be a tad long so I'll try and keep it to the point.
On mobile so format...



I don't drive/ have a car at the moment because my test was cancelled twice because of covid, and they haven't started back yet, and there's no information about when it will - which is extremely frustrating.



Anyway, I matched with a girl on bumble about 2.5 weeks ago. She lives about 10 miles away. She's moved here from another country a few years ago. She loves seeing the sights and she drives.


I hadn't been on a first date in nearly 8 years, so I was a bit nervous. 

We met up for 2 dates and they went well, she said she enjoyed both and she agreed for a 3rd - the first date was her choice, it was nice. I was instantly attracted to her on the first date and moreso on the second. We texted a fair bit between dates too and it seemed to go well. I made her laugh a lot over text and on dates and there was some flirting too - though to be honest I probably could have done more in this department and I'm kicking myself now - I'll explain more below.


Second date was my choice - my country is still in lockdown, nothing open except essential business, shops, transport etc.

I wanted to be able to take her to somewhere she hasn't been before or even to take her out for dinner and maybe a drink but I couldn't because of lockdown. 


There's limited places I could meet her because she had already been to some of the places I thought about but also I don't drive so I couldn't take her to most and transport there and back would take forever - I didn't want to get her to pick me up and go somewhere - she mentioned when we first talked that me not driving wouldn't be a problem but she didn't want to be a personal driver so I wanted to show her the best I could that I'd take whatever transport I could to meet her and be independent that way.



Anyway, I feel like I couldn't be as flirty because we were just walking and talking but with covid and social distancing rules I didnt feel like I could be my flirty self and express myself physically, even though the conversation was flowing I was hesitant on the touchy aspect of flirting - sometimes she was giving me the eye to just kiss her but covid, man, just made me second guess whether I should have or not.


I had told her that me not being able to drive had annoyed me because I wanted to be able to take her somewhere different to where we are or I could have even drove to see her and went for a drive and a coffee or whatever at any time between the dates, instead of texting, which I think would have been more personal and would have allowed her to feel more comfortable and it may have felt a bit more intimate too.


Anyway, she went quiet/ ignoring me for a few days, only texting once a day or something - I knew something was up and feel like she met someone else instead. But I asked her if she was still interested in that 3rd date.


She told me last night she doesn't think so, she said she liked me and my company but she didn't feel a ""sparkle"" and didn't know whether she should keep looking for it with me and didn't want to give me false hope or waste my time.


I still don't entirely understand whether that was a cue for me to say ""sure 1 more date"" or just accept it as a loss and move on.


I can't stop thinking ""if my driving situation and covid wasn't a thing that this could have worked differently and could have been something special.""


I get it was only 2 dates but, we talked a lot about pretty much everything and something about her made me want to better myself.

I felt that sparkle that she said she didn't feel so I'm a little confused and sad about it all.


What do I do? What can I do? 


Fwiw:

I replied to her message last night saying I was disappointed to only find out her thoughts after the several days of silence but I'd kinda expected it due to her silence.

I did tell her I liked her and her company and told her I did feel that connection and thought there could have been something. I told her I enjoyed the time we spent and I appreciated her Sharing with me some of her personal stories and family memories, which I could tell at the time were difficult for her.


I told her I respected her for letting me know where I stood and hope that she finds this sparkle she's looking for.

For context we had been dating for a year when she started acting weird, she talked less, she didn't want to go anywhere and when i needed help with a problem or something she just didn't care at all (we used to talk a lot about the issues we had on our lifes and I was always ready to give her some advice or do anything I could to help her feel better) until one day she told me that she thought she needes some time alone, after a week or two she broke up with me, I honestly felt really bad but i still loved her so I tried to be supportive, and to be a good friend, I talked with her about what i was doing and tons of different stuff but she took hours, maybe days to respond and all her vocabulary turned into ok, oh or good, literally nothing else, i tried to go and talk to her when i saw her irl but she told me she didn't want to talk and a few months ago she vanished, blocked me on all social media, ignore me when she sees me irl and just ignore my existence, like I was never there, I felt really bad again and tried to reach her, ask her whats wrong but no respond.


After she broke up with me it took me some time to get rid of the feelings I had, but i still considered her an important part of my life and I didn't want her to just dissapear from one day to another. I'm angry at her, everytime she appears in my mind and i remeber all that happened i can't express it with words but its like an overwhealming feeling, it is too much and I just try to do something else and distract myself.

I'm not angry because she left me, I'm anoyed that after all the time we knew eachother she didn't care to just stop talking with me, she wasn't there when my parents started beating me up, she wasn't there when I started my music proyect on YouTube wich has been a dream of mine since i was a child and after all this time all she needed was to take a few seconds or her time to say hello, or watch the music i made, just 3 minutes of her life to listen to what i have been dreaming of since always, but it has been 6 months since we broke up, she didn't care about anything involving me, i was there every single time she needed help, even when I was dealing with bigger problems I just try to fixed myself from all the shit i had been dealing with so i could make her feel better every single day but in the end she just vanished, and all the kind words vanished too, i thought i was important for her too, i just needed some text, to ask me what i was doing or how's my day been, but the text didn't come, i know I wasn't the best but everytime I noticed i had made a mistake i did all i could to fix it and try to not do the same a second time, i try to be a bit better every single day.


Things are hard right now with the exams and college getting closer but I think I'm in love again, she is sweet, kind, and cares about my feelings, my hobbys, my music and my life, and i think about her tons, slowly the feelings of love are fixing the bad things that came with my last relationship but now i am so scared that the same might happen now, i didn't tell her my feelings yet because I'm terrified that she might disappear too, and I'm super nervous because she has been silent for two days now. 

I don't know why people treats others like they don't care about other human beings, i personally think that the most important thing in the world are the bonds we make with each other but what if I'm not enough?

That isn't to say that I reject the idea of dating one so much as it's to say that it really wouldn't make that much of a difference.

I have family, friends, a career and a handle on bettering  my mental health. I have aspirations and I'm hoping I'll have a dog real soon. My question is what dating someone is really going to add to any of that? I enjoy my own company, I enjoy the freedom of being able to do what I want, go where I want and say what I want.

To redirect this to be a bit more general, I just have to wonder if other men have ever stopped to seriously ask themselves why they want girlfriends or if being single is really that much of a burden?

Bought me flowers, fixed things around my house, always wanted to be with me and hear from me.

I just don't understand how someone not being interested in you is appealing. Like, if I see a text, I'm gonna reply. Sometimes I'm on my phone and it will be right away, sometimes I don't see it for 2 hours. My favorite conversations in OLD have been when we are messaging back in forth.

I'm not usually a talkative person, but if I like someone, I'm gonna try to talk to them. Almost nothing seems less appealing than a girl not reciprocating interest.

People say you seem to desperate if you respond too fast, yet expect someone to case after them. And when exactly does 'hard to get end,' when are you allowed to admit that you're interested. No one ever talks about that, just to act uninterested to seem more interesting, but sooner or later they will get sick of it.

I guess this was more of a rant than a question.

So - I‚Äôve been ‚Äòdating‚Äô this guy since February, we have been on 5 dates over the course of 2 months, slept together 3 times. We text most days, with 2 days silence in between here and there.
We are moving nice and slow. He has a daughter which he takes care of every second week - hence why we only catch up every 2 weeks or so.

Anyway - we were meant to spend a couple of days together over the Easter break (Sunday and Monday to be exact), but he texted me on Saturday morning saying he had a sore throat on Friday night and thinks he may be getting sick - but that he would let me know.
I check in on him later on Saturday, he says it‚Äôs developing into a viral cold - so we cancel our plans. I did other things (caught up with friends etc instead).

Last texts were on Monday saying he‚Äôs sick, I asked if he needed anything and he replied saying that he is sad he is not seeing me (but didn‚Äôt acknowledge my offer to help).

It‚Äôs now Thursday night. I haven‚Äôt heard from him. 

I see two options: 

1. Do I leave it and let him chase me? (traditional approach)

2. Do I reach out and see how he is? (compassionate approach)

So I was talking to a guy through text on a dating site- his texts seemed really eloquent and intelligent, and we even seemed to share a lot of the same niche interests and likes and dislikes. 

We had pretty good back and forth with questions to get to know each other, so I offered to exchange numbers so we could do a phone date. Well, first of all he sounds a bit younger than 26. And he would word vomit. His voice was erratic, fast and he was all over the place- kind of like a person on speed. He would ask me if I knew about vlad the impaler- when I said no, he proceeded to ramble about the mythology behind it and stuff- and about a unicorn that ate hearts, and how he thought werewolves ate hearts. 

He would ask my favourite kind of dog, and when I would respond he would jabber on about how huskies are his favourite because of their blue eyes, and how his uncle was retired military and had a British shepherd, etc. I tried making a light joke about how he sounded off/rambling to try to redirect and he said it was because he was nervous....then right back to it. 

Whenever I said something, he would respond with an emphatic ‚Äúmmmhmm‚Äù and then ask me oh did you know....and went off again. I said like 10 one word answers during the conversation, I‚Äôd previously tried to joke about it to give a polite signal...he seems slow as well, when he asked what kind of medicine I was considering, (I want medical school) I told him family medicine and emergency medicine. He responds ‚Äúfamily medicine, like....a family doctor?‚Äù I said yes, and he goes ‚Äúemergency medicine...like working in the ER?‚Äù Like come on really? 

I made some excuse and hung up but that‚Äôs like the worst conversation I‚Äôve ever had. He texted me after and said he really enjoyed talking to me, and had a good time. I kind of gave a vague answer that sounded like I liked it and went to bed. His texts after the phone conversation and today are the same- eloquent, thought out, intelligent. It‚Äôs like two different people- one adult and one teenager off the walls. He did say he had adhd and he‚Äôd been medicated for 10 years, which lead into a whole ramble about his childhood and such..I have adhd as well, but I definitely don‚Äôt speak like that. 

He sounded really immature and not like you would expect a 26 year old to hold a conversation. I thought first date conversations are supposed to be calm conversations with good give and take, asking questions like what do your parents do, etc. He did do this over text and he seemed very good and intelligent, but the phone conversation was like an unmedicated hyperactive kid rambling and a bored teacher giving one word, disinterested responses praying he would shut up. 

My mother thinks he could have just been really nervous, but at the same time she thinks such a drastic difference in his texts and speaking shouldn‚Äôt be ignored and it could be catfishing. I‚Äôm trying to decide between eventually doing another phone call to see if it‚Äôs more of the same or just cut it now- we‚Äôve only been talking a week, so it‚Äôs no real loss to me either way.

We have became friends throughout the process and he claims he wants to come to America to study for his masters. He kept asking me to come visit his country. Now it has been more aggressive, and I'm wondering what his agenda was.

He said he was going on vacation with some friends for 2 weeks all around us country. Come to find out, I see he is travelling with an older American woman (saw the pic on social media)! I also saw he has randomly added women from America and Europe recently too.

Talked for a few days, suggested we meet up for a date. She disappeared for a week (saying later that she needed a break from online dating), but upon returning gave me her number and said she'd absolutely like to meet up. The next week she couldn't meet up as her sister was visiting from out of state. As such, we scheduled for the following week.

We met on Monday and got drinks. The date seemed to go pretty well. Our personalities clicked, we had easy conversation, and laughed. It lasted about three hours. We joked about some future plans early on in the date, but that's about it. It was mostly just getting to know one another. The four quarter of the date was a bit different. I felt it losing a bit of steam, for me just due to being tired on a Monday and the alcohol setting in a bit. She opened up more about her family, and did mention that she's been single since November and has been on some ""awful dates"". A bit of a red-flag for me given that she hasn't been single for a *terrible* amount of time after a LTR (I know that everyone is different).

The date ended late, and as such I didn't send her a text upon getting home (about 11:30pm). She didn't reach out either. The following afternoon on lunch I did send her a text thanking her for a fun night and dropped a subtle inside joke from our date about march madness. It was something like this:

**ME:** ""Thanks again X for a fun night. I hope you ended up showing your coworkers up in your fantasy bracket!""

**HER:** ""Thanks! I didn't end up winning anything but you can't win them all lol &lt;Shrug emoji&gt;

**ME:** ""I won $10 but my buy-in was $10 so... &lt;Smile with tear Emoji&gt;

My typical approach with post-date texting is to keep it brief anyway, wait a few days, then re-engage and look to schedule a second date. My vibe for whatever reason though is telling me she's just not that interested, otherwise she could have sent another text. Comparing her with past dates, if the date went well I'd typically have a text from the girl thanking me by the time I got home, then there'd be light texting, and I'd reach out a few days later for the second date. With her, I'm not feeling the same energy.

Is she playing hard to get or should I let her reach out to me?

**TL;DR**

Date on Monday that went well on paper (lasted three hours). We had good chemistry with lots of laughter/mutual interest in the other person. She's only been single for a few months after a LTR. I picked up the tab. I initiated the post-date texting the following day, but the convo fizzled with the ball in her court. 

Do you think I should leave this one alone and wait for her to get back to me? Or should I send a text tonight checking in and see if she's reciprocates? My gut is telling me she might be ghosting and hoping I get the clue based on her not texting me back, and I don't want to come across as needy so I can hold on to a bit of pride. She knows I am interested based on me following up with her, etc. I also ended the date saying ""let's do this again soon"".

Reading the book Models by Mark Manson (only halfway through buts is a book every guy who struggles with women should read, seems like a game changer for me) and had an eye opening experience reading it. He talks about how people know other‚Äôs intentions implicitly, and if you‚Äôre just talking to someone expecting their time, or sexual favours, or an ego boost from them, due to you own low confidence, instead of just to genuinely enjoy their company, they can tell, and it‚Äôs unattractive as shit.

I‚Äôm 23 and a virgin and I think I‚Äôve been doing this all my life. Only talking to girls I like to desperately make them like me rather than just for the joy of knowing them. But for one brief moment in time I didn‚Äôt, almost got somewhere, and I didn‚Äôt even mean it. I was at a club and my friend was trying to force me to approach girls all night since he knows how bad I am with women. Pretty fucking drunk, and fed up of never getting anywhere, I followed his lead and done whatever he told me for do. After a couple of hours of this (with equally hilarious and cringe worthy results) the ‚Äòtutoring‚Äô ended when he ended up flirting hard with a girl he‚Äôd himself been talking to. I was standing a little away from them, drunk, lost in my thoughts, kind of wondering to myself how the fuck it was so easy for him and I just got kind of got laughed off by everyone, when her (very attractive) friend who was standing next to me struck up a conversation. I just started shooting the shit with her, joking around, thinking I‚Äôd be polite at least and just talk to her since we were both alone and our friends had left us. I had no more ‚Äògame‚Äô or whatever left in me and didn‚Äôt even think about this once as trying to get with her or whatever.

After about 15 minutes of this I realised we were getting along really fucking well. We were just laughing, joking around, and we went to grab a drink together. I made a comment pointing at our two friends about how they were halfway down each other‚Äôs throats within like 10 minutes and how they hadn‚Äôt wasted any time. She turned to look at them, I saw her brain working something out, and then she burst out laughing hard.

Turns out she wasn‚Äôt even with the girl my friend was talking to. She didn‚Äôt know her whatsoever. She was just a girl who had been standing near me, and struck up a conversation with me cause I was alone. In my drunken state I just assumed she was the other girl‚Äôs friend and started talking to me to be polite. Instantly my brain froze; holy fuck, a girl is talking to me just for the sake of talking to me! I think after that I must have got a million times more awkward and lost in my head, desperate for her approval, and I kind of watched her interest lower even though we were still joking around in the same way. I had switched in an instant from just talking to her for the fun of it, which made her interested in me, to trying to get her to like me, which put her off.

I always wondered about that night. I came back to it a lot, why in that one little moment some random girl actually seemed interested and went out her way to talk to me, and why it all of a sudden switched. And it‚Äôs cause I just tried to get to know her at first. I had no ulterior motive. It was my brain switching to that anxious, desperate for validation and completely unconfident side of me that put her off. And from now on this is how I‚Äôm gonna try approach all of my dating life in general; just wanting to talk to people for the sake of knowing them. That one little moment, and that girl I met for maybe half an hour, looking back with hindsight and some new knowledge, told me absolutely everything I needed to know about where I was going wrong with women. I was just too caught up in my head at the time to pick up on it.

I was dating a guy for over 3 years. We had a major problem that we couldn't continue the relationship (religious problem) and couldn't overcome it! We did love each other so much but when this problem was being raised every single time, it was screwing all this love (we both didn't have any benefit from each other or even have sex - decided to have it after marriage). I was living in Denmark at that time, and he was living in Germany and we were travelling to each other every few months.

Anyway, after almost 3 years of knowing each other, we decided to end this relationship and become good friends. I stopped talking to him for almost 8 months and during that time he was trying to chat with me (in the first couple of month of break up). Until I found him sending me on my birthday good wishes so I replied and we started talking again. He was sometimes asking one of my family about me, during the time we were not in contact.

I talked with him again and the conversation was very cold, I sent him a postcard and a parcel and get only thanks from his side. And when I disappear again, for two weeks or a month he asks about me and sends my family!

My question is why he does contact me and care/ask about me and even send my family if I don't answer although when I answer him, he has a very cold conversation with me (very short replies, end calls fast, no priority in his daily life, etc)?

So just for some context. I was recently rejected twice by my coworker we are both in our early twenties. I must be honest, her initial rejection was very kind and mentioning another guy she‚Äôs interested in. I like a man appreciated her honesty but had some idea that she thought I wasn‚Äôt serious and attempted again which logically resulted her to reject me again this time quite aggressively and bringing her friends into the picture now. I took it personally and asked her for some space. I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot lately and the whole thing really wasn‚Äôt her fault but she was trying to be kind and she didn‚Äôt even owe me that. I feel like sh** &amp; I haven‚Äôt seen her since I got her number. What do you women think her and her friends think of me now? I don‚Äôt want to approach her at work as I have a feeling she might be afraid of me or make a scene. Will it forever be awkward from now on? Also, if you women were in this situation what would you appreciate the guy (me in this situation) to do? I‚Äôm using this experience to improve myself and not mess up things for the next gem I meet in life lol (also never asking out a coworker again). I really appreciate you taking the time to read.

For men and women.
1) work on yourself!! look deeply into your flaws and hang ups WE ALL HAVE THEM IT IS JUST THE STRONG ONES OF US FACE OUR DEMONS INSTEAD OF PUT THEM OFF WHICH KILL OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND HURT LOVED ONES LATER!! 

2) just be calm and collected and stable when around people. Treat them with understanding and empathy and love.

3) stop buying the drinks and gifts. I still have trouble with this one but it is sientific that women and men appreciate some level of individual independence in any relationship no matter what.

4) don‚Äôt go all in at 1st chance they have to want to be around you too you can‚Äôt force this no matter how nice you are there is a level at which you look desperate and that is a fatal flaw and pretty hard to turn around.

5) if you feel you have been friend zoned and don‚Äôt want that, you have 2 choices. 
A- Just distance yourself from the friendship and cut ties 
B - choose that this is not the person and you will have a good friend going forward. Keep in mind Friends don‚Äôt buy each other gifts very often these days.

6) There is an easy way to flirt but not go to far. And that is being understanding and empathetic to any issues a possible partner would show and then when a topic is brought up that you incorporate a form of flirting do it quickly and move to the next subject. Do not linger on flirting it becomes creepy.

7) always be clean cut and smell nice. Keep a clean house and bathroom and car. And by clean cut I mean dress nice. Tattoos are cool and I have a lot but I dress as if I can jump into an interview at any given moment. Aka business casual.



Above all else once you have faced your demons and can be the stable voice of reason 1 or 2 things happen they want to be around you more and that goes in the best way possible or 2 they show you they are just using you for a friendship and that is where you get to choose.

****For Women and Men****

If either men or women find a person who is wishy washy you do not want to be with them. 

Example = I have had a relationship where my ex would shut down and not talk about a subject that was tough. If I asked if something was wrong she would tell me she was fine yet stomp around the house like a person who was pissed. 
If I asked what is bothering her too many times, like 3 or more through out the day, she would get even more upset. I would ask what can I do to help and she would say ""I don't know"". I would tell her I am worried because I love you and I cant read your mind and I dont like seeing her upset or hurt. Yet she would not do anything to tell me what was wrong. 

I once asked her what she would like to do about our children's birthday and she could not help make the decision even though she is great mother. 

DO NOT DATE OR GIVE ANY EFFORT OR ENERGY TO THESE TYPES OF MEN AND WOMEN THEY HAVE MORE BAGGAGE THAN THEY WANT TO ADMIT AND WILL NEED TO WORK ON THEMSELFS BEFORE ANYTHING WILL WORK FOR THEM IN A RELATIONSHIP!

I'm just not interested,"" and swiftly unmatched me.

I'm fine if someone is not interested in me, but given the way this conversation played out, it felt like that may have already been pre-established in her mind when she matched back, and she just needed a few moments of entertainment and attention. Her letting me know was appreciated, but people do this shit a lot on dating apps, and it's tiring.

So this is my story. I dated someone a couple of years ago and it was an emotionally abusive relationship and I got of it pretty hurt and drained. I didn't date anyone for years and didn't see anyone casually either and also turned down any guys that showed interest towards me. Recently I thought that it's enough and I should get out there and figure out what I want. Fast forward, I downloaded bumble and met a guy that I thought I had a good connection with, hooked up with him but he turned out to be an ass (he made rude remarks about my body after we got together and that shit I just can't tolerate). I was pretty bummed and then met another guy which I posted about a few days ago (he seems really busy, takes two business days to respond lol). 

The problem with me is that I get too emotionally involved in the process as in though I have a ridiculously busy job, I would still make time to respond to the other person. I get super hyped about what I'll wear blah blah blah and even kind of just think through conversations etc before meeting someone. It's probably cuz I'm really new to this. But the thing is that because I take one guy at a time, I think I get somewhat invested atleast more than I should be, which I've come to realize results in disappointments more often than not. But at the same time I don't have the mental capacity to be speaking to multiple guys at the same time.

Saturday noon comes around, I say ""I take it you're busy this weekend?"" she said yes, and that we can do something the following week, she'd make time during the week. I agreed.

Tuesday comes around, and I ask her what days work best. She said wednesday or thursday. I said thursday would work best. I suggested she come over and introduce me to superhero movies (she's really into super heroes). She seemed excited when she said yes. Today, Thursday comes around, and she seems busier than normal. Hadn't snapchatted me for a couple hours (not very normal), and mentions being tired from cramming work in. I believe her when she says this. I ask if we're still on for today, she says she should probably nap and try for time next week. I responded by saying that's understandable, ""lmk when you're free next week"". She just said she'll be free after next tuesday cuz that's when she has her final exam. 

Final info: She frequently starts convos about small stuff, which gives me the impression that she's at least somewhat interested. Has been this way since we started talking almost a month ago. Often replies very fast to my messages, as I do to her.

Wondering what I should do now. I want to ask again on tuesday (what we both said we'd do), but at the same time I fear she lost interest and doesn't want to let me down. Idk what to think

I've moved around a lot and dated men of all cultures and backgrounds and heights and ages and let me tell you, when I meet one who's a click, I just...know). 

And I know this sounds insane, but we only went on two dates. I can say that just within that time I absolutely deeply and surely felt that this guy was a keeper, I laughed more than I have in maybe a decade, talked more freely than I have in years, felt giddy and connected and we have a freakish amount of common interests. Felt like I was 18 again. He's even in the career field I've been wanting to switch to. I know he liked me back, he made it very obvious. We both are probably a bit socially awkward, and we've both moved around the world a lot in our lives.

On the first date (we met through Hinge), he told me he's trying to move to Alaska really soon. Me being me, I was just like OH WOW COOL! and it didn't sink in. Then the second date, he made it more clear that soon is in like...2 months. We had an amazing time that day, then when he dropped me off, there was that moment in the car where it just felt like, ""damn this is fast but ok a 'lean-in' is happening"". But, I pulled away, and just said I can't since he's leaving and I don't want to end up hurt in 2 months. Am I right to be irritated that he had an active Hinge account while having plans to leave soon? 

The next day, I texted him to see how he was feeling about things. I am NOT the kind of girl to fall fast, it's VERY rare for me to get giddy about men at all these days, and I am also NOT a clingy person, usually I'm very distant. But since there's a time limit, I needed to know. I basically told him I really like him, really want to keep seeing him, but that I've gone through too many painful goodbye's in life and just can't handle another one soon. I also said I'm a very open person and really could consider moving anywhere (I didn't say to Alaska, but I let that hang...). **Should note that he doesn't think he's going to spend forever in Alaska, I would think only like 2 years max?? Then I guess he doesn't know where to. I'm also in a boat right now where I don't exactly have a place I call my home.

He expressed that he felt sad that he's on the edge of moving and that we met now, and said he's also had some hard good-byes that happened because of either him or another her moving. And he said something like ""You're really kind and you deserve someone amazing, blah blah blah,"" which honestly kind of hurt.

I feel I *found* someone amazing and I absolutely can't stop thinking of him. I felt like throwing up the whole next day, just thinking that fuck, this is so rare to meet someone like this, why do things have to be so shitty? But, his answer tells me that either:

A. He's not THAT into me, not enough to want to keep meeting and somehow consider a relationship past when he moves to Alaska. I really do feel like he liked me though. 
B. He was unavailable from the start and just, wants to move to Alaska and not have baggage (kinda like A I guess).

It was left at that, just a hard text convo with no solution and we mutually decided to not see each other again since he's leaving soon and we don't want things to be painful. 

I just am dying inside to somehow see him again and I haven't felt this way about anyone in a decade. My insides just hurt. I can't stop thinking about him, about how naturally we clicked. And at 30, I'm scared about this not happening for another 10 years now, and I feel I couldn't meet up with someone else for a while after this. I'm also a person who believes a home is found in others, not in a geographic place, so hell, idk, I've spontaneously moved places before and have dreamed about Alaska for a while as well and part of me is like...would I consider that?

I don't know if there's answers, but it would just...help to hear from others.
