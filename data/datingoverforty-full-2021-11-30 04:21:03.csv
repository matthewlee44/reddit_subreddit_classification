Is this just my small sample size?

Over the last year and change, I dated 2 women (on separate occasions) who were in their 40s and didn't have kids. The red flags were there from Day 1, but by months 2-3 I knew it wasn't going to work. The first (a widow) refused to accept that I couldn't offer her more than 1/2 days a week of my time. She would attack me every time I said I couldn't do something with her. The second (never married) refused to be exclusive/monogamous even though I doubt she was seeing anyone else. Maybe I wasn't the one for her, but both seemed genuinely shocked and asked ""Why"" when I said that I didn't think this was going to work. 

I get that certain things that people won't compromise on, but if they were happy why not try to?

On the other hand, I dated a women with 3 kids when I was in college and she did everything she could to make things easy for me even though I never asked her to.

I wanted to know. I miss my Andrea (41F) Cancer and we are 26 days apart in age. Me (41M) did lie about cheating on her with a friend in Las Vegas who I do care about as well, but when confronted about it I lied.

She is my Honey Bun, My Rib, My sexy music teacher, my lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets. Truth is it‚Äôs hard for me to move on because she was perfect and I was fucked up for trying to be something that I wasn‚Äôt. Trying to fit in with a younger crowed and then allowing my inner demons to come to fruition. 

I know I hurt her deeply. What I want to know is how do I reach out to her and tell her I‚Äôm sorry and that I miss her. How do I open the communication gates again and she trust me?

I met this girl online about 5 months ago.

On paper she ticked all my boxes so i asked her out and we started dating.

Fast forward to today, we mutually agree it wasn't going anywhere so we broke up. 

I now understand when someone is not really into you and keeps you second guessing yourself it is probably high time to move on.

To give you some examples,

\-after our first meeting, I asked for her number and she said let's talk later. So later in the day, I messaged her saying it was a good meeting. When is it a good time to talk on the phone? She said let's take a raincheck.

\-I had initiated all the text messages and she answers in a couple of days time with some uninformative feedback.

\-She tells me she is not much of an online messaging person. So, I said I can call you instead then she says lets keep to text messages.

\-I asked her what is your ideal partner? She replies, I am more happy to be single but would like a relationship. I asked her, do you like children and thinking about marriage? She replies, I would like children if my partner wants them and I would get married if my partner wants it. In my mind, I was thinking that is confusing as fuck. In my head, im like then why are you on a dating site when you want to be single?

\-A couple of week ago, I asked her whether she was close to marriage from her past relationship. She chumped my head off saying I was bringing drama and baggage into the relationship. She doesn't like drama or baggage. [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qsrkok/gf\_doesnt\_want\_drama/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qsrkok/gf_doesnt_want_drama/)

\-After that she said, I want a person who is confident and stable in his life. Umm..maybe I didn't say it clearly from the beginning. I don't deserve to be put into a situation where I am carrying someone's baggage. I addressed every one of her concerns and she said maybe she overreacted. At this point in her life she just wants to have fun with her partner. So we ended up doing a lot of restaurant events.

\-Today I invited her over to my place because I wanted to know how we were trekking as our Christmas holiday is coming soon. I've preempted the invitation with a text saying I would like to know what you think about seeing more of each other. So when she turned up she asked to speak first and said I don't think I am getting a connection with you and there is no point of continuing this relationship. Then I said, you are right I am not finding a connection with you as well and that is why ive asked you to my place tonight instead of dinner at the restaurant. She continues it has been 5 months and we have not shared physical intimacy because it should've happened by now. Then I said, I wanted to see you as my romantic partner but I just don't know who you are so how are we supposed to have a holiday together. I said, I wanted to get to know you but you don't do text and you don't do phone calls and so when I see you in person it feels like im talking to a stranger every time. I said, Ive asked you what time is best to call you but you don't respond. At this point, she just looked at me and nodded. She said, I feel like you want me to give you more than I could give you. So I asked her what do you think I need from you? She didn't answer. I said, I know we are on a different track in our lives and I've been more than generous and forthcoming with you but whenever we communicate with each other it is strained and weird. I know that if we have felt a connection then physical intimacy would have happened because someone would have already initiate it. We are basically friends ending our outtings with a kiss. I said, alright it was great to have known you and she said, likewise. Well, I will leave then and yeah, I will get the door for you.

Started seeing this guy for about a month, we've hung out a total of 4x. He's cute and we seem to have pretty good chemistry.  We were very natural when we hung out, nothing seemed forced.  I've spent the night as his place couple of times.

He markedly slowed down on the texting, but after I talked to him about it, he had assured me he's just not always a great texter and showed some improvement.  We had both agreed that for now, it's casual and see how things go, so no pressure.  

I did wonder if he was seeing someone else at the same time because after each time I spent the night, he was quick to say bye to me the next day, which was odd.  When I have casually asked what he did the day before, I could see his wheels turning in his head to come up with something lame like ""oh nothing much, just stayed home all day"".

Anyway, just got a text that he's been seeing someone else recently too and think it's best to break it off with me.  I do appreciate the honesty and text...cuz getting ghosted or faded and die a slow death is WAY worse.  That said, it still sucks.  I haven't responded yet, still trying to process it.  I liked this one and was having a good time.   The sex was great, actually pretty amazing (damnit!!), but he had the same name as my ex-husband (somewhat of a hang up for me) and a few other quirks that I wasn't a major fan of.

madly in love with for very close to four years long distance.  We met 20 years ago at work while I interned and he ran the intern program.  The minute he introduced himself I just felt something when we made eye contact.  I was 21.  I kept feelings to myself and he did too‚Ä¶a few years went by and we were talking and got back in touch.
I considered him my best friend. He moved and worked for a large tech company in TX and we talked while we both sat in traffic. Sadly he broke
Up with his fianc√© (I later found out he was so drawn to because she was so
Much like me but a bitch). He then met the woman he married and who gave him two gorgeous children who I have the pleasure of watching grow up and I
Adore.  My life is not as great separately‚Ä¶I marry someone that same
Year who ends up financially and emotionally and verbally abusing me
But the marriage lasts barely 5 years and I drop him, file for divorce but sadly end up with someone even worse on a rebound and oops in 2014 I have a sweet baby girl.  She‚Äôs the joy in my life and her dad well it isn‚Äôt good and we go to court and I‚Äôm awarded full custody.
My man comes back into my life via me  I find him on LinkedIn and reach out (just wanted to regrow my circle of good friends). When he finally calls me back it‚Äôs several months later and he‚Äôs doing so well and I‚Äôm so happy for him  he lets me tell him about my life over the last 10 years here‚Äôs the thing; he‚Äôd been watching it all unfold on Facebook since I joined Facebook in 2007!!! So for almost 11 years!!! My Facebook page was private how is that possible ??
I want to mention our chemistry and connection and friendship is incredibly strong and the sex is the best I‚Äôve ever had  ever 
We‚Äôve been inseparable ever since. 2021 is a rough year  he is distant on and off and doesn‚Äôt make a huge effort to visit me at all  he doesn‚Äôt have full custody of his children but I do and my child has high functioning autism 

Ok so fast forward to October where I went to see him and it was the best long weekend ‚Ä¶.he was cuddling me and put a huge ring on my finger and said ‚Äúthis is just for a demo and we were practicing me being his wife.
I thought it was so sweet. The rest of the trip was great and when I got home things started to get strange 
A few weeks later he got distant and when I asked him what was up he said I needed to find ‚Äúa real boyfriend a local boyfriend ‚Äú
 Then I didn‚Äôt answer for a couple of days his calls but I texted and that evening 11/13 I called and it went straight to voicemail and has been that way since 11/13 and it‚Äôs 12/1

I told her that I respected her decision to cut things off if she felt that was the best thing for her however for me I know what I want and at this point I'm looking for someone that is ready to commit and since neither of us at this point want the same thing it would be better for us to just go our separate ways.  She said ok but she was here if I ever wanted to talk.  I just said thank you and left it at that.  

Second part of this is we where FB friends and after a week of no contact I noticed she deleted me and actually blocked me as well which really surprised me because the breakup wasn't hostile however I'm not a big social media guy so not sure if that is the typical treatment of an ex after a breakup.

At least over text before the FIRST date. I'm with most ladies and have learned the hard way that anything less leads to feelings of disappointment for women looking for something serious.

That said, how does this apply to budding LDRs?

Three months ago, I met someone online who lives in another state who seems nearly/potentially perfect for me. And that's saying a lot, bc I've never married and I'm pushing 45.

In terms of the long distance thing, he's an immigrant who's been in the states for 3 years. (During which time he says he's not dated anyone.) He says he's not opposed to relocating, if things work out that way. 

At first, I thought I could see SOMETHING (visually) attractive about him, but after several video chats, seeing him in various lights, I'm _fairly_ certain I couldn't possibly resist any physical, in-person advances. And, knowing me, after any physical intimacy, I'd be head over heels.

So there's all kinds of potential here. He's kept it pretty classy (I can't imagine an unsolicited D pic, for example), but he's starting to drop not-very-subtle (his English is still awful) messages or hints that he needs/expects more intimacy from our .... acquaintanceship?

Part of the issue might be that I'm at the very tail end of Gen X and he's squarely in the millennial cohort (44F, 37M). I can't imagine getting sexual prior to meeting in person, but I think younger people often feel quite differently. 

What do y'all think? Loosen up and give the guy a break? Or I may as well start an Only fans, if I'm so willing to get intimate online before meeting?

I am getting back into the dating pool and I just want to know how y‚Äôall navigate that. 

A little about me, two kids, married for 15 years, divorced, then after that I was in a 5+ year relationship that ended earlier this year. 

When dating, do you just go out with whoever asks and see how it goes? If you don‚Äôt like the person romantically after a date, is it usually okay to just say and then y‚Äôall can be friends and everything is cool? Do you give it a few dates to see if there‚Äôs anything there? Is it okay if you have a date but are still open to go on dates with other people? Do you go on a first date as more like friends and set that expectation? 

As I‚Äôm reading this these questions sound silly, but I have literally never actually ‚Äúdated‚Äù before and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing. I got a text from a friend that a male friend of hers was asking about me and I don‚Äôt even know what to do. I‚Äôm outgoing and friendly and enjoy meeting people.
