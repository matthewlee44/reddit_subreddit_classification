We both loved to talk to each other but now i'm getting the feeling i'm heading towards dating a fuckboy. I don't want to assume the worst, but he barely replies and leaves me on read now when before, he would always reply. He seems solely focused on sex or a booty call and while the occasional casual sex is fine, I want more out of the relationship. I'm not sure what to do as it has been all flirting and scheduling booty calls and no admittance of feelings. Not sure where to go from here.

14,nmnf42,1622167880,Should I tell this girl who wants to just be friends that I have feelings for her?,"**TL:DR** Hung out with a girl I met on a dating app a few times with an immediate connection. We went out a few times in a casual, undefined capacity for several hours each time. We have been texting every day since we first started talking on the app. We have a ton of common interests and a mutual friend as well. On the third hangout session, I asked her what she wants from this and she said she wants to be friends because I'm moving to a new city in a few months and COVID makes it hard to be in a relationship. I told her I agree cause I am moving in a few months (I originally got on the apps to just get more experience and meet new people post-vaccine anyway) but I kinda have feelings for her and I don't know what to do. Should I tell her? Should I just suppress them and keep hanging out? Should I distance myself?

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I got back into online dating a couple months ago after getting vaccinated and wanting to just get out there and meet new people. I am moving to Los Angeles from Seattle in August to go to grad school so I wasn't looking for anything serious and just hoping to just get back into the dating mindset.

This was basically my mentality until I met the woman in question. I messaged her on Hinge referencing a specific niche comedian who she also coincidentally happened to know of. We talked for a bit and found out we have a lot of common interests in standup comedy, hip hop, activism, etc. We hung out and got boba tea a couple days after our initial message conversation and she was really cool! She's honestly like my ideal woman in many ways and the more we talked the more we found that we have in common. She's a comedian, hip hop DJ, worked in a library, does activism/nonprofit work etc. all of which align a lot with my interests and work that I've been doing. I also really like her kinda shy but really funny personality. We also found out that we have a mutual friend.

After this initial meeting, we texted back and forth basically every day. It was mutual. Like I would initiate some conversations and she would do so as well. We had a second hangout session that ended up taking up the entire day. We went to a couple parks around the city, went to get tea, went to a video store, ate lunch, and then met up again after I went to work for a few hours and got dinner, drinks, and went to this board game spot. It was all really fun but never really discussed whether we were ""dating"" or just hanging out.

We continued to text basically every day until we met up a third time and similarly hung out for like several hours. Towards the end of this, I asked her what she is looking for on these dating apps. She promptly said she's looking for a long-term relationship. I said I'm probably looking for something similar but then asked her how she feels about me specifically. She felt bad answering and asked me if this would change the nature of our relationship to which I responded no. She said that due to the circumstances of me moving in a few months and COVID making it hard to date, she would like to just be friends. She then apologized and said she doesn't want to ""friendzone"" me. and said she would like to have more opposite gender friends. I responded by saying that I kinda feel similarly and it wouldn't make a lot of logical sense to get into anything long term if I'm moving to a new city in a few months. She said that I can talk to her about dating advice if I wanted and asked me She said that she found it really amazing that we have so many common interests and really enjoys spending time with me.

The problem is I think I was lying to her. Like I do enjoy spending time with her and would be psyched to be her friend but I think I have feelings for her. I know it's rationally not the best choice but I feel like there is a romantic chemistry that I feel towards her and I am worried that if we keep hanging out and texting all the time, I'm only going to get more and more enticed by her. I was considering telling her about my romantic interest and asking her out on a real date. I was going to ask her if she would be interested in me romantically if not for the logistical challenges of dating, and saying that I want to give this a chance for now and seeing where it goes. She has already said she wants to be friends and I promptly agreed with her on that so it feels weird bringing this up now but also weird to suppress my feelings. What should I do about this?

The other point is that if I'm only going to be here for a few months, I already have a ton of other friends I want to see. If there isn't a chance for romance, I don't know that I should spend so much of my time and energy on this person because I have so many other friends I want to see before I move and not a lot of free time right now cause of work. I feel bad cause I did promise her our relationship wouldn't change but I just don't know that I can invest ample time into someone if it's just for another platonic relationship. I don't know if that makes me an asshole and I don't want to stop being her friend, just might dial it back a little bit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmnf42/should_i_tell_this_girl_who_wants_to_just_be/

16,nmnfkr,1622167924,Why I think I’m done with dating and everything related to it.,"I[15M] knew this girl on Snapchat [16F]. We were talking as friends and I was really feeling her tbh. She was cute and she had nice communication. Then one day she unadds me. Oh well.

I saw she posted for her birthday and I got curious. I asked why she unadded and she said “u take 6 hours to answer one text😐” and I told her it was because it was the end of the year and I had multiple assignments to catch up on. That’s not even fucking it, I did one of my school’s biggest solo acts this month. This has been a really busy month for me considering I had a bunch of projects due, I had to write out for a band that included drums, bass, cello, viola, violin, trombone, saxophone, trumpet, keyboards, harp, AND background vocalists, and I had to direct that while singing and dancing, and you’re unadding me because I take a little long to respond?

I don’t mind the fact that it bugged her, but why couldn’t she say something? If she wanted me to make more of an effort to text her, I would but I didn’t know she had an issue with it until today after she unadded me. At this point, I’m just tired.

23,nmnvjr,1622169472,I (24M) want to propose an open relationship to my girl (23F).,"TL;DR - My ex and I have amazing chemistry, but I felt suffocated when we were together (due to lockdown/pandemic as well as not being able explore sexually outside the relationship). We both want to get back together, but I want to propose an open relationship (specifics explained below). How should I go about this? 

I'm ok with people who have different views on love, but I'm mostly seeking advice from people who are open to the idea of this type of relationship, not looking for opinions from people who think this would never work. Thank you. 

\--------------

In 2020 I was dating this girl, let's call her Lucy. Before we were dating we were best friends and everything about our connection was and still is so natural (conversations are stimulating, sexual chemistry is fire, we have similar interests as well as our own, we both have goals and stay fit, etc.).

However, in December 2020 we decided to breakup - being together 24/7 during a pandemic which allowed us to do little else besides play XBOX, watch Netflix, and make love created a lot of co-dependency so we decided to take time to ourselves and become our own people again. This ended up being really healthy because we both got our lives in order, slept around, and I realized that I really cherish her and want to experience life with her. Now that we've reconnected we've started to have sex again and act like a couple. We have not had the ""what are we"" talk yet, and I want to be proactive about addressing that.

The caveat here, as I'm sure you can tell by the title of this post, is that I would like an open relationship. By this I mean I want to have Lucy as my main partner (the person I take on dates, celebrate holidays with, comfort when she's down, and give priority to over other women), but I also want to continue to explore my sexuality outside of our relationship (casual encounters when out/traveling). This is something I have thought a lot about and with healthy, open communication and pre-determined rules and boundaries that make us both feel supported, I know we can make it work.

The trouble is, I'm not so sure how to approach her with this. I feel very suffocated in a relationship where I'm only allowed to be with and make love to one person. I like being free in this way, especially with a sexually repressed past and a very high sex drive. I'm scared that if I tell her this is what I want she's going to say no and I'm either going to sacrifice my own desires to keep her in my life (because seriously, she is such a great woman and makes me a better man, this is not just me saying this, she's the real deal) or tell her that I just can't do monogamy and we probably aren't compatible in that way.

I'd love some general advice on this, and here are a few specific questions:

1. What's the best way to bring this up? (in person or a thoughtful letter, her place or mine, etc)
2. Although she's a great woman, she does struggle with her self image and taking things personally, how can I approach this conversation in a way where she knows my desire to explore sexually is in no way due to any shortcomings on her behalf?
3. (Future-tripping here): If she is adamantly opposed to the idea, how should I respond?

25,nmnwq5,1622169587,Should I reach out to a girl that rejected me?,"*Please read the story to understand if you want. Sorry for the long story

Summary: Should I reach out to a girl that rejected me as I saw her recently and can’t get her out of my head before we all leave for college in the fall and since I may move states in July? Would moving on be the best move instead?

I am male (18m) who recently graduated on may 27th 2021 . I want to reach out to a girl (18f) who we’ll call Ava. Back in Junior year she was the new student at my school and as the year progressed we had a lot of mutual friends. My friend who we’ll call Daniel(18m), was friends with her various classes while only had one class with her. Ava and I were on the same team for a club too.

So around homecoming season 2019 we went as a group with Daniel and her friend. Ava paid for my ticket and I paid for hers at a different school’s homecoming later on. Ava asked me to hangout around October-ish but I couldn’t make it due to family visiting. Around Thanksgiving break she asked me if I wanted to hangout again and we went out. Originally, I had a whole great plan on going to this downtown area where there are restaurants and places to walk. Also it was when they were going to turn the Christmas tree on but my parents made me change it to roller skating when I don’t know how to. It didn’t go great and didn’t talk as much but we had some laughs. I went to her house to work on a project and her older sister was there. Ava mentioned something about Daniel and her sister says.”ooooh Daniel” in a teasing manner and Ava tells her to shut up. One time at practice I saw Daniel texting her and she called him babe over text. Now Daniel has never had any intentions with her and sometimes detested her and ignored her. But I suspected she liked him but I ignored it.

She showed up to a couple of my soccer games but nothing else really happened. She got her drivers license and we saw each other even less since the class we had was a free period. Fast forward to February 2021 and the club we were in had a competition at a hotel for states. We saw each other for the first time in a while before getting on the bus to get there. She called me over to sit with her but at the whole time there it was really tough.  We went out to the area where there were restaurants because she wanted to go eat with me at this one place but it was closed. After walking for a while we decided to walk back to the hotel and a girl from another school was lost and recognized us from the competition. She asked us if we could walk with her back and as we did she asked us questions about what school we go to, etc. Then she asks if me and Ava are a thing and Ava says no. She then asks if we are working towards being a thing and Ava says no. We get back to the hotel and I asked Ava if she meant what she said and she said yes. I dropped contact with Ava as I needed it. 

Ava hits me up 2 months later in May asking how I’ve been and if I’m still moving away because I was going to but after graduation. She asks me if I’m getting early release( where I leave school early) senior year, what time I would get out and saying maybe she’ll see me around there. She texts me three days later saying she liked doing the club with me and thanked me. There months later in august she asks me if I’m doing virtual or in person classes. Only asking that. A month later in September she asks me if I’m doing the club again only. And that was the last time we talked in 2020. She said happy birthday to me on snap after seeing my story in 2021 and I saw her again in person at graduation rehearsal.

 I haven’t been able to get her off my mind lately after seeing her again and now that it’s summer and before college and I may move in July, I want to hit her up again.

I tell him all the time to be confident, because I realize that the reason
why women find me attractive and not him is that I am very secure in myself.

The problem with this advice is that confidence comes from an early age and gets built on. When I was in my early teens, girls would hit on me, and from there I sort of built up confidence.

I've met way better looking, more polished, wealthier guys who utterly fail and totally lack confidence with women, and the only thing I can think of is that they lack the internal validation from their formative years. I think this further compounds and makes the issue worse.

To make matters worst he knows that I like him so when I go to visit my  friend and he is around he would avoid me if we alone and rarely talk to me when others are around and then another time he would do the opposite, which confuses me. 
He is always quite a gentleman around other ladies... My friend says she think he sees me as a little sister.. but he hasn't blatantly said so to.em or even acted in that manner because he would sometimes say certain things you to.ke that you wouldn't say to a sister, especially if we are texting.
He used to give me hints as if he liked me but then when I confronted him he wouldn't give me a straight answer and just acted as if he was oblivious to all the texts he would send me when I am home or the comments he would make... which left me confused... 
If I try to avoid him he would always come around and say something funny or something he knew I couldn't ignore.. BUT THEN HE'D GO BACK TO GIVING ME THAT COLD SHOULDER, that sometimes make me feel unwanted and unattractive... ps. I've seen his exes and they aren't all that...
Some one told me he might be intimidated by me...
Once this guy asked me for my number and I told him about it and he was annoyed and talked trash about the guy....
So I don't know...

30,nmonu1,1622172365,Settle this debate: By what age should a dateable guy lose his virginity?,"I was texting with a girl friend of mine tonight and she was telling me about a guy she's talking to off one of the apps who still hasn't lost his virginity. She's my age (30) and the guy is 32. I told her I would be weary of a guy who hasn't lost his virginity yet by that point, because first off, it brings up so many questions as to why a guy, if he's actually dateable, hasn't had sex yet, and secondly, if they were to have sex, he'd be inexperienced.

I prefer my men a little more experienced. I don't mean that I want to know that he's had sex with a lot of women, but I would like for him to have had enough experience so that if we're intimate, he knows what he's doing. To that notion, I told her that a dateable guy should have lost his virginity by the time he turned 24 the latest, but usually most normal guys do by the time they get out of college/grad school.

33,nmorvu,1622172783,My crushes are always into my friends,"Pretty much as the title reads, I basically had to deal with that for almost 5 years while I was working at Target. Pretty much how it always went is a girl would start to come around, I’d be hella interested and start to get the ball rolling for perhaps something more. However most of the time I shot my shot it was literally always the same answer. Sorry we’re just too close of friends(not a good excuse at all in my mind) and then they’d literally go and date someone else from my friend group.
There was one girl I was in a relationship in from Target between 2017-2018 for a year and some change, and it was fun. Have no regrets we’re still friends, and she gave me an honest to god shot. All I ever wanted out of any of the girl friends that were in our friend group was a single shot at a date. But literally every time I tried I would always get my heart broken beyond belief. This legit happened a good 7 or 8 times. 
It’s not that I don’t love myself. I meditate everyday, I take care of myself spiritually, and I truly think I’m worth being in a relationship. It’s just after that happening to me so many times it’s hard for me to even function anymore. 
The last time something like that happened it was around 6 months ago, and a friend of mine who I legit loved as a brother tells me that the girl he’s been hyping me up to shoot my shot with and tried to help me says my crush is into him and he’s into her. I responded respectfully, said I was happy for them and quit two weeks later. Only hung out with him once since and all I could think about was that moment. Today I finally left the group chat I was in with that friend and unfollowed him on all social media. For the past few months I’ve been saying on social media how I completely regret working there, and how the shit memories were in no way worth any of the good ones. 
Just thought I should vent since I don’t know what to do anymore. Went to the doctor, gave me Lexapro, after one month that didn’t work so now I’m on day three of Prozac. All I know is I’m never going to be in a big friend group again. I’m done with platonic shit.

I’m looking forward to seeing what hobbies my future partner has! It’s such a great way to bond and seeing their eyes light up when you show interest in something they love is heartwarming.

He was staying in a hotel/casino around 45 minutes away from me and wanted to meet for dinner. Before meeting him we talked for a few days over the phone and video chat. 

I brought 2 friends with me on the date so they could watch from afar for my safety because you can never be too safe. I dont really know this guy yet so i wanted to protect myself. 

I was glad I did. 

He quickly noticed my friends because they were young, like me, which is not typical for a casino. He became really rude and short tempered with me when he figured out i brought them with me and made me very very uncomfortable. After dinner I couldn’t find where my friends went off to and said i needed to use the restroom and he said he would show me the way.  

He took me to his hotel room instead. I became scared and used the restroom in his room and said my goodbye. He hugged me for way too long and picked me up to place me on his bed and began kissing my neck. To me this was WAY out of line. I told him i really needed to find my friends, he got mad and told me to leave.  

Later that night he sent me nasty messages and called me to argue with me. The next day he got even worse and said some horrible disgusting things that i do not even want to repeat. He then sent me a screenshot of my address and threatned to show up to my home and hurt me. I contacted the police and blocked his number.

53,nmrd37,1622182571,The 3 most disgusting behaviors of girls in dating,"1.Do not seek the opinions of girls, arrange blindly

Many boys tend to be a little machismo when dealing with their feelings. They arrange everything for girls and want to create a responsible and considerate image of a good man in front of girls. Think about all the itineraries for the date, such as where to go, what to do, and so on.

In fact, dating is a matter for two people. Both parties must have the prerequisites for understanding each other, such as what she likes, what she wants to do, and what she hates. These are all important prerequisites for preparing a perfect date.

2.Overrepresenting oneself

When dating, boys sometimes express themselves deliberately in order to improve their good image in front of girls. For example: places he hasn't been to, things he hasn't eaten, boys want girls to feel that he has them, and if they want to gain a sense of admiration, he will try to pretend to be himself, so that he will appear fake during dating.

The right direction: Don't express yourself deliberately, keep your own style and frame, just go for a normal date.

3.Physical contact with girls on the first date

I want to have too close physical contact with a girl on the first date. Few girls can accept it. Physical contact with a girl will increase the intimacy between you, but this behavior is the most difficult at the same time in the upgrading of the relationship. It is also the most important step. A slight improper treatment will change from ambiguous to indecent, and his image in the minds of girls has plummeted from then on.

The premise of physical contact is that you and your date have established trust and comfort. On this basis, some of your close behaviors will create an ambiguous pink atmosphere. To put it simply, it is to consider how far your relationship has progressed, and consider girls' acceptance of intimacy behavior.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmrd37/the_3_most_disgusting_behaviors_of_girls_in_dating/

I always saw him as more of a friend, but there was slight flirting this time around. I contemplated exploring a fwb with him (especially since I already knew him), and so the third time we hung out, we fooled around a bit. I made it clear that I wasn’t looking for anything serious, and he was on board with casual. But honestly afterwards, the sexual compatibility and chemistry just hasn’t been there for me. Afterwards, he said he’d love to meet again for this (and presumably full on sex). But thinking through it, I’d prefer to keep to friendship and not anything sexual/physical. But I do understand how that may not be possible for him anymore. I do value him and our friendship, and so I’m not sure what to do next? How do I phrase this to him?

67,nmt1pb,1622190010,When is the best time to date offline?,"Picture this. You have great chemistry from the stroke of your keyboard. You have fun sending messages to each other. He thinks you're a knockout. You think he's charming. He seems interested in everything you are doing. You spend an hour every night chatting online and get several text messages during the day. Are you in a relationship? No, not really.

Trust Your Intuition. Don't accept a date when the phone conversation doesn't feel right. If you don't have any phone chemistry at all, or find yourself in an argument with your date before you even meet them, don't schedule a date. You don't need a free meal or coffee. If you put a date on the calendar, don't feel badly about canceling. Why waste each other's time?

Take your date from online to offline as soon as possible. In this case, the couple had great ""instant message"" chemistry and emailed and text messaged each other frequently. Since they had communicated mostly online, they ended up with a false illusion that they were in a relationship. They got attached. They were not in a relationship. They were talking to a computer with a photo, that's all. After several emails back-and-forth, it was time for them to talk on the phone and move the relationship along. The couple waited almost three weeks before ever hearing each other's voices.

69,nmt5i3,1622190490,Mixed signals with a friend I am interested in?,"I (22M) met a girl (20F) in school about 4 months ago, and we have been texting quite regularly for the last 2 months. We met face to face for the first time about a month ago to study and had a quick dinner together. I asked her if she wanted to meet to study again, and she agreed quite enthusiastically. We studied together three more times and met up for dinner (and then went for desserts after dinner) after our finals.  I might have played myself when asking her out for dinner though because I asked if she wanted to ""hang out"" after finals. 

I recently asked her out again to exercise and we had brunch after exercising. We had a good time every time we met, but nothing flirty or touchy really besides some (non-sexual) teasing. On both the dinner and the brunch, she didn't mind sharing food and even drank from the same straw - not sure if this says anything but I probably wouldn't share a straw with my friends. I think she quite enjoyed spending time together since she asked if I wanted to exercise together again next week.

When I am with her in person, it seems like she's interested, but she seems a little hot and cold over text. She recently added me to her close friends list on Instagram, initiate random conversations occasionally (basically sending ""Hey, wyd""), and we would sometimes have long convos over text, but other times she would not respond to my texts for a few days, even though she has been online, which would make me think she's uninterested.

I really like her personality and I think she's quite cute too, but I am not sure what to make of these mixed signals. Do y'all think it is worth asking her if we are friends or if we could be more?

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note: 

I am from a rather conservative country, and my friends commented that I was ""moving quite fast"" when I asked her out for dinner so quickly after knowing her. Also, we talked a lot about our aspirations and family when we hung out, which aren't topics I usually share with a new friend?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmt5i3/mixed_signals_with_a_friend_i_am_interested_in/

72,nmu24l,1622194571,I (21F) had my first kiss and kept flinching when he (24M) touched my stomach and sides,"First post, just hope to get this off my mind.

I (21F) went for drinks and a walk on Wednesday with a guy (24M) I met on Tinder.
The drinks and walk bit went really well. We had great conversation, lots of fun, and there was definitely some chemistry. We ended up at a lookout in a park where he proceded to make out with me. I didn't see it coming and I kind of freaked out inside but went with it anyway. A couple minutes later I told him I had never been in a relationship before and then he figured out that it was my first kiss. (it was also really bad so he just knew hahah oh god)
We spent the next two hours talking and making out. I didnt feel entirely at ease with all the kissing and tried to signal it, but he just found my inexperience kinda.. cute? Towards the end I started to feel more comfortable though.
Also, his hands were all over me and although I enjoyed most of it, him touching my stomach and sides made me flinch massively. I have a history of childhood verbal abuse, some threats of physical abuse, that type of stuff. I didn't feel comfortable telling him about this, so I just told him that I didn't know why I was flinching and laughed it off.

I messaged him the morning after our date and told him that the pace was too high for me and that I had been scared to set my boundaries. He reacted positively, told me I shouldnt be afraid to tell him to stop and he said he went too quick as well. I thanked him for his positive reaction and asked him to elaborate some more on why he thought he went too fast and now he's left me on read.

I really don't know how to feel or what to do. I don't feel taken advantage of, but I'm disappointed in myself for not telling him to stop or tone it down when I didn't feel at ease. I was so concerned with his feelings and opinion of me that I let this happen and it's just gross. Can't believe I have such a hard time setting boundaries.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmu24l/i_21f_had_my_first_kiss_and_kept_flinching_when/

74,nmunzb,1622197168,Friend has got a girl pregnant within a month - advice?,"So my friend has been desperate for a girlfriend. He has been on a few dates on tinder and has found a Filipino girl in her early thirties, she has a job in london in healthcare and earns a substantial amount more than my friend who's on minimum wage.

6 weeks after meeting, she is now pregnant. His family and myself are very concerned about this as he only had a mental breakdown last year, hes quite simple and easily influenced and 'goes with the flow' without truly looking into things long term.

So hes got this girl pregnant, she wants him to quit his job and move from his home town to london, leave his family and friends behind because she does not want to quit her career.

We told my friend this could be a be a bad idea,  he does not realise the costs of living in london, financially hes terrible at budgeting and lives at home with mum and dad.

He will be away from his support system which if they moved down here, he would atleast have some support and so would the mother and baby. 

Essentially he would be alone with a girl he just met, who is saying to him to bring her parents over from the phillipines to life with them, my friend was not happy with the initial 6 months she requested and he agreed to 2 months (which no doubt will be extended due to how soft he is)

I ran through all the costs and expenses of living in london and the pros and cons of moving away from home but he is just absolutely hypnotised by this girl, who seems to know what she wants and will not compromise.

It just FEELS like such a weird situation for this girl to  just get pregnant with a guy she just met without considering his own life, financial stability and long term commitment. 

Has anyone else seen stories like this happen?!

Honestly, I have lingering feelings for my ex so I'm mostly looking for friends who I can connect with and then see if it goes any further as that's how my best relationships have started in the past and it's a comfortable speed for me. 

I enjoy first dates because it's like meeting new friends and seeing if I'm interested in them for potentially more if it were to develop that direction. So far though, I've had very little luck.

My family are pretty well off and I earn a decent living.

On paper, I should have a girlfriend or should at least be dating.. and yet no one wants to date me. Why? This is obvious advice: I see guys who are not that good-looking and they’re single and they think it’s because of their looks. Guys, it has nothing to do with your looks or how much money you have. 

Personality is the key to dating. 

Trust me, this is the only reason I am single. Last year I took far too much LSD and lost any trace of personality I had left. 

I’m just writing this so that if you are a guy who is worried about the way you look or worried that you can’t compete with other men financially: these things are only in your mind. Trust me, I have both good looks and money and regardless of how many girls I talk to on Tinder, I am never going to have a girlfriend.

he also was blabbing his big mouth about it to multiple people, even after I made it clear I did not like that. I am mortified. He rejected me so why is he doing this

also we are both 26, if that matters. i would have been fine with just the rejection, and i'd move on, but why does he feel the need to continue to be a jerk?

How can I stop being crazy?","We've been seeing each other for 2 months now (plus talking for 1 month before that) and have been on 6 dates. I'm kind of freaking out because I keep imagining all these scenarios of us getting married and having kids in the future. I haven't told him any of this yet because obviously this is really fast and I don't want to freak him out because I'm being crazy right now. I just literally spend all day thinking about him. I hate that I'm like this because I want to be cool and relaxed about our whole situation, but anytime I get a text or a phone call my heart is racing until I see if it's him or not. If it's him I feel flutters in my stomach, and I have to force myself not to immediately answer and calm myself. When I'm with him I manage to keep cool, but the moment we leave I already want to see him again. It just feels like we're 99% compatible or something. We have similar goals of what we want in life and where we want to live, we share all the same values, and we have similar personalities. We're also insanely attracted to each other. Like, even though we've already had sex, there's just this constant sexual tension between us and we can't ignore it, especially when we're alone. I've got it really bad guys. I just keep on thinking about a timeline for us. In my mind I think, ""so in two years he'll propose, then we'll get married the next year. It'll be perfect because he'll be 30 and I'll be 26"".... I've literally never been like this before in a relationship! I'm too old to be acting like I'm in grade school. How do I stop it, so I don't scare him away?? I just want to let our relationship progress naturally.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmxmoz/weve_only_been_on_6_dates_but_i_think_im_in_love/

I'm a 25 F and ever since grade school up to now, my crushes never seem to reciprocate my feelings. As I grow older, I have been dating online and in person and it seems that guys play with me or ghost me. I am emotionally mature and I am attractive since I run a NSFW account lol. There are days where I feel sad because I crave intimacy. And i'm a virgin lol.

93,nmy319,1622209253,Getting dumped for the same reason I’ve previously dumped someone myself sucks way more than I imagined.,"Obligatory “English is not my first language” disclaimer. Also, might be a bit long.

TL;DR: I left my girlfriend of over a year due to falling out of love, without feeling the need to talk with her about it before ending things, and felt pretty good in the aftermath. Several months later, a girl I was dating for months dumped me due to falling out of love, without feeling the need to talk with me about it before ending things, and I felt like a mess.     

&amp;#x200B;

People fall out of love. It just happens and usually leads to a break up. Sometimes it’s mutual, other times only one of you feels that way and ends the relationship. 

This has happened about a year ago. My girlfriend and I were together for over a year when I started feeling that something felt off. At first, I couldn’t describe it, but as the weeks passed I started realizing that my feelings towards her just weren’t the same anymore. More time passed, the lack of right feelings only got stronger. I could’ve talked with her about it, figuring out ways to maybe rekindle our love, but I… just didn’t want to. I was fine with our relationship ending more sooner than later, weirdly enough. The following weeks I thought about how I would tell her about my lack of feeling and my decision to end it right then and there. During this time, I repeatedly told myself:

“You’re not the bad one. You’re not the villain of this story. She can’t blame you for this. You can’t control your feelings, no one can. If you don’t love her anymore, then that’s just how it is and she can’t be angry at you for that.”

Finally, I did it. We met for a walk, and I told her how I just didn’t have the right feelings anymore. That she’s a wonderful person, that we’ve had a great time I’ll always have in fond memory. I’d love to stay in contact, but I just didn’t *love her* anymore. For her, it came out of nowhere. Some time later, she told me how she spent the rest of the day and the one after crying, but still understood and accepted my decision. No ill feelings and stuff.    

And I felt fine. Quite good, even. Relieved, that she took it rather well and didn’t seem to be particularly angry at me. I managed to move on quickly, enjoyed my life and wasn’t really sad that this chapter of my life ended (that last part sounds harsher than I mean it).

Fast forward a few months, I started dating another girl. She was insanely beautiful, completely out of my league, and I soon fell in love with her. We dated for 4 months, everything was fine, some ups and downs, but nothing too bad. Then, she started acting distant, though I brushed it off, blaming outside factors like work, stress and other stuff for her behavior. Soon, everything should be great again.

Then, one afternoon, she just said: “I don’t have feelings for you anymore. I loved being with you, we had a great time, but it’s over.”      

I was devastated to say the least. The following days, I was a mess. How could she do this to me? She didn’t talk to me beforehand about her changing feelings, she didn’t want to fight for our relationship, she just continued to enjoy her life, she… acted just like me. This realization hit me hard. I couldn’t be mad at her, because if I would, I’d have to be mad at myself for acting exactly like that to my ex. 

That’s a messed up feeling, let me tell you that. This was two months ago, I still think about her (the girl who dumped me) and don’t know who I should be mad at, if I should be mad at all.

We had contact a few weeks after. And what did I tell her? ""I understand and accept your decision, I don't have ill feelings towards you.""

I don’t even know what I want to achieve by posting this. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Though if I have learned something from this... well, don't treat a person in a way you don't want to be treated yourself. Or at least think about how the other person could end up feeling like before you act.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmy319/getting_dumped_for_the_same_reason_ive_previously/
94,nmyd7j,1622210127,Colleague set me up with her son,"A woman who I work and get along brilliantly thought thought I’d be a good match for her son. She’d always speak about me about him at work, and to him about me at home.

He finally gets in touch and after a week, and asks me on a date. We met up and went for drinks. Although the night was rather lengthy (for a first date) at 5 hours, it went by so quickly.

At the end of the night, he had his brother drop me back at my place on their way home.

We would normally text a healthy amount prior to the date, but it’s been 2 days now and I’ve heard nothing back from my last message to him.

I’m not in denial and know that I’ve been ghosted, even though we seemed to get on quite well. 

The problem is, I still have to see and work with his mum every weekend at work. Tomorrow will be the first time I see her and inevitably, she’s going to ask me how it went. She’ll already have heard his standpoint.

What do I say? I’m really kind of embarrassed by this. I just wanted to mention that over text, there were a few red flags. He would say some this that made me think “why would you say that to someone you don’t even know? Even if it is a joke, we don’t know each other well enough for things as personal as that.”

A standout one of his was “I might have to trade you in for a younger model” when expressing that I don’t want to start having kids until I’m in my thirties (I’m 22 now), and that there could be biological complications for a woman to wait that long.

Just before we were due to meet, he also expressed that he “might not like me in the slightest”, so if he wants a second date, he will let me know.

Overall, I don’t think we’d have been a good match. He seems like a bit of an arse overall. 

But the problem still lies, what do I say to his mum come tomorrow? I don’t want it to be awkward.

95,nmyg01,1622210368,"If you're not giving, then you're taking.","This rule applies to everyone. Relationships are built on the idea that each person contributes something of value to the other person (something that the other person wants). If you can't provide that, there is no point in engaging in the relationship for the other. Stop being surprised when people withdraw from you. You don't have anything they want.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmyg01/if_youre_not_giving_then_youre_taking/

97,nmyn7l,1622210949,Finances And Dating,"Just wondering, when you meet someone/are newly dating, do you consider the other persons financial situation at all?

I ask because I (39m), am newly single again and have been out dating, due to my situation (single, living alone in NYC), I don't have a whole lot of money in the bank because of cost of living etc. I'm not broke, have zero debt,  I have a great 401k, and a solid salary, but rent is a killer. 

I am wondering how many of you out there would care all that much or be more genuinely interested in the person themselves? For me, if I met a woman I really liked, it wouldn't really matter to me, once you are partners, financial issues can be solved (unless they are significantly serious of course). 

Anyways, just wondering what everyone out there thinks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmyn7l/finances_and_dating/
98,nmyr8w,1622211268,Messaging her after 9 months!,"Hi all,

I have gone on a date with someone over 8-9 months ago. It went really well. We met outside in a cute little cafe and chatted for hours and it felt like she really liked my company. Though she gave me her socials and number, when on the other day I asked her if she’s interested in another date she said she really liked me but she really needs to focus on herself and needs time and got a second thought on the whole dating thing in general. 
It was a bummer because I thought she was very sweet. And I said it’s totally fair and if you feel you’re in a right headspace and wanted to hangout, you have my number. 
I’m pretty outdoorsy and often go for hiking and see that she looks at my Instagram stories and posts, but haven’t contacted me at all after all these months. 
I tried messaging her once after almost a month and she never answered! But it’s 9 months now. I’ve been living my life and I’m keeping myself pretty busy but been thinking if I should message her again and what to say! 
I appreciate your help on this!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmyr8w/messaging_her_after_9_months/
99,nmyvgq,1622211619,How do I stop wanting to date and connect with people.,"I'll be blunt. I'm 19, 5'6, I have aspergers (and thus am more awkward than most) and physically unattractive, underweight and have forward head posture. I have plenty of friends but I've never once been in a relationship, but whenever I try getting into dating I end up crashing out as I realise I don't look good in pictures, would be misleading and deceiving people by writing a bio that projects charisma, and even if I ended up meeting someone in person I wouldn't have the personality to offset my poor physical appearance anyway. 

Yet for some reason I cannot stop myself from yearning to form a connection with someone beyond just superficial friendship, and it's killing me because I know there's not a chance in hell that'll happen. So to be frank, I want to know how I can expunge this desire to learn, grow, share time and love with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmyvgq/how_do_i_stop_wanting_to_date_and_connect_with/
