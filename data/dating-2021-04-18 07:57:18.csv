0,mtcgwt,1618751154,Sometimes there is nothing you can do,"Hey guys. 27, male. 
Almost 27 years single. 

Im kind of a 6-7/10 beauty guy, and l always tried my best on every date i had (im straight). 

During almost 10 years of Tinder i met all kinds of girls, and cant even tell how many times i was rejected, ignored, dismatched. 

I tried to be a fun respectful guy, taking a shot when i feel i could go for it. Always taking care of my looks and my behavior. Didnt really seem to be enough for the girls i ran into. 

Ive been on dates where the moment the girl sees you you realize she is by some reason disappointed (i never used crazy photoshopped photos just to be clear) 

Ive been dumped in the middle of a movie more than one time, by some heartless girls who liked arrogant jerks. 

All my friends are dating, getting engaged and i cant even get a match that works. 

My last chance i spoke to a girl from college and she knew i was really into her and she was even making plans with me for post pandemic moments. 
After 6 months of talking she completely stopped answering my messages, but never unfollow/blocked/dismatched me (we met on Tinder). 
She just keeps online, following people, posting stories and will never answer me again. Ghosted. 

I cant deal anymore with the feeling of knowing the date isnt going anywhere, knowing all the hard work to make the best impression once again ended up on nothing. 

So, if that person never respond you back, know that its not your fault, sometimes you just gotta go through some difficult journey for a good person show up into your life. 

Ive been in mine for 27 years, so many tries, talks, dates. Man, its hard to deal with it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtcgwt/sometimes_there_is_nothing_you_can_do/
1,mtcn5n,1618751828,What is wrong with me?,"I might seem like I'm lifting my own chair here... but it's tough to date. The pandemic just made it worse. I think I'm not bad to date at all. 

My heart and head are in the right places. I always have good intentions and I can talk about extensive topics. I'm well-traveled. I'm always working on my health. I have a secure job which I worked hard for. I make my own money. I'm independent and educated. I don't think I'm the prettiest girl in the room but I can say I'm easy on the eyes somehow. I don't think I'm bad in bed too. I have a very loving family, although not perfect. And somehow, I still find myself stuck in a dating rut. 

I've sat across men who are rather more interested in getting me naked faster than getting to know me. It does hurt sometimes. It can be draining going on dates. I put myself out there. I make it clear on what I want in a relationship and do not play games. And it's not as if I have pretty high standards. I try my best to be a good partner. I never cheated on any of the people I dated. 

In the end, I feel like I'm not enough to be worth fighting for. I'm always on the receiving end, always trying to salvage the relationship. I can't help but ask myself often, what is wrong with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtcn5n/what_is_wrong_with_me/

But lately I've been feeling really lonely and craving that someone special comes along to spend my time with. I think it might be my hormones or biological clock because the though of having kids has even crossed my mind, which is something I had never wanted before.

I'm introverted, a very unique person (I have traits of HSP) who doesn't have an active social life, online dating just makes me feel confused and sad. I feel I wont ever find someone and even more, someone who gets my different nature. These thoughts make me feel weak.

9,mtddap,1618754560,Reflecting on my past relationships,"I‚Äôve been deep into reflecting the last few weeks. I‚Äôm just trying to evaluate where I‚Äôm at and where I want to go.

I‚Äôm currently in a committed relationship with my girlfriend of 6 months. I love her, but she has a major flaw. Intellectually she‚Äôs not as close to me as I think I want her to be. I know this sounds picky and possibly rude, but she just didn‚Äôt get the education that I did and it makes it difficult to relate with her sometimes. I‚Äôm worrying that this will become a major deal breaker for me, it‚Äôs already starting to bubble up in me.

But when I started thinking about this I realized all my past long term relationships were with girls I ‚Äúsettled‚Äù for.

I‚Äôve been rejected by the girls that have all the qualities I want. Coincidentally the girls with the qualities I want always skew a good amount older than me and that‚Äôs one of the major reasons they reject me.

I‚Äôm just confused, I‚Äôm in a relationship but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôll last, we are too different. But every time I try to build a relationship with a girl that is truly a good fit the age difference creates the problem. My friends skew much older than me, I just get along with them better and prefer their company.

So, I‚Äôm just looking for some advice, maybe some stories from your own experience that I can relate to!

12,mtdnsb,1618755532,Does anyone on here (whose single) not use any dating apps!,"I'm just curious. Most of the questions on this sub relate to dating apps and to meeting people online. But I'm curious is anyone here whose single whose not on any dating apps. A lot of  girls and guys who I know don't use any dating apps. Many people who I've spoken to from work and university who are pretty good looking ;  go out regularly and have a wide friendship group, so they usually meet new people through going to bars and clubs , through mutual friends or even through instagram.   


I've spoken to a few girls who have told me that they will usually deleting apps because they can't keep up with the disproportionate number of message they recieve. And in general encounter a fair share of guys who act inappropriately and thus they will usually become sick of it after a while.   


As a guy who used dating apps for a few users; I would say I've done ok. I've gone on a few dates with a few woman. Addtionally, during lockdown it was a great way to meet and talk to new people-as everyone was online more during that time so it was easier get matches and message people. But now I feel that ever since restrictions have eased in my country - a lot of people who have gotten off dating apps.   


In my opinion whilst I feel like its harded to approach someone in a bar or whilst out clubbing than on a dating app because the potential rejection you face is a lot more personal. I feel like its so much more exciting to introdcue yourself to someone in a real life setting. And additionally, I feel you can move things a lot faster and ask people out more quickly if you've met someone whilst out. That being said, a lot of people I've met in clubs most of the time aren't really looking for anything serious.  


So without rambling further, I guess my question does anyone on here not use any dating apps.Or if your still living in a country where covid restrictions are in place - did you use dating apps before the pandemic?  I've feel like slowly people are starting to go more old school again ; and Im interested in everyone's opinion.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtdnsb/does_anyone_on_here_whose_single_not_use_any/

15,mtdzb6,1618756572,"Why she doesn't just say ""no""","I've seen a lot of posts recently about men complaining when women won't give them an outright ""no"" and even urging women to do so if they're not interested. So I'm here to give some explanations as to why women don't (and often shouldn't).

1) Safety: too many men take outright rejection very badly, with responses going from yelling (I've experienced this one) to threats and outright assault. It's also very difficult to tell if a seemingly nice, stable guy is going to flip out on you, so playing along and then dropping off the face of the earth is often considered pretty much the safest option.

2) Social conditioning: Women in most societies are expected to be caring and nurturing, which makes it psychologically difficult for them to be assertive and reject someone to their face. A hesitant, ""well, maybe"" may be as harsh as some women can get.

3) ""No means yes, yes means anal"": As this Yale fraternity so eloquently puts it, even when being told ""no"", too many men interpret this as ""try harder, she's testing you"". So what's the point? Just say yes and ghost. (See point 1.)

Yes, being ghosted sucks. You know what else sucks? Fearing for your safety. So next time a girl stops answering your messages after agreeing to a date, don't be mad at her. Be mad at the assholes whose behaviour means this is the safest option.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtdzb6/why_she_doesnt_just_say_no/
16,mte1a2,1618756759,Why do guys always want you when you don't want them?,"31f I feel like when ever I'm not interested in a guy or I've lost interest thats when they're interested in me but when they have my undivided attention they could care a less. 

Also almost every guy I was I dated regrets messing up with the relationship with me &amp; taking me for granted when they had me &amp; wants a second chance. I don't understand why guys can't appreciate what they had when they had it?

I feel like guys are brainwashed to thinking the grass is always greener on the other side but its not. Its green where you water it. A lot of guys only like the beginning of a relationship &amp; like the benefits of one without the responsibility or commitment.

I dated a guy briefly who was shitty to me &amp; told me he didn't want a relationship so instead of me sticking around, I left &amp; moved on &amp; found someone else. 

I dated the other guy for a year &amp; was really happy until that guy decided he didn't want the relationship anymore &amp; left me in the cold. I was devastated &amp; am still getting over it. 

Then the ex popped back up but this time he seems more serious. He's a lot nicer to me &amp; even apologized for his behavior towards me. He seems like he's trying to patch things up with me &amp; wants another chance but my heart is just not in it anymore. The feelings aren't there &amp; besides I feel like the minute I give him a chance again he'll do the same thing again and lose interest &amp; run off with another girl again.

I do think his intentions this time are more honorable &amp; he really did realize my worth but I just don't care anymore &amp; see him as more of a friend.

And I wonder if the other ex is going to do the same thing? I've also had other exes do this as well. Almost every ex of mine wanted a second chance realizing what they had with me once I moved on.

But it kind of upsets me like why didn't they see what they had with me when they had it? Why do guys only realize a woman's worth once she moves on? Why does it take leaving the relationship, hurting her, her walking away &amp; moving on with no other choice for them to see they had a good thing with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mte1a2/why_do_guys_always_want_you_when_you_dont_want/
17,mte2yt,1618756914,Review,"Just throwing out a quick scene that I appreciated in a movie yesterday. May or may not relate with the community here but I honestly think, that the scene was absolutely witty. 

This is not what the title suggest. I saw a movie, I liked something and wanted to write about it. The particular scene captures the playfulness for a lying man and an aspiring actress perfectly. Our protagonist is a compulsive liar and a struggling actor who cooks up stories on the go. He meets our lady on a production set and start to lie to woo her. The lady is wily and uses him as and when the opportunity comes. But this is not about their characters and what do they do, This is about the quirky banter they have just about when our protagonist is about to hit it gold with her.

Jump 1:02:00 in the movie and there it starts. To set up a context, our lady had scoffed at and walked away angrily from our hero just a few minutes ago. She humiliated herself based on some lies that he has told. Jump into the scene and he has been promoted as a key production guy for a sleazy producer. The dialogues that follow are pretty witty and looks have been written by those pulp fiction writers whose books fill the bookstands at the railway and bus stations.

She knows that he has been promoted and calls him to congratulate him but more importantly to squeeze him into getting her a role in one of the movies. He hits back and tells her what the deal has it for him. And the lady ends the scene with a witty one liner that makes us aware of the humor and playfulness that the lady would exhibit in the coming scene.

Cut to the next scene, after a hearty dinner, he is taking her to his house on a bike. She makes him stop and then the fun begins. It is a game of tennis. Balls are being volleyed with no one relenting to give up. She is testing his strength by being very flirtatious and relentlessly testing him. His street smartness and wittiness allows him to hit back whatever test is being thrown at him. They foreplay with their eyes. We enjoy the same. She begins by asking what his plans were for the night. He innocently answers, his home. She says its too late. He praises her in return and as sly he is, he hits a volley at her of doing so much for her acting aspirations and gently asks her to accept his tiny request this time. She has seen this kind of sleaze as hundreds of them have tried to bed her. She knows how to handle them well. She knows she wants someone unnerved by her. She answers if the dinner counts. But he is a seasoned liar. He is very perceptive and knows he can bed her if he plays his cards right. With a child like innocence he answers with a heavy dinner, one should always have a coffee. She says why does he need her for that coffee. He quips her that drinking coffee alone, is not what he is used to. She then makes an observation about his flat-mate. He remarks he has got rid of him for the night. She understands the game. She understands the tease. She knows he is not giving up. She knows he had a plan with her for the rest of the night. As such she bluntly asks him that. He calmly takes her blunt knife in his chest and exaggerates her claim to make her sound ridiculous by answering in affirmative that the only plan he had, was not to drink coffee alone. No one should decline such an invite.

Next scene begins as they both enter his place in complete darkness. They are playing a game. They are playing hide and seek. Just the adult version of it. He sees her silhouette in the dark and moves in closer to her. She objects to his moves and tells him to back off. It is the match point. After all this banter, he cannot lose now. He keeps on closing the gap towards her and says he has something important to disclose. She moves back teasing him all the while. He asks for her ear to disclose. She presents her ear. He hits the match point. He says there is no coffee in the house.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mte2yt/review/

I feel some sort of urgency to start doing this kind of stuff before I get much older, I don't want to be in my 30's and a virgin (not that there's anything wrong with that, this is just my personal goal).

However, I'm not really interested in simply having one-night stands, or going out to bars. I'm really just interested in having a relationship with someone. I don't know how realistic this is, though. I feel like quite a flawed person. I don't think I'd be attractive to somebody I'd like, as I'm physically stick-thin and my social skills are a work in progress. Both of these things, I think, would give off the impression to someone that I'm ""weak"". I'm also kind of a weird person, which can be a good thing, but also means I don't fit in with a lot of people, I feel like an alien sometimes just talking about normal things. 

I like being financially responsible, I don't care about going out to meet girls at a bar, but it seems like that's the norm. As someone in my position, should I try dating apps? Or should I try to meet people in person? I've heard people say that you should focus on yourself first, and ""the girls will come"", but I don't really understand how that works. I can work on my own life, achieving my goals, making money, but I still won't have any dating experience unless I practice.

I decided to download the apps months ago and I‚Äôve gone on ‚Äúdates‚Äù with people twice in that time.  

the first guy, we went on about six dates (walking around in the park or driving around together because of Covid, but still a decent chunk of hours spent together) and then he asked me if I would consider ‚Äúdating‚Äù him. in my mind, this meant that we were exclusive and he was probably a boyfriend. but no, I saw later that he updated his Tinder. we continued going on a few dates but he eventually told me he wasn‚Äôt over his ex so we parted ways.   

few months later, started going on dates with a new guy. we‚Äôve been talking for two months, hung out a bunch, and he asked me recently if I‚Äôd ‚Äúdate‚Äù him.

So iv been dating someone for the last month and iv realised shes not for me, however she is really keen on me.

Since getting to know her its become clear she is suffering with some issues, she has borderline personality disorder and is also suffering with depression and she regularly binges on coke and alcohol when she has bad days and i cant have that in my life.

Yesterday she was talking about how shes been feeling suicidal and doesnt want to be here and she feels like noones there for her but says when shes with me i make all her worries go away. The thing is, i know shes not right for me and i dont want a relationship with her but feel like if i have the conversation with her it will probably trigger her to spiral out of control again and at the moment i havent ended it yet out of guilt.

I need advice to on how to let her down gently, below is a template of roughly what im going to say to her. Please help me with the best course of action.

""I've been doing a bit of thinking, since we met eachother iv enjoyed every second of you in my life, you're funny, caring, kind hearted with a beautiful soul and I've been blessed to meet you. 

Within the few weeks of getting to know each other its become clear to me that we live opposite lives and i dont think we're the right match for a relationship with eachother. We've both got alot going on at the moment and have some self improvement to do, you're going through depression and battling drink and cocaine binges and I've just lost my mum, i don't think i can be there for you the way you need me to be, i cant even be there for myself at the moment, i just dont think we're right for each other.

The problem is, it already happened some other times with past relationships, whenever I start hanging out officially with a girl, I start getting kinda down, thinking things like ""Is this really what you want?"" and bad things like that :(

Before we started dating I looked at his photos and our chating, and always though ""oh man, if I can date that girl I'll be very happy, she's awesome"". But then here we are, now I look at her photos and think ""ah man, there's something wrong, is this really what I wanted?"" and things like that, and I don't have a clue why this happens...

Whether you are looking for something serious, a friend with benefits, or fuck buddy, why is it so hard to find consistency?

I (30F) had a pretty good physical relationship going with a guy (36M) I met in August of last year. We established early on that we didn't see anything serious happening between us but that we were pretty sexually compatible. I told him that as long as he communicated with me if he couldn't keep this going anymore for ANY reason, that I didn't have a problem with just having a physical relationship. We're both adults with jobs and lives, things happen, I get it. He was pretty good at communicating at the beginning, if he needed to reschedule due to work and such he'd let me know.  But last weekend he texted me on Saturday night and asked to see me on Sunday. I agreed. Sunday came and I didn't hear from him. I texted him asking him if he had changed his mind. I never received a response.

I'm sure people will say ""well he doesn't owe you anything."" Maybe not. But we had more than one discussion about communication and he had no problem sending me a text before about things coming up.

I was curious what sex with someone else would be like, since he was my first and only. A couple weeks pass by and I match with a charming 26 year old man who is very good looking and also just looking for sex. We meet up talk a bit and had amazing sex and a nice conversation after. We chat and sext a bit in between, it feels nice to be admired sexually again. This repeats a few times. Last friday was the last time and it was crazy intense. 

He sent me a strava link to his account to tease me about the fact he had been working on his condition. I, nosey person, scroll through his profile and see pictures of him cycling with his child. Yeah, a child. I confronted him and he confessed he had a wife and newborn child. We had spoken about past relationships and I realised his wife was his ‚Äòex‚Äô he was talking about, the who he had incredibly little sex with... I am feeling so so sorry for her. I can‚Äôt imagine bearing your husband a child and recovering from giving birth and your husband lies in bed with another woman. I told him I was very displeased about his dishonesty since I feel like he let me violate my own moral rules without me knowing. I would never have slept with him had I known this and so I said I could not see him anymore. He said he would really miss me but thanked me for giving him insight about how he was a bad husband. 

How is that an insight I can give him instead of him realising himself? How can a grown up man get home to his wife and children each night and still download tinder and fuck a girl on the side?

52,mti32w,1618769491,Why would girl not be interested even though she grinded and danced with me?,"So I went out yesterday and I just got broken up with by someone I was seeing for like 3-4 months and really liked, and even though we weren‚Äôt even a thing it still hurt lol.

That‚Äôs just some context but I‚Äôm saying this to say that I wasn‚Äôt really looking to do anything extra but it just happened. She was a friend that someone else brought as a +1 and long story short at clubs or certain parties sometimes you basically dry hump in each other like while dancing. Like we danced and I know she felt my dick when she was grinding on me and she asked me my name and all that, but my friend talked to them after and she said that she was just looking to dance and isn‚Äôt really interested interested.

I tried kissing her a couple times (1-3) and what I do is basically tilt there head with my hands and if they let me i take that as a green light, but she would let me tilt her head but didn‚Äôt really want to go in to makeout or anything. I just shrugged it off and kept dancing with her but I didn‚Äôt even take it as a rejection tbh bc I was just tryna go for extra. I‚Äôd still just grab her butt and waist and I just gave her a kiss on the cheek just like playfully.

She was the one who started dancing with me and her friend would place her in my lap too lol (the friend ultimately I feel like is the decider haha). Anyways I asked if she wanted to give me her Instagram or Snapchat, she gave me her Snapchat, we danced on and off throughout the night and that was pretty much it. She did dance with one other guy and I did dance with another girl too as well, but like it was only one for like one song or something.

I don‚Äôt honestly care about this girl specifically but I‚Äôm trying to understand why you would let a guy hump her (when I‚Äôm hard too), but not really be interested enough for a kiss.

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, at this point I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth trying anymore.
I can‚Äôt tell you how mentally debilitating it is to constantly be ghosted. I‚Äôm on the brink of giving up on dating until the climate changes, though I don‚Äôt know if it ever will.

58,mtij3s,1618770842,Leveling the playing field with abundance,"One of the most common complaints from men is the seemingly impossible task of online dating. Worse yet is that online dating is creeping into regular life, any woman you encounter is likely to have hundreds of men to choose from on the app on her phone. This creates a bit of a brutal environment for most men. We‚Äôve all seen the complaints here and many of us have experienced it first hand. It seeming less and less like a realistic expectation or a ‚Äúwinnable battle‚Äù and more like an impossible task that we may as well step away from. I personally recently came to the conclusion that I wasn‚Äôt willing to play this game like that. What we need as men is abundance to match what we‚Äôre up against. How are we supposed to ‚Äúkeep cool and confident‚Äù when our efforts are fruitless? How are we supposed to be motivated for dating when it seems like most women have easy access to whoever they want? 

Now we‚Äôve all also encountered some women we‚Äôd rather not be with. Whatever we perceive as wrong with her whether it‚Äôs less attraction, world views, maybe she thinks the earth is flat, whatever the reason we‚Äôve deemed her unworthy doesn‚Äôt matter all that much. What does matter is that this woman is our version of a hundred ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù guys that women always have liking them on dating apps. They constantly have tons of choices but they say the choices are low quality. A remedy for this situation is quite simply engage with the less than desirable girl while also pursuing the girls you actually see yourself with. Whether you‚Äôre having sex with her or not and to whatever extent you find she helps you, she will add abundance to your game. Having access to dates, sex, comfort, completely changes the outlook going into dating and allows us to meet these women on their level. She‚Äôs not replying? Neither am I I‚Äôm getting laid tonight. One word answers? I got a paragraph from this other girl I‚Äôll respond to that one word later when I feel like it. She ghosted me? Who? Not the girl I‚Äôm smashing tonight that‚Äôs for sure. 

By maintaining abundance we can meet women on the same level: I have other stuff going on, I can‚Äôt respond that fast, oh sorry I forgot to respond. Are we not tired of that nonsense? I certainly was. I‚Äôll be damned if the only thing going on in my dating life is some online inflated value women ignoring me. I may catch some hate for this because of emotions and stuff but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to someone looking for a genuine relationship. This is to play the game, to meet them on their level.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtij3s/leveling_the_playing_field_with_abundance/
59,mtin4o,1618771198,Is she interested?,"So I (26M) met this girl (31F) on a dating app. She's actually the one who reached out to me. We have so much in common, she's gorgeous, we have the same religious beliefs, etc. We got along so well that we stayed up until 3am just talking and getting to know each other (even though I had a date with another girl the next day, and I just couldn't connect with my date because I was thinking about this new girl the whole time). If I believed in soulmates, I think this would be her.

So she's at least an 8 hour drive from me. But she has family who lives closer to me that she visits somewhat regularly, so we plan for her to go to her family's and then meet up halfway in about a month (March 20). We talk all day, every day. Some red flags: she's divorced, she has two kids, she suffered a brain injury back in highschool (car accident left her comatose).

So March 19 finally arrived, and she neglected to get a babysitter for her kids. The family she would've been visiting already had plans. Her ex wouldn't have been available until after work, at which point it would be too late to drive that 4 hour halfway point. 

Should I have ended it there?
So after her ex got off work, she went out drinking with her girlfriends that she hadn't seen in 7 months (coincidence?). She felt really bad about missing our date, she had a really bad hangover the next day, we didn't speak much. Which I was fine with because I was super bummed out and didn't want to talk.

I ask when the next time she'd be able to go out would be, she says the end of April for certain but she wants to figure out something sooner.

Then I notice our conversations get shorter. Around 4pm she typically goes silent, I presume to help her kids with homework (one has ADHD). We last speak March 24, our main method of contact is snapchat. March 27 she still hasn't even opened my last message. I text her phone number, I get a reply from her number from someone identifying as her brother. She had left her phone at her brother's house and she was going to get it back on March 28. So I text her number again March 29, no reply. She then messages me through Instagram. She didn't want to text my number because she doesn't want my number in her ex's phone (reasonable). She was afraid I would believe she had ghosted me. So everything's fine. I message her through Instagram March 31, message remains unread.

I message her through Instagram April 2 because someone read my Snapchat message to her. I messaged her Instagram again April 9. Today is April 18, I haven't heard from her in two and a half weeks.
According to Instagram, her account was active on April 4 and April 16, my messages remain unread.

Like I said, if I believed in soulmates, I think this girl would be mine. I'm more open and myself with her than anyone else. Since the beginning we've talked about taking things slow, but at the same time we became so comfortable that we started calling each other ""babe"" by accident, so we mutually decided to call each other ""babe"". But after talking all day, every day for a month to not talking at all for two weeks is jarring. My gut tells me I'm being ghosted. Dating-wise, I have little experience. But I'm trying to grow up and mature, I try to understand things happen. I tell myself ""if it doesn't make sense why she would ghost you, there's a logical explanation for why she's not talking to you"". Why would she message me through Instagram if she was ghosting me? But at the same time, if she indeed has a method of communicating with me, why isn't she?

Am I being paranoid? Am I putting too much hope into some girl I've never even met yet? 

So if supposedly, she wanted to try a date at the end of April because that's the next time she's visiting family, that's when she'd get her phone back right? So do I give up hope after May 1?

(like an insane amount of effort). So I do get matches. Yesterday I had an in person coffee date with this woman who's a first year doctor. Coffee date was an hour and a half. We were vibing, but it felt like a job interview, but whatever. I could tell she liked me a lot though.

She just moved to California for her job, and she says she knows no one outside of work.

Here's the issue:

I've had a lot of adversity in my life (expensive health and other issues.) I'm honestly a loser with little dating experience. I'm 32 years old, and I'm currently living at home with mom. I have no debt, but I don't make much money either. I've sorta had a rough past (and present), whereas her past appears to be very privileged (not judging, but she went to top tier private universities) and traveled excessively.

I feel like we're mentally on the same wave length with the difference being she made extremely good decisions and I have made horrible ones.

I'm currently a substitute teacher working a long term assignment till the end of the year for special needs kids (I've been working at the HS for 2 years).  I have applied for the credential program as of a week ago.  I'm confident I'll get accepted, but I am having cold feet about it.

I've heard advice of being unapologetically myself, but I'm pretty sure as soon as I tell her I'm 32 living with my mom and working as a sub, she's going to poof like the wind. And I sure as fuck don't blame her.

What would you do if you were me?

My pros:

I've lost 75 lbs and workout daily

No debt, but no money either

Authentically kind

Cons:

Live at home with parents

61,mtir9q,1618771554,My ex talking stage has a new girlfriend that he treats so much better than me,"So in July 2020, this guy (19M) and I (20F) were in a talking stage that lasted three weeks or so. Bear in mind, he was the second guy I had ever talked to in a romantic manner, so I was very, very inexperienced in that department. We were both completely infatuated with each other, but during that talking stage, he treated me awfully and did not respect me at all. Some notable examples would be: he called me a liar because I told him that I didn‚Äôt find wrestling interesting but I thought his interest in it was cool, he begged for butt pictures after I told him no three separate times, and he joked and said ‚Äúwell I have two grandmas‚Äù after I told him that he was so lucky to have a grandma and I wished that I had one as both of them are not a part of my life anymore, which resulted in me crying as it stung so much. In addition, he also treated me like an object by having entire conversations where he would only excessively compliment me and talk about what he wanted to do to me sexually and romantically. Overall he was a really shitty person, so I ended things with him and then ghosted him. After I did this, I tried moving on to different guys, but it turns out that he affected me more than I realized, so I had to stop dating for 3 months. In December of 2020, I made the mistake of being curious to see what he was up to on social media. I found out that he got into a relationship with a girl that he had been seeing since September of 2020 and it made me feel like complete shit because he seems to be treating her so better than me and he treats her like a person, meanwhile he treated me like an object. It also made me feel like complete shit because I still haven‚Äôt been able to find someone yet and he has. I admit I wasn‚Äôt perfect either in that talking stage and I definitely do not want him back, but it still hurts my self esteem to this day. It makes me feel that I am easy and am only worth being seen as an object to a man, not to be seen as a person with thoughts and feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtir9q/my_ex_talking_stage_has_a_new_girlfriend_that_he/

63,mtiyh4,1618772170,What can I do to tell/show my girlfriend that I‚Äôm only interested in/am loyal to her?,"(For context we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship) 

My girlfriend is fucking amazing and I truly love her with my heart. She‚Äôs sexy, passionate, strong willed, confident, and cares a lot about others. That‚Äôs why I love her (I could write an entire essay about my love for her but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre here for).

The thing is that my girlfriend has trust issues and sometimes compares herself to other girls in a negative way. She would sometimes say that I‚Äôm talking to other girls (when in reality she‚Äôs pretty much the only girl I talk to regularly aside from my mom), I can go ahead and have sex with other girls near here if I want (which I will ABSOLUTELY never do because I love and respect my girl enough to not take advantage of our distance like that. Plus, fuck cheaters and fuck cheating, cheaters can go fuck themselves), and she‚Äôll sometimes think that I prefer other girls (when I actually just want her). 

I‚Äôve told her this before: I don‚Äôt care if there are other hotter girls out there with a nice body, a lot of money, etc. If they‚Äôre not my girlfriend, then fuck em. I only want my girlfriend and she‚Äôs genuinely one of the best things to happen to me in life. I love and appreciate her so much and I‚Äôm truly grateful that she‚Äôs in my life.  But if I‚Äôm being honest, it does pain me and gets sort of exhaustive of her thinking that I like/am talking to other girls or whatever. I trust her fully and I have faith in her. I don‚Äôt question her loyalty because I know that that‚Äôs not who she is. 

There are also days where she asks if I want to break up or end it because I don‚Äôt respond on time (due to my job) and she does get pretty sad sometimes, saying that I do the above when it‚Äôs never crossed my mind. She‚Äôs also told me that she‚Äôs clingy in a relationship and stuff so I‚Äôve kept that in mind and have showered her with praise and compliments. 

So what else can I do to help her understand that I‚Äôm loyal/faithful to her and her only?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtiyh4/what_can_i_do_to_tellshow_my_girlfriend_that_im/

 What‚Äôs the best way to practice no contact when we see each other 2-3 times a week to swap our son? 

Backstory of our relationship:

I‚Äôm constantly trying to self improve myself and have no contact with her. She did me dirty many times and I kept taking her back so they made her lose all respect for me. So I left her and I tried no contact for 3 months before we had settled custody in court and I had my son full time and she went insane she unfollowed every guy on her social media and was begging for me back and her arousal towards me was insanely heightened, she would send me sexy pics(something she never did before) and tell me how horny she was for me (this was after we got back together after I had no contact for 3 months)That‚Äôs when I realized the power of no contact and not giving a fuck what she does. She had never done anything like that and before I tried no contact I would constantly blow up her phone asking where she was and things like that and she would ignore me. We got back together for a couples months and I started acting beta again not holding my frame and she began disrespecting me again so we broke up.

82,mtlcq9,1618779545,Work hard on myself or just go for it?,"I am a recent grad from university (M24). I pretty much have no dating life. Though this wasn‚Äôt always true. 

Till around a year ago, I always had attention from ladies. I was a university student. Money didn‚Äôt really matter. I worked out a lot so I looked great and had a buzzing social life. I had an extensive dating life throughout 4 years at university. Kind person who‚Äôs easy to get along with. Popular within my circles. 

Fast forward to now. I own two businesses. One is e-commerce &amp; one recruitment within the financial world. Both doing well, but it‚Äôs early days so I don‚Äôt have a lot of money, and then when I do the money goes towards my family and investments. I still work out but it‚Äôs been tough with the pandemic - I don‚Äôt feel as confident in myself as I once did. I come from a single parent family so living at home with mum &amp; sister can be tough. Not a lot of space for myself &amp; certainly not for a girlfriend. The pandemic has literally killed my social life. My Instagram has been deactivated for the past 4 months and I‚Äôm finding it tough to keep in contact with friends. In all honesty I‚Äôve lost a lot of confidence and am a little bit upset with myself/depressed (self diagnosed). 

I work hard, I can definitely see a brighter future for my family and myself. I always put them first and I work hard for a better life. I‚Äôm at a stage where I have no time for a girlfriend. In addition, I‚Äôm just not a catch with the ladies anymore. My social life has decreased dramatically &amp; due to the gyms closing I just feel a lot less confident in myself (lost some gainzz). I live with my mum and honestly can‚Äôt afford to take girls out on fancy dates (this wasn‚Äôt expected from student partners). 

My question is: Am I just loathing in a pool of self pity? Am I just making excuses? Should I just try my best to find a partner with my current situation? 

OR Is it a case of having to stay patient, get back into the gym routine, fix my financial situation, feel better about myself before trying to go after women.

86,mtlpg7,1618780606,I‚Äôm worried my standoffish nature at the beginning has been misinterpreted as disinterest in being more than platonic friends OR he's not interested?,"Hi everyone, so I get nervous at first about physical contact to the point where I think this guy thinks I‚Äôm not interested. We went on 3 dates and I realize I kept things super platonic, I never flirt at all, I insisted on paying, and my body language hasn‚Äôt been open to kissing/hugging.

The truth is I‚Äôm just nervous, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to be physical with him, I just haven‚Äôt been physical with a guy in a long time.

I also have some insecurities about my looks, although i think I‚Äôm fairly attractive and this guy has gone out with me 3 times so I guess he probably thinks I‚Äôm cute?

I think there were a few occasions where he would‚Äôve kissed me ‚Äî for example, on our second date, he was dropping me off and kind of lingering in the car (parked in front of my house but was making more conversation and asking what I‚Äôm doing the rest of the night), and I was super nice and was just like ‚Äúok I‚Äôm going to bed now, bye!!‚Äù and hopped out of the car.

The time after that, he came to my house and I just kept putting us in platonic atmospheres and never suggested watching a movie or even sitting down... I just suggested like sitting on the balcony and playing cards, ugh!!

I think he‚Äôs written me off, and rightfully so. I haven‚Äôt reached out to him at all and we last texted a week ago, the day after our third date. I was thinking of sending a text apologizing for treating him so platonically and explaining I am interested, I just take a bit longer than normal to warm up to people.

Should I send that type of text or is that a massive turn off?

I joked about having a few beers beforehand for the first time in 5 months as I was nervous beforehand. Her response was ""Does that make you threat üòÇ"". I saw that as her having a joke at the time. My response was ""I hope not üòÇ. anyway are you down for meeting up"" something along those lines. Her response ""online is fine lol"". I still thought we were joking still so my response was ""online ain't real life yoüòÇ"". She got offended as I was unfriended/unfollowed. I tried to apologise after that. She then said that she was serious about me being a threat because I had been drinking again. Bearing in mind. I had never hanged out with her ever and I've never been a big drinker

I take things like that very seriously and I said some harsh things that I shouldn't of done in response to that. None of it was threating tho. No guy needs that stigma over them, especially in todays age so I then Immediately blocked her on everything wanting to remove myself from the situation. I could of handled things better as I don't know what her past is. I won't be unblocking her and will be staying as far away as I possible can. I then had her cousin messaging me making even more paranoid. That as objective as I can be about it.

I don't have twitter but I found she had taken to twitter after. saying the following"" There‚Äôs always gotta be one person that takes your friendliness as a sign of something more, and then turn nasty when you reject them do not ‚Äòwaste your time if you think it means I‚Äôll date you.""

Her version of event's were so false. I criticized her over her baseless claims that I was threat for no reason. Not at her for saying no. You then had her army of online yes men telling her how special and wonderful she is. Her tweet got liked 70 times and retweeted 10 times. I was shocked at how easy it is fool people online without telling the full story.

My conclusion is people who write contrived one sided stories on social media just because you've blocked them for good reasons are pathetic insecure individuals. It's like well done you've managed to fool 60+ people who have never met you before. Never trust a smear campaign.

91,mtm0n2,1618781572,How can I help myself accept the fact real love or relationships may not be in it for me?,"Hi there, 20 year old M here.

I won‚Äôt bore you with an entire life story so I‚Äôll try to somewhat get to the point.

Had some minor succes in high school, one girlfriend of 8 months and one of 2 months, the latter being a shitshow., the first one her admitting she stayed with me the last few months she did so ‚Äúout of pity‚Äù a few years later. Outside of making out, nothing sexual. A date with some crazy chick suffering from schizo or something when I was 18-19 which ended in a fight, and 3 dates since yesteryear.

The first girl I clicked with amazingly, or so I thought. We basically acted like were together already and made plans of eventually moving in together, but she ended up ghosting me leaving me broken as hell only to show up a bit more then half a year later on Bumble to apologize to me for that.

Second girl, acted really lovey and sexy from time to time, but ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù for a relationship one day, then she was ‚Äúmaybe ready‚Äù the next. Broke it off because I hated the emotional rollercoasters.

Latest girl I vibed with amazingly, super long and insightful text conversations every day. Our first date last week was what I felt like a bit dry, but we ended up making out a bit before she left for the train and we hugged. I felt super upbeat and happy after that, surely that‚Äôs a very positive sign right? Nope.

We met up again yesterday, she was even willing to come drive to my place which was amazing, never had a girl put in that effort for me. Planned  some Netflix, 2 walks at different locations and a nice dinner but she was pretty quiet and hard to talk to. 3 hours into our date she told me it just felt platonic to her and that she doesn‚Äôt feel a spark.

I told her I obviously didn‚Äôt wanna hold her up, so we had some tea and she left after 30 mins, later offering my via text to still be friends and hang out as such because ‚Äúit clicked so well on that regard!‚Äù.

You guys, I‚Äôm sick of dating and considering not getting on apps anymore and say fuck it and be that 30 year old loveless virgin 9 years from now. It always ends up in a whole lot of nothing, heartbreak, sadness and depression. I‚Äôm done re-introducing myself to someone every 2 months and getting to know them with it eventually leading to nothing.

But I wanna change that, I wanna get over those feelings and switch of those feelings and move on as quickly as possible. I wanna accept love is not in it for me after a ton of attempts over the years and that I‚Äôm at most a good friend for most woman. Not in a negative way, but in a realistic way.

How do I go about that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtm0n2/how_can_i_help_myself_accept_the_fact_real_love/
92,mtm6ch,1618782069,Second date,"So went on a second date with a girl this Saturday. We ate breakfast, mini golf and walked around down town from 10:30-4pm. When got in her car to head back I held her hand, hugged her and kissed her twice on the lips and when I hugged her again and leaned in for a kiss I kissed her on the cheek.

My question is she into me or am I just overthinking this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtm6ch/second_date/

97,mtmkme,1618783317,Tinder. Men vs women,"Let me preface this story by saying I don‚Äôt have problems with Tinder itself. The concept is there, you make of it what you want.

However, I found that men have a way harder time on Tinder and I wanted to actually see and experience how using Tinder was and got inspired by a post on r/instagramreality about a guy that used the FaceApp to make himself look like a woman.

I used Tinder myself throughout the years and sure I got matches but nothing out of the ordinary.

So.. I took 3 pictures of myself and converted myself to look like a woman. Just the usual feminine features long hair, some basic make up and some fuller lips. I completed my profile with some basic stuff but didn‚Äôt even put something in my bio.

I swiped for maybe 30-40 minutes and then stopped swiping by the evening I had over 40 matches. Throughout the day I checked on my messages regularly.
Sure I wasn‚Äôt picky when I was swiping but I got matched with some fairly looking dudes even! You may be wondering about conversations‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to waste time for myself nor for other people so I kept it short. However, a good chunk, around 10, initiated a conversation within the hour or so. Some where original and appealing, most where average (a simple hi or gif saying hi) and 1 was just all around bad that I rolled my eyes upon reading it.

My take away? Yes, women have it way easier on dating apps and the attention/validation seeking that many men seem to pick up on seems obvious. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all sunshine and roses. Picking your way through a bombardement of men is exhausting too. You also get the feeling men just swipe every girl to the right. Because of the above it gets old rather quickly. For men, a deviation from a simple hi or gif seems like a good choice but don‚Äôt go over the top either avoid the ‚ÄúHi beauty‚Äù comments (should be common knowledge but then again I got them as a man looking like a girl)

98,mtmlc9,1618783376,Guys who don‚Äôt get matches: are you using the paid version?,"So I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about men complaining they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúmatches‚Äù and I‚Äôm curious about something. Are you guys using the paid version of whatever app you‚Äôre using that allows you to see your likes? Because if you‚Äôre getting likes but not matches, there‚Äôs probably something in that to think about. 

As an illustration, I have ~1000 likes on my Tinder but I‚Äôve only matched with about 25 because a lot of guys like me but I‚Äôm looking for a particular type of guy that is hard to find in my area (sweet and nerdy but cute‚Äî basically not some fish pic guy). If I only went by matches, I‚Äôd think guys didn‚Äôt like me. When I can see the whole picture, it‚Äôs just that there aren‚Äôt a lot of guys I like (or they‚Äôre not on Tinder).
