Here's a little background info:
We're in the same friend circle, and she's the ""attractive magnet""; all of the seven guys in our circle have, at some point, have been attrected to her one way or the other (we've both attracted our fair share of people, but neither of us have been in a commited relationship). When I first started making moves and talking to her about a year ago, I could tell she wasn't really into it, sending mixed signs, not really opening up, etc. Because of that, I took a lot of time to really think if she really was worth my time in terms of dating (she's really nice and a good friend to everyone). However, I couldn't stop thinking that she's the one, and she's perfect for me (some people have mistaken us for a couple/said we'd make a good couple... maybe it's just because we're both Asian or something).

Lately, however, we've been talking a fair bit, and she seems into it, and at some point, we started sending memes to each other. Usually, the memes are something we thought was funny or relateable. Most recently, she sent several memes with a romantic touch... I don't mean anything too wild, but they were kinda out of her style of things and seemed a little awkward coming from her. I don't know if she's trying to say anything with those memes, and I needed the advice of older, wiser people.

Just for context, I'm 25, been on a lot of first dates and this is the first time I got rejected.

So I met this girl on Tinder, she is cute and really cool, we hit it off immediately. Been texting for a few days, got to know each other a little bit, I made a joke about ""we should go out and do something"", and she said ""Are you finally asking me out ;)"", and this was after 4 days of texting, pretty fast in my experience. 

Naturally, this was a really good sign for me, she was really eager to go out with me, we were hitting it off on text, and so, like the idiot I am, I thought ""Oh, I got this, the date is just going to be a formality, I basically can't fuck this up"".

So we went out, got some coffee to go, sat by the lake and talked for 2 hours. It was a beautiful afternoon, I made her laugh, we talked about our lives, our hopes and dreams, there was never a dull moment. After 2 hours it was getting cold, so we walked to the bus station, said goodbye, talk to you soon and I went home. 

Sounds like a perfect first date, doesn't it? It certainly sounded like all the other first dates I had and all of them were successful, so I thought everything went well. 

So after a couple of hours I got home, and sent her a text saying I had a great time, would've been better if not for the wind but oh well, what can you do. And she sent back a really long text saying that she had a really nice time too, she said that I'm a great person and the 2 hours flew by, but she doesn't think we're compatible, it's not you it's me, I don't want to waste your time and stuff like that.

Obviously I was pretty confused, so I wrote that what she said kind of caught me off guard, I really had a great time and really like you, hope I didn't do something to make you uncomfortable. To which she said that I didn't do anything wrong and she's really sorry but her gut is telling her that this doesn't have a future. To which I really didn't have anything else to say, other than ""Alright, well it was nice hanging out with you, good luck""

I know the obvious answer is she didn't like me physically - I'm not trying to jerk myself off here, but I'm a decently handsome guy, and all the pictures she's seen of me were very clear so she had a very good idea of what I looked like before we ever met. 

I don't know, I'm trying not to overthink it, I just think it's really weird. I don't know what I could've done that made her go from 'can't wait to go out' to 'not gonna happen' in the span of 2 hours. If I came across as an asshole, she wouldn't have bothered writing me the nice and long rejection message, she would've just ghosted me. Maybe there was something that I told her about myself that she didn't like, it's possible but most of the important stuff I already told her over text. 

I know this sounds like someone who just can't accept the fact that someone doesn't like him so now he's going on a tirade to soothe his ego. But it's really not like that. I just feel really bad, I'm worried that I did something bad and I don't want that to happen again. I feel like this girl was really excited to meet me, and now I've somehow disappointed her.

As I'm writing this, I realize the bigger problem is I just have trouble accepting the fact that people can like you one day and then suddenly change their mind the next, over the dumbest things, or for no reason at all. It's just one of those things I guess, you have to accept it and move on.  I might have done something horrible, or maybe not, I'll never know, so there is no point losing sleep over it. Still gonna post, maybe someone can offer some insight or take away something useful from this experience. Who am I kidding, nobody is gonna read this

If things immediately pop off and feel like 
a fire work that dwindles over time that’s a HUGE warning sign. HOWEVER not all love bombers follow the same course of action. The impatient types will pop off immediately but their patient counterparts will take a more subtle approach and play the long game.

The **impatient types**  can be sussed out within the first three dates if you keep objectivity. In my experience, these types are extremely arrogant and superficial with their charm. Here are a couple red flags that stood out: they bombard you with compliments, say will outright you’re amazing and/or claim you’re the best date of their life; they divulge personal information ASAP to gain your trust and reference future plans that include you, such as meeting friends and family etc; they are extremely complimentary during the date and make follow up plans in quick succession, on subsequent dates they may adopt a drastically different demeanour and begin to neg you if things are progressing fast enough. In an effort to move things along, they may offer up commitment too soon. If you’re a dead end,  they will likely immediately discard you. 

The latter more **patient types** are tricker to spot because they’re calm, cool and collected. In my experience, they are far more subtle and insidious. 
These were the red flags I missed: they rarely share any personal information about themselves, and redirect the conversation and/or deflect any personal questions back to you; they listen WAY more than they speak, to figure out your shadow self for best manipulation practices (ex: you speak highly of your academic achievements so they compliment your intellect); they preform acts of service to build a false sense of intimacy, to distract you from how shallow your connection really is! Another warning sign, the relationship doesn’t progress in: emotional intimacy, trust, and vulnerability despite going steady for months. By the time you figure out something is ‘off’ you’re usually hooked and therefore, more prone to stick around because you’ve fallen for their facade’. Assuming you’re serving a purpose to them (sex, services or supply) they’ll likely use intermittent reinforcement techniques to suck you back in: switching back to their facade, ignoring you then flooding you with attention, gifts &amp; compliments etc,

N during that time, I've been in one 3years relationship and she's been in 3, the last one also ended after 3 years, so during our friendship in college we've never both been single at the same time. We're really close and cherish each other platonically on the outside, at least for me. She's has really put me in the friendzone absolutely. To the point that she's too comfortable in being friends with me without worrying abt crossing any line. 

I myself on the other hand, have been secretly in love with her for 7 years. And I'm not proud to say this, but even during my past relationship, the feelings didn't actually went away, just subconsciously disguised as me being caring towards her as a friend. I mean, I loved my ex at the time with all my heart, but I can't stand the fact of not knowing what's happening in her life at the same time. 

Anyway, I'm a people pleaser with the lowest self esteem so I've covered up my feelings quite excellently and played along with the platonic nature of our friendship. And it has reached to the point of we're both comfortable with each other to care enough like the bare minimum amount of how couples should take care of each other, without the romantic nature. I don't wanna lose that, would do anything to preserve that, but at the same it ACHES me to not being able to do more,to give more, to love more, to express all out and sincerely all the things I've been thinking about her, wishing to do with her, to share with her. To spend the rest of my life with her. It hurts so, so bad. 

And just recently, I found out she has broken up. But unfortunately I never heard anything from her. Because despite being best friends, love life is one of the aspects of our life that we agreed to keep to ourselves. And I found tht out abt a month after breakup. 

She's keeping herself busy with her job, and now she's REALLY in kpop group to the point of making them her whole life. Just basic overcompensating the exes voids. And even now, she hasn't shared anything regarding that with me. Kinda bum me out since friends are supposed to ne sharing about each others' heart break. 

My dilemma right now is being friends while deeply in love with her is the hardest thing yet for me. 
1. I could just not risking the friendship, and continuing what we have now, but I'll be forever eaten alive inside coz I know I'll be forever in love with her and without closure, I'll be left hanging n constantly asking the ""why"" and the ""what ifs""
2. I could confess to her, and she rejected me, but now that she sees I actually have feelings and hoping something out of her, she'll be hesitant to continue the ""platonic"" friendship anymore. Hence, ruining the friendship
3. I'll confess to her, she turn me down, but demanding to stay friends like usual. And considering it's a 7 year crush and being in love, I KNOW I'm not strong enough at all to just man up through that, and hence again, ruining the friendship. 

She never sees me in the light of potential mate. I'm very sure of that.. So it kinda kills whatever acts of love I gave her all these while. So what do I do? We live across the country from each other now, so our only mean of communication is by textings. Which makes it harder coz she's a dry texter as well. No room for further bonding... I know I'm being 70% unreasonable and overthinking. But she's just that great of a girl to be crazy n unreasonable to.

My mistake was suggesting she'd pay for the 2nd date, then pull away from her when we couldn't go out right away and strongly hint at seeing other women (trying not to put all my eggs in one basket) to make her jealous. I also use to tease her to get her to open up more as well. I found out she gives up way too easily and also closes up emotionally so this backfired badly and I haven't had the courage to break the silence for about a month now.

Despite her emotional flaws, she's pretty much got a lot of potential for what I'm wanting in a long term partner. A lot of the girls I've talked to do not have these qualities: family oriented, reserved, sweet, still believes in love, wants kids, folks still together, healthy relationship with family.

The first time he ghosted me, he got in touch at the end of that week telling me he was swamped and he was super excited to talk so I gave him a chance having seen that but this time, I have gone completely cold... I know some people need space during the week when they work and I'm ok with that; in fact I'm much busier than him even though he works full time but I want him to communicate that to me and not leave me in the dark! But at the same time, doesn't matter how busy you are, if you care you can just send a single message to show the person they're important.

He just messaged me after almost 3 days but I am so turned off I don't even wanna talk to him. I really thought this is going somewhere cause we clicked instantly, we are very alike but also very different, our cultures are super similar.

Why does this keep happening??? I have been single for 3 years now for this very shit show. I've never been the type to play games and definitely not now.

I feel like such a freak. I’ve had sexual partners that have lasted for about 6 months - 1 year differing from each relationship. 

But so far, I’ve never been in love – I don’t even think I have it within me to feel that way about someone. I feel so uncomfortable in relationships and I truly don’t think I’m cut out to be in one. I know everyone here is probably going to say “but you don’t need a SO to live a happy life!!” I’d beg to differ. It’s human nature to want companionship and as someone whose an only child, I’ve always been alone. So it’d be nice to find someone but I don’t think I ever will. 

I think even if I had the opportunity to be in a relationship, I’d sabotage it because it makes me so incredibly uncomfortable to be in a partnership. 

I feel uncomfortable when people buy me things. I don’t like the idea of having a joint bank account with someone. I’ve been through a fair share of bad experiences with men and I just don’t trust them anymore. I like having the bed all to myself. I don’t want to have someone there to influence my decisions in life. I have my moments of being sad because I’m single — but I’m not sure if I would be happy in a partnership either. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t want a relationship though. 

Worst part is how other people react when I tell them I’ve never really dated anyone. It’s a common topic that often comes up in your mid-20s and I always dread it when it does. I don’t like to talk about it with people because of how my friends in the past have reacted to me never dating. 

One of my friends asked me how long my longest relationship was and I told him I’d never been in one. He just widened his eyes and looked at me as if I had 10 heads. Then goes on to say “my longest relationship was 3 months” as if that was some big accomplishment. I’m so sick of having friends that judge me about it because it makes me feel even worse.

I know too many people that believed they would become happy and feel complete once they found someone, but even after finding said person, they still weren't happy, because they never knew how to be happy with themselves first.

Enjoy your life. Wake up and appreciate living comfortably in a society that gives you the tools to thrive and survive. Be glad you're being gifted another day to enjoy the finer luxuries and experience interactions with others. Take risks and try new challenges. Learn who you are as a person and become skilled at things that will make you marketable.

I'd rather see all of you develop talents that grant you economic freedom before you go running off looking for someone to jump into bed with.

I will do my best to sum up the issue instead. 

Me (F25) and my boyfriend (M25) have been together a year and a half and have been living together right over a year. I love him to death which is why I’m seeking outside, unbiased advice from any others. I want to learn how we can both work together to deeper understand each other and love through this. 

My SO and I have very similar interests and hobbies. So, we work great together. We do communicate with each other openly and respectfully. We don’t raise our voices and will normally approach the conversation letting the others know some time and attention to each other to listen is important. 

However, when it comes to our expression of love and our love languages... we communicate almost the exact opposite. 

1) I love deep, meaningful conversation and expression of love. He does not. 

EX: I’m the type to be falling asleep and say “Babe, you’re my favorite person and friend. You mean so much to me.” He will get awkward sometimes but will echo what I say or say he loves me. But he doesn’t go into detail when echoing me and he doesn’t initiate sweet convos. He has let Me know through open communication that , emotional conversations make him awkward. He says he isn’t good at expressing emotion like that. 

2) he says he is more one to show how he feels. I might take notice to him doing something once a month. 
EX: I’d had a tiring week like 6 weeks ago with working 6 days that week plus adding about 20 hours worth of schoolwork for college. He brought me a few roses, and when I saw them and looked at him after getting home, he told me he knew I’d been working hard and he was proud of me. 

This was the sweetest, and I truly appreciated it. But that’s the last thing he did to show how he cares. And I crave those conversations. 

I don’t want to add too much where it’s even more of a novel... but overall, just FYI we both have good sex drives and our sex life is pretty great, so I’m not worried about that part. 

And it’s not that I think he doesn’t love me honestly, but if any of you are strongly a Words of Affirmation love languages I feel that you’ll understand. I think he honestly just lets time get by him before thinking to do something. But it’s hard for someone who is talkative and open about emotions to figure out a solution saying a quiet guy who doesn’t like to get into emotional conversations about us. 

I love him so much, I just want some advice for ideas that we can both compromise. I’m really considering seeing a therapist, too.

please help out a guy out its obvious im below average in terms of looks, but how is it this hard to go on a date with a girl? in 5 hours I get 99 likes with men, once every 2 days with women. and I feel shitty doing this because I'm straight but I just like doing it to test out.

We are both single now, hooked up and spent the night together at a party last week. Haven’t texted since, but wondering if I should ask her out on a date

So a few months ago I (24M) met this girl (23F) that I get along with really well, we kind of hit it off instantly, talking a lot every time we would be at the same party (we have some mutual friends). Only thing is that we were both in committed relationships.

We both recently got out of our relationships, I broke up with my girlfriend and she got broken up with not too long ago either. We had chats about each other’s breakup, she feels sad about hers but respects the decision of her ex-boyfriend.

Last weekend I had a party at mine, she ended up joining with some friends. Again we started talking to each other most of the evening and things became quite flirty, a lot of physical contact, eye contact etc 

We ended up talking in my room, when she mentioned that a few weeks ago she kissed a guy that asked her out on a date as she was curious what it would be like to kiss someone else as she’s been in a relationship with the same guy for the last 3 years.

We continued chatting, and I couldn’t help but think that I was curious about kissing someone new too. I decided to go in for the kiss, we started making out quite aggressively and eventually got to 3rd base which she initiated. We then returned to the party, stayed quite close and very flirty.

As the party went on quite late, we ended up having lunch with her friends/flatmates at a restaurant, before everyone went home and she stayed over to sleep. We didn’t have sex, just cuddled and kissed before falling asleep. 

The next day I had plans, so she woke up and we kissed each other goodbye. I texted her to ask if she got home safe, to which she replied “yes, thank you for asking”, and I left it at that without us texting since (this was 4 days ago)

I’m now wondering: should I ask her out on a date? Or wait for her to text me before I make the next move?
On one hand we had a fun night together and get along great, and clearly there is some physical attraction between us. Our conversations are also very flirty (joking about how we’ll fall in love with each other, how she’s going to invite me to her home town etc).

On the other hand, we both recently got outside of relationships and a date might be too early for her. Maybe this was just a fun hookup/rebound as she likes the attention, as from what I’ve heard she’s always been a quite flirty person.

What do you think? Should I just accept this night as a bit of fun in my life as a single person, or ask her out on a date? Should I take the next step to text her even if she hasn’t reached out since when I asked her if she got home safe?

I was bummed out but I accepted it and just wanted to move on.

I haven’t dated anyone in 4 years. It’s only been hookups, fwb, acting like we’re dating but not actually dating, things like that. Every girl I asked to date me, which was like 4 girls, they all said no. I probably had sex &gt;5 a year on average these past 4 years since I graduated high school. 

PS: If you see numbers and you aren’t sure why they are there, add a (per cent sign after, it’ll make sense. My post was taken down automatically because I had them so I had to remove them. 

I’m just convinced I’m not good enough to date. I’m 6’0 130 lbs, tall but slim. Nice jawline decent/good face but I’m biracial so my features are mixed and I guess that’s throws off for girls. Slightly bulbous nose, so it’s skinny at the top but fat at the bottom. teeth are naturally pretty straight but I never had braces so they aren’t perfect or pretty white. 

I don’t want to be the guy anymore where girls are like no or I’ll give him a chance maybe then she ends up getting with another guy, ghosting me etc. I want to be in that t•p 20 attractiveness of guys so the attraction is obviously there so it’s just about finding the best person. 

Instead of chasing these girls and struggling I’m going to focus on improving myself. After all this time I know the areas where I need to improve. I started working out a couple weeks ago. I’m getting braces soon. I’m going to work a lot this summer and save up money to get a rhinoplasty around January. Once it heals I’ll get a nose ring too, not septum but nose ring. Next summer, summer 2022 I’ll save up to get tats from 2 high end tattoo artists around the following January. By that time I should be able to get my braces off and get my teeth professionally whitened and I will have been working out for 1.5 years so I should have put on 10-20 pounds of muscle. 

So in a 1.5 years I can have a prettier face: nose that better fits my face, nice white perfect teeth, in good shape with dope tats, earrings and nose ring. It’s partly so dating will be easier but partly just because I want to be more attractive and look the way I want to. 

I already have good hygiene and dress well with clothes that fit me. My haircut is kind of a basic fade so I’ll probably find something that looks nicer, fits me more but still easy to maintain. 

At that point I think I will be in the top 20 of guys for attractiveness at my university and I’d be a junior. My opinion on dating in university from experience is that most girls (70) aren’t trying to date, will only date if it’s a guy they really like. 20 already have boyfriends and 10 are saving themselves for the perfect guy. 

The problem with that 70 majority of girls who aren’t looking to date doing hookups stuff like that is they don’t do it with anybody. They only get with the t•p 20 of guys while the other 80 of guys are struggling to get anything. If you can get into that t•p 20 of guys you can have sex pretty regularly with different girls in college. One of my good friends, white guy nice face tall skinny. Big as*hole tbh. He was barely in that t•p 20 and he’d hookup pretty regularly with girls, maybe 2-3 I knew of every semester. Guys that were even better looking, like this buff white guy with his own apartment I knew, he slept with 10-20 ladies a semester. I met him because he was sleeping w one of my friends. I don’t think I could get to that level but if I did the stuff I listed earlier I think I could sleep with 4-6 girls a semester. 

Once I do these things and I’m attractive enough for girls to get with me regularly, I’m going to make up for this time. I’ll sleep with 20 chicks and I’ll only date when I find someone really special. I’m not going to forget how these girls treated me when I wasn’t good enough. I’ll just focus on getting body count up, having fun experiences, making connections and trying to find that special person. I feel like that’s what a lot of these girls do already, sleeping around a lot and only dating if it’s a guy they really like. Doing this stuff I feel like will not only be a lot of fun but put me on equal footing with a lot of these girls. 

To make it short: I’m sick of never being enough for these girls. So I will focus on self improvement for the next year and a half, then when I’m more generally attractive to girls I’ll start making experiences and looking for the perfect one. 

Also: don’t start taking about, why are you focused on hooking up ? Why aren’t you focused on love ? I’ve been looking for love and dating for the past 4 years and I’ve been denied every time. When I’m “good enough” for dating I’m going to remember this and the girls are going to have to wait until I’m ready.

Life is what you make of it, so be conscious of the decisions you make. Ladies deserve respect, all ladies; even the crazy ones. Crazy women however, should be avoided as much as possible. Jumping into a relationship with a quickness is a good way to set yourself up for both failure and heartache in the future. If you're going after something solid relationship wise then you can't be in a hurry, nor can you rush it. Be patient and spend time on yourself while you can, because a relationship is a whole fuck load of work. You're getting more than just cuddles and sex, you're getting a whole new set of issues and problems. Their mental issues, family issues, physical issues, financial issues, job issues, personal insecurities, etc; all of those problems suddenly become your problems. Dealing with all of that can be really really really fucking hard and time consuming. Relationships however can be a great thing, when you find that person who is not only good to you, but good FOR you. Until that day comes however, you should be spending your time on yourself in a worthwhile manner.
