Am 45, was married 20 years but relationship went bad 11 yrs ago.  Stayed for the kids, but we didn‚Äôt know how to give each other what we needed.

Im sorta an ‚Äúall or nothing ‚Äú person.  One of the reasons i decided to end the marriage.  it was agonizing being with someone who had shown she didn‚Äôt really care about me

I had really been ‚Äúout‚Äù of the relationship for about 8 years‚Ä¶. and was ready to move on.

A funny thing has happened that i didn‚Äôt expect.  

I have very little interest in meeting new people and learning if i am compatible.  I have met a few people, gone on a few dates, and at first am interested and it‚Äôs exciting.  As soon as they express interest, I start to pull back and not want to go thru with anything.

I have two female friends that are divorced and im pretty close with.  We will message a few times a week, and maybe get together every few months.  Dinner, drinks, baseball game etc.

And of course the ‚Äúone that got away ‚Äú is still out there.

We reconnected and it was amazing.  I never lost feelings for her, and am so thankful to have her back in my life in some capacity.  But, for a variety of reasons a real relationship with her is not feasible.

As i navigate this journey, i am realizing the only person i desire a relationship with is the one that got away.  And its not in the cards.

So‚Ä¶.do people just hang w their friends and carry on w their life? I never thought id be alone, long term.

14,ok9wqn,1626285723,Navigating initial physical attraction,"I‚Äôll preface this by saying that I (40F) have very little dating experience, mainly because I had intimacy issues for most of my 20s and 30s and finally unpacked them with therapy starting a few years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to make up for lost time and figure out how this whole dating thing works and what I want in a partner. So far, I‚Äôve had exactly one relationship that lasted longer than 9 months (probably would have lasted longer but we broke up under pandemic stress).

I‚Äôve been going on a lot of dates since I got vaccinated a few months ago, and I‚Äôm slowly realizing that even if I find a guy physically attractive, I panic if he makes moves on a first date because it feels like pressure to immediately reciprocate. In fact I‚Äôve been on two first dates where I was initially on the fence about their physical attractiveness, but because they limited physical contact to hello &amp; goodbye hugs I felt that I had room to explore my feelings in my own time, so I gave them a second date chance and only after then did I start to find them attractive. Meanwhile, I have so far been uninterested in second dates with the guys who got handsy on the first date.

I‚Äôm not sure how to communicate my hesitation to potential dates without making them think I‚Äôm weird. And in the back of my mind I‚Äôm also worried about the possibility that a guy who doesn‚Äôt try to make moves on a first date is really only interested in me as friends (this happened once), so I might be turning down guys who are actually interested in me romantically/sexually and falling for the guys who aren‚Äôt interested in me that way.

Sorry if this is confusing or sounds juvenile this is the first time I‚Äôve actually tried to thing critically about my dating habits. I‚Äôm simply trying to figure out how to navigate the first few dates in such a way that I can find out whether I am actually attracted to a guy without inadvertently sending him the wrong signals.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ok9wqn/navigating_initial_physical_attraction/

I have always wondered why men (in my case) want to go to WhatsApp after a few messages. It didn't make sense to me. You are basically opening an app to send messages. Yes there might be an extra step in opening OLD messaging service but it doesn't justify going to another app. You can still get messages through the app. It's all text based, anyway.

The other reason I don't like going to WhatsApp is security. It's harder to block someone once they are in your phone. I remember a specific incident where I blocked someone on WhatsApp and SMS, only to find that I still had them in my contact list, when they appeared on Viber. Since then I am wary of giving out my number. Google chat doesn't work where I am, so I stick to staying on whatever old messaging service.

28,okqg9v,1626346557,Acting like I'm backed into a corner... I guess I'll never learn.,"After a few dates with a woman, it happens. She'll give me shit, i.e. she's going to hang onto something I've said being (or acting, I don't know) all surprised ""Oh! I can't believe you just said that!"" kind of thing. For example, we'll walk by a shop window and notice a nice dress and will say something like ""I bet you'll look pretty good in that"" and she'll go ""wait, are you now imagining me in that dress? That's interesting.""

I don't want to constantly watch everything I say, I just want to relax and enjoy my time with her, sometimes I may make a comment on, say, what it says on her t-shirt and she'll smirk and go ""and pray tell, why were you looking down there?"" and won't let up. The problem is I'm feeling like I'm backed into a corner and say something like ""Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean it like that"", feeling like I'm accused of something.

Once we get to know each other a bit, I think a woman will subconsciously test me to see how I react in certain situations and if I'm up to the mark for being a long-term partner that she can rely on, but I can't tell for certain between when she does that and when she's genuinely annoyed or surprised. When I do my retrospect post phone-call or date, I replay those conversations in my head and go ""fuck! I'm sure I turned her off by saying that."" I'd like to know which times she doesn't get offended so I can own up to what I say and tease her back.

I guess I'm writing about it here because I know I have a problem and I want to do something about to solve it, although I think that that ship sailed long time ago. They say that certain things in life should be taught by your parents and, more to the point, your father. If he doesn't teach you those things, you'll find out about them yourself later in life but you'll have most likely lost precious decades of your life by then.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/okqg9v/acting_like_im_backed_into_a_corner_i_guess_ill/

35,okzlrp,1626376055,I‚Äôm so embarrassed,"I (44F) have been dating a handsome and charming man for a few months. It‚Äôs mostly been great, in all ways. A few hiccups but that‚Äôs what comes from human interaction. Many fewer than expected though.

We have a good and strong sexual connection. It‚Äôs been great, all aspects. Last week, laying in bed after sex, he made a comment that alluded to giving me an orgasm and punctuated it with some incredibly unflattering noises which is apparently what I sound like during sex. In that instant my heart just dropped and I think I went sheet white. I was mortified. He has made comments about closing windows and the neighbors will hear before and I thought he was being funny. I felt instant shock and shame and intense embarrassment. If I am not in love with this man I am very close, and he thinks I sound like an actual animal during sex. 

I know all people make less than flattering noises and I also know in these moments I was absolutely undone with passion and pleasure and was paying no mind to what I sound like. But this keeps playing on in my head. We have seen each other but not attempted sex since but when I have tried to masturbate, when I get close I hear that and it just disappears and all I feel is shame. I have a lot of anxiety about having sex going forward and I‚Äôm not sure how to relax and enjoy it again.

For a little context, I left a dead bedroom marriage and sex is absolutely a main priority to me in a relationship. I need to have an open and trusting sexual relationship to be happy. I need to be able to be vulnerable to really enjoy it and connect.

I do think he was being kinda insensitive but I don‚Äôt think he meant to hurt my feelings like that and I know I am sensitive which is not his problem at all. My emotional roller coaster is my ride, not his.

I don‚Äôt know what I want. Any funny stories to share? Advice to move forward? Thanks ya‚Äôll.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/okzlrp/im_so_embarrassed/
36,ol0clf,1626378295,Interest levels (and gauging a woman's interest level),"I've found that I can fall for a woman easily &amp; quickly in certain scenarios (if we seem to have a lot in common and if they're easy to talk to and seem to show interest in me).  Currently though, I've been seeing someone, and we've been out on 4 dates so far and I feel like I haven't been falling as fast as I have with some people (maybe that's a good thing).  Also, I feel like it has been hard to gauge her interest in me too, though it seems like she is.  She's a few years older than me, if that matters.

These are some signs I've thought she might not be very interested in me:

* She has mentioned a couple times that she has talked a lot.  I do tend to be an introvert and might not talk as much, depending on the person, but I have done some talking and shared some things about myself.  When she has said she's done a lot of the talking, it didn't sound like she was really complaining though, just something she noted.
* As far as communication between the times we've met up in person, it seems lately I've been the one to initiate texts; she does respond though, and sometimes she texts first.
* She hasn't been very flirty with me.  And from observing her body posture/language, I'm not sure yet how she feels about holding hands etc.  I'm not sure if it's just because she needs time to warm up or if it's a sign she's not very interested.

On the other hand, these are some signs that make me think she is interested:

* She has repeatedly mentioned seeing me again after our dates.  Also, a couple times after a date, she has said she enjoyed it
* Often it's common where I live for the guy to pay for dinner &amp; stuff, and she has let me pay rather than assuming I'd want her to pay for herself.  I know  this point might be debatable and some people can disagree on who should pay for dates, but it's just something I noted.
* We had a dinner date last night, and when we were leaving, she kissed me (normally we just hug).  It was a light kiss on the lips (though it wasn't full-on, it was more in the right corner of my mouth).  She then mentioned seeing me again this weekend and asked if I'd want to come watch a softball game with her.
* She has mentioned telling a couple people she's dating (and specifically used  the word ""dating"") and has said one of her friends wants to approve people she dates.  This might not mean much, but I felt like at least I'm not being friend-zoned.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ol0clf/interest_levels_and_gauging_a_womans_interest/

46,ol9txa,1626410968,"~6 month relationship, minimum time before getting back out there? - breakups suck","First post here, even though I've commented a lot.  Learned a ton here and thankful for everyone that participates!

Had a short relationship just end ( I'm more of the dumpee, but somewhat mutual)  It was about 7 months since we met, 4 or 5 months exclusive.   This was my first relationship after 20 year marriage,   we met 19 months after my separation ( 4 months after official divorce).  Overall it was a great relationship... until it wasn't  ( past 6 weeks or so?).   Probably not a great match overall as some of our weaknesses didn't mesh well together... but that's the way it goes.  I have some stuff to work on  - had a couple of screw ups that definitely didn't help.  Maybe this is a vent post as well.... breakups truly do suck.  I got a little ugly over a couple of things and that's not cool.

I thought I'd be in for a world of hurt, but I'm not?  Maybe because I realized a while ago this was not going to be long term.  Maybe because compared to the ending of my marriage this is nothing.  And  things never progressed that much relationship wise - good times -  saw each other a couple times a week from the start, no family enmeshment.

I won't be putting myself out there again at least August.  I'm not one to fudge things when asked either, if someone asks me about my last relationship I'll tell them how long and when it ended.

I have a good feel for what I look for in time passed since a longer marriage.  What's a good number that won't raise eyebrows for a shorter relationship like this?

59,olpl7p,1626468103,Story time: 3 hours of Tinder Gold (52M),"Hi there, a few days ago I figured I'd throw some money away.  I installed Tinder, put in my pictures, stats, little description.  Then I signed up for a month of Tinder Gold (to see who likes me, and have unlimited swiping, plus a free boost).

Anyhow, my phone starts notifying me like crazy - Tasha likes you, Myriam likes you, etc.  I got like 15 likes in the first 5 minutes, then it slowed down, like popcorn in the microwave.  I took a look at this collection of ""hot singles in my area"".  Interestingly, they were all age appropriate (no younger than 38), and cute, but not like obnoxiously cute.

As I started going through their profile, the pattern solidified, a couple of nice pics - good lighting and composition, but not overly professional, unverified, and each of them had an ""anthem"" (it's a quick setting to pick a song that feels like you).  A lot of them had the same anthem.  In fact between the 15 of them, there were only about 3 songs represented. Peaches by Justin Bieber is apparently a favorite of single professional women in their late 40s.

Several hours passed and I ignored the app.  I noticed 1 or 2 real likes in there (not interested).  At 7pm I decided to use my boost for 30 minutes of slightly increased visibility.  Again the popcorn starts popping - got about 12 new Likes in rapid succession.  Same deal - cute but not suspiciously stunning, age-appropriate, unverified profiles with shockingly similar taste in music.  And maybe 1 legit user (not interested).

I was tempted to Like them all to see what kinds of scams were in store.  Then I thought ""what am I doing with my life"", deleted my profile, canceled the subscription, and deleted the app.

For comparison's sake, I've been on *\[another app which I've redacted so you don't think this is an ad\]* for less than a week, am chatting with a few cool, interesting women, have been on one date with an agreement to go on another, and have two other first dates lined up.

Anyhow, Tinder is awful in my demographic.  Not only is it hard to find any mutual interest, the amount and effort of the scam-bots is kind of terrifying.

No matter how many times I tell myself it‚Äôs my AA, I can almost never overcome it. I‚Äôve also recognized that it may very well be the person. If someone is triggering my AA so often then they‚Äôre likely not the one for me‚Ä¶maybe.

I would like to have had my last first date. But I don‚Äôt know that I have. I‚Äôve been dating a man for about 10 months; about 9 months since we started sleeping together and being exclusive. He seemed perfect in every way, except that he had recently separated and was still in the process of divorce. 10 months later‚Ä¶he‚Äôs still in the process of divorce. He seems to still display these hot and cold feelings about us, I feel. I spend a lot of my free time still being on my own, and that‚Äôs not what I want and it weighs on me. I can‚Äôt seem to distinguish my impatience at wanting more, and loneliness of being single, from behaviors of his that seem confusing or hot and cold, or ultimately incompatible.

I have two questions for the Internet. One is, if you‚Äôve had similar experiences in a relationship, I‚Äôd be interested in hearing yours and what the outcome was. But the larger question I have is, how did you find clarity in a situation that felt confusing or uncertain? Because ultimately my circumstances are unique to me.

76,omc0xk,1626553550,Ghosted? Too much in my head?,"I (44F) have been dating a guy (50M) for 8 months. 

Work became super hectic for the both of us in May and June. Still talked every day. Met his family and friends. Still did things together, but the frequency dropped off. I wasn‚Äôt concerned because we were both exhausted. 

He had to travel for training for two weeks (beginning of July) and then immediately after that he was headed out on vacation with his kids. Talked to him on 7/2. His training started on the 5th. He texted me on the 6th to ask about a big interview I had had that day. I did reply. No response. No big deal-he‚Äôs in training. After a week I called and texted him, but no response. 

I don‚Äôt feel anxious or worried per se. He has always been reliable and consistent. At first I shrugged the lack of communication off and knew he would contact me after he got back from vacation, but now I‚Äôm stuck in my head and thinking maybe this is his way of ending things. Why? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm having a hard time distinguishing between the narrative my brain has concocted and my intuition.

I guess it‚Äôs just wait and see, right? I could call or text, but we typically don‚Äôt talk/text when we have our kids and he‚Äôs out of the country with them right now. If it‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs done. If it‚Äôs not, then I need to clarify my boundaries about communication. I also need to admit to myself that I‚Äôm more invested and attached than I thought I was

Context: I am a talker and a texter. He is a talker. We both have been clear about our expectations in regards to our communication and we are both good with our communication style.

80,omemlo,1626562581,"""Rejected"" due to distance. How far is too far?","I had a date on Thursday night with a guy I matched with online.  We live about an hour and a half apart.  We planned a date in the middle, which turned out to be about an hour away from him and 30 minutes away from me.  We both acknowledged the distance, but also that we didn't mind because we like to go on road trips, etc.

The date went really well and we spent about 5 hours together. When I got home, I texted him to let him know I got there and I mentioned that we could get together this weekend if he wanted to.  He said something to the effect of ""sounds good"", and he mentioned that he also had a good time.

The next day the texts slowed way down and got way shorter and then nothing.  There had also been no mention of weekend plans obviously.  I figured he was not interested, which is fine, but I felt weird about the fact that he sent silent, because we talked quite a bit before we got together and seemed to really get along.

I was thinking about it today, and I decided to send him a final text, and it went like this:
""Hey! I'm assuming the feeling isn't mutual about us going out again, and that is totally fine! I wish you all the best, and it was really great meeting you.""
It just seemed like the adult thing to do because he genuinely seemed like a nice guy. I got a text back within a few minutes that was him apologizing and saying that he didn't mean to ghost me, but he had thought about it and the distance is just too far for him.  (The low self-esteem part of me is aware that he could have said this to cover up another reason that he didn't want to see me again, but I'm too not worried about it.)

So I'm a little bummed, but I'm glad I sent the final text and that he responded. It just made me start thinking, how far is too far for you when first dating someone? I know this will vary a lot between people but I was just curious about the average.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/omemlo/rejected_due_to_distance_how_far_is_too_far/

Ok.  Maybe something came up.  Maybe she forgot.

About two hours later I saw she read my messages and viewed my profile again.  So, she's still alive and knows for sure she missed the date.  Still no message (""Sorry, I forgot."", ""Sorry, my car wouldn't start"").  I thought about texting ""What happened?"", but I just unmatched instead.

I can be honest with my cousin about a lot of things and the feelings of desperately wanting to date and breed have been really weighing on me at times.

I'm so desperate I'd hit that just for the chance to have a kid or some sort of sex!""

When we got back to my place we actually talked about the idea of me just going on one of these breeding forums i found a few years back and just hooking up with someone to have a kid.  She actually thought it was a good idea.  But she did ask me how desperate was i at that point and i admitted to her that there was a time in the past where i seriously considering asking one of my female cousins if we could have a kid together.  Of course my cousin thought this was kind of gross and asked me why i would have even considered that.  I was honest with her and in my mind at least i could have a child with some one i could trust not to be some lunatic and we could get along and not have to marry if she didn't want to.
