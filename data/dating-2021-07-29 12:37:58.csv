0,ou28v6,1627580324,Are guys more easily content than girls in relationships?,"
The other day me (f24) and my bf (m24) where talking about how he has friends who basically just picked a girl from their church and married them even though they have nothing in common. He said those relationships usually ended with someone cheating (usually the wife, because the guy thinks there’s nothing wrong but she is actually super unhappy). 

This lead to my partner stating that men can more easily content with a partner bc they basically just want someone attractive who makes them feel like they’re loved, helps around the house, etc… and that woman have more wants from relationships.

For me I’m not sure how I feel about that because there are a lot of woman who settle with men and take on all the emotional labor in the relationship. They do all the planning, make all the grocery lists, plan and buy all the family gifts during the holiday etc. so I feel like it’s just that woman wake up and realize they don’t have a partner; they’re just taking care of everyone. So they leave and the guy doesn’t get why.

I do think girls have a longer checklist for relationships though, but more so just because there’s less stigma around woman being in touch with their emotions. Like we don’t just want a good partner, we want a partner that sees us as special to them and makes us feel special, not replaceable by just any nice woman. We want a best friend. And I don’t think these wants are gender exclusive, but I do think men are raised a lot of the time not to think about them so it seems like they’re less “picky” from a birds eye view. 

I would hate to think that my partner was just content with me so he stuck around… idk. What are your thoughts on this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou28v6/are_guys_more_easily_content_than_girls_in/
1,ou29az,1627580361,Started seeing a girl but now it'll be a month before we can meet,"25(M) Back in April, I went on a couple dates with a girl (24) that I' know through mutual acquaintances and the dates were great - connection was there and we both felt, as the kids say, bubbly about each other. However, about two weeks ago she moved to SF (I am in San Diego).

This actually doesn't pose a problem for me because I work in San Francisco. My apartment there is being subletted since I decided to spend the summer here. I'm not certain when I'll go back but I want to keep this thing going and she's open to it. The only issue is that we wont actually see each other over the next few months. Texting can only go so far and I want to keep her interest until we see each other again. 

We're not exclusive and there have been no promises made by either of us on what happens when I return to SF, but I was hoping to get some thoughts on how I can keep her interest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou29az/started_seeing_a_girl_but_now_itll_be_a_month/

3,ou2bg3,1627580537,Help finding Mr. Right please!!,"The characters:

Me:
Very good career and career driven, hope to move back to my home state whenever I get the chance, stand by my beliefs and values which are more liberal, came from a hard background, upper 20s, looking for my next relationship to be the last one. Have had several long term relationships which only lasted as long as they did bc I tried so hard to make a toxic things work. I clearly can't pick em. 

Snoop: 
Started out as just a stranger I met on tinder to smoke with, from the beginning we both explicitly expressed we weren't going to be soulmates or looking for anything serious, but it seems that he has feelings for me now after getting to know each other and he checks a lot of boxes for me as well. We have a lot of the same goals and visions and align closely on many things from music to morals. He has a lot of female friends that which makes me uncomfortable just bc I have had tons of issues with that in the past in other relationships. He says he gets attached to people easily which kind of makes me feel like if he does have feelings for me then it's just another instance, but maybe not as he seems genuine. He's getting his phD and has a good future as well. He's moving in as a roommate bc I need help with bills and he has no place to stay since him roomies are all leaving. So there's that. 



Jellybean: 
We have mutual friends that set us up together and they think we're a perfect match but I can't say bc I don't know him that well yet. We've gotten to know each other from being at our friends' house events and have gone on a few dates. He's very handsome and has a good personality. My friend tells me he hasn't dated in a while bc he's been busy with his company but he very much wants a real relationship but he's too shy to approach women. I love a shy guy though and it's cute to see how nervous he is around me as I know he's very interested. 

The problem:
 However I just don't know jellybean well enough yet and I don't know what would be best for my future. Jellybean seems like a good fit bit we seem less aligned on our values than me and snoop. Snoop would be willing to relocate if I moved to my home state which I 100% will do. Whereas I don't think jellybean can so easily do since he has his business and entirely family here which he is close to. Snoop and I come from similar backgrounds and I get the sense that jellybean has had more of a privileged life which I don't hold against him it's just something we won't be able to relate as easily on. Also I can't confirm but I think jellybean was a trump supporter and it would make me feel like we could have future issues just because we would have very different moral and ethical views I would think. But he's such a sweet guy Its hard to know if this matters. Snoop isn't really a romantic though and I can tell it just doesn't come to him that easily whereas jellybean is kind of old school romantic which does get my heart swooning but isn't a good measure for future relationship success. 
I'm trying to look ahead and get a sense of what's best for my life and what would make a better long term relationship as I tend to follow my feelings usually, which has proven to give me some bad relationships once the butterflies wears off. I didn't have feelings or big attraction to snoop initially but he's really grown on me and it's easy to see him in my future. It's harder to see jellybean fitting in my future plans and goals as well but he gives me the butterflies that I've not exactly felt with snoop, but I know those fade and won't ultimately matter, or do they? I'm honestly very happy spending time with either of them but I'm trying to be logical. I feel like maybe some extra perspective would help me see things I've not considered. 

Also I don't want to keep seeing them both for any longer than necessary. I don't want to be rushed to make a decision but I just don't have one yet and I don't want them to feel like I've been playing around with their emotions either. I just wanna be done with the dating life, it's just hard to know.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou2bg3/help_finding_mr_right_please/
4,ou2dlm,1627580709,Confused in the outcome of this,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room.

5,ou2en1,1627580793,I've (F22) known him (M23) for a month. Is it strange to ask him on Vacation?,"I met this guy at the bar, we texted each other for two days, then went on a date. We slept together the same day we went on our date. I don't ever feel comfortable having a first date over my place, especially being a woman who lives alone; but I felt so comfortable with him and we got along so well.

We've been on about four or five dates with each other and every date has been great. We have a lot in common, we're both extremely chill around one another and we trust each other in our apartments (He left me alone at his place and said he trusted me).

Work has been taking a toll on my mental health so I'm privileged to have supporting family members and enough savings to be able to take a small break from work. On this break, I want to go on a vacation with someone (Not super comfortable going to another state alone). My friends are too busy with school or transitioning from school to work. And my family is busy as well. He's the only person I can think of going with that isn't going to be too busy to go. My mom even suggested I go with him. The only thing that's holding me back from asking him is the possibility of making things awkward between us.

6,ou2fz6,1627580903,Had the best first date of my life... ghosted,"Matched with a girl on Bumble, talked for a week and a half and she disappeared. another week and a half, kept thinking of her and she had her Instagram handle in her account so I thought ""what do I have to lose"" and messaged her there. She took it well and we started talking again leading to a date. 

I don't have much dating experience, but this was genuinely the best first date of my life. We got along so well, clicking on so many levels, after dinner we went to a desert spot, then after went to a bar and played pool. We held hands and hugged and she even initiated kissing. We had great discussions, learned a lot about each other, we both made it clear we wanted to see each other again. 

She even texted me first the next day. Texted moderately for a few days. Planning our second date she says she's busy that week but we figure out that next Wednesday works. She says she feels bad it's so far of but I let her know it's ok ""Hey you're a busy lady. How about this we plan for Wednesday, if you happen to have an hour to grab a coffee let me know. If not, don't feel bad, we'll see each other Wednesday. You are worth the wait.""

Apparently, I made a critical error here as there seemed to be a conscious choice to never talk to me again. That was Wed, I wait till Sat to text a simple Happy Birthday (she told me it was during the date), no response. I wait till Mon to confirm if she's still available for Wed, no response. I try messaging her on Instagram to confirm, hasn't even looked at the message, yet seems to be on the app regularly. 

Unfortunately, I listen to my cousin (who is very smart and very dumb about certain things) and send her a text on Tuesday about rescheduling for Wed (which I don't think is the worse thing in the world that's prob me overthinking things)

Still nothing today (Thursday). 7 days no word. That feels like a super long time to me. No way someone is THAT busy. I KNOW she likes me. As I mentioned, she has disappeared before but I feel like it's different this time. Do I assume this is over? I plan on sending one last text probably Sat just to let her know I hope everything is ok and still interested.

20,ou3k1f,1627584267,Do I stick around or create distance?,"I've been dating this guy for a month now and things were going really well until yesterday. We have great conversation about religion, our previous relationships, mental health and our beliefs about the world. The sex is pretty damn good and feels kinda magical. I've been showing him around town (he just moved to my city from across the country.) He is really affectionate when we're together: hand-holding, kissing my hand, cuddles, holding my thigh when I'm driving, stuff like that. I have a tendency to get lost in my romantic pursuits but have been doing well about maintaining my own life, doing my own thing, and not relying on him to make me feel good but doing things that make myself feel good instead. 

I was getting hopeful that this was going somewhere in the realm of commitment. Until yesterday. I had spent the night at his place and we went out to lunch. The previous day I had read this other post on Reddit about how when you are dating someone to always assume that they are seeing other people unless exclusivity has been clearly established. This got me worried and sad because I know it's true that you can't expect exclusivity when you're dating someone but things had been going so well! So when we are out to lunch I ask him if he is seeing or sleeping with other people. He answered that yes, he is sleeping with another girl. He explained that they don't go out and do fun things like hiking and drinks the way we do. He described himself as being her booty call. When he asked if I was I told him no and there was a fat pause in the conversation which did not feel good lmao. He asked if I was looking for a serious relationship and, after a brief pause from me, I said yes. He said he was enjoying time to ""focus on me"" at this time in his life. He's wrapping up a divorce right now as well, which I learned recently.

I don't know. On one hand I feel disappointed and sad because I felt like we were compatible and that we were heading towards exclusivity. But on the other hand, he had ""looking for something casual"" in his bio on Bumble and I am almost certain that I did too. And dating nowadays you can't assume that the other person is only seeing/talking to you. So I feel like I did this to myself, lol. He is a really respectful person and I would like to remain friends but I can't help but feel somewhat misguided by him. And I know that if I continue on with dating and keeping it casual that my feelings will continue to grow.

25,ou44vu,1627585996,"My boyfriend (17M), me (18F), and the TV","

TL:DC
My boyfriend and I just watch tv together, and I want to do more. I don’t know what, though.
Also, it’s making me realize that we aren’t similar in a way I think most couples should be. 


We’ve been dating for a year and a half now. It’s a great relationship, and emotionally we are super healthy and good for each other. But recently, I’ve realized that we’re stuck in a rut. Every time we see each other, we just go to his room and watch a show and then go to eat and then maybe take a nap. I love being with him, so I love all of those things, but I want us to do other things too. I’ve mentioned it slightly before, but nothing changed, and I think there are three main reasons.

1. The majority of our relationship has been when we couldn’t do other things. We needed to stay inside, especially because his parents are at high risk to Covid.
Even though things have started getting back to normal, it’s hard to change what a relationship has been for so long. 
That kind of goes into my 2nd point.
2. He loves routine, and he doesn’t like change. Once he gets into a habit of doing something, he has a challenging time unlearning it. It’s hard for me to be the only one wanting/pushing us to do something different, so I didn’t do it much, and now I’ve stopped.
The 3rd is the biggest one. 
3. We don’t have the same interests. It’s not that we just have a romantic relationship, and that’s the only thing that connects us because we still are friends, and I like being around him no matter what we do. But I feel like we don’t have much to talk about besides our lives in general. He and his friends talk about music and instruments and bands (he’s a musician), and I don’t really care about that stuff beyond caring because he likes it. I don’t have a specific interest/s, so once We finish talking about what’s going on in our lives, it’s hard to make conversation. Even worse (in my opinion) is I’ve realized we have different senses of humor. I can still make him laugh sometimes, but I can’t have him dying laughing as his friends do, and the same goes for me.

There’s no doubt we love each other, but I guess I’m just worried because I don’t know what to do.

Do you have any suggestions for something we could do together to have something to connect with? Or any advice on my situation",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou44vu/my_boyfriend_17m_me_18f_and_the_tv/

She mentioned that I was cute and I saw her picture because I forgot how she looked like and I thought she was beautiful. We still talk to this day, but she talks a lot about her boy best friend, a guy who she says is like a cousin to her. This guy has openly tried to get with her but she rejects him, which is good, but now I feel like our bond isn’t what it was when we started talking in May. I’m still confused as to why, she gives me some compliments here and there. I’m an insecure guy because I’ve lost many people who I’ve loved, and i’ve developed somewhat of a crush on her, I can see myself marrying her, the cultures match, and my parents actually know of hers and vice versa.

My mental disorders make me needy for a listener, a man who prefers to chill at home, and can deal with someone high maintenance. I have mommy and daddy issues which both add together to trust issues. I'm 23, so not young enough for any man to be interested, too ugly compared to most other girls, and a boring personality to have anything to offer.

Brown, because I'm biracial and you will never understand how many men will turn down a black woman for no reason.

I want to find a man with:
-Patience for my mental bullshit and lack of social awareness.
-Interest in my obsessions with me (or can fake it and put up with it) to listen to my rambling impromptu Ted-Talks.
-Doesn't care about my stimming.
-Considers home-cooked food in the dining room then cuddles in bed a date.
-Considers me reading, writing, or sewing with headphones in as I sit next to him while he does his favorite indoor hobby in the living room or bedroom a well-spent night/weekend.
-Not a bigot.
-A job (Idc what, just needs to help pay for the bills and etc).
-Likes animals (he needs to like cats and dogs).
-Doesn't want kids.
-Introverted.

Me and this girl have been talking in school for a few months ,started in class and then turned into walking home together 2-3 times a week. Over this time i really started to like her and wanted to be around her more.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her out and she said yes. We went around to bowling the movies and had something to eat, the whole day was fun and we had alot to talk about . when we were out i said she looked really good and she started blushing and gave me a compliment back.

&amp;#x200B;

Over dinner she asked if I've ever had a gf which i responded no becuase i haven't and i asked her and she said no aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

i asked her on the way home why she'd never had a bf and she said nobodies ever made a move on her and she's never made a move on somebody else cos she hasn't had the courage to do so. i told her 'i think thats crazy, you're a really nice person to be with' and she blushed again.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually we were back home and she said she'd wait with me while my bus came just outside her house. i decided to tell her i had alot of fun and that i have feelings for her and that im making a move on her now. she looked at me and said 'really ?' and said ' i didn't think i'm your type'.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her ' I've never felt this way about a girl before , i really like being with you '. she laughed and i asked ' why are you laughing' . she said ' im not laughing at you, i just laugh when im nervous sorry' . she then said nobody had ever told her that before so she didn't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

i gave her some time to take it in and then she stood up and asked if i was being serious which i responded 'yes, i have never felt this way about a girl before. i enjoy us spending time together'. She said 'i agree'. I grabbed her hands and looked directly into her eyes and said ' i really like you'. she said ' i like you aswell but i want to meet up more before i commit to something'.

&amp;#x200B;

It was getting late and her parents were already asking where she was so i just told her to go home before her parents worry, we went in to hug eachother so in put my arms around her but she seemed stiff and not really there.

&amp;#x200B;

i walked away and got on a bus, i got home and she said ' i do like you back btw, i just want to meet up more before i commit to something'. i agreed and she said ' thx for telling me tho, i feel like were now on the same page'. Again she said ' i get very awkward easy and i was thrown off that you liked me'

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know if i said too much or if she just needs time to take it in more. i really like her and while her saying she likes me back is nice i feel like i may have done something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Can somebody tell me how to move forward now?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; i told a girl i liked her after going out and she was very shocked in the moment and said she wanted to go out more before she commits.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou4w6w/i_m17_told_a_girl_f17_i_have_feelings_for_her_and/

38,ou5g6m,1627590017,What are some techniques and mental reminders to help manage my anxiety regarding relationships and dating?,"As a disclaimer, I am currently in therapy. I just can't afford to go super frequently so I see my therapist once a month and its definitely not enough, but at $250 an hour its super difficult to find alternative methods that are cheaper and more frequent (particularly clinical psychologists who have hundreds of hours logged and specialized experience in religeous cults).

 While I am working really hard to heal the issues I have with coming out of a religious sect, and managing my expectations around my religious parents who have pretty much abandoned me, along with the rest of my community... I am struggling to come up with techniques to help ward off the relationship anxiety I have with my boyfriend of 7 months. Things are going well, and i really care about him, but I struggle to trust him. He has done nothing to fail me, but I am convinced he will... and I recognize that it's my problem.

The reasons behind my anxiety are:

\- Due to dating 2 men in the church who were cheaters and liars (felt women were property etc. typical fundamentalist views) I find it very hard to trust men in general. This is usually expressed through keeping an eye on social media accounts and their phone habits. Unfortunately when I pick up on one small thing, it sends me down a rabbit hole of self hatred and the negative ""i told you so"" voice in my head that convinces me that no man will ever want to marry me or have a family with me. I try very hard not to check on my boyfriends social media and analyze his phone habits too hard... but I'm convinced he will cheat on me whenever I see him like another girls selfie on social media and i physically can't eat and just spend the evening hating myself. When my boyfriends cheated, the church (or members of the church) would indicate that somehow I must have DONE something to make him lose interest. It was suggested that I act more ""wifey"" and be more ""subject"" despite the fact both my exes had patterns of drinking and picking up random girls from bars when I wasn't around. This made me also distrust my own family as they often questioned my behaviour first instead of the men I was with. I realize parents make mistakes, but this toxic dynamic was beyond traumatic and while there are less than 1,000 members of this sect left in the world, it used to be 5,000 strong when I was a small child... so it should be evidence enough that the situation was highly unusual and toxic. Most people ended up in some form of therapy. 

\- Because I have very few close friends or family support after being excommunicated from the church, I definitely tend to lean towards codependant behaviours when someone shows me affection. I am aware of this, and am actively trying to combat that by studying more about childhood trauma and adopt stoicism so I can accept that what happens to me is often out of my control and that I can only work to accept what has happened to me and build a better community and life for myself. 

I realize that I have a lot to work through, but i'd love if people could share their techniques for warding off these insecurities and self worth issues, whether its **quotes, helpful media or physical exercises that can help me be confident in myself, regardless of what is happening... and will happen, with my relationship.** I need help in becoming more confident in myself and not defining my existence by whether or not I'm getting love from others. 

I realize this is a heavy post. But if theres anything that you find brings you mental clarity, i'm interested in hearing about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou5g6m/what_are_some_techniques_and_mental_reminders_to/

We have gone out to dinner, took a walk in a park, got ice cream, walked around Washington D.C., played virtual reality games, played board games (Backgammon), and literally hung out watching Netflix. 

The relationship is great; he sends me funny cat videos on Instagram, we Sanpchat each other, we text, and he has started calling me on his breaks during work. 

I have been introduced to his mom over the phone and he told me he talks to his family about me. The latest update is that they coerced my last name out of him and they peeked at my Instagram, which sadly, is mostly about my cats (once I realized that, I made one for my cats and now my main account has been neglected, lol) 

This weekend his family is having their annual get together in NJ (where he is from). I assumed I wasn't going (after all it has only been two weeks). He asked me on Monday what my week looked like. We had a mini fun lighthearted debate about which day was the start of the week (we concluded Sunday). Despite our conclusion, mentioned that I had a Bridal Tea (for one of my high school friends) in NJ on Sunday. He was like, ""Wait, Sunday as in this Sunday this weekend?"" I replied, ""Yes"" and confirmed the date August 1st after going back and forth a couple times making sure we were talking about the same day. He then says, ""If, and this is a big if, I can get my parents to say you can come, would you want to come to the party on Saturday?"" I accepted the invitation. Tuesday came around and as the day went on he became more confident that asking if I could come wouldn't be a problem. 

Fast forward to Wednesday afternoon. He calls me before going into work. After some small talk, he says I can come to the party with an asterisks, his asterisks, not one imposed by his parents. He explains that we have only been seeing each other a couple weeks and that he would introduce me as his friend (as opposed to girlfriend). I said that I guess that would be ok, and as I thought about it, that is ok. 

He has told his family about me and it has only been two weeks, but should I bring something since I will be meeting his parents for the first time? Should I bring anything at all? At least flowers for the mom? Maybe a chocolate box set? I like to bake and have plenty of frozen ripe bananas so maybe make a loaf of banana bread? Lol!

I’ve dated several women in the last year and a half since my last relationship ended (see post history). Many of these women have been great with no reason for me not to pursue further, and yet I don’t, every time. I’ll see someone for a while, notice things are getting serious, and start distancing myself.

These women (generally) have great jobs, are beautiful, are interested in me, yet I walk away every time.

For background, we were friends for about 3 months and we were almost 2 months into dating. Now, that doesn’t seem like a lot to most people, but it hurt for me so much because during that time we spent every day together. We would call every night and wake up on the phone together. We had wonderful dates. We were in love.

I dished out hundreds of dollars on gifts and dates for him without any concern of him making it up to me. He had told me how hard his life had been before me, and I just wanted him to know how loved he was. Any time he told me he was unhappy with how our relationship was, I listened to him and I fixed it. I just wanted him to be as happy with me as I was with him.

He made me feel like all the abuse from guys prior didn’t have a hold on me anymore. I was really beginning to learn to trust again, and he told me we would have a future together. I was so excited at the thought of that. I didn’t know if we would be together forever, but I really thought he would be the one I could finally have a healthy long-term relationship with. 

Or so I thought.

One week ago, with no legitimate warning signs, he left me. He started off the break-up by telling me his sex drive had been gone for a few days. I thought that was strange because two days previously, I had made him orgasm during a blowjob that he ASKED for. He proceeded to tell me that he could’ve orgasmed without me (it was just the same as if I hadn’t been there). Then he told me the sex we had (a first for both of us) wasn’t stimulating for him, and he realized after sex he wasn’t sexually attracted to me. 

I thought that was crazy because during sex, he continuously encouraged me to keep going and gave compliments. Following us having sex, he frequently told me how good it was. Then two times after sex, he initiated sexual interactions. His actions didn’t match up with his words.

How can you have sex with someone you sexually feel nothing for?

I asked him if he loved me, and he said he didn’t know. I asked again and he said he didn’t think he did. Then he said he emotionally wasn’t connected with me anymore. He said he was drained. He said he wanted space and didn’t want to be friends.

There hadn’t been any signs leading up to this except for this quiet fear in my head, which I brushed off as an irrational anxiety. In the last 72 hours, my brain started telling me I could do better than him. I figured I was just scared to be vulnerable and always began to calm down when I remembered how much I loved him. After all, was I really settling when I felt like he meant the world to me? 

I now feel like I knew deep down he was lying to me, which is why that urge to leave had settled within me. Something was off that night we had sex, but I ignored it. What a painful mistake to have made.

On top of all that, I received screenshots showing him sympathizing with my abusive ex boyfriend and giving him tips on how to sleep with me right after the break-up.

At first I barely slept or ate. I cried all day. I had a massive panic attack. I felt the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. I felt like shit about my looks and sexual appeal.

Now I’m numb and I feel disconnected from everyone. But most of all, I lost most of my confidence that I worked so hard for. 

I want it, but I don’t know if I ever will get it back.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou7ky6/i_have_no_sexual_confidence_anymore_after_my_ex/

59,ou7zdu,1627598003,I am Worried I May Never Find Someone.,"Some background about me. 20, male. Just graduated and plan to be starting college next year. I am and have for most of my teen years been single in spite of being asked out lots of times by girls throughout the years. I was a chubby kid growing up and I grew up in an abusive and dysfunctionality home. When I got older I grew up to be somewhat decent looking and girls began to take interest in me around when I was 13. Since then I have been asked out and flirted with by about 20 girls or so. I had a couple relationships but they never lasted long. I also struggled and continue to struggle with mental health issues, which has made having relationships in general difficult. I am often commented on my looks and facial structure. I have had random strangers say I am good looking. Anyways I continued to turn down most girls I had chances with and chose to remain single. It wasnt until I lost my chance with this very pretty and sweet girl named Judith when I began reconsidering the decisions I was making.

I gained a lot of weight throughout those years and just recently got into good shape. I plan to get in better shape. The compliments regarding my looks have returned..But I have yet to meet anyone who took interest in me. Even when I wasnt in that great shape. continued to recieve attention from women. I finally want to start dating now that I am in a lot better shape and look and feel better about myself..But with Covid going on and everything I am afraid I will never meet another girl again. Girls were always the first to ask me out and I am wondering if my luck has ran its course.

60,ou828t,1627598269,Am I (M31) being too strict by not pursuing a friend (F29) who is interested in me?,"Hi! A bit of background first. Single for some years now, quite social/extrovert, and weirdly enough I often get along better with women than men. But, OLD did not work and IRL likes are a bit difficult to detect. In all this time there was a handful of what would be a stretch to call a date and couple of more friendly hangouts. Not the best of situations, manageable, still I would like to meet someone to be more than friends with.

One of the more friendly hangouts was a woman that initially wanted to talk more about her career (as we share the same profession) but we talked about everything. I asked her at some point if she was interested in more than just being friends, but she said no at the time. Not really sure anymore if I was genuinely interested in her or if it was just a ""mechanical"" response to having had couple of coffees with someone that was ok.

We did not hang out much, until recently. And I felt like she was behaving differently, saying things like ""I think I am ready for a relationship now"". But I find myself just thinking, she is nice and interesting, but I am not that excited about the idea of asking her out. Another friend is saying that I should definitely try something as it is visible the girl likes me. That I should give her a chance.

I kinda resolved myself to not care too much and to leave it up to her, if she wants something, she should make a move. I am relatively happy now to now want to pursue a relationship at a slightest hint of an opportunity, but I figured I could give her a chance if she makes the first move. Or is it unfair to her if I am not feeling the ""spark""? But at the same time I might be missing out as these things sometimes take time.

Is that a crappy way to handle this? What would you do? Initiate even if you do not really want to, or just let it be?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou828t/am_i_m31_being_too_strict_by_not_pursuing_a/

62,ou83gi,1627598381,My (M20) girlfriend (F22) wants to break up with me days before my 21st birthday,"We have been together for 7/8 months now. She came out of a 4-year relationship that was bad for her. We never had an argument before until now, we had small bickering that would be dissolved with honest communication. I recently planned my 21st Birthday with 13 of my friends and her. She does not want to come due to Covid and because she had it before, which I understand, but now she wants me to change it to suit her.

I decided to leave things be and let her calm down today (she usually needs time to work through problems). Today, however, she sent me a message saying that she wants to drop off my gift tomorrow and the costume I bought her for my birthday. When I replied, she accused me of ""pretending to be busy"" and that I did not message her today out of spite.

I told her that it is as much in her capacity and ability to message me as it is in mine. Again, she was upset and blamed me for pointing a finger at her, yet she can point one at me and not get reprimanded for it.

She further told me that she felt hurt that I did not include her in my birthday plans as she did with me for her birthday (I reiterated that I did, but she accused me of lying, and there wasn't much to plan anyway as my family did it) and that I have no consideration for her family's health. Furthermore, she said that I did not ""seem upset"" or ""put up a fight"" for her in not coming to my party...I told her that I respected her decision to not come because of her own health and safety so why should I have. Also, I am not going to change my entire birthday to suit one person.

I constantly told her that it does not take away from the feelings I have for her and that I of course would have wanted her with me. She ignored it and said that she does not know how to move forward from this and that this will always be in the back of her mind, how I made her feel. She said that she does not want me to be heartbroken but if a breakup needs to happen then it will be necessary.

What I don't get in all of this is why is breaking up even an option to her? It was a small argument and disagreement that became unnecessarily large due to what she thought I wanted her to feel. No matter what I said, she was not having any of it. I am the bad guy in this and all of our past memories, love, and fun over the months means nothing to her now. She seems adamant about it and does not want to listen or believe my side. I even suggested meeting up before the party, but to her, it's too late now as if I really wanted that I would've said it yesterday or earlier. ""Actions speak louder than words"", yet I have done so much for her over this year so far...

My birthday means nothing to her if she is not there and she's hijacking it for her own selfish reasons, to the point where asking 13 of my closest friends was a problem to her. Anyway. I am just distraught at the moment as I thought she was better than this...I guess not. If this is the reason we break up then God alone knows why. I don't know what to do

TL;DR: My girlfriend is considering breaking up with me now because I planned my 21st Birthday and invited 13 friends during the pandemic. She is not comfortable with that and I understand, but instead of making up for it or letting it be, she is blaming me for it all",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou83gi/my_m20_girlfriend_f22_wants_to_break_up_with_me/
63,ou8eee,1627599432,"Dating a new guy, still twinges of disappointment from the last one. I've never dealt with this before.","I (F26) dated a guy at the beginning of the year; it ended and I finally found my self respect stomped all over on the ground. I go to therapy, have a full life, and I try to stay self aware. I'm in a much better place than I was 3 months ago. I am dating a new guy, someone who typically isn't my type or normal guy I date. Point blank, he's wonderful. I've never missed someone before, but I miss him and look forward to seeing him. 

But, a couple of times a week I get these twinges of missing the last guy I dated. He likes to flit in and out of my life, but I don't contact him myself, don't see him, don't flirt, and kinda give him the bare minimum. We haven't chatted since I started seeing this new guy, and it isn't something I am willing to mess up by being disrespectful. I haven't ever dealt with lingering feelings like this before, so I am unsure of how ""normal"" this is. I know emotions are complex, but I also want to make sure I'm being honest with myself. New guy and I haven't had the ""what are we"" talk, but again, I am not willing to disrespect someone who treats me this well. Which some might argue I already am? This is something I am working through in therapy, and like I said, I am doing much better, but I would be lying if sometimes I didn't get a little sad about it.  If new guy had an issue with it, old guy would be blocked easily. I guess since I don't ""have"" to right now, it's easier for me to wait and see what happens. 

Should I just keep working through it? Or do we think that ending things with the guy I am seeing would be the best thing to do?

My girlfriend at the time (F19) and I (F20) had been dating for about 8 months. I lived with my parents and they went on a month long trip, and I stayed home because of university.  this gave me and my girlfriend the opportunity to spend a month basically living together. the relationship was good, I really liked her and she felt the same about me.

the strange thing is that almost every night during that month of living together I would have nightmares, most of them having to do with my CPTSD from growing up in an abusive household. The contents of the dream isn't that important. I thought it was just a phase (you know how anxious or depressive episodes can just happen and go away.) but when my parents came back and she went home, the nightmares stopped. that's kinda insane right??

79,ouaa3k,1627606156,"32M, I’ve never approached a woman anywhere, and it’s making me feel abnormal.","I’m sure there’s lots of people out there who are either decent on tinder or online dating and maybe even have managed to some kind of discussions with women but I’ve truly never been someone to go and approach a woman that I found attractive, and it really makes me feel abnormal. 

I don’t think I look horrible. I’m 32. I own my own condo, I have a cat and a dog, I’ve had relationships, but they’ve only been through tinder. The longest being 3 years and that just recently ended. 

Coming back into the dating scene has just brought up fears from my past. Whenever I would go out to a bar or club, I simply never approached anyone. I just have no idea how or what to even talk about. All I know is that I find someone attractive but at the same time I feel like they might be annoyed of me, of all people, trying to strike a convo with them. 

It hurts because I feel so unhuman, like there’s this part of me that just can’t seem to get over the fear of coming off as a stuttering and bumbling idiot and then them just looking at me oddly and then anyone around me would probably notice. 

The closest times I’ve ever gotten was seeing someone I fancied and trying to approach. But as I got closer to them I just never did anything. I just kept walking past them and then that’s it. It sucks because I just feel like there’s something wrong with me. Like, my friends who are probably just as attractive as me, some even going in sweat pants to bars, still manage to somehow strike convos up and get interest. 

Sometimes I see women looking at me, but they look more confused or concerned? They don’t smile at me and when we meet eyes, they quickly dart away or start talking to someone next to them. It makes me feel like I’m either unattractive facially or something because I know I dress well, I groom myself, I cook, I go to the gym 3 times a week, I’m active but when it comes to just approaching a woman it’s just impossible. It seems there’s just 1000 negatives that can go wrong and not a single one of them is that she will reciprocate me being polite. I just feel like she will laugh, be grossed out, think I’m weird, think that I’m way out of my league and think I’m just not hot enough. 

I don’t really know what to do. I’m 32 and I thought by now I’d figured it out but I just see young women and young guys all managing to get dates, hookups, numbers and I’m still here in the spot I was for 20 something years. I just end up feeling like I have nothing to offer. 


TL;DR: 32M. Still have never approached a single woman when going out to bars or clubs or anywhere for that matter. Feel like I should’ve figured it out but I still can’t muster up to do it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ouaa3k/32m_ive_never_approached_a_woman_anywhere_and_its/
80,ouafhg,1627606740,The date went very well he held my hand and seemed very genuine. This date was 7 days ago and he told me that he plans on hitting me up again to see eachother in about a week/ once he is finally free.,"He told me about he will be out of town helping his Dad move out of his home. He says he doesn’t know officially when he will be finished helping his dad but does not think it will take more than 10 days tops. 

Since our date we have texted back and forth a little and the most recent text was him asking me how my day was and then me replying and asking him how his is. He hasn’t responded yet and it’s been almost 4 days so the conversation kinda died down. He has followed me on social media also recently    

Another thing to add is before our first date he asked me a week in advance and then did not reach out to me until the day of our date so I don’t think that he is big on texting.

82,ouajut,1627607174,"Girl just broke up with boyfriend, I'd like to ask her out. Not sure when or how to do it.","I (30,M) met a girl (27) in my summer class, which just ended. We only had class/clinical twice a week but within that time I saw her every day. From the very beginning we vibed really well, sat next to each other in class, had lunch together every day, became good friends.

I had a crush on her from the beginning but she had a boyfriend. Things apparently weren't going great with him, to the point where I asked if she wanted to hang out back in mid-June - she declined (well, actually said she'd let me know...I didn't push it and we never talked about it after). After that I assumed they weren't breaking up and so I just enjoyed being friends.

Last day of class was this week, and during lunch she tells me her boyfriend broke up with her over the weekend and we talked about it for awhile. With that in mind I'd like to ask her out...here's where I'm seeking advice.

She just broke up with the guy. I don't know how long they were together, I think it was more than 6 months but less than a year. As much as I'd love to ask her out today she needs more time than that to process everything I'm sure. Plus I don't want to be a rebound. Next thing is that I only texted her directly a couple times this semester and it was mostly school related - so I'm not really communicating with her right now and if I started suddenly texting her or gave her a call that would be pretty out of the blue. Thirdly we got put into separate classes this fall, so moving forward I'll be lucky to see her once-twice a week in passing.

Any ideas on what to do? I kinda wish I'd texted her more during the semester so we'd be talking but she had a boyfriend until recently, I didn't want to seem weird. TLDR what do I do about the timeline, what can I do in the meantime. I've dated/had a couple relationships but I don't have that much experience for someone my age, so I kinda feel dumb asking.

83,ouaoyi,1627607713,Have you ever had a happy ending that had a rocky start?,"I was struggling with a person in my dating life, without getting into too much detail, they were selfish and never ready to commit to me and hurt my feelings often and strung me along for awhile, but I believed (and still do but with no expectations) that they were a good person and once they got their shit figured out, they would apologize for how they treated me and we would end up being happy together. 

This thought process changed dramatically when I explained how I felt to my friend and they said ""do you really want the mistreatment you endured to be apart of story you tell your kids?"" And I kinda realized I was being unrealistic, and even if he really did do a complete 180, things would likely never be that good because of trust issues and resentment.

84,ouaqns,1627607891,First date to just friends: viable? Problematic?,"This one is mainly for the women here...

I (M) have always found it a bit difficult to be “just friends” if I’m the one that has been rejected. To be attracted and pretend that this isn’t there while wearing a platonic mask has never been something I was comfortable in doing.

Recently though I’ve been a lot better in this regard, just accepting that it is what it is so long as my feelings aren’t that strong but my question is this:

If you went on a first date that went well but you both felt like it wasn’t going to work or you felt like it wasn’t going to work, how open would you to being just friends?

To me it makes sense to be friends because even though at first you mutually thought there could be something there, at least there was enough common ground - and this means that while the guy might not be a good match for you, maybe one of his friends could be.

On one hand I feel like this is “using” the other person to “get dates” but I more so see it as a good opportunity to expand your circle of friends and meet new people.

At least this way the “failed” first date (or successive dates) could still be something of value to you both.

2021 rolls around and my best friend overdoses early February. He was my brother. I have neck surgery in March that puts me out of commission for two months while I heal. Most debilitated I’ve ever been. I then lose my old job through no fault of my own. Now I’m a courier (good money tho). I go on tons of dates (hinge/bumble/tinder) and almost none of them pan out, which is unusual. I used to be great at dating, now I’m getting turned down or giving friend vibes or what have you, even to people I’m barely attracted to. It feels like I’m cursed. 

I’ve never felt less confident. Nothing seems to be working out. And all I’m doing is aging. 

The weirdest thing is I’ve been self-improving for months. Fixing old scars with expensive surgeries, bulking up on creatine and protein, straightening my teeth, buying clothes, investing in myself in every way.

91,oub6vo,1627609610,A recent hookup hit me up. I don’t know what to do.,"I was wild about this girl in the stupidest sense. 500 Days of Summer wild. Pixie manic girl or whatever they call it. I was lonely, unemployed, living with my parents, and not much of a womanizer. Suddenly this gorgeous woman I met suddenly took interest (using that word liberally here) in me.

We'd hangout for a day. I would try and sleep on the couch, and she'd say her bed was fine. Then she'd say ""We're not hooking up."" I never even made a move or tried to bring it up. She'd invite her ex out when we'd be hanging out (he never ended up coming), flake on plans, tell me she thinks I'm hot, tell me we're not hooking up, say super sexual things, then say we're not hooking up again. I mean it was obvious I liked her, but I never brought it up or made a push for it for as much as she talked about sex.

So we ended up hooking up one time. She put her hand on my thigh when I was falling asleep and we had sex. Granted we both were drunk but it happened and it actually was... kinda passionate. The next morning she told me not to tell anybody, that she doesn't hookup with friends, wouldn't let me kiss her when I asked if I could when we were cuddling. I told her I liked her and she just went ""...why?""

Anyways I just felt like shit. I liked this girl. I was comfortable around her. We really did click. She's hot as fuck (probably why I'm so torn, tbh). I made a few attempts to do things afterwords but they never worked out. I just deleted her number and moved on.

So here I am 6 months later, employed with a good job, a 1BR apartment (which is a big thing for a 24 y/o in my city) and doing alright socially. I ran into her at the grocery store and we talked for a few minutes and I told her what I was up to and she went ""We should do something,"" I made up an excuse as to why I didn't have her number and she said ""I'll text you!"" She didn't.

Then after a therapy one session where I started fucking balling to my therapist (unrelated issues) and she told me to focus on what's important in my life. I was sitting on my patio pondering what was important an hour after my session, and like fucking clockwork, my old hookup walks RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY GODDAMN FACE. She told me that her roommate is moving out and she doesn't have anything to do and we should hangout. I just went ""okay but I still don't have your number."" She said she'd text me. Didn't think she would. Then on a Friday night I get a text saying ""I'm at a concert and every guy here looks like you!"" or something stupid that was just an excuse to text me. I really didn't think it would happen. I responded. She didn't. She was probably just testing the waters on how I felt about her or something. Idk.

So now I'm in a situation I didn't think I'd be in. She actually does want to do stuff. I want to think ""maybe things have changed? I'm not an unemployed shithead anymore. She saw where I lived, and maybe she's willing to try something out with a child who doesn't live with his parents?"" but the smart part of my brain knows she probably just wants a mindless hookup or attention or something.

I usually don't have an issue forgetting women. I've had dates that have flaked since then. I just deleted their number and move on. But some reason, this girl is like an embodiment of my self-destructive tendencies and something about that drives me fucking wild.

I know what the answers are going to be, but anybody have any advice?

I definitely don't want biological kids. I may be open to adoption in the future. But I know a kid is not coming out of me. 

I would get matches, dates, etc. I often get asked how many kids do I want and I say none and they're shocked. Like dude it's on my profile.

And I've made the argument before that having kids aren't a guarantee, like being infertile.

Anyways, I had met a guy and things were going so well. He told me how it is not a problem for him that I don't want biological kids. Today he comes over to my place, we are intimate, and upon cuddling he tells me he doesn't think this is going to work because he wants to have a family in the future.

I told him it is not guaranteed they will be successful, or better the world, cus at the end of the day it is their own lives. He argued that with good parenting it can happen.

99,oucaas,1627613806,Confused by the outcome of this,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room.
