2,og8cfb,1625754539,Rough Time Communicating (sorry long post),"my partner (25F) and I (24M) have been having some communication issues. Recently she has had a family member in the hospital for a couple weeks now in critical condition but now improving. It just feels like I have been becoming a little bit of a punching lately. I understand her situation has been rough on her and her family and I have been trying to be emotionally supportive to her as much as possible and come see her when its possible. 

She recently got upset with me at me when she called me. She called earlier but then called her friend to tell her something so I assumed she was going to take a while which is usually what happens. I get a call back in a group call and she wanted me to walk outside to ask me something but I just needed a 1 min to grab food while still being on my headphones and she got upset with me about. 

Later on in the night she tells me that I am insensitive because I took a nap but still replied to her texts (I was gone for work from 9am-8pm and had a long hour commute).

Also mentioned that I play sports (only played like 3 times in the past 3 weeks) the time she calls me. then mentions I don't properly eat, sleep, study and finds it unattractive.

I stay up for every night since the incident because she feels anxious to sleep and it helps her sometimes but only when she asks/wants me to. Eating has been just the past 2 days because it has been hectic.

I own up to the times I am in the wrong but now it just feels like I am not doing anything right and that I am an awful partner to her. I will take the blame for the sports part but its a way for me decompress and help me talk to her with a clear mind.

3,og8gez,1625754869,Literally about to be 27,"I barely had a first real relationship. Didnt last long and also lost my virginity to him at 26. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed bc of it. I lived a life where I pushed away alot of guys due to own personal issues like not wanting to face judgement or hear my family members have opinions about the one I love and just feeling like im incapable of love pretty much on top of also really just focusing on myself. I graduated from university with an undergrad degree and just recently graduated from an ADN program. Im a very reserved individual due to always being judged about what I do or who I associate with from my family.  

I always saw myself getting into a relationship once I was more stable in life, which I felt like now is the beginning of that time as once I pass my boards I can live a fully independent life and move out of my parents house again. Moving back was hard once i finished undergrad. 

I care way too much about what people think and I think that is what has set me back from actually being happy. 

But I really am embarrassed that it took me soo long to get into a relationship.. allow myself to be vulnerable and lose my virginty.

It seems likely because the only reason I can see for why some women find being tall attractive is because they see it as more ""masculine"" (which I'm not even sure why people think that, but it seems they do) and a large penis is also seen as masculine while a small one really isn't. It almost makes me feel like I should avoid any woman who likes the fact that I'm tall, or who I know only dates tall men, bc she's probably not going to be okay with what I have down there. Hell maybe I should even lie about my height on dating apps and then be honest with the women who hit me up about my actual height because at that point I'll know they didn't just see my height and decide to talk to me for that reason alone. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with women who like tall guys I'm just saying I feel like they probably also expect other things that I just don't have.

I (M/18) am in love with someone (F/18) who loves someone (M/18) else.

I love her, I really do and I have told her about my feelings but shes in love with him. 
Even though they dont talk and when she told him she loved him he just said ""Love?"".. and they never talked again since then. 

It hurts me because I just want her to be happy. And she said he's the only person who'll be able to do that at this moment. 

So now I'm trying to be the good guy and support her and its really painful to hear about her feelings for someone else. So one day I told her... can we not talk about him now. Then she got angry?!

I don't know what to do. Ive tried forgetting about her but I can't. I am really in love and like, everytine we do something we enkoy it and eachothers company and there is chemistry bit she says she feels safe and warm and at home when we're together but she says she doesn't think it is love

So what do I do?

6,og8nte,1625755484,I cannot believe how many guys want the ‚Äúgirlfriend experience‚Äù with no commitment,"I am a woman in my twenties. I do not have sex until I‚Äôm in a fully committed relationship.

I‚Äôm in no rush for one, and so I don‚Äôt pressure any guy I‚Äôm seeing for it. However, I‚Äôve noticed a trend with guys I and my friends date. They want the ‚Äúgirlfriend experience,‚Äù but without the commitment.

What this means is that they want you to just see them, have sex with them, date them, etc., without being in a relationship. Essentially, this means you have no commitment, and they could go be with other people with no problem.

These guys are not ‚Äúalpha males.‚Äù They can be short, average looking, whatever. In fact, the average guys seem to be the worst with this!

What‚Äôs maddening is that they don‚Äôt understand why I won‚Äôt date them for three-six months and give them sex with no commitment. 

I‚Äôve only fallen for this once, with a guy I was seeing post-breakup. He wanted to take it slow and get to know each other before dating, which I agreed with. However, soon, he began whining and whining to have sex. For six months. I never did, but as soon as I said no deep kissing or other intimate things (no oral sex, but heavy rubbing) until we got to know each other better, he said we‚Äôd be better off as friends. Then immediately tried to be FWB.

Earlier this year, I started dating someone who respected my personal beliefs, and began a relationship with me after we got to know each other. Even though I ended things after two or three months (he had some financial issues), the experience with that was SO much better for me and him than if we had gone back and forth for four to six months.

There was so much less risk this way. Every time I chat with someone on a dating app who wants to hook up ‚Äúbefore‚Äù a relationship, I block. Anyway, I encourage everyone (both men and women) to not give anyone the relationship experience without commitment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og8nte/i_cannot_believe_how_many_guys_want_the/

2020 was rough. I dated a toxic guy who treated me like shit. I let him ghost me 4 times and each time I fought for him harder. Now that I think of it, I don‚Äôt think I even liked him that much. However, the fact that he didn‚Äôt treat me well, made me fight for him even more. I felt undesired and disrespected, so I wanted to prove to myself and him that I was worth it. Sadly, he ended up sexually assaulting me one day. 

Fast forward couple months, I finally felt ready to date again. Thank you therapy and my wonderful friends. I am now dating someone I love deeply. Not only is he reassuring, he respects me in a way that I have never felt before. He had easily become one of the most important people in my life. When I opened up to him about the sexual assault, he was surprised, but simply accepted me and listened. Furthermore, when I had a mental breakdown about it, he just listened to me. Outside of that, he is such a good listener and makes me laugh like no other. I‚Äôm meeting his family this weekend and I am nervous but so glad I get to meet the people who made him to be today. I am so full of love and feel so loved. Life works in mysterious ways people. Don‚Äôt close yourself from good people. And if someone makes you cry, run from it.

I realized that being anything but sales person, manager or a ""CEO"" (read self-employed ""hustler"" with no employees) puts you in an unenviable position on dating apps. At least here, girls want consultants. Sales guys with ego bigger than their brain.

It's happened to me many times. I refuse to fake / creatively rename my job position just to appeal to this new demand from the opposite sex. My career is fucking great so far. I have an enviable position and make a lot for my age. Also, I like the role, it suits me.

I decided if I was going to do this I will comit to it and do it right, I took my time choosing my photos, I do not use any filters btw. I am an avarage looking woman at best, but I am not ugly, like most girls do, I get a lot likes, anywhere between (10 to 100 per day althought the 100 happened a few times only tbh I was surprised) anyways, most of them were from creeps over 40, but I did found some interesting guys in that pool, I tried to never match with more than 5 guys at the same time so I could maintain personalized conversations and not feel overwhelmed. Anyways, from what I have read in here, I tried to be proactive, not leaving all the burden to the guys. When I talked about shared hobbies it wasn't like ""oh I enjoy that too"" I explained why I liked it an my opinions in the matter, how I came to like or find such and such, and conversation wise it seemed to be working, my first date was amazing, we spent the night together but that was a mistake on my part, a few days later I asked him out again, we went out, spend the night together again and the morning after he dumped me, cool times. I tried to shake that off and kept going, mostly the rapport I build with guys was about videogames, they were honestly excited I liked a lot of the same things and actually knew what I was talking about. Music and movies was a great hit as well and I tried to keep comversations short 3-4 days before I ASKED THEM OUT for a coffee, and they all said yes. Each time I was super excited because conversations were easy, fluid and they all seemed happy I had asked them out, one even said to me he was coming back home after getting a haircut and buying a new shirt because he was THAT excited about it...3 days before the date he stops replying, then the following 2 attempts I made literally blocked me the day after I asked them out and they said yes. The 4th one also ghosted me, this shook my confidence and self esteem pretty badly, I erased all my profiles (2) and have been feeling like crap for a few days now. I don't know if I want to try again but if I do, I need to do it differently I think, I don't mean to throw myself a pitty party, and I know a lot of people will say I dodged a bullet with these guys, but you know how people say that if you keep running into assholes, you are the asshole? I feel that might be my case and I just can't see how the hell I manage to scare this guys off  so quickly that I don't even get an explanation. Any input, especially from guys will be highly appriciated. BTW I don't know if this matters, but the guys I talked to were between 32-35.

22,ogb8yz,1625763059,"Ladies: If you've been dating a man and he hasn't kissed you after a few months, would you kiss him yourself, or end the relationship?","I (M25) was in a relationship with my ex (F25) for about 5 months and we were friends for 6 months before that. I never kissed her during that time. I know, I know. I'm an idiot, she thinks I'm gay, etc. But I resolved to let her set the pace with kissing and being intimate. 

Here's why: In my past relationships I tended to move too fast with physical intimacy, and my relationships often turned into fwb type situations before fizzling to nothing. We had the physical connection without the emotional one. With her I wanted to build an emotional bond before establishing a physical one. I overcorrected. Also, she's religious and a virgin. So I wanted to treat her respectfully and move more slowly. I thought that she would appreciate that - I was wrong. Long story short, she never made the move and neither did I. Then she broke up with me because she didn't believe that we have as much physical chemistry as we should.

But the thing is, I'm really attracted to her. I was just way too hesitant to make any moves. I think that she was very attracted to me as well, but she's a more submissive person with this type of thing. Things are now over between us, but I still have a lot of strong feelings for her. 

So I guess I have two questions: 

1. If you were in a relationship with someone who was a bit passive when it came to physical intimacy, would you make a move yourself, or would you walk away? I know that this will be different for different people. But I'd just like to hear some outside perspective. I expected my ex to make a move herself. 

2. If you were to walk away from a relationship like this, what are the chances that you would take your ex back if the two of you got back together and he was more purposeful about touching, kissing, snuggling, etc.? I'm thinking about calling her up and asking for another date. And I want to be less shy about what I want with her, as long as it feels right.

The night rolls around and I'm on my way to the restaurant we agreed on. I arrive on time and I see her but as I begin to approach her outside the restaurant entrance I notice she has a weird expression on her face. I don't think to much about it and just assume it's her anxiety. I giver her the typical greeting and hug, tell her she looks incredible and compliment her prada heels that were honestly works of art.

I'm not an idiot so I ask her ""look, do you really have somewhere to be or am I not what you were expecting? because if there's somewhere you're needed then I don't want to keep you but if it's me, we should just not waste each others time."" She takes a couple seconds to reply but admits that it was me and I wasn't what I looked like in my photos. I thought this was odd since they're normal photos but I don't let it get to me and take her at her word. I let her know it's fine and that I also feel bad for making her come all the way here after taking the time to dress up. I ask her how she got here, she says uber so I ask if I can pay for her uber ride home. I truly felt bad. 

She hesitates to accept my offer but then accepts and I summon the uber. As we're waiting she says a few times that she also feels really bad for this and that she hopes I'm not annoyed. I remain honest as I'm a pretty chilled guy and reply with ""I'm a little gutted. You're very beautiful and it would have been nice to get to know you but I'm not your type so it is what it is."" She doesn't reply and just looks kinda sad. The uber pulls up and as I open the door for her to hop in she gives me this weird look but this time it's an anxious, hesitant look as if she didn't want to go but it was definitely too late to go on with the date. She hops in nonetheless and I jokingly tell the driver to ""keep her safe precious cargo on board."" she smiles and the driver laughs. As I close the door, I keep thinking of the hesitant look she gave and say ""text me when you get home so i know you're safe"" she replies with ""I will"". 

I get back home, hear my phone buzz. I read the text ""I'm home, thank you for getting me a ride back. I'm sorry for tonight."" I reply with a simple ""No worries, time to rethink my photos I guess."" I go to sleep but the next morning, well late morning for me. I wake up to another text and it's her asking if I'd be willing to meet up with her again in the next couple days. I don't really know what to say as she did express that I was not at all her type but at the same time after talking I did sense she was hesitant to leave but at the time thought this was just be inhaling large amounts of copium.

38,ogcgmh,1625766597,Could you give me some advice guys?," 

But please. I don't things like laughter or say anything like I am only complaining... I really seek helpful advice.

I broke up with my ex 4 months ago. Our relationship lasted only 4 months....

I had until now a really hard time emotion wise. I could overcome my sorrow thanks God. I tried to date again, but I am introvert and really shy. I don't like to speak with girls that just pop up on the street. I tried online dating and got many matches. From German girls or Romanian(m nationality) girls, but it seemed that I am really boring or at least this is what some girls told me. I am more the humble, modest and quiet guy. I like to enjoy the time in peace and have a relaxing chat.

But many didn't write me back after 1 day. I don't fear speaking to women, but I really have a hard time to keep a discussion alive with women. Physically I speak with women only by opportunity like when more people meet or most of the times online. I also saw that with many I didn't have any type of resonance. I like to read about IT, but also feed my thirst of information with facts from different topics like history, theology, geography or languages. I am a nerd I guess....

I also don't to drink and smoke at all! I don't go to nightclubs, disco, pubs or clubs. In my honest opinion I think I should spend my time with the nature by biking, taking long walks with a backpack with water and a snack.

I wish to live my life with moral values like being helpful, honest, respectful, friendly. I have this thirst and hunger to always reach my goals. Right now I am unemployed because of COVID-19; but I succeeded in achieving my technical degree in IT and now if I am unemployed I used my potential to make some Sysadmin courses and find another job, even better paid!

I know I have my downsides as well and I am not perfect, but I really don't in finding a fitting girlfriend for me.

I can tell you how I treated my ex(she was my first love). I always watched her in the eyes, smiled, hugged and told her what a huge treasure she is for me, that I loved her and always offered emotional support on phone or by being with her physically. I never went empty-handed and always brought her something. Never forgot about her. We used to close the lights, wait for the night and turn the radio on playing music. We hugged and slowly danced. I always wanted to make her smile and show my affection and support in all her needs.

But even now I struggle to find the right woman for me....

I have had to give him thousands for rent.,"Although he is the sweetest, my biggest problem with my boyfriend is that he is absolutely incapable of working.

He just stops showing up at work simply because he doesn‚Äôt feel like it until they fire him. He makes up excuses not to go and instead he just sits at home and plays video games.

I spend hours applying him and writing out cover letters for him (mind you I am a full time college student and I work full time so I am already extremely stressed as it is.) only for him to complain about the jobs I apply him for.

I am really struggling to get over this. It sort of feels like how I would imagine a breakup would feel (I've never been in a relationship so I wouldn't actually know haha).

42,ogcqyu,1625767415,"Having dating and sexual experience will help you make better choices in picking a long term partner, and will allow you you to be better in your relationship.","There are tons of posts from really young guys and women who are fixated on a friend, an ex, or believe they are deeply in love with their current girlfriend/boyfriend, and are already proclaiming that they want to settle down.

When I see this, I recall the mistake I made when I got settled into a relationship my early twenties without any significant dating history, and eventually got married. Although I don‚Äôt regret it, we were together for 15 years and had several good years where we were in love, looking back my lack of experience at times made me (and likely her as well) dissatisfied, and was a factor in my eventual divorce.

I met her when I was 22 and she was twenty. I had only had sex with two girls prior, and no true relationships. She was the first attractive woman who paid any significant attention to me. After we had been together for several years, I proposed, because I thought that‚Äôs what you did if you are with someone who checks most of your boxes. If I was honest with myself, I wanted to date more women.

As I got older, this itch became greater. I stayed faithful physically, but mentally I was constantly lusting after other women. It was unhealthy, and didn‚Äôt help me be the most present and best husband I could be. I also needed to do some work on myself, which I didn‚Äôt realize at the time.

This wasn‚Äôt the sole reason I got divorced, but this pervasive emotional distance was a factor.

I‚Äôm not advocating for throwing away a good relationship so you can sleep around, or be a fuckboy seeking constant validation from as many women as possible.

However, I do believe that everyone should have an extended period of their lives where they date for just for fun, to see what they like, to gain sexual experience and confidence, without a serious relationship as the objective.

This way, if you enter into a relationship with someone, it‚Äôs because you are genuinely excited to be with them, not out neediness or a belief that you won‚Äôt find someone else.

Additionally, you wont be as eager to please and be a pushover, because you have confidence you can find others out there if things fall apart. An abundance mindset is much easier this way.

When you are young, take your time. Have fun, gain life and relationship experience before deciding to put your hopes into one persona prematurely.

We went on 4 dates in 2 weeks (I know this was quick and a bit against my instincts, but it really felt like we couldn't get enough of each other) and our dates were ending with us talking on my couch until 3am.

On our last date we almost had sex but didn't because I started getting really in my head wondering if it was too soon, worrying the dynamic would change etc. He was cool about it and didn't pressure me, but I am afraid my behavior came off as wishy washy and insecure.

A few days later I texted him to let him know that I had gotten in my head but would love to see him again. He said he was up for it but had a busy week (2 events he had to travel for back to back) but definitely after. Since then we've exchanged a few playful texts (initiated by me) but no plans have been made. I feel the ball is in his court and I guess it's a waiting game, but I find it a bad sign that he didn't really make an effort to text or check in after our last date.

I find this tends to happen a lot with me, where it's like guys seem really into it and pursue me so heavily in the beginning and then suddenly I feel something shift. It's like I can have fun on early dates but ultimately don't know how to cultivate something with longevity, and then I get in my head already expecting it to end. I wonder if maybe I should be better at pacing out the dates to once a week instead of jumping into seeing each other so often in the beginning, but it's hard because of course it's exciting when you really connect with someone. Or maybe i need to get better at identifying and communicating what I'm looking for (???)

I was traveling back home after a trip, so I took a bus -- he asked me for a my number, we texted a bit, and now we're meeting for coffee this weekend.

I have pretty low self-esteem, and honestly it's because I was not desirable at all in high school and early college and it really messed with me. COVID hit during the end of college for me, so I didn't date. I've always been thin but I was super awkward and shy, plus I'm black and grew up in mostly white environments which was definitely a factor. I think now, it's maybe not so much that way since I seem to notice and get more attention from guys now (regardless of race), but we were wearing masks when I talked to this guy. I saw him without his but I didn't take mine off.

I guess I'm just worried he'll see me and think I'm ugly lol -- he only saw my eyes and the bridge of my nose anyway. I guess I'm also just overthinking a lot because it's all very new to me, but at the same time I'm keeping myself a bit distanced as sort of self-preservation, I suppose.

65,ogfmuc,1625775884,Fear of commitment and ending to date someone," I (M, 31) met a girl (F, 30) in April over a dating app. There was chemistry and we continued meeting and in end of May we became romantically attached. The first strange thing was that I was quite into her before we became romantically attached and afterwards I started to have doubts.

Maybe that's because of my previous relationship that lasted about 8 months. In the first months I was really into her as well but over time my feelings became less and less until we broke up. So maybe that's one reason why it became difficult for me to just enjoy the time together and see where it goes. Another reason is that dating a girl who is in her thirties as well makes me feel pressured in regards of founding a family. It feels impossible to just date and see where it goes. If we split after one year that sucks but for her it could even mean she wasted one year before its becoming difficult to start a family due to biological reasons. Now I'm unsure if my lack of feelings and doubts is due to us not being that into each other or because of some fear of commitment due to past experiences and feeling pressured overall.

In addition to that we texted about the future today. She said she would like to marry within the next 2 years (and probably starting a family soon after). For me marrying within 2 years and potentially starting a family soon afterwards seems quite early. Seeing all the divorces and unhappy marriages I'd like to spend more time together before marriage and family. On the other hand I''m in my early thirties and dating girls in a similar age does not leave you with that much time. So we talked about stopping to meet today as we have different plans for the future and will meet on the weekend to make a decision.

Now I'm a bit unsure what to do. On the one hand I think we just met and after such a short time it's difficult to say how much potential the relationship has. On the other hand I'm not fully into her or even in love. Though I'm not sure if that's more because of some fear of commitment. Also for me it's difficult to imagine to marry someone within two years. I also don't want to play any games. I like her and want her to have a happy future. So telling her marriage within 2 years is a possibility just to continue seeing her would not feel right. Continuing to see each other and to strengthen the bond just to split some time in the future would makes us both unhappy.

So to start off, I have never really been in a relationship. However, this last weekend my brother tried to set me up with this girl. We spent three days together and I have to say it was some of the most fun that I have had in years. We spent a ton of time together and often paired up in party games and tubing all weekend. I noticed that when I was around her I felt more confident and outgoing than I ever have before, I was also constantly happy when I was around her. From what I could tell she also had a great time as well. However, she had to leave on Monday and she lives about three (soon to be eight) hours away, would it be weird/awkward to try and contact her? I only ask this because despite spending all weekend with each other we didn't really get much time to really talk to one another without family being there so I don't know if she has similar feelings or even if she was interested at all.

I've gotten better over the years, but these last few months have set me backwards due to some family and medical issues. 

During a silly argument/miscommunication I got so frustrated I threw my ring that he got me at his desk near him, and started bringing up irrelevant things to make the situation worse. Needless to say, he said I won't get that ring back. My heart just sank.

I feel so embarrassed, ashamed and sad. I have to do something different in my life because I don't want to be like this anymore and i know he doesn't want to be around it.

I did grow up with a father who was demeaning, emotionally abusive, irrational, physical, and a mother who was soft spoken, walked on eggshells and struggled to abort the situation. 

I know this has a huge impact on how we are but I can't use this as a reason for my behavior for this long, in old enough to be growing.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to enter the dating pool now, and seem to have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt have anyone to discuss this stuff with, so I‚Äôm counting on your wisdom, kind Reddit strangers. 

A bit of background: I met my former girlfriend in third grade. I had just moved to town and she was the star child in our class. I‚Äôve always been good at studying so we ended up becoming fierce competitors and got into arguments almost every day. When we were 14, (after a series of events) she told me that she liked me ‚Äî I did too, but didn‚Äôt really have the guts to tell her myself ‚Äî and we started dating. For the next 3 years, we were almost inseparable. We had all our first together. Things were going perfectly well, but right before our final year of high school she got diagnosed with leukaemia. She did not survive it. I went into a really dark place after that. I don‚Äôt have much family to begin with, and even stopped talking to the few friends I had. I retreated into a shell, and after a few months of debilitating depression, I managed to get myself to work enough to get into a good university. 

At uni, I continued to avoid people for most of my first year. Thankfully, a professor noticed this and connected me to a therapist who has been helping me deal with all of this. I‚Äôve made significant progress since then ‚Äî I eventually built a small social circle and was doing fairly well in school. At the suggestion of the same professor, I applied for a transfer to a much more prestigious program. Because they offered me a very generous scholarship, I ended up accepting it. It was right about that time that COVID hit. I ended up spending last year in the same city. But now I‚Äôm moving to a completely new place where I don‚Äôt know anyone, entering my final year of uni, and I‚Äôd like to try dating again, but I don‚Äôt know how. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you so much for reading! I‚Äôm really sorry if this sounds a bit awkward and forced ‚Äî this is the first time I‚Äôm openly talking about this, outside of my therapy sessions.

I‚Äôm so much out of my depth here that I don‚Äôt even know what advice I‚Äôm looking for exactly. I welcome anything you folks have to offer!

Met someone last week from Hinge and we hit it off pretty well and we are planning another date for this coming Sunday. For our first date we went to grab some dessert and then played mini golf afterwards and just had a ton of fun. Unfortunately I am really limited in my time for the next week so the only time I could meet up for a date is after 5:00 PM. So I was just wanting to run some date ideas by you guys and if you have any recommendations I am all ears.

I was wanting to grab dinner with her since I will be pretty hungry coming from work and on our last date she jokingly mentioned that we should have got dinner as well since we survived the night on beer and ice cream. I really wanted to go ice skating, but our nearest rink is a little far so might have to save that for a different time.

So I think I am set on getting dinner, but I would like to do something afterwards as well. There's a cool historic spot in a nearby city that is right on the river and it has some interesting shops and restaurants. It even has a smaller ferris wheel that would be kind of cool to check out. But I am worried about this cause it would literally just be dinner and walking around. It is also a little bit of a drive and I have not been there in a while so I'm gunna have to rely on google haha.

Was also thinking of some of the following activities, either after or before dinner. We could go to a wine and paint night, play board games somewhere (no idea where though haha), or do an escape room. There is an escape room in the old area of the city so it would work out well. Are any of these okay? I have overthinking this but I do not like to wing things.

We have been talking since the end of March and had our first date at the end of April. We have been on 3 dates total now, last one was on Friday. 

Last time we went mini golfing and got smoothies. I paid for golf &amp;amp;amp;amp; she spontaneously paid for my smoothie. We aren't exclusive either, at least right now. 

I talked to her 3 days ago because I wanted to touch base about how she felt about how things are going between us. She told me she isn't looking for anything serious, but wants to keep going on dates with me. She said that she wants to see me again and explicitly stated that she isn't friend zoning me, but that she doesn't know what she wants right now, and I don't exactly either. She seems happy with how things are going though, and I'm just kind of getting to the point where I'm starting to like her a little bit. I guess that's a good thing based off what she said? 

I don't know what I want either and also keeping my options open. I do like this girl though but want to control my feelings and build off of what we have. 

She told me she doesn't sleep around. After our last date she said she was down to go back to my place, but wasn't ready for sex. All 3 dates we have had some pretty intense make our sessions. This last date after golf/smoothies we danced in my living room to country music then cuddled and watched a couple movies. We hung out for almost 6 hours. 

Whenever I'm stressed out, she texts me the next morning wishing me a better day. She's also mentioned that she wants to take a trip to Austin and sends me tik toks of stuff to do down there. She's texted me at night before saying that she wishes she was with me, we've been talking for over 2 months now so we have plenty of calls, FaceTimes, and texts between us in addition to dating. 

The last few days we just briefly chatted it up on snap. Flirty at times and other times just back and fourth selfies and usual normal snap convos. 

From here on out I want to play my cards right. Tell me if I'm reading too far into this, but we have a 62 day streak on snap and I sent a message to all my streaks this morning and she opened it 2 hours after I sent it and didn't reply when she usually does. I've never double texted or overstepped but for some reason it seems weird but I'm probably just over thinking it.

And they're like no that's not the same thing cause girls who want rich guys are gold diggers. And I'm like ok repeating a phrase your dad taught you doesn't qualify as an argument. Try again.

And they're like women who wear makeup are false advertising. And I'm like it's not false. They're advertising the fact that they can make themselves look hot but you can't get any richer, not even temporarily.

Can you even afford a pool like where are we going swimming?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oghm3p/what_are_some_ideas_for_a_first_date/
89,oghpei,1625782105,Texting first‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve been seeing a girl for over a month and we‚Äôve seen each other maybe six or seven times. 
Things have been great in terms of chemistry, conversation and intimacy between us but one thing that I don‚Äôt get is that she almost never texts me first. 
I‚Äôve probably been the one to ask her out in all the times that we‚Äôve gone out and I get some girls might like to be the one to be asked out, but I can‚Äôt even recall getting a random text just asking how I‚Äôm doing. 
Right after she left from our last date she texted me that same night saying how much of a good time she had and how she thinks I‚Äôm really sweet but it‚Äôs been a few days now and I was hoping she‚Äôd finally come around and be the one to initiate this time. 
The last time almost a week went by before I finally caved and just decided to text her. 
What should I do? Should I even read into this? Am I making too big a deal over nothing significant?

Thanks,",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oghpei/texting_first/

91,oghuzp,1625782595,What's the difference between establishing exclusivity and asking them to be your BF/GF?,"I know everyone is going to roll at their own speed but a lot of things I've seen online say that you typically establish ""being exclusive"" after the first month or so, but that you shouldn't ask them to be ""official"" until a little later after that. What is that period of time in between called, and do those events NEED to be separated? 

I've been seeing this girl 5 weeks now, and it's been absolutely amazing. Date 2, which was a week and a half of knowing each other, we told each other that we were not seeing others, and liked to just date one at a time. Was that establishing exclusivity? Does there need to be another conversation to do that? Or am I allowed to just ask her to be official now? We talk/plan like we plan on being together a while, have been intimate sexually, and I've even met her entire family already. I kind of feel like we are naturally just falling into a relationship, but apparently I have to make things ""official"". And before I do that, I have to talk to her about being 100% exclusive.

92,ogi1fc,1625783161,for women: Is it acceptable to date a man who suffers from depression?," First, please excuse my bad English; I'm not a native speaker. 

I'm 24m, and I've been dealing with depression for 6 years. My last relationship was 4 years ago, and it didn't last more than three months because I was going through a hard time, and I saw her going down with me, and I would NEVER let that happen to someone I loved, so I let her go. 

For the last 4 years, I've avoided any contact with others... 

 But I recently fell in love with a girl on Reddit, and I'm not sure how I'm going to tell her that I've never felt this way in my entire life!

..I swear every time I saw her, I felt alive again, this was the first time in so long that I felt happy!,

I've had a massive crush on her for months and don't know where to start, and I was a little worried if my depression was a problem.

 I don't want to do anything stupid, I don't want to lose her, I just want to tell her how much I love her. Any advice on where to begin?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogi1fc/for_women_is_it_acceptable_to_date_a_man_who/

94,ogidgj,1625784243,Why do I feel blocked when stepping towards a girl?,"For some reason I (20M) am blocked by myself when trying to meet girls in a club. When I see a girl which is obviously into me I am for some reason incapable of stepping towards her. It feels like something is holding me back for no reason. It feels like that word on the tip of your tongue but you can never get it. When friends of mine tried to push me towards girls I always stay put, pushing just as hard back. I always say that I will do it later, but it never happens.

This happend to me in the past and I thought that it was because I weight more than the usual person at that age. The past couple of months I have been working on that and lost quite some weight because of it. I felt proud and thought that any insecurity's would have flown away.

Last week I went out to a nightclub after a long time because of COVID. The same thing happend again and it's bugging me ever since. I try to think about what is holding me back but I can't think of anything.

Why am I blocking myself while trying to step towards girls? Anyone has had a similar situation and how did you solve it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogidgj/why_do_i_feel_blocked_when_stepping_towards_a_girl/
