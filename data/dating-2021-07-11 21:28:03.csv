Do I ghost?","Hi all, I'm new here so please let me know if I'm outside of the normal etiquette for this sub.

Basically I decided to start using dating apps a couple months ago. I was feeling anxious to be in a relationship, especially since I will be graduating college soon, and because the pandemic finally slowed down. During that time I started talking to a few people, and now there's about 3-4 people that I've been consistently messaging.

When I started using these apps I made it really clear that I was looking for a relationship and that I wanted to take things slow, and most people seemed good with that.

What I realized recently is that I am *not* in good enough mental health to be dating. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, and my therapist saw right through my facade of fake confidence and pointed out that I have incredibly low self-esteem. I have no stable or healthy relationships in my life right now and lack an understanding of what that looks like.

The paragraph above is more or less what I've sent to the guys I've been talking to. I've also added that I'm probably toxic and that the only reason I want their attention is for a temporary boost to their self-esteem. I've also mentioned that I'm in therapy working on myself and working with my doctors to make progress.

Despite ALL of this, none of the guys I'm talking to want to stop dating. They say ""it's not a big deal, I'm understanding, I can help you"" but I am not looking for someone to fix me and don't want to put people through toxic relationships. Since they don't seem to care, do I just ghost them?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oii5c5/i_23f_realized_im_not_emotionally_in_a_good_place/
1,oii5f3,1626057023,"Girl says she likes me back and has feelings for me, makes plans to hang out but takes hours and hours to reply to texts/snaps","I met this girl a little while ago and quickly caught feelings for her. In person, we seem to get on really well. When it's time to part ways, we'll stick around and keep talking for 30 minutes. She maintains strong eye contact and we laugh at each other jokes, etc. but she also seems slightly nervous around me at times. There are several specific incidents that happened that would make you think, ""oh dude she is totally into me."" Among those are examples like: she would sit next to me during lunch break (at work) rather than her best friend, and when I asked her to hang out outside of work she seemed totally interested and started suggesting times and gave me her snapchat when I didn't even ask for it (I asked for her number and that's when she gave me both).

HOWEVER, she takes absolutely forever to respond to texts/snaps. I don't just mean like an hour or two. She will take anywhere from 5-15 hours, sometimes even longer,  to respond to messages, and even if I sent it directly after she just messaged me. And on snapchat, I will notice her snap score rising while I am left on delivered for hours and hours. On top of that, when she does reply, her replies seem fairly dry and lack-luster.

Now normally, I would see all of this and just assume she's not interested and move on, but one day I eventually opened up to her and told her that I have feelings for her etc. and she responded saying that she also likes me and those feelings are reciprocated and that she truly enjoys the time we spend together and the conversations we have. Not to mention she has texted me once out of the blue to make plans to hang out. Unfortunately, of all the plans we made to hang out none of them really came to fruition. Mainly because of bad weather and really unfortunate timing between our schedules. 

So what gives? I'm really stumped on this. I want to move on but when she said she has feelings back it just confused things. It's like I'm dealing with two separate people. 

TL;DR Girl I like told me she likes me back. We have a great time in person together with long and engaging conversation, but in text/snap she takes ages to reply and replies with very basic and low-effort responses like I'm annoying her or something. I also get the sense she is deliberately ignoring me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oii5f3/girl_says_she_likes_me_back_and_has_feelings_for/

His response put me off so much, so could someone please tell me if he’s being cold, does he sound uninterested? I can’t even tell if he cares or not anymore...

My message to him:

Heyy I was meaning to bring this up with you when I was at yours but you seemed a bit distant when I tried so I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable or cross any boundaries. I’ve noticed your energy has been off lately when I see you maybe the last two times and I’m not sure if it has something to do with me or other things.. I notice because you weren’t ever really like that for the first few months and it feels different being around you lately. When I first walked in yesterday and for the first couple of hours after that I felt this distant energy from you and I realised that when that happens it makes me withdraw without noticing because it makes me feel a bit insecure not really knowing what you’re thinking about and whether it has anything to do with me being there. I know you warmed up to me and it definitely got a lot better as the night went on but I still feel concerned because I like you and I also am trying to not put up walls when I’m with you, and I’ve definitely been doing that without realising. It's conflicting because your energy has been fluctuating even if it's really good at points And because of everything that we spoke about the other week I can't help but feel insecure about it. Regardless of whatever it is I just wanted to be honest with you and get this off my chest, I hope you’re feeling ok, thank you again for last night 💜

His response:

Hey, I'm sorry if I was giving out those vibes. I don't mean to but when I have alot going on I tend to pull back and be distant. I'm just all over the place mentally and I'm going to be up and down for some time I think. I hope you still enjoyed yourself

So hear me out, with online dating being the current trend today, the story dates back to when I matched with a boy who I dated for the next 3 month. I went to 1 Christmas and barely interacted with the family since he preferred if we hung out in his room most of the time. 

Almost 2 years later, I am back onto dating app, hoping to find the one. Swiped upon his brother. Is it wrong to swipe right — only to see he have already sent 3 flowers (ladies on CMB knows what I’m talking about).  

I mean, is it okay to date his brother? Also his brother and him are close however they never talk about dating life to each other. But all their friends sorta are of similar if not the same group. Also makes it a bit weird.

After another casual relationship turned painful, im reflecting on what I told her. I really liked her, and even have some feelings for her, but there was just something that didn't quite feel right for a forever/long term partner... While explaining myself to her, I referred to it as a ""light switch"" that ""needs to turn on in order to feel safe commiting to someone in a long term serious relationship."" We were talking for enough time for this to be a really painful separation for us both. Made me think I should never get too involved with someone unless they are THE one.

It really hurt us both to let her go... but I'm wondering if there's a healthy way to pursue a relationship without having that ""light switch"" turned on that indicates this person is THE one? Do I really have to just keep searching for THE one? Or has society just convinced my subconscious that that person I commit to has to be perfect for me? I want to fall in love...

Anyways... Im 100% done with casual stuff and just going to make friends and take everything slow until I feel confident I'm interested in a serious relationship with the person. But that has never happened to me... I have had tons of casual flings and never felt like I met THE one... Curious if I need a perspective change... wish there was a wiki here? I don't even know what dating really is under the hood... the psychology of it... why humans even need long term partners... Maybe I should have stayed with this girl.... Not sure what I need to turn the ""light switch"" on... I don't know what it means to feel safe with commitment. Please help.

11,oijgjq,1626062023,Approach or just forget about it,"So I’ve (w20) have had a crush for about 4 months not on a guy (idk how old he is but he seems older) at the gym. When I first saw him he seemed to look at me lots and it was obvious. At first I was thinking that accidentally kept making eye contact with him but then I noticed he purposely looked behind him to look at me. I stopped going to the gym so I didn’t see him for about 2ish months. Once I started going again I started seeing him everyday. At first I wasn’t interested but the attraction grew. 

Why I thought he was interested- He seemed to look at me a lot. I once brought a friend with me and she asked if I knew him because he was looking at me a lot. 

I’m not even sure if I would want to be in a relationship because I could kinda tell that he’s flirty. 

Why I think he’s not interested- he seems to talk to everyone there. I thought he didn’t talk to me because I was a women but he talks to them all the time. It felt like I was looking at him a lot more now :(. Anyway, there was also a time where I was running and he had smiled and me and I froze (kept running but didn’t smile back) so I think I ruined it there. And as I said before he seems very flirty. There is also this other women that he obviously has taken interest in. Once I saw this I gave up.

She told me she was leaving in two days and so I messaged her asking if she wanted to hangout. 

At first she said that we could hangout in the morning but I had work that day so I couldn’t but she was leaving on Sunday (today) and this was Friday that I met her. I asked if she wanted to hangout at night we still could, she invited me to go out with her and her two friends at first, but she wanted to go to an 18+ club, and i only turned 21 recently but partying sober seemed unappealing so I said I wish we could go to a real club, but that at 2am we could still hangout if she really wanted to.

Oh it’s also important to mention that when she originally responded that she asked me if I knew of any 18+ clubs and I gave her a name, and that’s when she invited me. It turns out that club was closed and I get a message saying that I could bring a bottle to drink at her hotel room and hangout with her and another couple. What started seeming weird is that she sent the message but with her friends name at the end, so her friend probably grabbed her phone and asked for the bottle (they wanted Hennessy lol). She said that’s what her friend wrote and her friend even put her name at the end like (- name). I just put laughing emoji’s and said that’s doing too much.

She said that’s what she and her friends drink and asked me what I drank, but I just left her on read. She then messages me again 30 min later saying I can just come over with nothing saying “they said if you wanna come you can,” and idk I was already hanging out with my friends so why would I leave to hangout with a bunch of random people when I’m just trying to get at this girl.

I ended up saying that “I’m good, but thank you,” and she responded “oh okay.” I sort of felt bad so I told her that I was at a bar (not true, I was drinking at at a buddies house, but a bar sounds cooler lol )watching the ufc fight, which is true. 

My friend said I should’ve gone but something seemed off and they were a year younger then me so maybe they just wanted alcohol or something. Also, her friend sending the message could’ve meant so many things but they were probably just trying to see what they could get out of me, plus I forgot to mention that she never followed me back lol. 

I feel like if I would’ve been inexperienced or naive then I would’ve gone, but at the same time I could’ve had a good time and with alcohol getting involved maybe something interesting could’ve happened.

The odds were not in my favor lol, but she seemed genuine when she said that we could hangout in the morning the day she left, but it just started to smell fishy.

I forgave her the second time. I forgave her the third time, but I decided to break up with her, because I am at the point that I just can't trust her to keep it between the two of us.

20,oik96f,1626065186,I cant stop feeling envious when my friends who are girls talk about the guys they are into,"I realized 6 months ago, that I was always desperate and trying to get into a relationship, to the point that almost every girl I met who I found attractive, I would try and get into a relationship with them. It did nothing for my self-esteem and made it worse. I know it isn't my looks because I know I'm good looking, it was anytime I was with a girl I liked I always stifled my true self out of fear of rejection and afraid that I wasn't good enough. Someone had suggested to me that its because I've been putting girls on a pedestal, and that I only see them for relationships, since then I made it a goal of mine to only be friends with girls and nothing more, 6 months later Im really good friends with a few girls and they are all awesome and I couldn't ask for better friends and I'd be devastated to lose any of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, anytime we are talking and they bring up relationships or guys they are into, I start feeling envious, and bad about myself. Hearing the way they talk about guys they like makes me feel lonely because, I feel like no one has ever felt so enthusiastic about me the way these girls feel about their crush. 1 of these girls I have a crush on, but I promised myself that I wouldn't try and get into a relationship because I feel like I would be doing it out of desperation from being single and not because I like who she is. Since then she started talking to a guy I know, and we were hanging out at 1 time and I had to listen to them flirt with each other for 30 minutes. 

The same thing has happened to almost all of my friends who are girls, at one point in time, I develop a crush on one of them, and I never tell them because I feel like I'd be telling them because I'm desperate to be in a relationship.

Anytime one of these girls talk about their crush or the guy they like I start subconsciously comparing myself to these guys, asking in my head, ""What does he have that I don't? Is my personality not good enough? Am I not good looking enough?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

And at the same time I start hating myself for thinking these thoughts, ""Why are you thinking like this? You should be grateful you have such a good friend, you should only want to be friends and nothing more. If you tell her how you feel, she'll think you've been manipulating her by being friends just so you could get into her pants. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of them have been in relationships before and I've never been in one, I feel so bad about myself because I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone, like why hasn't anyone ever felt such immense emotions for me the same way these girls do for other guys? 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do, I've tried looking and being more attractive when it comes to my personality, The girls who I'm friends with have told me how great of a friend I am, like I'm a good listener, and how cool I am, and how fun I am to talk to. Like if that's true, then why hasn't anyone talked about me, the same way you talk about the guys you like?

&amp;#x200B;

We're all in highschool, I'm currently 17 with the girls Im friends with being 16-19. They've all been in relationships before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw someone say that I have to wait for the right person for me, but like whats the point of that advice? There are 15 year olds in relationships who didn't have to wait for the right person for me, and my friends who have all been in relationships before have gone through like 3 relationships already, they didn't need to wait for the right person if they've already been through 3 of them.

24,oiklct,1626066611,She wants to take it slow,"I’ve known this girl for a while, but we really hit things off at a 4th of July party, after we had both had a few drinks. We left together, and I walked her back to her apartment and held her hand but left it at that.

She texted me the next morning saying that she wanted to talk about it, and over coffee I gathered that she got out of a pretty toxic relationship not long ago (probably in the last month, but I don’t know the details of what was going on) and she didn’t want to do anything in the wrong mindset. We agreed that we could take things slow (and more sober) and see how it goes.

The issue is, now I’m not sure what we are. I want to spend time with this girl, but I don’t want it to come off like I’m pushing too hard and not respecting her hesitancy. Do I take her on a date? Should we do more casual stuff without calling it anything? Do I talk to her about it directly, or do I wait and let her make the first move? Then there’s also the nagging doubt in my head that stuff at the party only happened because she was tipsy and that she regrets it but is too nice to say so. I don’t think this is what’s going on, but it doesn’t help my uncertainty as to what I should do in this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oiklct/she_wants_to_take_it_slow/
25,oikmxh,1626066794,"Is it just me, or is it a lot harder to initiate [flirting/touch/romance/chemistry/non-platonic-interactions] on first dates from *apps* compared to those from any other source?","The title is the TLDR, but I'll type out some of my thoughts and background here.

Firstly, I've had plenty of first dates that felt romantic from the start and which involved kissing, touch, etc. So I know that I can do it. But the difference in ratio is pretty stark, like &gt;50% of first dates from the ""real world"" got romantic, and I think I've had one, maybe two, app-initiated first dates that even felt flirtatious, compared to probably 25-30 that didn't.

There are a number of things that partially explain this. Firstly, a lot of the women from apps were just not attractive to me. I wouldn't have even wanted to get flirty with them in the first place. Putting those aside, the ratio is still pretty different.

The other thing that could explain it is biased sample: In other words, if I meet someone in person, or I have already gotten to know her, and we both agree to go on a date, we already know what it's like to be around the other person, and clearly have felt *something* around the other. However, from an app, we don't know if we vibe physically. If I met these women randomly in person at an event, I might never think to ask them out because it might be clear from that we don't vibe.

Even still, it seems to me like there's some extra ""frigidness"" or ""formality"" that gets introduced by the apps. This person feels even more like a ""stranger"" than normal. I've met women in random ways before and established chemistry almost instantly, so I don't think it's just that they are strangers I've never met.

I really want to know: are these frigid initial encounters just because I wouldn't have been compatible with them anyway, and I just have to keep looking? Or is there something I should be doing? I know the tips on how to initiate touch and such, and sometimes it feels natural and right, but on a lot of these dates for me it doesn't feel right at all. I was on a date yesterday and she touched my arm at one part and I had this pretty ambivalent feeling about it :\\. I didn't establish more touch after that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oikmxh/is_it_just_me_or_is_it_a_lot_harder_to_initiate/

28,oikwrm,1626067968,Should I have apologized for this ?," So, this might be a long story but I need opinions on this cause I constantly go from feeling guilty about reacting this way to feeling stupid for apologizing later. So I made an account on an online dating app and only posted one picture. The problem was that it covered my face with my phone but I didn't think much of it at that time(probably was a mistake). The thing is, I met this girl and gave each other's numbers but couldn't meet fast for many reasons so kept texting for a long time(like a month and a half). Since she had no problem texting me for so long and agreed on meeting I just thought that having one pic didn't bother her so much. Well, one day she asks for more pictures and I send her a pic where I showed my face more clearly. She took a while to respond which made me doubt but responded saying she liked the pictures, so I believed her and felt great about that but then when I kept talking with her right after that I get ghosted. So, I wait like 2 days and told her that if I wasn't her type that it was okay, that it was still nice getting to know her; but that also got ignored. Tbh that's when I got upset cause after texting for so long I at least hoped she would send a message saying something, even if it was simply saying that I just wasn't her type. I'm an overthinker in general so then I started wondering if it was simply that or if it was something else that bothered her and reached out again telling her that if she doesn't wanna keep talking that it's okay but that I would like to know what happened cause I was confused and felt bad about it, still no response. A couple of days later I got upset and sent her a message saying that if she ghosted me simply because of the pictures that I could have understood doing that when I first started talking with her but that doing that after more than a month was kinda rude cause I wasn't talking with her simply because of looks. Keep in mind I was never mad at her for rejecting me, I was just upset that after texting me for so much time she choose to ghost me instead of telling me something after I told her I was confused about it. Well, some time later I started to think about that again and thought that maybe she didn't knew how to tell me I wasn't her type and that's why she said she liked my pictures but ghosted me after that. I never saw it that way before so I felt bad and apologized to her telling her that I know I insisted too much and maybe she didn't feel comfortable telling me what happened, didn't get a response either. Also, another reason I got upset was because in one of our conversations she talked about how she was insecure about looks, so I felt it was kinda ironic of her to do that after I send her a picture, it almost felt like nothing she talked with me mattered and that one picture was enough for her to ghost me like that. I'm not saying that because she was insecure she had to keep talking with me if I wasn't her type, but I just didn't think it would be enough for her to not even send one text to me. Also, why keep talking with me for so long if it bothered her that I only had one picture ? Now I don't know if I did the right thing or if it was stupid to apologize to someone who ghosted me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oikwrm/should_i_have_apologized_for_this/

33,oilsgq,1626072037,Only being desired when they're horny,"Hey folks, I have a problem. Laugh at it if you must, mock away and call it first world problems, or sardonically comment that at least you get attention. But here it is nonetheless: the only time women are attracted to me is when they're horny/pent up/dtf/call it what you will. Yes, I'm a guy, and yes, apparently this affects ~men~ at least one man too, as anyone else encountered this? 

I've come to this realization after going on a number of dates as things are opening up again over here (PNW). The leadup varies, sometimes texts are fast and furious, sometime they're intermittent and brief. Regardless of the quality of the pre-conversation, and sometimes phone calls - which are fun, exciting, and definitely heighten the anticipation... then comes the big day. Universally, the conversation flows well, there's a decent number of shared interests, and mutual respect and laughs all around are all present. Sometimes there's even a good night kiss. And yet, afterwards, the dreaded ""I had fun, but I didn't feel a connection/you're not my type/I get a friend vibe"" text comes in, and it's back to introspection, and moving on to the next one.

I'm certain it isn't appearance, since my pictures on the swipe app(s) are recent and accurate, and there's enough draw between those and a decent enough bio that people are willing to go on a date to begin with. And I do get smiles, winks, and the occasional grope from (I'd assume to be) gay men. And the initial texts, conversation, attitude and so forth do stay consistent whether or not they ask to head back to one of our places that very night. But looking back, only the latter ever ends up progressing anywhere, and though the beer goggles sometimes wears off or post-orgasm clarity strikes, sometimes it persists, and looking back, every one of my relationships stared out as a hookup turned into a friends with benefits situation that just continued on. And, well, it's something, but it'd be nice to try and start something based on shared values, positive energy, and passions that aren't purely carnal?

So if you read this vent, thanks for taking the time to? I'm not sure what to do about all this, this was mostly to get it off my chest.

37,oimjxo,1626075662,My online girlfriend of 3 months broke up with me due to depression and suicidal thoughts coming back to her.,"2 days ago my online girlfriend broke up with each other due to reasoning being depression and her suicidal thoughts coming back to her. Note, she's been depressed and suicidal before, she's been the therapist and I know that her mental state right now is everything but stable. To maybe get a better understanding from her perspective, this is what she wrote 2 days into the breakup, after reading a message I sent to her.

 ""While I'm very thankful for what you wrote, you have to understand that I'm in a position of depression and that's why I need to find myself again, find life that was in me a few years back. I just wanna be happy but if I was to keep going into this relationship, stress about thinking is he cheating, are there girls around him. I trust you more than anyone else but these thoughts just create bigger stress on me that I don't need at the moment. That's why I've chosen to remain bestfriends at the moment while I try to just be me at the moment and focus things on me.""

Before this message, she opened up with me, a lot of her depression comes from family issues and stuff they've said towards her, stuff that even me as a guy who has been through hard times in life aswell, would find as painful as a bullet in the heart. These problems have followed her for a year now and the fact that she decide to end it 3 months in the relationship because of the same problems she had when she started it, hurts me. Sometimes it feels like she just doesn't want my help, we really love each other and I begged her to let me help her as that's what a partner is for, be there for you during your best and worst days. She insisted on remaining bestfriends but she still wants to spend the same amount of time with me, talk to me and just me all the day, play with me, fall asleep in FaceTime with me and still tell me that she loves me and will not stop loving me no matter what. She promises that this breakup will not effect her love for me and that when she finds herself, she will come to me, the person she loves. She will not move on nor find anyone, she will focus on herself so when she comes back, she's stronger for ever and then we can make things work out. I know it's only been 3 days now but she tells me that she loves me before she sleeps or goes somewhere, she tells me that her love for me cannot be put into words.

I asked her about the part where she said ""then I have to worry about thoughts of you cheating or girls coming to you"", she said that she fully trusts me and it's just thoughts that come through her mind and make her stress even more. We have argued a lot in this relationship, most of the time the reason being a dumb one, not even worth talking twice about, not mention argue. She doesn't want to worry about arguments or breaking up while she finds herself, thus doesn't want a relationship right now. She's had access to all my accounts and to make her feel better I asked her if she wanted to still have access to them so it would make her feel comfier and better knowing that I'm all about her and I wouldn't even TALK to anyone girl, not mention do anything behind her back. She said it would make her feel better having access so she still does. 

Also another thing to point out, is that during our relationship we've done sexual things on a FaceTime and 2 after we broke up, so yesterday, she decided to start flirting and do it again, even after breaking up. We're pretty much doing everything we used to do as a couple, spend so much time together even though our time zones are 9 hours apart, sleep in facetime and now even do the thing still. She says that even as bestfriends, she feels comfy and trusts me, that's why she does what she does. 

She's 17, this exact argument with the same reasoning happened some days before this and she ended up coming back a day later saying ""she would never leave and she just ends up coming back to me because she can't lose me."" I don't know if she's just confused at the moment and needs some time or if she's breaking up with me because of the arguments and she's just trying to let me down slowly. She did tell me to move on and that she'd keep my heart safe for another girl when we first broke up, but now she's switched up and knows that I'll wait for her and she says that she'll keep loving me the same till she's ready again aswell. She's been through all this before so I doubt she's lying, I believe her and I'm aware of some of her problems, I'd be depressed too.

**My only question is, will she keep loving me the same, will she come back?** We're not distancing from each other, we're still close the same but not in a relationship and honestly there's barely any difference since we still do everything we used to do, other than call each other nicknames and say that we're dating.

39,oimwrs,1626077428,All of my exes have nicknames that they go by.,"I (male 23 yo) have had 3 girlfriends in the past 2 more serious relationships and one naive young relationship that was never really going to go anywhere. I've also had several flings and one night stands but really didn't love these other girls. I was just minding my business just now watching YouTube and randomly I made the connection my 3 most meaningful relationships were with girls who go by nicknames. Names that everybody calls them instead of their real names. I'll shorten the nicknames to just the first letters so that somebody who knows me doesn't recognize the names. ""S"" was my first girlfriend, and it was short lived, but I was just really excited to have a girlfriend and when it ended I was very sad cause it was one of the first relationship I had and you know teenage drama and angst etc. Second gf, ""B"" I was with for nearly 4 years. We thought we were gonna marry eachother lol again nativity. Last relationship ended month or so ago, with ""L"" she was a beautiful soul, but I had to leave the country that she lived in and return to my home country decided to end the relationship because I didn't know if I would return. Anyway, I wonder if this says something about me? Like do I find people who are unsure of themselves or perhaps have low self esteem so much so that they take on a separate name/ identity. I also used to struggle greatly with low self esteem. Basically I feel that perhaps I have a pattern that I need to assess. Like maybe I unknowingly find myself falling for these girls because we both have low self esteem, or I'm unknowingly like taking advantage of their low self esteem or maybe some other thing that could be associated with a nickname? Nonetheless, maybe I'm just worrying and overthinking it, cause nickname doesn't necessarily mean low self esteem, and in fact I'd say ""S"" was very outgoing and sure of herself and the same could be said about ""B"" as well to an extent. Maybe I just feel guilty about leaving ""L"" as I know she has low self esteem and that me leaving her really hurt her. I fear it may cause her to think that I left due to something about her, when in fact I basically was deported. I just want to identify a pattern so I can assess if it's a bad thing or merely a coincidence. I wonder if I subconsciously seek out these nickname girls and take advantage of their vulnerability or low self esteem? I suppose I keep bringing up low self esteem because I think nicknames are weird. Like my name is my name why are you degrading it with this fake name? Who are you talking to? Like it's sort of insulting in my mind even though it's probably endearing if anything. I feel like I'm overthinking this, but thought I'd let y'all into the inner workings of my mind. I suppose that patterns establish a behavioral tendency and I just really don't want to be a bad lover and want to improve for future relationships that I may have. Want my girlfriend's to feel secure and supportive and hope that I haven't actually I unknowingly been an enabler of self loathing or low self esteem in these people. Hopefully this makes sense.

41,oin11e,1626078014,He acts high class lately.,"My (F20) fiance  (M22) lately acts like he had better things to do instead of responding to me or seeing me.

We are almost together for a year. So it started with small things, like not responding to my snaps or pictures of myself i send to him on whatsapp. Like not any response. Even if he is not busy he does it. Then yesterday i text him in the morning to say hi and my messages didnt deliver which is unusual. I got concerned. So i texted his mom and she said that he feels sick and has pain in his throat. So then a few minutes later he himself responds and i asked do you need any help? I said i will shower and come to you right now. (Its almost 3 hours with public transport) and he acts unthankful and says no youre not coming. Not even saying he appreciates my help. Just a straight no. After a while he started appreciating me but still a no. 

So a few hours later i ask if he is doing better and he says “im outside with a friend and doing better”. I was surprised and glad he was feeling better. But then he said: we will see if we will meet tomorrow, depends on if i will feel better. I was so confused because tomorrow is his birthday and we planned shit and he is saying this shit. He says i dont want to make you sick but in the meanwhile he is making his friend sick??


Then i told him he is acting high class and said “bye” (16:20 pm)

00:30 am he called me and said i will be home in half a hour. I said uhu and he said if you dont feel like calling with me you can hang up. I said uhu. He hung up himself and said i will talk to you.

Then at 2:30 am i didnt hear anything from him which worried me again. Called and texted him several times, no answer. I texted his mom again and she said that he is asleep. I was relieved and angry at the same time. He went asleep without talking to me about today, what time we will meet. We alwYs do that a night before.

45,oinqg6,1626081640,You may want to be actively listening to your date instead of waiting for your turn to speak,"I've caught myself doing this a few times. While she talks I'll interrupt with ""oh, yes, something similar has happened to me too! Let me tell you a story that one-ups your story"".

I hate it when other people do it to me, but usually, these other people are mere acquaintances that I meet once in a blue moon and I generally don't give a shit about strengthening a relationship with them.

I am seeing this woman which I really like, and when our date ends I do a review in my head and think ""fucking hell, I did this again, when she was talking about this, that and that"".

One way to reduce this is to let her do more of the talking but I don't want to just stand there silent most of the time.

How should I handle this? Being self-aware for the whole duration of a date is exhausting and I want to let myself enjoy my time with her instead.

I guess I should learn more about letting people speak and actively reflect to them what they said rather than going ""yeah, whatever, let me tell you a story that is better than yours"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oinqg6/you_may_want_to_be_actively_listening_to_your/

After starting my job, I am in talk with a girl and we usually talk very day on text (late night texts too) with a lot of laughing emojis and a lot personal life chats and i felt that she is also attracted to me. Even we had talked about going any place for vacation for having fun (but not actually, just to tease each other).
Now, With a lot of guts, I had asked her out 3 days back over text. Her furst reaction was We still have time and she doesn't answered. But we still were texting. Last night, in texting, again I asked her and this time she replied who else are going??
I was like she is dumb or what??? 🤦‍♂️
Then I sarcastically replied her all our managers and bosses (She is my office colleague). 
Then she replied she asked her only. For this, she replied she is going out with her friends on that day and we can go out on some other day.
Is she rejecting it or what???

To some extent, I feel like being rejected.

We went on three dates which were always characterised with long talks, him opening up, good constant sarcastic humour, passion and politics. I’ve never connected so well with someone. 

Problem: I told him I don’t want to be fucked about and that I like him. He said he really likes me and wants to continue talking and dating. He even wanted to book an Airbnb. I called things off despite him being perfect and now I sort of regret it. 

However RED flag time 🚩
- we could only meet at nighttime as he isn’t out 
- he wanted every character of a relationship without the label

55,oioy4f,1626087572,Realizations on the Strenghts an Weaknesses of a past relationship,"Recently just got out of a 5 month relationship with a girl I'm certain I really cared for at the time but maybe it wasn't good for both of us.
  The both of us have history and early in 2019 in my first year at college I met this girl who I seemed to really click with, someone got me and I didn't mind listening to her problems whenever we saw. We started seeing each other more often and we kissed one night and that was the basic origin. We didn't really have anything in common besides her getting my sense of humor, Not to say my humor is quirky or anything but it was nice to have someone laugh at your jokes
     
        But What I didn't know was that one of my buddies had a crush on this girl the whole time we saw each other, it was a very messed up love triangle, caused a lot of problems between me, him and her and then. So out of morals I decided to stop seeing her, she hated me and I didn't particularly like her as much as well, just for reminders I wasn't attracted to her from the start, it was more of a fling than a relationship and fast forward March 2019, Covid makes its debut so school is shutdown, I don't talk to her for about 7 whole months and since schools out, it made it much easier to keep my emotions in check.
  
        Fast forward again and now its November 2019, schools back in session. My buddy that I said has a crush on this girl was in contact with her the whole time and he knew we didn't talk anymore and he felt bad and encouraged both of us to stay in contact. I didn't really want to cuz I have this rule of never going back on my mistakes or having regrets but Anyways we start talking again cuz he seemed like he really wanted to get us back together, I make sure to clarify if he's okay and has no feelings for this girl anymore and he says yes that it's fine but he feels responsible for our fallout and he doesn't like the shade of guilt on his head. I say okay, so me and her start talking and apologising and getting to know each other but this time we were a little bit more serious about where we wanted the relationship to head, then we start seeing again in early 2020.

So we're seeing now, being sexually engaged and all but our relationship doesn't have a title but simultaneously we knew we were serious about each other, we knew if we saw other it would be considered as cheating even if we weren't dating. Now I knew I really liked this girl the more I got to know her and being my first actual relationship I fell and I fell hard and she made it seem like she felt the same. So over the year 2020 school keeps going in and out of session for the next couple months and her reciding in a different state means we don't see unless at school but we stay in touch and in love if you could call it that

Now it's early 2021, school's in session again and the normalcy of life after a pandemic is on a rise again , I've decided that I like her a lot and it seems she feels the same so I ask her out officially and we started dating on 24th of January but before we date we laid ground rules on the foundation of what we want this relationship to be and about having no secrets or cheating and being honest down to a tea and all that and I really thought that we've made a serious connection, sure we have our differences sometimes but we've seemed to push that aside and work it out over the years and then she tells me one night that she took this picture that's not good and I wouldn't like and all but I should forgive her and obviously I undermine it thinking ""how bad could it be and all"". I ask to see the picture but she said she doesn't have it but I overlook it in that moment and forgave her even without evidence 

Here I am chilling in my dorm one room and one of my friends pulls up an explicit picture of this girl taking multiple pictures with some random guy and they're uncomfortably close I'm talking forehead to forehead in the eyes like they're about to kiss, his hands on her ass just very disconcerting sights and it crushed me that someone who I've spent this whole time opening up to and making an impact with could do this to me, I haven't felt that bad about anything in the last decade. I was absolutely livid, I block her and delete her number .
 
I have a particular blood related medical conditions that requires constant care from both doctors and my loving family and then I was going through some health issues so I pulled out of school in the meantime and then she's calling me nonstop, sending me all kinds of apologies, for about 3-4 days I dont completely ignore her and reply with one word passive aggressive ness cuz it really hurt and at that point I wasn't mad anymore but just disappointed in her. I had such high Hope's and respect for her and never thought she could do something like that and then I decide to confront her in the same week about it after the 4th day of having no solid contact with her, I reply her messages and I wanted to hear a reason for that, she says that it was accident, peer pressure and she wasn't composed when they took the picture and she was in tears during the call with her, absolutely balling her eyes out apologising and regretting what she did and honestly I really wanted to end it but I wasn't  strong enough to do that cuz I still have feelings for her and I didn't think this was reason enough to dump her for this but I forgave her and we pulled through. This is the second biggest problem we've had since knowing eachother 

Okay now it's late February 2021, 5he dramas over, I'd forgiving her and we seem happy again but I'm still home due to to medical conditions, it's been 2 weeks since the big fight and we've stayed in contact since then and we're always texting and calling, eventually after having my health in partial order and despite the consistent fevers and aches I resume school and see her the same night, she notices somethings wrong with me but here's the thing, my health situation isn't a big disclosed secret but I avoid letting people know if need be and that's because the way you get treated by society if you seem weak or incapable of something's and I hated to get pitied on and I didn't like the sight of being viewed as weaker or inferior to everyone else which is why I've held it from her all this time but she really seemed concerned and bugging me to tell her so I did and during confession she cried and kissed me, It was really emotional for both of us cuz i felt like i could trust her enough to let her know about my weakness and I loved her so much I would feel guilt if I withheld it this far into our relationship,

 so yh that happens and now I'm going in and out of school due to my health but now I don't have to lie to her about why I'm leaving  when i do because she knows and understands why i have to and that's been  going on for the past 2 months we've only been able to see eachother once every 2 weeks since then. It's not ideal but we made it work. Then semester takes a break and everyone goes home. So now she's home in a different state and now I can really focus on taking care of myself without school stress and all that but uh oh here comes fight number 3

I notice our communication has taken a dip, I call her and she doesn't pick up ever and when I text her she barely replies so now I'm really concerned. She tells me she's going through an existential crisis and she can't explain it and i know she has issues with communication now so I keep pestering to tell me about what seems like a secret to me but she doesn't yield so I interpret the little info she gives me as her parents are pressuring her about her academic work being disappointing to them and she's had problems with them from the start of the year which I knew about and comforted her whenever I could and I keep trying to reach her but she stops texting back one day, so now I'm ghosted for 3 weeks and she texts me randomly and I see it and deliberately ghost her because I'm mad and then she asks me why I'm ignoring her and I tell her because she's leading me off and I can't help her because she won't open and now she's apologising about the ghosting and tells me she's going through somethings and I obviously want to help her go through because it's my job and if she won't tell me then I'm not a bf I'm just a fwb but I forgive her for the ghosting but she still won't tell me what the deal with her at home is

This starts to cause some problems between us because I feel like she doesn't trust me enough to tell me what this is but meanwhile my health is getting worse I've been diagnosed with avascular necrosis and it's causing some mobility issues and I'll need a new hip surgery every 20 years to have my life back and I'm absolutely devastated, I need someone to talk to about how I felt like a liability to my family and if im worth spending such money on the surgery, feeling suicidal at times and then my gf tells me one day she's taking a break from social media and our communication and now I'm furious because she literally just apologized for leaving 3 weeks ago without disclosing the reason to me and then i see her snapchat status literally the next day after ""leaving social contact"" and now I'm overwhelmed with my health situation and her unavailability to be there for me as my companion and i decide to call her but she never answers so we're fighting now again cuz I tell her why won't she just tell me why she's leaving it would make me understand better but she won't disclose it and its frustrating. So I send her a very long text about how the way she's behaving is upsetting me and we go back and forth through the argument. I can't call her cuz she won't answer I can only text her directly and she's still pretty much active on social media after telling me she's taking a break and I want to talk to her about the state of my physical and Mental health over the phone and not text

So I decided to break up with her over text because I didn't want to be in contact with her once in a full moon as a companion and then she doesn't text back. That was last 2 weeks and then last week after having to deal with my mental health through the intervention of my loving parents I got over it without any help from my so called ""girlfriend "" cuz she's not available obviously so then I feel bad for dumping her like that and I text her if we can talk and then she calls me and we talk about our feelings at this point I don't bother asking what's going on with her home cuz she still won't tell me and in the past week I'm trying to get her to forgive my obvious mistake and I didn't really mean to break up with her and how I was just in a bad place and felt like no one was there for me. So throughout last week we've been talking but she's not sure about getting back together and I'm trying so hard to swoon her back but we've been going back and forth, she says she wants me back but she's scared that what happened will definitely happen again and how she wont always have time for me because she's trying to get her grades up and as being rational and I say I dont mind and I'll wait until she can create time for me.

Over the past week I've been trying to make it work by being level headed and logical, trying to give her space while still trying to get back together but she's rather difficult telling me how she's forgiven me and she loves me too but she's thinking about it and still feels indifferent and I've apologized so many times but she says I really hurt her and I clearly didn't mean to say I wanted to break up but she keeps making me feel like shit for it. God knows I'm deeply immensely sorry and I've made her know that I'll be better and it wont happen again but she's not having it. So I gave up and told her she shouldn't lead the next person after me on like this and then she explodes and says that I'm trying to guilt trip her into feeling bad for me and calling me selfish and all that and even after I agreed to her frustrations and I stopped disagreeing with her and being in line with her concessions about me. She called me selfish and I'm trying guilt trip her and I'm not the victim here and after all I'm the one who broke up with her then she says she's glad to be done with me, so I tell her I think she needs some space and so do I then she says that we're finished and I still haven't replied.


First off I really don't resent her for this decision to be through and I still strongly think she's a good person but just misguided and confused. I dont think I deserve to be forgiven and I've done nothing worth to be forgiven over but what I know without a doubt is that I put everything into making that relationship work, body, soul and a lot of my mind. 

Secondly I know I wasn't the problem. The problem stemmed from her lack of trust with me as her bf. She didn't know how to get in touch with her feelings and if she doesn't fix that, it's going to ruin her future relationships as well 

Third off. The fact that she based the future of what was left of our relationship over me trying to emotionally blackmail or guilt trip her is mind boggling  to me. If I really wanted to make her feel sorry into the feeling of getting back together with me, I could have brought up her explicit pictures she took and absolutely crush her into feeling sorry me but I didn't. 

Conclusion: I know my worth, I may not be the best person out there but I know I value a relationships mental health over everything else I did and not everything in life can work out as you plan but that's okay. I'm obviously hurt by this break up but I'm more enlightened if anything, it's made me realise a lot and develop myself as a person. I dont regret having this for the past year of my life and rather I'm grateful I was able to experience such a surreal moment of my life

I'm 23, a girl, and my boyfriend (my first boyfriend) is turning 27 in December. We've only been together 6 months, and I know December's really far out, but I'm 99% sure we'll still be together by then (unless something crazy happens between us). I'm also really bad at coming up with gift ideas in general, which is why I usually try to start thinking about gifts for people this far in advance so I have time to come up with ideas. I've never even had to buy a birthday present for a guy before, so I just have no clue what I'm getting into. I definitely don't want to just get him some random gift card though. 

There's also the issue of this being the first gift giving between us, which means that I guess I'm setting the tone for expectations on gifts. We weren't dating yet during my birthday or Christmas, and we were still extremely new when valentine's day came around, so we didn't celebrate it. I'm not really sure what level of gift is expected between newish (about 1 year) couples. How much money is generally expected to be spent? $5, $20, or $100+? I just have no clue.

He's interested in soccer, golf, and his college's football team.

68,oiqmf0,1626094296,Any advices if possible?,"Hello  guys. My ex and first love broke up with me last year, i was going  direct to no contact but i saw that we still had some kind of ""residual""  relationship. I gave her time and space and after some time she  messaged me 3 times. She said she wants to see me, calling me and   entering even on my discord server when i was with a friend cuz she  misses me etc but i ignored  all her messages like a stupid. Like  ghosting her

Time passes, she had a  rebound and when she broke up with the rebound, i was telling myself  that is the time to apologize because i was feeling very very guilty. I  reached out to her, I apologised and i said that i don t want to lose her and that in case of something bad happens, to reach out for support if she needs to. She responded but i saw that she appears moving on  from the situation and i was vey very stupid for the mistake i made only  because for my ego, but we had a friendly conversation though. I  apologised to her but she said that it doesn t bother her at all this  thing and i was like wtf? missunderstanding?.

**My question is, should i  continue staying in NO contact after i reached out? Or should i reach  out again? Because i feel guilty that i ruined my situation with my ex  and i feel that is my fault that she moved on after i ignored her ( she broke up with me at first )**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oiqmf0/any_advices_if_possible/

We’ve been “talking” for all this time though. Sometimes on a daily basis. 
Fast forward to now we’re hooking up. Idk how it happened but I’m glad it did. I understand a hookup now and then doesn’t really mean anything. We’ve actually been on a couple “friend” dates. 
I’m mature enough to know he sleeps with other people and he dates other people. I’ve been around. It doesn’t bother me. 
But what does it mean that he texts me daily? What does it mean when he intertwines his legs around mine after sex and doesn’t immediately kick me out (I kick myself out)
What does it mean that when I went on a date with another guy, I got a text from my hookup asking how things went (meaning did I bang him?)
I don’t like that I think about this guy so much. But I do. He makes me laugh and is hot as eff.

Just wondering what others make of the situation. Should I continue to be chill about it and keep letting him make the moves? Or should I ask him what’s going on and risk losing a good thing? I think I’m worthy of a dinner date or something every once in a while. But is that moving too close to relationship crap? And I hope to hell he’s not on Reddit.

74,oir9dc,1626096559,Where To Meet Outdoorsy Women,"My question is pretty simple : How to Meet Outdoorsy Women?

Background:

Right now, Im doing my very best to try and get a mix of serious and casual dating. I want to get married within the next 8-10 years, but I don't want to miss out on the fun of dating as well.

When it comes to the casual dating scene, I dont have much of a preference, as long as we get along well and there is some spark.

On the more serious dates, the first thing I 'look' for (or want) is their love for the outdoors. I've loved the outdoors since I was a kid and I always will. By love I mean how much do they hike, bike, swim or even would they rather be outside than inside.

The problem with this, is I cant seem to meet women who have a similar love. Most don't.

76,oirale,1626096676,Ghosted...again.,"My high school crush and I reconnected four years ago and had a brief fling. It was the sweetest time of my life, and I cherished him so much. He has issues with anxiety, and I think starting to date was a lot for him at the time. The fling ended by him ghosting me, and I was extremely crushed. It took me months to get over. 

Fast forward to now, and this past March we reconnected again. HE actually searched me on a networking website and added me. Of course, the spark came alive again between us and we started an internet fling that lasted up until a couple weeks ago. He stopped responding to my messages, and I ended up deleting the profile we were communicating on out of a fit of rage and sadness of feeling ignored. 

I feel so much emotional wreckage of being ghosted again. I have dreams about him every night. I miss him, so very much. We have such a special connection that I feel like I want so badly. But because he ghosted me again, I feel empty and broken. I feel as though I'm not good enough for him and I never will be.

We started DMing every night until 3am for about a month and she was always saying how special I was to her and that we should hang out. I eventually worked up the courage to tell her how I felt about her and she says she felt the same way. She got out of a long relationship in January and we both want to take things slow

After that it was like a switch was flipped, we stopped texting all night, barely a few msgs a day, sometimes at work she wouldn't even say hi to me just walk by, always cancels plans we made. We used to to hang out 3-4 times every week, but now its been like 4 in the past month. Now I can pretty much count on her having to cancel or postpone. I asked her about why things were different and that she is more distant now but she says its just because she's tired which I can get, but is this more? I only told her how I felt about her a month ago and she said some really nice and sweet things about how she felt. She doesn't say that kind of stuff to me anymore, which I miss. Shes just different now and it seem like she doesnt put in as much effort, it feels like a lot just trying to get to her to text me now. I'm perfectly fine with us taking it slow, but now it feels like something is off with her.

 I'm not sure if she still feels the same way about me but when I asked two weeks ago she said we're fine, but she seems more distant now than she ever has. I said we've always been close and she always tells me very personal things she's going through so I didn't think its that, she would have told me about it.

82,oirr9o,1626098208,Need advice for 29 year-old wanting to initiate a relationship.,"Im a 29 year-old male who has not had much success with dating. I was raised with some bad ideals around dating, and never tried to initiate a relationship through high school or college. I had no idea what to do with crush/attraction feelings. And essentially never learned how to communicate attraction and ask a girl to date me. 

I was in one bad relationship out of college where I was very much in love with her, but she was essentially with me because there weren't any better options at the time. When a ""better option"" came along she left and married him after a few months which messed me up for a long time and I didn't want to be in a relationship for years. 

I've been on about 10 first-dates since then with girls I either was set-up with, or met on dating apps. All of those interactions never lasted more than a few dates as either one person or the other just wasn't feeling it. 

Recently I've been volunteering at a theater and there is a woman there that I like a lot. I think she was interested also for a while because she initiated us talking about music through instagram dm's. The problem is I think we talked too much too soon online and my eagerness made her back off a bit. Over the past month I've been trying to keep it casual and not force talking to her, so we've had a few more fun conversations in person that I think have gone fairly well, but I still feel like anything ""big"" will scare her off once and for all. My time volunteering with her is coming to an end soon though and I'm worried I won't have an excuse to see much of her after. I have very little experience and much less success just asking if a girl will go out with me, so I have no idea how to approach this. 

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oirr9o/need_advice_for_29_yearold_wanting_to_initiate_a/
83,oirsfp,1626098315,I need more from my girlfriend but I'm in a tough conundrum,"My girlfriend (19F) and I (19M) have been dating for two years now and a heavy portion of our relationship has been long distance. With long distance comes problems and lots of them (at least for us). Our first year together, we lived about 1.5 hours from each other and I'd make the trip all the time just to see her for two or three hours and this slowly became the core reason for my happiness. 

//sidebar//

When I was 16, I had severe depression and was close to a lot of things I wouldn't like to mention but as a point of context I believe may be relevant. I still suffer from anxiety and more often than not close myself inside a shell and stop communicating. It's bad I know but I can't help it. 

//sidebar over//

To continue with our story, we slowly developed very strong feelings towards each other and she became the light of my life enough for me to tell her that I wanted to marry her and raise a family together with her and just in general be with her for the rest of my life. These feelings were mutual. 

In our second year together, my family and I shifted cities and I was thousands of kilometres away from her. We kept fighting on and off for days in between because she couldn't give me attention when I needed it and I couldn't give her the attention she needed. This became tbe central point of all of our subsequent fights. She shifted close to me (still a half hour drive) about 6 months later and I was so excited to meet her and spend time with her. 

I'd make the 30-60 minute drive as often as I could and we'd again meet for maybe 2-3 hours which was enough for me to stay happy for weeks to come. Lockdowns hit (yes multiple) and we were separated yet again for 3 months. This was another tough problem to get through. We managed and now we're in present times. 

The situation as it is now, her family is over and she's spending time with them before they have to leave again and for the past two weeks I've been going through finals week and submissions combined with general college pressure with family pressure as well. It's been hard but every day I've been trying to fake a smile and try and be happy for her sake so that she doesn't have to face the same emotions and overwhelming feelings I do. I'm in my final week of exams and I really need her but she won't respond to my texts because she's spending time with her family and I don't want to seem like I'm asking for too much especially because they've come to visit from so far. 

I talked to her about this but there isn't much I can say because they are her family and I cannot be so needy as to constantly ask for her attention especially when she's just trying to have a fun time before they're gone. 

I guess it's also worth a mention that the past two weeks have been absolute hell and every day I've been just fighting loneliness and sadness.

(Also if you think we're too young to be making decisions like starting a family or more of that sort or if you think we shouldn't be together please don't say anything because I really love her and I want it to work)

Am I a bad person for wanting her to treat me with extra care and caution and give me attention when her family from far is visiting her?

Thank you for reading this far &lt;3.

So after 10 years in Las Vegas, (I'm from Vancouver originally) I moved to Florida to help my mom out who lives in another town here, and decided to move to FL for a change.

I used to travel all over the planet, and be really adventurous. But I have a few anxiety disorders (run in family) and I get headaches now if I drive too far. (I have therapist, psych doc and CT/MRI all clear so Neuro says Migraines and gave me some meds so I just have to limit my driving and things like that).

Well the issue is, I have a nice home with good trees and peaceful and all that.......but I've been on like 4 dating apps and there are like 7 people in my area for months...all smokers and love country music lol....and I can't drive far to meet people that I match with and possibly get to know them?

So do I just have patience and hope someone cool eventually shows up, or do I actually sell my house and move because dating is sorta important lol.

I had no issues dating in larger cities at all, but I'm not used to small town dating especially since I'm sorta stuck now because I can't drive far....and people I've connected with further away aren't willing to come out to see me in rural Florida lol...nor do I want to ask them to do that etc.

I'm a guy, mid 30's, my job is e-commerce online etc, 175lbs average build, average looking, with a cool dog lol.

I'm like 50 miles west of Orlando and 50 miles North of Tampa.

I like the area, I have a nice little boat for the lakes, my dog loves the big backyard and I like the cycling trails.....but yeah not being able to go on any dates or meet someone for a relationship at all after almost a year is getting pretty boring.....

It just seems ridiculous that I would actually sell my home that I like and leave a place that is nice and peaceful because I can't find anyone fun or special to spend time with...but yeah.......do I just hope someone eventually shows up in the area that I connect with well....or that someone wants to visit me out in rural florida lol?

Also it seems to me that it's the guys duty to make more of an effort in arranging a date and getting there etc....opening the door and all that.........so it feels odd...do I put in my bio that I have this driving limitation now? or bring it up later? and is it really strange to mention to a woman that she would have to make the effort to come and see me instead of me driving there? ....that pretty much seems to limit my possibilities to very few or none lol....not ideal.....as it seems odd to ask a woman to make the effort to visit me ? instead of me going to them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oisxpq/moved_to_small_florida_gulf_coast_town_from_vegas/

I told him I wasn't looking for that, and he said he was fine with keeping things as is.

I like spending time with him, and I'm attracted to him, but my problem is that he's really not smart and is unambitious. This was fine at first, but I've become increasingly annoyed by his stupidity and have found myself less attracted to him because of it. Him wanting something serious also turned me off.

I become more of the person I want to be everyday now that I don’t have anyone draining my energy.

There is no way I can even think about dating again right now, because anytime that I do have free from work/school are dedicated to me. And I refuse to do online dating again because I want to meet someone “naturally”, which would obviously take longer, should something like that even happen. 

But some days- like today- are tough. 

I can’t help but long for some sort of romantic companionship (but not from my exes). What can I say? I love love. Everyone says that you need to be happy with yourself and by yourself, and I am.

She accused me of harrassing her, then she started posting stuff on her vsco profile about me or smooch pics, she knew I was looking over her profile, she even posted a song picture named ""treat you better"" I thought I hurt her really bad that I started pouring my heart and started posting for her, started being better for her. 
I realized that she stalked me on one of my photography alias account. I started telling my side of story there. I did what I could but she was telling everything to her friends, they would come where I work and eat lunch or dinner, I was the hard working dishwasher taking care of dishes from two floors. I had to ignore her everytime I heard them talking like, ""you are gonna go under him!"" Or ""he is so cute why isn't he talking to you?""
I got so angry after hearing those words, I tried to change myself for her and she told everyone for what? Friend points, they laughed at me in street and even at work.
I have a promising future I am getting a degree in psychology and I am a long term trader at 21. 

She just kept making things worse, so last week I posted that you should block me because I don't wanna see your profile but again I couldn't do her like that, stubborn me!
I really went to work on july 10 and tried to apologize to her about everything, about how and why I ignored her, why I stopped talking (mainly cause she would talk to people who were saying racial comments about me), she stopped me and told me that let's leave it and never talk about that. 
I felt really lost at that moment.

I never told her that I came back to dishwashing for her, I never told her that I changed for her, it's probably my fault for even starting to interact with her because as soon as I told her that ""at least give me a chance to explain myself"" she accused me again for harassing her. 

Last night July 10-11, nearly 1.24am a group of drunken boys and girls came down my apartment window and they were screaming that, ""look that guy lives here"" and ""hey dude come on down"".
One of them tried to knock on my apartment door at 1am.

I was really sad about how the things went down, how I didn't started talking at times and she went to talk about that in a big group. This was happening nearly every weekend, drunk people would come down my apartment window and they knew my name, but last night someone tried to knock on the door. 
I am a different guy, I've been to an army academy and learned shooting rifle when I was 15, I never wanted to scare her with this info thats why I kept her away from my life. I'm in financial trouble and life problems are piling up slowly as I'm growing. 

I still love her but it's a mental toll to keep this all in my mind so I decided to post it somewhere.

So here's a simple yet super confusing tale about the initiation of my second decade and my second love (or mistaken love),

I'm really fucked up right now, can't think straight, I had to leave the job cause everyone at work are on her side, they think I really enjoyed harassing her, they don't know anything about my side of the story.
