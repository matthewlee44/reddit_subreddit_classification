So, I want to keep it short: there's a guy at my gym that seems to be into me. He hadn't shown up at the gym for 4 months, until last week. Before that, we had never really talked but greeted each other. 

Last week, when I saw him again, we chatter for a bit and I asked him for his name. He seemed very happy to see me again and tried to make some conversation.

After that, this week we have seen each other twice on the street (I live right in front of my gym, so we've seen each other on our way in/out). He stopped me to chat each time and gave me a kiss on my cheek as greeting (not weird in my country, but a bit weird because covid). 

I never see him alone. Mostly, because he has a twin brother and they are always together, so I feel a bit awkward talking to him with his brother next to him (who never really talks to me). 

So, I don't know how I'd ask him for his number or try to talk a little more.

On the other hand: going to the gym for the past 6-7 months is like, the best part of my day. So I'm afraid if things go sour with this guy, it'd make things uncomfortable.

Is it normal to have a post mortem or two and discuss how the argument got so out of hand? Or should we just move past it? 

Should we both apologize to each other? Or just drop it?

She actually put effort into conversations early on, which was a nice surprise. A couple weeks in on our 2nd ""date"", I asked her what her intentions were, and she said she's got a lot going on right now and couldn't offer much, so for the next few months she's just looking for friends, which was disappointing, but I'm also fine with it, because she is cool to hangout with. 

From what other guys said, I figured she was just letting me down easy and not even serious about the friends part, but in the two months since, we have been hanging out at least once a week, sometimes twice. And now she's talking about driving me around the country next month on a camping trip, so suffice to say she is at least serious about being friends. Two weeks ago, I asked again if she would be open to potentially dating, and got mostly the same response; she says she isn't in the right headspace for a relationship, but said she ""wouldn't be opposed to it in the future, maybe in a few months"", and would let me know if she ever decides she wants to date me. She then said ""but don't wait for me.""

Well, I guess my question is, do any of you think she is serious about potentially dating me, or is she just saying that? Is it possible that she actually is interested, or could be in the future?

I'm 25M and never really put myself out there in regards to dating or anything romantic (the spare few times where I did were not successful), but I am trying to make an effort as of late and am feeling a bit overwhelmed. This effort has been constrained to apps like Tinder and Bumble as I don't really know how exactly to meet people and connect in person.  However, I find these apps aren't exactly making me confident or better about myself.  Plus the ease of rejection and lack of responses on these apps is taking a toll on me emotionally to be honest. But if I delete them, I'm pretty much shutting myself out to this world and committing myself to further loneliness, which isn't exactly what I'd like to do!  I have recently gone to both the Tinder and Bumble subs and got decently positive feedback about my profile, yet that doesn't seem to translate into matches.  I'm in fairly good shape and I'm not in dire straits or anything in regards to my life, so I don't think I really need to do any material overhaul of my life in order to start dating, but there is a strong mental block that has been in the way for a long time.

There is this feeling that due to the fact that I missed out on a period of development that most went through, I am handicapped when it comes to this stuff.  I feel as though I'm pretty poor at engaging in small tall and initiating conversation.  I'm trying to figure out how to move forward because this has been a major aspect that is missing from my life, but I constantly feel the desire to just give up and throw in the towel.  Its hard not to feel self-conscious about the fact that I can't seem to have another person see me as attractive and worth their time.  I know that people develop at different stages, but the fact that I'm 25 and have never been on a date or hooked up with anyone is something that makes me feel like there is something innately wrong with me.

I know this is probably coming off as self-loathing, and I'm really not trying to say ""woe is me, please pity me"".  I just can't seem to figure out how to engage in something that appears so natural to many others and it makes me feel inadequate.  We are social creatures and I know that being able to accomplish this would be fulfilling, I just don't know how to not beat myself up over this and feel a sense of loss over what I didn't do growing up.

She agreed. The first date we agreed on had to be rescheduled so we went a week later. It went well, talked for several hours. I thought she was funny while I made her laugh as well. Then I proposed a second date a couple days later, and she agreed. Said she'd let me know if she can follow through. That day comes, I ask her about it, we postpone to next week. 

That week we had our second date. This time lasted even longer, we were definitely getting more comfortable with each other. Gave her a hug when we left 8 hours later. 

Then I proposed a date a couple days later, asking if she wanted to come over and introduce me to superhero movies (she's a big fan of superheroes). She excitedly agreed on a day. That day came around and she says she is very tired and naps instead. She suggested next week. I agreed.

Next week we have our third and most recent date. We watch a movie and cuddle, then just lay in my bed talking an holding each other for like 8 more hours after the movie. 

I noticed that throughout, there were a couple mentions of her leaving. After the movie, she said ""I should probably get going *soon* to have dinner with my roommates"". We continued talking for a while after that. Then when it started getting dark, ""I should probably get home before it gets dark"". Continued talking after that as well. We were pretty much non-stop talking and laughing together for 8 hours after the movie, and she finally decided to leave at like 12am. At this point I was just trying to fall asleep with her, gently rubbing my arm with her thumb (really enjoyed that lol). 

couple days later, I once again proposed another date. She said she might be able to do that friday, and she'd let me know. Friday comes around and I mention it to her, she says she's too busy but she will be should be able to do next wednesday when her finals die down. I agree.

So now that I've illustrated how things have been going (more info is better, right?), I need some advice. 

I absolutely HATE that I have been the one to propose hanging out. I hate that so much. It seriously makes me question whether or not she's even into me. But then at the same time, she's always the one to start conversation over random stuff over snapchat. Maybe I'm dumb, but I see that as her just finding a way to talk to me, which I like. Then there's her cuddling with me for over 9 hours, when she could've left at any time. Then there's the fact that we're both always laughing when we're around each other. I really enjoy her time and I get the impression that she enjoys mine as well.

I feel like I'm not seeing her nearly as much as I'd like to, and now summer is about to start so we won't see each other for 3.5ish months (assuming we're still talking when we come back to school).

I even made sure I was incredibly direct with her when we finalized next wednesday when she said friday wouldn't work. I said ""I'd like to see you at least once more before we leave, but I'll leave the ball in your park since I'll be available pretty much all of next week."" then she said either  tuesday or wednesday would work, and I said ""Whichever day gives us more time is the option I'm for"".

If she didn't get it yet, I'd hope she gets it now.

If wednesday goes well, I then have the fear of staying in contact over the summer. I'd like to facetime her now and then, but I DREAD being the one to ask about it because I have proposed literally all of our dates (again, I really cannot fully express how frustrating this is due to the mixed signals).

How should I proceed? This was mainly a rant but I'd really like some insight from anyone who shares an experience in any way similar to this.

Tbh she came onto me first. We just hit it off really well.

Our first date was the night we met at a bar with friends and I had actually forgotten her name for like three hours while we were talking. I didn’t think it’d be a big deal that she was also called Natalie but then we started going out about a year and a half ago, moved in together last spring when Covid started, and then my sister had to move in with us about three months ago.

I mean, almost daily we’ll be hanging out or passing and I’ll say “Hey Natalie...” and either the wrong one answers or, worse, they’ll both be like “Yes?” “Yes?” at the same time!

They also both hate being called Nat, which was something else people were suggesting. My girlfriend also hares pet names because she thinks they’re childish or creepy... I mean, it’s sort of weird. Even saying, like, “sis” makes it sound like a creepy porno. It’s a little dehumanizing to call either of them something other than their name. They really don’t want to. Neither of them. Worst of all, they’re good friends now and they spend a lot of time together!

I’ll be on the phone like “Natalie said this.” and the other one will be like “No I didn’t.” Or I’ll be cooking or something and I’ll ask one of them a question and they’ll both answer. Or I’ll be like “Yeah Natalie your food is on the counter” and they’ll both go thinking it’s theirs. Worst of all, they’ve started sharing stuff.

Like I got us Chipotle on the way home from work the other day and they wrote my name on my bowl tin and ‘Natalie’ on my girlfriend’s bowl tin and I left it for her on the kitchen counter and I went to change out of my clothes and when I got back they were sat on the sofa holding it between them each taking turns with the plastic fork. You know how they come with one of those black plastic forks? They just decided to share it!

As the title said, how do you deal with someone who has no time for you? Apologies for the messy telling, my mind is running wild.

I was seeing this guy for almost three months now. We met on an app, so it's more of an OLD thing. It was an instant attraction, but lately, we have been having friction. We are in long distance since our workplace are quite far from each other (we are not from US). He is also older than me. Here are some of the issues we have:

1. I like talking about things, but he rarely talks. I love discussions, especially knowing each other, but he rarely open up to me. He did tell me certain important things about himself, although not all. I still have doubts about certain things about him. He tries his best to talk to me. But at times, he just disappears in chats. Which brings me to...

2. He is a very busy person. I understand this, especially with the nature of his job. I don't usually bother him during work hours since I also have a full time job. I send him some random texts during the day which he tries to reciprocate. He also tries to talk to me at night through calls although not always. 

My issue now is that I want more time with him. Even on weekends, he is busy. I understand that too, but I just want him to give me more time. I feel neglected that my insecurities are showing, to the point of being unreasonable. I realize I am being toxic, with me lashing out on him. He is mature enough though to explain circumstances and I feel bad about what I did.

Maybe I really want is for him to give me more time, give me security. I am falling for him, but I am not sure about this. It feels like I am chasing him and desperate for him. I feel like I am demanding for something zi don't have right to. Last night I lashed out at him again, and today was filled of tension. 

What should I do? How to deal with this insecurity and how to tell him what I feel without sounding very demanding?

I became aware of my breathing, my movements, my need to talk to her and this was seconds after seeing her. Settle down!!

I made a decision to just shop and get out of there. Who wants to get hit on during a pandemic? I started to shop, but her every movement I was conscious of her and I started to analyze. Did she really pick up grapes or did she move there because she saw me reach for the oranges? Ridiculous.

The problem with a supermarket is you are constantly positioning, bouncing into the same people, and sharing the same small space. For someone with their mind running, like me, it leaves plenty of room for interpretation. I ran countless-- what else can I call them?--traps. Waiting in the pasta aisle to see if she, after seeing me, would come down. She didn't.

I was attracted but did not see a way to start a conversation, so I tried to put her out of my mind and headed to check out. While waiting in line, she walked past-- so hot!!-- and headed to the self check out. It was moving faster, so I followed. She beat me and headed out of the store first as I scrambled to catch up. It took a couple of minutes.

When I exited the store, I immediately searched for her car and it was not in the space. Shit! I pushed my cart towards my car. Circling at the top of the lot I noticed a red Lexus coming down the row, the car, like the driver, stood out. 

She approached with me on the passenger side and yelled over ""find everything you were for"". I laughed. We talked. She took off her mask and she was more attractive. To me, she was a straight lightening bolt. We exchanged details. She was older than I thought, 55, but I was not affected. Think Elise Neal. I told her that I was paranoid about the virus. She was,too. ""Let's meet up"" she said after close to 20 minutes of talk after we both get the vaccine. Perfect.

We were chatting today and sex came up. She mentioned that she was gonna wait to have sex with me until I was ready to not use a condom. I’ve always used a condom so this came as a surprise to me. 

Of course my two biggest concerns are 1. Getting her pregnant. Guess what? she is a single mom with a 3 year old kid. So you’d think she’d learn from that. 2. Getting stds. This is a failure on my part but I have not been tested in a long time. Like I said I have always used protection and felt confident that I wouldn’t have any issues with the previous partners. but after having this discussion I realized I need to do it. Hopefully I can find an affordable, easy, and legit way to do this. 

Idk what to do here? I’d love to do it but idk if it’s worth the risk. She says she has the ring and has been tested. Trying to figure out how to stay safe and continue having fun with her?

It's crazy when you look back to when you were younger and see who you are now and think to yourself who would have thought. 

I thought my looks may have been the problem concerning getting guys attention in high school. I had lots of friends, stayed out of drama and I am still like this to this day. Very popular with the girls, get along well with people all of sorts. Had guy friends. But mostly I thought I stayed single because I was not allowed to date and was a good girl who felt guilty going behind my parents back. I thought if I just get out of high school things would be different for me because I'd have freedom. 

Flash forward second year of college, my favourite parent dies and I start seeing guys because I was not scared of anything any more. I changed a lot, personality became more outgoing and cared less about things, still cared about others, and I got hotter. All of a sudden a lot of guys, hot guys I never even had in high school, found me attractive. High school guy friends all of a sudden started to reach out to me trying to hang with me one on one. I thought to myself well I'm bound to get a boyfriend now. 

But as I continue getting to know different guys, the ones I genuinely like and click with only want to fuck me. I have evolved so much, I was insecure and have gained so much confidence even with grieving my favourite parent and although I thought I was enough, thought I was worthy of love, these guys keep showing me I'm simply not. 

There is no one to blame but me. I wish I knew what to do to turn this around for me but I am beginning to think maybe this is just what I deserve, maybe this is just how it's gonna be for me. Life isn't fair, I know that with losing some one that didn't deserve to die so young and so harshly. 

 I have always felt like I had so much potential, and I get so close only for it to slip away through my fingers. This guy that led me on for months, playing me, just made this new girl his girlfriend. She looks like me (same features) so it's clear he has a type. I wondered why I wasn't good enough for him to want to cuff. And then I began talking to a more mature guy, better guy overall who asked me ""what we are"" the second time we hanged. It seemed as if he liked me more than I liked him cause I was just going with the flow at that point. He said he wanted friends with benefits and I said that's cool but I don't want that I want more. He quickly told me he was open to a relationship to, how he thought I was really cool and respected me. He asked if I wanted to go on a date next and I said yeah sure. He opened up to me about a lot and we just get along. I've never had this much in common with a guy. I told my friends and they all thought he was gonna be a potential boyfriend. But after that hang out he hasn't reached out much. Which is totally fine, not sure why he had to make it seem like he was so sure of wanting to go out with me. 

Some info about how I act with guys: I match their energy. I am not clingy. I don't put out (I'm a virgin).  We just make out, maybe take my top off but I've never really let it go beyond that cause I'm trying to wait until I have a boyfriend to try other stuff. I just don't see it as worth it to go beyond that if they don't want more than a hook up. Cause I don't want a hook up. But I'm chill and don't NEED a date, we can just get to know each other hanging out first. I try to make convo and keep things interesting. I make them laugh, I always seem to have similar music and movie taste as them. 

Anyways, I'm 21. At my peak in terms of beauty and youth. Life is only getting harder. I have never been desperate for a boyfriend, I have always been focused on myself and family and friends. I have grown to self love myself. I decide to open myself up to getting into a relationship and it simply is not happening. I am a firm believer in if you want something, you get it. You simply do it. But I have proven to myself that with some things, you just can't change what is meant for you and what is not. I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do. What is the point of all my high grades, all my friends, the money I make, the compliments, if I just end up alone with no guy to love me for once. I am not even asking for something long term or ""the one"" I just wanted a boyfriend. 

I have been a lot more aware of how short life is, how short youth is after my parent died. So the fact that I just watch myself, not being able to get a boyfriend at 21, already regretting that I haven't had one earlier, kills me. I want to live right now. Do things I want right now. Because only right now is real. Fuck the future. You can't depend on it. I am running out of time. I have no control, yet over another thing in my life, and it is killing me.

I've had a complex history with men. Early traumatic experiences in 8th grade, hooking up with the guys who had called me ugly a year prior. Lost my virginity to a stranger, because my abusive guy didn't want to have sex with a virgin. Was raped sophomore year of college (2015) by that guy, who said things to me no one should ever hear. Didn't process the trauma, went on to sleep with lots of guys, had lots of panic attacks every time. I've done some therapy, but of course, this kind of thing runs deep. I have a long way to go.

Fast forward to 2019, I met my ex boyfriend. This was my first real relationship and my first real love. We had an on and off thing for about 15 months, but quarantined together and were officially together for 5 months of that. We had an amazing time together and the relationship was incredibly healing for me. We slept together for the first time 2 months after meeting, and he's the first person I've ever really felt sexually safe with. Once I fell in love with him, I practically forgot about my trauma. Of course, that is, until we broke up. The trauma started seeping back in. I also was completely and utterly heartbroken. Honestly, the emotional pain was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The break up was very hard for me. We initally broke up in July 2020, but we didn't stop talking until February 2021. It was a mess.

Well, my life has been a mess. Long story short, this year has been really really hard for me. I got very very sick in July, moved home in November and have had 5 surgeries since then. Basically, my gallbladder was filled to the brim with stones. They removed it and I became very jaundiced and sick because there was a kink in my bile duct. Since then, I've had stenting every 12 or so weeks, plenty of pancreatitis, and it's been very very painful. I'm going to be ok soon, the last operation is coming up, but it's been difficult. My ex was there for me as much as he could be, but we weren't together, and it got really really toxic. Ok I'm getting to the point.

I feel like something is wrong with me. All of my friends want to go out and date right now, but I just... am not interested. I feel like it's maybe because I look at dating through the wrong lens. For some reason, I'm only thinking about the physical aspect, even though my relationship with my ex was so much more than that. But I'm not looking at dating as finding a best friend. I'm viewing it as like... is this person gonna try to have sex with me right away? I don't know if that makes sense. I just feel really ... scared. Even though I don't want to be back with my ex, he's the only person I can see myself being physical with right now... cause he's the only person I ever felt safe with.

I know it's probably partially because I don't feel well and am in pain a lot of the time. Also, I'm currently in my parents house in my small childhood town. I just have this fear that I'm not going to meet someone that I like again. I just feel absolutely terrified to open myself up again. The idea of someone I don't know touching me makes me want to hide under my bed forever. The break up was so painful and I've only recently actually moved on. Like I've been free of heartache for about 1 month. It's just tough like... I know he's out there starting to date, because he doesn't have trauma issues lol I wish I felt excited about dating!

I used to be one of those people who desperately wanted to be a relationship. I felt like something was missing - I wanted someone close to be, to hug, to have sex, to share special intimate moments. That want was so strong I found myself imagining futures with people on first dates and investing way more than I should early. Dating was filled with immense highs and lows. 

At the beginning of this year I had a realisation. The label of a relationship honestly meant nothing. It wasn't a good goal. Because it fails to recognise how different people are and how they might serve our lives in various ways. The goal should've been getting to know people and enjoying whatever experiences I could share with them. It should've been finding joy in all aspects of my life (because honestly, life is pretty freaking awesome). 

As soon as I realised that labels and weird personal goals and timelines were whack compared to just experiencing life and taking it as it comes my life honestly changed. I had an incredible fling (something I would've never done before). Then as I was dealing with the natural little low after a fling (you need some lows to enjoy the highs), an incredible guy came into my life. I knew and he knew that I didn't NEED anyone, but I still see the value in good people.

I let myself just experience getting to know him. I took time. I didn't and haven't looked far ahead. One month in and it's fun and easy. And you know what I couldn't give a flying fuck about labels or what happens. I'm just happy existing. HAVE FUN. People are attracted to joy. They're attracted to people who are focused on the now, who are focused on simply getting to know them without a specific goal. Every single relationship is different. Give what you get, and enjoy the process. 

And most of all laugh. Laugh at stupid stuff. Find humour in the ridiculousness of life and the freaking awesome joy of simple things. I promise you so much of life and attraction is mindset and understanding the goals that might be directing your emotions and actions.

No more matches and the last few women I've knew in person tell me I'm not their type or just don't care.

I got out of a relationship at the tail end of 2019. It was toxic and I was in a bad place. I worked on myself. I got into a job that's turning into a career, I lost a ton of weight. I worked on my negative emotions, got a new wardrobe to try to spruce myself up. Worked on my self esteem and was more confident. 

I'm educated and have an interesting and fun hobby. I like to travel and experience new and fun things. 

I entertain as a hobby. I can make anyone laugh and I can show them impossible things (magician/mentalist) and I play music for fun. I like to go out and party on some weekends and do dumb goofy stuff for fun. I like to go out and experience life and see what's out there. 

But since I've been back in dating I've gone no where. 

The few women I've met or talk to never care to learn about me. Never care to put in any effort. Which I guess makes sense when you're spoiled with  bombardment of a ton of dudes you get the luxury to not give a fuck. It's just a picture on a screen, no one's behind it right?

When you pick people out of a human catalogue and you don't have to give anything for it, you take what you get for granted like the millionth shirt in their  closet or the dime they drop. 

And when you make a wrong comment or say the wrong thing or you're not constantly entertaining them they'll drop you for someone who will. 

It's like you don't matter, you as a person aren't good enough and if you are for now, they'll drop you when you aren't later. 

I can't take the idea of feeling like I'm a commodity for someone. It's not about me, it's only about what I can give, what I can offer you all the time. When I want something in return, an acknowledgment, an interest, a single bit of care. Ghosted. 

I don't do porn or nudes, I don't want to jump into bed. I don't want to hurt anyone, I'd like to be a positive influence in someone's life. But I want someone to care about what's going on in my world. Reciprocate some general care. I mean, sure we just started talking, but aren't you doing that with the intent on maybe starting a relationship (I don't usually go for those who say ""looking for just friends"") wouldn't you care to get to know me at all? Seeing how I react to day to day tells you so much about me as a person, wouldn't you want to inquire? 

I'm sorry I wasn't born pretty, I'm sorry I do have bad days, I'm sorry things aren't perfect in my world. I'm sorry I do have some issues, but I worked on them and  I work carefully to make sure it doesn't spew into other people's lives. I'm sorry I'm not always confident. I'm sorry things get me down at times. I'm sorry I have thoughts and feelings. I'm sorry I'm not just some cardboard cutout coddling your every word with no regard for myself. 

Why is it so hard to find someone to give a shit? Even on just a platonic or basic human level?

What's wrong with me? 

Am I entitled for thinking if you talk to me you should want to know me as much as I want to know you? I don't think anyone owes me sex or love or anything but if you're going to talk to me with the supposed intent of dating shouldn't you at least care to know about me first?

I’m (F19) yet to have my first time, but I’ve realized I might have a problem regarding my standards and who I want to have sex with overall. 

I have a really strong sex drive, but whenever there is a guy that could be a possible sex partner, I feel like I start only noticing his flaws and the perfect sexual partner only exists in the movies. It’s easy for me to say “I’d sleep with him” about hot guys, but whenever a quite hot guy approaches me, I have an anxious attachment and only notice his flaws.

I seem to reject the guys around me for these reasons but I’ve started to think that **will any guy EVER even match my standards?** I’m afraid I’m overthinking the perfect sexual partner in fears of a bad sex and not knowing how I react to it. 

How do I “humble” myself and take into account guys with flaws? **Cause after all, I have flaws too and we are all human, but my subconscious doesn’t seem to understand that**.

I don’t know, never found a deep connection since my Ex, and have kinda stopped looking for something especially since Covid hit. Most girls on dating apps seem to shallow, or not very deep on like a spiritual level. I find it attractive when a girl respects herself, is heathy, and doesn’t throw herself around aimlessly and has character. Anyways decided to go out dancing tonight, like Latin dancing. Haven’t done that in a while. But I am somewhat experienced dancer from my younger years. It’s interesting to dance because you can really feel the girls energy and connect with the girl. I have danced with many ladies in the past and once in a while you find someone where sparks fly. Like tonight, as soon as I stepped into her aura and touched her hands I was transported. Like could really feel her energy and was almost dejavú like. Where it seemed like I had encountered her in another realm or something. And looking into her eyes I was lost they were so bright. For like 15 seconds I couldn’t concentrate and my body was flush and heart started racing. It was like instant chemical reaction. I’ve only felt that a couple times in my 34 year life.

All through college I dated around quite a bit. At peak, about 2-3 dates per week, some even in the same day. About 30% would be second dates, and 5-10% would be third+ dates. After a long period it just got boring. I wasn't sleeping around or anything, just casual dates in the daylight. Met lots of people and just came to the conclusion that I wasn't really enjoying the time I spent with... any of them actually. College finished, and a couple years went by where I continued to date in my new area where I worked. Eventually, about two years ago, I finally came to the conclusion that there were other things I'd rather do with my time. I had started to view dating as a hobby, and like any other hobby, I decided to move on and try some new things.  
  
So I did. I got into game development and team leadership, for a few months I leaned hardcore into getting good at my favorite video game, I stopped everything at one point to read a couple of books (Knocking on Heaven's Door and Warped Passages, fantastic books on particle physics and the Higgs-Boson experiments, and history of the Large Hadron Collider). Developed my career and went through two promotions in under 3 years, built a diversified portfolio of investments and savings, and even set up some passive income sources so my job has now become a ""hobby"" as well, to the point where I don't actually need it financially. In my free time I keep up with my game development and am working towards a few certifications in my field and a masters degree that I'm super excited about! Needless to say, lots of stuff going on and I think I've done pretty okay!  
  
Now, I'm starting to wonder if post-Covid it would be fun to date again. I get my second shot in a week, which means within a month I should be set! I'm a bit concerned that I'm ""out of touch"" or that maybe what worked before won't work now. Last time I was on the scene, OLD still worked pretty well and it wasn't quite so badly infested with bots, and there were more convos to be had. It may still be a while before I can casually walk into a cafe and sit for hours talking to other customers and just chilling. Was wondering if anyone had some advice on what a good plan of attack would be? The last time I was able to just waltz into a casual cafe with a book, or maybe my old gameboy color or my laptop to do some CAD or programming and that would be plenty to spark some conversation. That was almost 3 years ago now though. Lots has changed. So what's up now? :D",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,735714,public,self,"It's been over two years now, and I think i did pretty okay with myself!
