She seemed eager to give it to me and said ""Of course you can have my number."" This is after I asked her if she liked texts that may contain ethnic jokes. She's white. I'm Asian.

From what I have gathered, she has single for less than a month. But she told me that this outcome was a long time coming, so I have no idea when she fell out of love with her previous boyfriend.

People say I should ask her out, while others say I might be a rebound if she even says yes to the idea.

I have no idea how to proceed to get to know her more, or even potentially ask her out hoping she says yes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pesnhc/woman_seemed_eager_to_give_me_her_phone_number/

Does anyone have examples of when their gut feelings and intuitions didn't guide them the right direction? When your gut lied to you? OLD has been a pain, and almost ever guy has only wanted sex. Its uncanny. Guys who are more or less decent will ghost within days. I always read posts about giving guys time to respond to messages/texts, and not go by gut that they aren't interested, but I'm seeing through my OLD journey that gut feelings never fail. When a guy was interested, he didn't wait days to respond, and once he did, it was over, and I didn't hear from him. If I did, the decent ones would say that they aren't interested.

She's been there for a year and I've been a somewhat regular the whole time. For weeks now she's been been stalling me and ping ponging around, cracking jokes blah blah. 

I admit.. I am a man. I am stupid. I realized this all of 2 days ago. 

And so I went in there, completely unable to contain my smile, got my shit and went up to the register. She's waiting there and immediatly 4 people pile up in line. Shucks. Better make this quick and simple. I just told her she seems really cool and to let me know if she wants to hang out sometime. Now, this store has a mask policy for employees but you can only hold about 60% smile in a mask. She was fumbling her words and giggling. Changing the subject. The lot of it. But I saw her eyes smile and the mask contort. She seemed like I blew a fuse in a head which is understandable. I've been shaking in my boots for 23 years. so I just dropped it after what I said and went back to blah blah for a minute and she ultimately said have a great day. 

So now, she knows. I know she knows. She knows I know. If she wants to dig in she can say the word. If she can't muster a sentence around me, should I nudge her or let it be? I feel like I'm torturing her with giddy laughter now and I'm gonna have to hear a no at some point with every green light lit. I don't think it's a no.

Also, we're both from the same small town so I've been wondering:

Should we go out in our own town's bars that we already go to or should we drive to somewhere else?

Is it standard to go for a walk before or after the date or even at all?

Should I propose continuing the date after we leave the bar or not?

Should I dm her about swinging by her house to pick her up or is it weird if I do?

13,petual,1630366056,"Well, there you have it","So I'm in the military, love my career, it has it good days and bad just like any other, but dating in the military is definitely difficult. I'm a 28 African American male 5'5, about 176 lbs, toned build with a slight pudge of the stomach due to a binge of bad eating choices. 

I've never been the type to have success when dating, it's just never been a strength throughout my life, and honestly it's something I've learned to accept, girls just don't like me like that, and I've made peace with it. Crazy thing is whenever I do come across a woman that is somewhat interested, it's typically someone I'm not at all attracted to in any way, and someone who I'm not at all interested in.

I come from an environment where if you not from the streets or a thug type of guy, a majority of women think you're lame, or they will flat out tell you they're not interested. I remember someone telling me look for a church girl, or Christ loving woman, someone that has a good head on her shoulders, you're in the military, date a military girl. There's this one girl in particular that I've been talking to here and there, she's a church girl, she's a beautiful woman, great attitude and personality, she told me just got out of a relationship.  She said the guy was heavily toxic, but she stayed anyway then things got physical, she even gave him a chance after that but she soon after cut it off. 

She told me she didn't want to leave because she didn't think she could get another guy like him, this immediately made me think that he's a physically attractive guy. She said she went to a party a few nights ago dressed up, and a guy she knew said wow, you don't look like a guy for once, she said she wanted to cry, and this is crazy to me because she's absolutely gorgeous, even without makeup.

Fast forward to today, she showed me and another guy her wallpaper on her phone, she said this is my man, ooh I wish we were in front of each other, I looked at the phone at it was NBA Youngboy lol. I was like well, I guess I know what her type is, I can't seem to escape that standard no matter where I go. I really like the girl though, she didn't call me a nice guy, she called me a good man that has plenty of potential, I've never heard that before, but I also don't want to waste my time on something that isn't fruitful, I honestly don't know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/petual/well_there_you_have_it/

15,peu160,1630366732,Social media post,"
Ive been dating this girl for almost a year, and recently i decided to post us together on Instagram and tag her in it. She posted us before but on a private account that only she sees, she also posted a few times on her snap story. Ive poster her too on Snapchat, but none of us ever have done Instagram yet. We spoke about her making a post of us or her picking the photo for me to use, but the conversation died off. So the other day i brought it up and i asked her to post the private post on her main account. She refused and told me she‚Äôll wait for a better picture of us. I was a little saddened so i decided to post one of my favorite pictures of us and tagged her in it. Immediately she started to freak out and ordered me to take it down. She said she didn‚Äôt like her in the photo which was reasonable, but the way she reacted was ridiculous. She started spamming with text to take it down and delete it for almost 2 hours. I took it down soon after she started but then i put it back up because she pissed me off. At roughly 3am she finally agreed to pick pictures she liked for me to post, but i told her id do it tomorrow and she went off one me again telling me she hated me and what not. It doesn‚Äôt sit well with me at all, and if she really didn‚Äôt like how she looked i felt like she should post the one on her private account, which barely shows her face but she is kissing me on the cheek. Now shes still angry with me, telling me all i had to do was change it despite the fact that ive been asking her to find a better pic. She finally blocked me on Instagram. The timing of our argument couldn‚Äôt have been worse as shes going through a lost of personal stuff rn, but i figured a cute little post of us together wouldve been a sweet gesture.

Growing up in a conservative middle eastern household, I was basically told that I shouldn‚Äôt be having sex until marriage. Although I don‚Äôt plan on waiting till marriage, I do want my first time to be with someone I‚Äôm in a relationship with or at least have been seeing exclusively for a while.

Now, I seem to have a fear of putting myself out there mainly because I have trust issues surrounding sex. I‚Äôve heard way too many stories of girls being ghosted after sleeping with someone, or just how a lot of men (not all of course) want to sleep with a woman before being official, which I‚Äôm not comfortable with especially for the first time.

36,pev21v,1630370334,Ghosted by coworker who was flirting. Advice please,"So we‚Äôve been working from home for a while last week I decided to send a message to a cute coworker that I had only met one time in the office. She seemed to be very receptive to my message, and over the following couple of days, we actually got a decent conversation going. She was using tons of emojis, asking questions, joking back with me, and even gave me her number without me even asking. 

This continued on text throughout Thursday night, at which point she said goodnight, and that it‚Äôs been great talking to me and getting to know me etc. And then on Friday I sent her a good morning have a nice day message, she took a while to respond and then she said she couldn‚Äôt wait for the weekend to begin and asked me if I had plans. I said I would be hanging out with some friends that night, but was trying to figure out the rest of the weekend. Asked if she had plans, and then she just never responded. 

The funny thing is, I was planning on asking her to hang out if she said that she didn‚Äôt have much going on. I felt like I had lots of momentum, and several of my female friends had seen screenshots of my texts with her and I had confirmed that she was certainly flirting with me. So it seemed weird for her to stop. I‚Äôm very confused as to what happened, and how to proceed. Will appreciate any and all advice!

Only possible explanation I‚Äôve thought of is that she is a couple years older than me (27 to my 23), but when she asked for my age and told me hers it seemed normal, like she continued being relatively flirty for the rest of the day. The shift really only happened on Friday, with he taking more time to respond, and sending shorter messages",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pev21v/ghosted_by_coworker_who_was_flirting_advice_please/

They are not interested whatsoever in having more children or god forbid getting married or living with a man. They want fun and good times only, hot sex and laughs maybe doing other things occasionally like hitting the bar, concert or whatever.

What are this woman's chances in the dating realm for what she would like keeping in mind said woman hasn't dated since she was 18 and met her teenage sweetheart which eventually grew apart but is amicable and friendly now due to children .

39,pev9js,1630371074,I got friendzoned again,"I've been in the friendzone more times than I'd like to admit. I just wanted to share some of my experiences with being stuck in the friendzone. You know. You meet someone. You get closer to them. You start thinking about them and before you know it, you like them. Things seem to be blossoming and everything seems to be going well. You might think about being with them and imagine what it's like. And then you eventually find out that they only see you as a friend and it feels like a dagger going through your heart. 

You can go about it in a few ways. You can cut them off. But what does this accomplish? You lost someone who wanted to be a friend. Friendships can be invaluable. Whenever I did this, I felt fucking miserable, immature, and stupid. 

You can stay their friend, but it will be painful having unreciprocated feelings attached. Whenever I went this route, I felt like I was selling myself short and settling for less than I wanted out of the relationship. I felt like I didn't have any self-respect. 

I recently got friendzoned again. When I realized she only saw me as a friend, it did hurt. I decided to tell her openly how I felt, reassuring her that it wasn't her fault for liking someone else. But at the same time, it wasn't my fault for having feelings either. I was at a crossroads where I didn't want to lose her, but didn't want to be just a friend. 

However, I'm coming to terms with the reality that she does not see me as more than a friend. I gave myself some alone time and space from her, but I decided that I want to stay in contact with her. I do have to set new boundaries and I can't be too emotionally invested in her like I was. I have to set new expectations of what we are. I feel like if I can do that, I can continue having a healthy friendship with her, without feeling bad about myself. I don't think it's okay to cut people off just because they don't want to date you, and in general it's better to keep them in your lives and work through your feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pev9js/i_got_friendzoned_again/

42,pevnnv,1630372482,Really feel down and out about this,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pevnnv/really_feel_down_and_out_about_this/

After that night  things continued on normally. We get along spectacularly, great conservations, and sex. There hasn't been any hints up to this point that would lead me to believe she has doubts.

49,pewd72,1630375045,Very Weird Situation I‚Äôm in,"

Hello everyone, yesterday was probably the best and worst day ever for me in terms of relationships and hanging out. I went on my first date (which they brought up the idea and wanted it to be a date) and it was so bad I wanted to cry. Now I'm a nervous and more reserved person so I tried my best to bring up some convo starters and it felt like they tried ending it quickly as they didn‚Äôt care. We had maybe one decent convo the whole time, and they didn‚Äôt even try talking to me back as they were on the phone the whole time, not even kidding. They probably spent more time texting and never once asked me a question and it just made me wanna cry because I felt shitty and wanted to leave. They soon left abruptly and texted they had a good time while I rolled my eyes and question why did they even invited me, it felt like a fucking interview where they don‚Äôt talk back. Anyways as I was planning to go back home I thought to myself I‚Äôm not gonna go home like this and texted this other girl I was talking to and they invited me to their house( if you‚Äôre confused this is a new person not the one that invited me to the date), it was honestly the best time I‚Äôve ever had. I felt like myself and had a genuinely fun time talking and learning about them, I felt the connection. We also made out and cuddle a lot. We both ended up liking each other a lot and I think I‚Äôm going to ask them if they want to date me. Now my question/problem is despite having a great time with the other person I still can‚Äôt get over the shitty date I had first, it was my first ever date and I felt so disrespected and mentioned how I wanted to cry (which I did but only a little bit). Maybe it‚Äôs because it barely just happened but I want to forget it already because I‚Äôm happy with the other person but I just keep thinking about it?

This will be quite long as I want it to have all the details. 


I was in a chatroom and some catfish sent me a vsco link to a girl‚Äôs vsco account. I gotta admit she was really cute. I ended up finding this girl‚Äôs Instagram and dm‚Äôed her, telling me who I was. She responded back saying she was never on a chat room. We ended up texting for a few, I found out that she‚Äôs been having random guys message her for the past year or two, because someone is using her vsco and tinder account to catfish. She‚Äôs been asked to send nsfw pics multiple times, she‚Äôs thankfully rejected. And she‚Äôs had a couple of guys pretend to like her only so they can invite her over to his house/ask for nsfw pics. She‚Äôs ended that relationship. I felt a bit bad for her and I felt a bit mad at whoever the catfish is. And so I told her I‚Äôll attempt to help her find the catfish so she at least knows who it is. I‚Äôm pretty skilled in the IT / computer department and I know how to find someone‚Äôs IP address. She‚Äôs told me about 6 times that she can‚Äôt thank me enough for helping her.


The central topic is always this catfishing stuff but we ended up talking about our religions/faiths. Both of us have the same faith and agree on so many things about our faith, such as marriage before sex, pro-life, etc.. and faith is so big in my life and her life. We live about 16 hours apart from each other, both of us in the USA. she‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúone of a kind‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúextremely sweet‚Äù and that she wishes more people were like me. Not even 2 hours after texting her, she asks for my Snapchat. We end up snapping a little but always talk on Instagram. She doesn‚Äôt seem to be on nearly as often as me, and it kills me when it goes 15-20 hours without her reading my message. 


But now I‚Äôm running into trouble. I really really like this girl but we hardly know a thing about each other and she‚Äôs so far away. I liked her at first solely because of her looks. But now I really like her because of her interests and beliefs. I like her as a human, not an object. I wanna tell her how I feel but I think she‚Äôs either going to think I used this situation with the catfish to try for a long distance relationship, or think I‚Äôm not trying to find the catfish, or be scared away. And I think it‚Äôs too early to say anything to her but I really want to. 

Idk how I feel about long distance relationships. They‚Äôve got the pros and cons. But Idk.

Hi, I didn't quite know how to word the title.

But  anyway, 4 months ago I split up with my ex girlfriend (First  relationship) she meant everything to me she really did, I still care  about her so much as I thought she was perfect. Since that day I've not  been okay, I've been severely depressed. I had struggled mentally before  I met her and during my time with her was the happiest I've ever been  in my life.

- one time she logged in and I saw she had about 7 unopened messages

- one time she had her Snapchat open and we were taking a picture. Someone messaged her with the name ""David (My Stalker)"".

- we work at the same place. It's how we met. There are two guys that constantly talk to her. I don't care if she talks with people in her work area or even quick convos while moving around the warehouse, but one of these guys doesn't work in the same plant. Whenever he comes he's always talking to her. The other guy works in a different area and is always approaching her and talking to her for so long. She knows that it bothers me but she still talks to them. 

- I spoke to her about the Facebook messages and snap message and she did agree when I asked if they were all guys but she just doesn't open the messages. She said the guy on snap has always stalked her. She blocked him when we were talking about it.

58,pewwrk,1630377025,I CANNOT come out to my parents.,"Me (23f) and my girlfriend (21f) have been officially dating for less than a week now, We've known each other for a little over a year but weren't ready for anything more than a friendship until recently. Prior to this, things were very rocky between us. Now, we're trying out the whole relationship thing, but we're still learning and messing things up. She's my first ever girlfriend, as I didn't realize I liked women a little more than the average straight girl until I met her.  I was raised in a very religious household, so I always shunned the parts of myself that I'd be taught were a sin. My parents are painfully homophobic (my little sister tried to come out to my mom and my mom said ""We'll work on fixing that) so it's been very difficult to talk to them about this new aspect of my life. I'm worried they'll be disappointed in me or keep me from being able to talk to my siblings. My parents know that my gf exists, but they know her as a very close friend....who sleeps at my house every night just for fun. Last summer when the came to visit, my dad specifically requested that my gf (who I was just friend with at the time) not come over to my house while my family was there because it would make him uncomfortable. I'm sure they have a suspicion, but none of us have ever actually brought it up. We kind of have a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy when it comes to my sexuality.

As for her parents, they don't really know we're together either. I don't think they know she's bisexual either. They are also very homophobic and have the same DADT policy about her sex life. When they first met me (before she and I were dating) her mother refused to speak to me or acknowledge my existence. It's put a really bitter taste in my mouth, but I figured she and I could just work it out down the line.

My parents are coming into town for labor day weekend to stay with me, and my girlfriend is demanding that we announce to *both* of our parents that we're together while we have everyone in the same city. This would be her first time meeting my parents in person. She's talking about it like it's really easy, but I'm terrified. When I shared this with her, she was (rightfully) upset. She's saying I'd do it if I loved her, and I shouldn't care what my parents think because I'm an independent adult. I know coming out is crucial to us furthering our relationship, but I feel like it's too soon for me and for us. I mean, I just realized I was bisexual a year ago, we just started officially dating last week, and I'm just really unsure. I'm worried about how awkward and emotional and uncomfortable the discussion would be. I know I need to tell them, but I'm really not ready. I also don't want to hurt her. Is there a way to compromise?

59,pewzzp,1630377349,I've had a coffee date with a woman and now I can‚Äôt tell if she is giving me mixed signals or just busy.,"TL;DR - I met a girl who's certainly out of my league and we went for coffee, which went well. We've agreed to do dinner soon, but she keeps canceling and pushing the date back, because she's busy with work. We're texting about other things and she keeps saying that she's looking forward to meeting me again, but it generally takes her 24-48 hours to respond to my texts.

Full Story So Far -

I met a woman on a dating app a few weeks ago. After chatting for about a week, we set up a video date. She forgot about the first video date, but we finally managed to connect when rescheduled. The video date lasted around 10 minutes, because she was in the middle of an errand. We flirted for around 5 minutes before she got serious. She made it clear that she wanted to meet her husband and start having kids as soon as possible, and ask me if I'd be up for that role. I told her that I was down to get married and have kids if I met the right woman. (We are both childless and in our early 30s.) She said that that worked and then asked me out to coffee before ending the video date.

Through texting, we set up a coffee date 2 days later. I arrived early to find that the place she had chosen was permanently closed. I texted her that information and told her that there was an open place across the street we could meet at. She finally texted me back 10 minutes after our date was supposed to have started to say that she was running late and that she'd meet me at the place across the street.

Once she arrived, she decided that that coffee place was too busy and that she didn't actually want coffee. Instead she wanted to walk through the nearby park and find a bench to sit on. I agreed. Once we were actually on the date, I think things went great. We both laughed a lot, told each other intimate details about our lives and before we knew it an hour and a half had passed and she needed to go, because she was meeting her friend for lunch. She told me that she had had a great time and said that we should plan to have dinner the following week.

At this point I should say that I'm very successful in my field and I live comfortably in a major city. During our date it became apparent that she is at the top of the same field as me. She's more accomplished and successful then I'll ever be, and I likely make pennies in comparison to her. (I've 100% verified that she is who she says she is.) Also she's incredibly beautiful and though I'm decent looking, I wouldn't expect a woman that looks like her to be interested in me.

I texted her 2 days after the first date to say that I had a good time and asked for her availability for dinner. She texted back that she was actually busy that week, but that she wanted to meet the following Tuesday. We worked out the details and I made a reservation at a place by her apartment with great food and a quiet atmosphere. Somehow that negotiation took almost the entire week as it took her 24-48 hours to respond to me each time I texted her. (For instance she picked Tuesday and I texted her back asking what time would work on Tuesday. She didn't respond for over 2 days.)

The afternoon before our dinner date she texted me to say that she hadn't gotten as much work done as she thought she would've and that she would be too busy working to take a night off for another week, so she had to cancel. Still she made it clear that she definitely still wanted to meet up the following week. I told her that I was disappointed, but that I could make time next week, if she gave me a heads up. (I'm also busy.) She was grateful and reiterated that she was looking forward to seeing me.

I didn't immediately try to schedule another date, but instead texted her for a recommendation about one of her interests, which she was happy to respond to. It looks like we're going to try again this Wednesday.

A large part of me thinks that I have no chance with this woman and that the coffee date wasn't as good as I thought. She's clearly just being polite and either has no interest or very little interest in seeing me again. She's likely talking to 10+ more successful and better looking guys, and that's what she's actually busy doing. She comes off as flaky and unorganized to me only because she doesn't care about me or my time. Clearly someone as successful as her is responsible when it comes to things she cares about.

A smaller part of me hopes that she really is just busy, and she really is excited to see me again. I mean it could just be that she's bad at dating and since she's so successful other guys aren't interested. Still if she's so busy with work that she can't take a single night off in 2 weeks how could she have time to be in a relationship? If we do end up dating, will I be expected to only see her twice a month?

I don't mind getting rejected. That happens all the time and I kind of wish it would just happen here. This situation feels worse to me, because I don't know where I stand and every time I text her she manages to wait just long enough to convince me that I'm getting ghosted. Ideally I'd be able to talk to her about this, but I'm pretty sure that would come off as needy at this point. Please tell me if I'm just over thinking things and being crazy. (I've gotten likely good advice from friends, but I'd like to know what other people think.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pewzzp/ive_had_a_coffee_date_with_a_woman_and_now_i_cant/

61,pex27t,1630377569,I miss him,I(22f) was talking to this guy(27m) for a while on and off. When we started talking and I first met him I wasn‚Äôt sure about him because it felt like we had nothing in common and we just didn‚Äôt have a connection but a little time went by and started to like him. But we both have clashing personalities and we would argue about a lot of things and would end up breaking things off with each other. I think we did this about 3 times and one person would always end up going back to the other. Anyway he deals with a lot some mental health issues so the last time we broke things off he would text me occasionally saying he missed me and I told him he needed to stop. So after some time went by I was worried about him for no reason really so I texted him asking him how he was doing and saying that I just wanted to make sure he was doing okay. He texted back saying that he had deleted my number because he thought I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him which wasn‚Äôt the case. Anyway now I miss him a lot and I want to text him but I don‚Äôt want him to be annoyed by me  so I‚Äôm unsure of what I should do.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pex27t/i_miss_him/

63,pexm87,1630379620,She asked me to sleep over next time and I am confused,"Met her in the psych ward a couple years ago. I remember she was very pretty but I didnt think too much about it at first. She was just ending a 3 years stay there and I stayed there for around 9 months. We got 2 months or so together at the psych ward. It took a few weeks before I let my guard down and started talking with her. Turned out we had a lot in common and we ended up talking for hours a day, every day.  


I started crushing on her a little while after that. We were basically together but we never kissed since it wasnt socially acceptable at the hospital. Still I found ways of flirting with her that wasnt too over the top. I was a little careful as always since I have got my fair share of dissappointments in personal relationships in the past.  


But eventually there was no doubt: She was crushing on me as well. We were just trying to hide our feelings for one another but the staff already knew. They took me aside from time to time and told me that what I had with her was special and that I should stay in touch with her after my stay.  


One day one of the other patients noticed that we were flirting. It was too obvious but he asked her bluntly if she liked me. She said yes there and then, in front of me. So absolutely no room left for doubt.  


But I was conflicted. One of the last days before she left, I got her number. Lucky thing I asked. She left the hospital after staying there for 3 years. I stayed for a few more months. I wrote about her in my diary for some time. Hand made leather diary. Sort of my best friend that one. Until I reached the last page.  


She left on a Monday. I remember that pretty clearly. I sent her a sad song from my spotify list: I dont like Mondays. Twilight level cringe probably but she responded and I thought that was the last thing I would ever hear from her. I didnt forget about her, although my crush for her gradually dissipated over time.  


A few months after I got out of the hospital, my sister bought her first appartement. I knew that the girl from the hospital lived in the same city. I realized I still had her number so I called her. That conversation ended up lasting over an hour.  


I told her my sister had bought an appartement in her city and asked her if she wanted to meet. She asked me what the street name were. I told her it was close to so and so. She replied in shock: I live 5 minutes from there, what is the exact street name? I answered and she was even more shocked of course: She lived in the same street. Turned out my sister lived in number 23 and she lived in number 19.   


I ended up meeting her 3 times in a week and our meetings were around 8 hours each. I met her mother, some of her friends. She met my mom and my sister. She showed me her appartement which she had just bought. It was far from ready. It needed a total renovation.  


We met up maybe for a few weeks until October of last year. I asked her out on a date and she turned me down. It was on Halloween. I asked her out for a horror movie. I didnt know she was afraid of large crowds and she told me that we had to just stay friends.  


I was devastated of course and didnt know what to think. I tried to rekindle what we had at the hospital and I guess I went too far too quickly. I didnt try to contact her for months. I needed to get the idea that we were going to be together out of my head. But I wanted to still be friends so I contacted her again around January of last year.  


I realized that none of us were really in any shape to date. I guess she realized it earlier than me. So we became best friends for the next 18 months or so. We talked about everything and had many soul to soul talks.  


I didnt flirt with her until she started it a few months ago. I didnt really know what to make of it at first. I was emotionally numb and had put up walls I guess. We both had abandonment issues so the progression was really slow.  


Winter turned into spring and we both started to get out of the heavy winter depression we didnt realize we had. We started to feel lighter. Then summer came and we had some really good weather. We started to meet often. Up to several times a week.   


We started going on what looked more and more like dates. I didnt say a thing until she one day told me ""what if we are on this exact date 6 months from now?"". Then I started to realize that we had some spark again.  


We went to a lake late at night one day and took a bath. That was maybe a two months ago. We had our first kiss. I remember it was full moon that day. We have kissed once since then. She had a bad period which lasted for multiple weeks and I started second guessing everything.   


I got unsure if she was ghosting me or whatever but turned out she was getting stressed out over several different things happening in her life all at once. And I probably didnt help by being in that equation. I was about to leave her. Never got to the point where I confronted her about it, but almost.  


But in the last few weeks everything have been different. I have never seen her in such a good state over a period this long. She have opened up even more and shared exactly what she is thinking and feeling.   


I visited her today. Her appartement got finished today. She got her new kitchen which was the last thing she needed to complete it. She told me that next time maybe I dont have to sleep at my sisters place but at hers instead.  


I am nervous. I am still second guessing if this is for real. We have barely kissed but I guess we are together still. It has been an emotional bond over these three years or so. I never felt like I needed anything more from her but her friendship. Once I got my head straight anyways. But I also really like her and have always been.  


 This isnt between a friendship or a relationship really. It seems like something deeper than both. Even if the relationship fails, I dont think this can. Soulmates are hard to find.

There is this girl at work which I flirt often with. We kind of have this back and forth thing. I noticed when I stand there and chat with another girl she randomly pops up and stands close to us and listens and pays really good attention. A lot of the times she will randomly join the conversation and start talking to the girl (kind of kicking me out). I once hung out with a female coworker outside of work and she saw this on my snap.

After that relationship, I've found that even though I am very much over that, I'm interested in meeting new people, but then once things start to get real, like the person wants to meet, or video chat, or whatever, I start to think too much about what it all means. Am I going to really pursue this? Is this someone I want to risk it all for? Is it worth it to pursue this when it could easily just become another wasted half decade of my life? Obviously I have a serious mental block here. I've met with, matched, and spoken to a lot of people, and then found myself backing out when a meetup or video chat is suggested every single time. I don't know if it's pressure, fear, or what, but I'm going to be 30 next year and I've been single for 3 years now and it's just really discouraging, especially when everyone I know is in a relationship, getting married, etc. and I went from thinking I had something in the bag in my mid 20s to being terrified of commitment in my late 20s.

I guess stick to the tried and true method of in-person? What do I say? Especially being mid 20s, how the hell am I suppose to know if a girl is 20 or 29? Obviously don't want to come off as a creep, and sure it's quick, flirty conversation but Christ, what do you do after that?

I‚Äôm kind, loyal and pretty cute. I have an anxious attachment style that tends to settle to secure over time and sometimes I smoke weed (trying to quit) but as far as my vices go that‚Äôs really it. I don‚Äôt drink. 

I have been seeing a guy for 2 years. It took a long time for him to commit but once he did, he was very affectionate and loving. However, he always kept me at arms length. He‚Äôs a very avoidant attachment style and quite obsessed with his routines, so much so that in the time we‚Äôve been together, he‚Äôs never spent a full sunday or saturday with me. He will come over 2-3 times a week in the evening, we‚Äôll have dinner, watch a movie, cuddle, sleep together and in the morning he‚Äôll leave to go workout or do stuff around the house. He is 32 and we are currently in lockdown. When we aren‚Äôt in lockdown the routine remains more or less the same (although we‚Äôll do more social things or go camping together.) 

I‚Äôm seriously thinking about kids and marriage in the near future. When i brought this up with him I got a pretty straight ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know but i‚Äôm leaning towards no‚Äù. He seems scared due to his upbringing and personal attachment issues, and my anxiety is flaring up because of his uncertainty.

I will be most likely re-entering the dating market, but i‚Äôm plagued by one major fear - that most viable men don‚Äôt want kids or marriage these days, and that anyone who agrees to my timeline that quickly has some red flag i‚Äôm missing. 

By viable i mean someone within a reasonable age bracket (i‚Äôd go up to 36 but don‚Äôt really want to go any higher), has a stable job, i‚Äôm attracted to them and they are kind.

I guess i‚Äôm feeling pretty disillusioned right now. I don‚Äôt really want to get divorced at 40 because i rushed into something. I don‚Äôt think of relationships as disposable but i feel like i‚Äôm in a dying minority. I‚Äôm scared of my future husband hating my post-baby body and leaving me for someone 30 years younger. Basically, i‚Äôm scared, and i don‚Äôt see a future for myself anymore.

Cold approaches have been horrendous. I‚Äôm just not built to do them. Parties are off the table as I don‚Äôt drink (close family members have abused alcohol). My close friends aren‚Äôt much help as most of them have been in long term relationships since high school. And the two that aren‚Äôt have been as lost as I have.

I wasn‚Äôt really responding to guys on there not because I think I‚Äôm too good but because a lot of men are just lame as far as personality but for some reason he caught my eye so I messaged back. We talked for a little on there and then he asked for my SC and added me, we messaged a little more on snap and it‚Äôs all going smooth. I ended up asking if we can talk OTP so it would make me more comfortable and he agreed, we talked OTP last night for about 10 mins and it was just a little awkward because I got kinda shy but it wasn‚Äôt too bad and he was really chill so I‚Äôm feeling hopeful. When he first messaged me last Monday he had actually asked if I was free going into that weekend which I actually wasn‚Äôt so I said no but really even if I was free I would‚Äôve said I‚Äôm not because I‚Äôm not ready to meet just yet for personal reasons and also I‚Äôd like to get to know him a little more through text so I asked him if mid or late September would be okay and he agreed.

So far he‚Äôs giving me a lot of good vibes, he‚Äôs handsome, chill, funny, has his own things going on, working and in school, not constantly messaging me, I mean just all good signs so far and I could definitely see how it can turn into something more if he keeps this up. We haven‚Äôt really talked enough to establish what either of us want, tbh I wasn‚Äôt even necessarily on tinder looking for a relationship or even a hookup (sounds dumb ik) I was just curious to see who was on there and kinda took it as a joke but then I ended up meeting him.

Guys this will be a bit of long text so keep reading üòä So I (25M) found this girl(24F) from Facebook and she sent me a hi through FB and said to share an online class banner. I shared it and I started talking with her very politely. So after like three or four weeks, we get to know each other well. At this time she was having some exams and she was pretty much stressed about it because she didn't study at all and her ex. Her ex used her two times and cheated on her. So she has that regret of being used. I told her how to manage the stress and other negative emotions just to make her life better because I felt bad for her. So again to exam topic, she said to she doesn't want to come on Facebook because of the exams and said to me let's meet later when the exams are over. So I said ok and time went by.

After two weeks a friend of mine called me and said a girl was trying to find me and she was scared of me because I didn't see the text she put to me (it's because of the covid). I immediately went to messenger and found that she sent me a message yesterday and I explained why I didn't see her text. My friend told me she asked my number too and he kind of supported me to hook this girl by giving her my number. I said ok to that. So we messaged and finally, she asked by sending my number to her saying ""is this ur number? a friend of mine gave it to me when I'm trying to find you"". I said yes it's my number and we started to message through WhatsApp. 

When I'm texting with her I feel a very genuine connection because she is always eager to message fast. She is a fan of animals(especially cats) Korean music and drama and me too. She sent me love emojis and very romantic, happy kind of songs from youtube. I also did the same. So after some days, I asked her why she takes pictures on her Facebook with the backside open not the front side. She said to me her face is ugly because of her big cheeks and slim body. So it feels like she has low esteem and insecurities. When she brought that up she said to me no one likes her because of her face and people neglecting her.  She thinks she is very ugly. But she is beautiful to me! I said ur beautiful and told her things to make her happy. But she kind of thinking about her insecurities more. We connect well. I want this girl in my life. I don't care about her face. But how can I convey this to her? How should I make her think of me? I really can't think of a way to connect with her more.

PS: Unable to meet with her IRL because the country I'm living in has covid Lockdown now. I kind of have trouble with texting because I'm a newbie and very shy. I have told her that she came into my mind when listening to a song before. Her answer was"" it's really good if you thinking of me"".

99,pf0ebl,1630391795,"Does the ""friend zone"" actually exist?"," 

Growing up I always understood the ""friend zone"" to essentially be what happens when a woman tells a man that they are ""just friends"" which is code for ""I don't want to date you"".

But it always thought it was an odd concept because I never liked the idea of dating a stranger and never understood why other people would want to do it, or even why people would prefer it. It seemed to me that most women preferred it and I grew up believing that if you didn't ask a woman out within the first few interactions and started to become even slightly friendly that romance was automatically out of the question; many dating coaches, gurus, and pick-up artists even teach this (not suggesting that I'm particularly fond of any of those teachings). I'm not really stating what I believe here, just past experience.

So after seeing a study that found that 80 percent of relationships viewed by the study began as friendships and that blind dates, dating apps, and bars were the worst way to find relationships, I got to thinking ""does the friendzone actually exist and is starting with friendship really a bad thing?"" Of course I understand that if you're already friends for a long time and no romantic relationship has been established or romantic interest shown then that is one thing, but I'm thinking in more absolute terms. Women: are you strictly against dating men after you've met them and they haven't immediately shown romantic interest, and are you strictly against dating a friend? Is it more advantageous for men to avoid being friendly with romantic interests and/or should a man give up if a woman doesn't immediately show romantic interest after initially meeting?

I don't know because all I know is, I can't date someone I've just met. If I haven't known you for a few months at least, have had a handful of interactions, and have a decent idea of who you are, I'm not going to be interested whatsoever.
