problem: i feel guilty whenever I want to be closer to someone! I'm programmed to be so polite.

While there my older brother (28) had many girls come up to him, dance, or just chat. Now I was talking one girl that night too, but she ended up having a bf. I do lack some self-confidence and am not as good at flirting as my brother, it just seems effortless to him. My brother also started dating his first serious gf \~6 months ago, but was still entertaining these girls. 

Now you are probably thinking I'm just jealous of my brother, however I'm not, we are very different people and I'm very happy with myself and my place in life, except only in the dating realm. I am 6' 2'', skinny/average looking, content with my appearance, and I have a good job. I go out to bars and see girls, or in college I remember talking to girls at house parties, but very rarely did it turn into anything more. It just sucked after the wedding when family members and friends were commenting on the impression he left on all of these girls who were disappointed he was taken and none were interested in me. I know its my own issue and has more to do with my inexperience and lack of self-confidence than with my brother.

This is not the first time I've felt this way and I can think back on previous encounters with girls that I could've done differently, but that is in the past. At the same time I wonder if maybe I took a couple more chances or was a little more bold I could potentially have had one or two serious relationships by now. I just feel I've always been chasing the wrong girls and it almost makes me regret not settling for girls that I knew liked me but I wasn't interested in back. Have I been self-sabotaging myself my whole life just because I haven't tried hard enough, or didn't want to settle

Next week I am moving to FL (currently live in NJ) for my job where there is even less of a younger population than where I currently live, I'm worried I missed my chance and will not meet anyone (my anxiety talking). But I also think its a good opportunity to focus on myself. My plan is to hit the gym (The most comfortable I've felt going up to girls is when I'm consistently working out), stop smoking weed, find some new friends, hit up some bars, and actively practice having more self-confidence in these situations hoping it will eventually lead to a serious relationship.

She seems really cool and we've had a family constant conversation

The only problem is we're only talking about her.  Ik all about her hobbies and passions, her work, etc. Not once has she asked anything about me! Not that I'm a narcissist and want to talk about my self all the time, but in the whole ""getting to know you"" phase shouldn't she actually get to know me?  

This isn't the first time eather.  I found that in alot of my matches I end up being the one asking questions and carrying the entire conversation, and non of the women put forth any effort to get to know me.

Ik that is I stopped talking to this one girl, and we've only talked about her, that I wouldn't get another message from her, or from many of the girls I've stopped carrying the conversation with.  It's so frustrating that not even the smallest effort is made.  

PSA women, talk to guys.  Reach out to them, ask them what their passionate about.  How they are doing.  Their favorite memory. What their hobbies are. Don't just wait for the guy to ask you everything and have to carry the conversation. If you don't think this applies to you, look through your messages and see who texts who first.

I’ve noticed any time a man in particular brings up his poor appearance, the cavalry comes screaming down on him, if not outright calling him an inc3l, hovering dangerously close to it and/or telling him he just “doesn’t try hard enough”, “has a shitty personality”, “doesn’t groom/clean himself” or any other manner of insult or accusation, as if his problem cannot in any way whatsoever be ascribed to his looks, it HAS to be something under his control, something he’s doing wrong. 


Why the aggression? Why is looks so taboo to discuss? People are happy to say looks matter somewhat, but then feel the need to immediately qualify that with overcompensating BUT PERSONALITY MATTERS MORE!!! So nobody calls them out for thinking “inc3l thoughts”

Yesterday morning (the morning after the party) I texted her and the conversation was a little cranky, probably because we were both hungover and agreed to properly talk over Facetime on Wednesday.

Should I not text her until Wednesday? She said she will be busy this week in general because of work. I don’t know IF I should text her to let her know I’m interested or if I should just let it rest until Wednesday and if I do text her, what should I tell her?

I’ve been friends with this guy since we were in highschool. We used to do everything together and even went to prom. We grew apart eventually, as we went to different colleges. He reached out to me about a year ago (after almost 10 years) to see how I was doing and told me that he deeply regrets not asking me out when we were younger. He asked to take me on a date. I was in a situationship at the time, so I turned him down. 

Me and the other guy broke up pretty soon after. My friend reached out to me again a couple weeks ago. Telling me how beautiful I am, and that he’s always liked me, and that he would like to take me on a date and that he hopes I’ll at least consider it because he’d treat me better… we’ve been taking back and forth since.

Reasons I’m hesitant:
1) We currently live in different cities and if we got into a relationship, someone would have to move eventually. I’m not good at LDR’s bc I need a lot of attention and quality time.. 
2) I’m not super attracted to him. Once a guy is my friend, it’s hard for me to feel that way towards him physically. He’s cute, but not my usual type.
3) I don’t know what his intentions are, or why he waited all these years to tell me. 

I know he would treat me well, and he makes me laugh. He was always such a kind and caring friend who I could tell anything to, and I keep dating douchebag after douchebag. I’m a little worried about how I’ll ever see him as more than a good friend though after that’s what he was for so long. And I’m worried about the long distance. I don’t want to hurt him, but part of me does want to see him and see where things go. I just can’t tell if it’s a good idea despite the circumstances.

Hi all, just need some advice and help, ex (20) broke up with me (22) mid November after 5 years together due to no longer feeling happy and excited.


So we separate and I started no contact for 3 weeks I was absolutely heart broken over it as I thought we were going to have a future together. After her breadcrumbing me she reached out just saying “I made the biggest mistake of my life thinking I wasn’t happy enough with you”.


I was obviously so happy when this happened and after talking we said we would take it slow and get back together. Yesterday after just 2 weeks trying she just kept saying her head was a mess and the last thing She want to do is mess with my head so I think we should just call it a day. 


This was all over text and I asked to see her in person just to talk and she wouldn’t and that was it she wouldn’t talk about it anymore or anything.


I just don’t know what to do now as when we first broke up I was struggling but made it 3 weeks with no contract and this time it is just so much worse as she literally said she made the biggest mistake of her life thinking she want happy with me ,so how can she say that then do this this 2 weeks later then my friends see her out clubbing a few hours later.


I just need advice on how to cope and deal with it, I’ve removed her off social media but the pain is so much worse the second time after her saying all that to me about making a mistake. I just don’t know how to cope she seems like a different person. She was hugging and kissing me just on Christmas Day saying she wishes she could spend all day with me too.

I did indicate on my profile I was looking for something more serious, not just ONS. I thought maybe FWBs or maybe casual dating, who knows where that goes... 

However I've been pleasantly surprised. We get along very well, talk everyday and have hung out at least 1-2 times a week as our schedules permit. Communication feels very natural, our sexual chemistry is fantastic, and he's very sweet and chivalrous. I've tried to let him take the lead because a) keeping realistic expectations to avoid disappointment, b) trying to reciprocate based on his actions, not just his words. So far, he's been the one initiating conversations and arranging things in advance (i.e. next date plans on the current date, etc.) and his words and actions have been consistent.

My dilemma is this: He will likely be moving quite some distance away for work in the New Year, and I don't know where I stand or how to talk about what this means for us (more details below for context). I like him more than I thought I would, and I think there's a possibility that things could grow into something real if given the opportunity.

How should I ask him a) where we currently stand, and what (if anything) he wants from this relationship, and b) what his impending move means? (i.e. does he want to give a LDR a try, and if so what parameters are there? Do we set a time limit? How often and how would we see each other? Are we dating other people? etc.)

I don't want to rush the normal momentum of the exclusivity/commitment conversation and I really don't want to be that stereotypical clingy female who pushes things. But I'm feeling the need to have this discussion soon because there's a bit of a time limit with his potential move.

Any advice as to how/when to have this conversation? And what are people's thoughts about long-distance relationships when you've only just started seeing each other? 

I'm so confused! Please halp!

*For context:*
• We haven't had a conversation to define anything yet (no labels, no direct exclusivity discussion, etc.). I haven't wanted to be pushy or scare him away. However, his actions and the way we talk is very much bf/gf relationship stuff and I'm fairly certain he's not seeing anyone else. And he has made comments about plans in 4-5 months' time (I plan on having very serious surgery, he asked about sex 😅). 
• He's currently interstate with family for Christmas for about a month, which is making having any kind of conversation harder. I had hoped to find a moment for this discussion before he left, but we were both too busy. I feel like this is the kind of conversation best had in person, not via text or phone call or even facetime.
• He has two job offers (either would be ~2hrs by plane, basically interstate). He was upfront and did mention this possibility on our second date, but it was still early days so I thought let's just see where things go. Well, now it's getting complicated. 
• He's still making his decision about what job offer to take (only just had the interviews/offers before Christmas). He's talking things over with his parents, so again, I've wanted to give him some time to think things through.
• I don't want to stand in the way of his career and professional development. Either job would be a good move for his career, a logical next step, but I'm not certain I could/would follow him by moving to these locations unless we were really serious and further into the relationship.
• There aren't many great job prospects for me in those areas (kinda regional), and it would mean upending my life, although I'm also facing many forks in the road professionally right now).
• If he takes either job, he'd probably be staying there for 1-2 years and there is the possibility of him buying a home, something he can't as easily afford right now in our city.
• I don't want to scare him by asking him to commit, but at the same time, I don't want to waste my time if this isn't going somewhere (I'm a women in her mid-30s, biological clock is a tickin'). I'm also scared that we're just starting to get to know each other properly and gain momentum in the normal progression of relationships. Moving apart would likely hinder this process and could prematurely kill what might have been. 
• He has mentioned that if either job offer wasn't good enough, that he would consider staying in our city locally and finding work with another company (lots of comparable jobs on offer). I don't want to sway him one way or the other, but for context, he has considered staying locally (but I think he's seriously considering both offers).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141388,public,self,Help!

We've been regularly talking everyday, making phone calls, and have been on multiple dates. She has even stayed the night at my place multiple times. Started to notice some red flags from her. Every conversation we pretty much had, always reverted back to her complaining about her work, coworkers, family, or anything going on in her life. I don't mind people occasionally venting, but she constantly complained and was negative pretty much every single day I talked to her after the first 3-4ish weeks we initially met. Another red flag I noticed, was that she was being pedantic over my texting. One day, I was hanging out with my step sister, and she tried calling me, and I responded with, ""Out with someone right now. Will call you back later.""

She took offense to me saying, ""someone"" and she basically demanded that I clarify who I am out with. I let her know that I don't have to clarify who I am out with every single time I go out, and that we weren't even together, so I don't have to say who it is (I ended up telling her it was my step sister for piece of mind though). I let her know from the go, I was remaining exclusive and even if I was seeing another person, that I wouldn't be an ass and tell her I was out on another date...She just didn't trust me when I told her ""someone"". 

So last night, after Christmas with my family, I called her late at night. She was in an awful mood from work and she cut the conversation short. I ended up going to sleep and I kid you not, she called me back at 3:00 am in the morning... It woke me up, but I didn't pick up because I wanted to go back to sleep. As the day went out, I just sent her a text saying, ""Hey, just wondering what were you calling about last night?"" She got pissed, and texted me, ""Excuse me!"". I then called her back and she blew up on me over the phone out of nowhere for me texting her, why she called me last night. I was getting a little ticked off, but I was biting my tongue and being vague in the conversation. She just kept ranting on and grilling me out. She then yelled at me, "" I AM GETTING OFF THE PHONE!""  I hung up the phone after she yelled at me, and then she sent me an angry message telling me to go ahead and block her phone number...I told her that I enjoyed hanging out and talking with her, but that she  unnecessarily blew multiple things out of proportion for me asking a simple question. I told her I will not tolerate someone blowing up on me out of nowhere, and talking to me like this. Told her I was not interested anymore, thanked her for showing her true self to me early on, and blocked her number after that.

Another 3-4 shifts go by just making small talk until one shift where she randomly comes up to me where me and my other coworker were working and asks what I'm doing after work, I was stupid at the time and gave her an honest answer of 'sleeping'- my dumb ass didn't work out that it was 99% a cue for me to ask her what she was doing and if she wanted to do something after work. We had been texting about work to each other prior so I thought I better start giving her signals that I'm interested so I started putting x's at the end of texts and she responded by doing the same, also added her on FB to see if she had a BF- which she didn't so everything was going well.

I asked her at the end of both our shifts if she wanted to get some food with me and she had the biggest smile on her face and said yes, we got some fast food and just talked about life for a couple of hours getting to know each other- It seemed clear to me that she was comfortable around me as she started opening up about family problems, she was also laughing quite a bit so I felt it had went well.

About 2-3 days pass until we were working together again and I ask her if she wants to hang out again after work but said she was busy- fair enough, not every shift we're on together automatically means we should hang out so I asked again after a week had past and she again said no so I took this as the last time I'd ask face to face given that it seemed like all I was doing now was bugging her while losing any self respect I had left. It had now been about 2 and a half weeks since we last spoke outside of work yet she was still showing interest during work hours so I messaged her after work saying we should catch up next week if she wasn't busy and she texted back 'of course'. The week arrives so I asked her over text if she wanted to go out to a certain place for food on the day we both had off- I waited 2 full days for her response and got nothing and never got a reply- I would've been gutted if she had replied 'no' but not even replying really got to me.

I started backing off again and thought to myself that shes probably only likes the attention I give her and that I'm her 'eye candy' to look at during work but once work is over she wants nothing to do with me. I started removing the xs from the end of texts and treated her like every other coworker- it took her a total of 1 shift for her to message me and ask if I wanted to hang out with her after work. We did and spent 3 hours in the back of her car talking and watching videos, we did the same thing about 4 days later- this time she brought up the conversation of her ex and how she dated him for a couple of years- I wasn't threatened by this but did wonder why would someone mention an ex out of the blue, it seemed like a sign that she was thinking of us becoming something, but I always 2nd guess myself. I suggested the idea of doing something outside of just hanging out only after work has finished, she seemed keen but maybe she was just being friendly.

She does seem to have a few guy friends she messages which is a bit strange considering most women where I live are only friends with their own gender, when I ask her about she met them ( not in a threatning way) she says they are 'just old school friends/mates'- For me shes indicating to me that shes single (I've never asked her but of course know through FB), or shes sleeping around. Is there anything I can say or do that can test the waters and she if she does want a relationship ? If I do straight up ask her I feel like it will just lead to another disappointment like when she didn't even reply to my text about meeting up,and then there is the problem of having to face the awkwardness at work every day we work together if there is rejection. I feel like a women wouldn't spend 2-3 hours late at night sitting in close proximity with someone they don't have an interest in, but I'm still not 100% sure whether it's interest in a friendly manner or something more?

Even if you are attempting to be humble, downplaying a compliment will backfire. When someone gives a compliment, they are putting themselves out there. Downplaying a compliment is in essence a form of rejection; if their compliment is sincere, you are negating a feeling they had about you and were willing to express. They will be less likely to open themselves up to you in that manner in the future. Additionally, downplaying a compliment will make you seem insecure and unsure of yourself, not humble.

The same holds true for returning compliments. On the surface, it seems like a friendly and polite thing to do. However, it comes of as being insincere. You are not giving someone a compliment based on something they did themselves, but rather as a favor for saying something nice about you. This will likely make them feel the opposite of how you intended when you returned the compliment.

If you receive a compliment, embrace it. If someone says something to you that is impactful, try to stay present in the moment and remember it for when you need it in the future. There is nothing egotistical about this. Tell them how it makes you feel. Simply saying “Thank you, that means a lot to me” is all you need if you mean it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141442,public,self,"If you receive a compliment, don’t respond by downplaying it, or by giving a compliment in return",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpnotf/if_you_receive_a_compliment_dont_respond_by/,no_ads,0.0,,,

When I was younger (16-22), women used to show interest (in a subtle manner, like prolonged eye contact, smiling, acting shy around me), but at that time I was very shy myself, and with a low sex drive, which made me clueless on how to approach the situation.

Fast-forward to today, I think my sex drive has improved, I work out and have thoughts about having s.ex with women, but I've become quite anti-social and angry. Somehow the idea of making the first move pisses me off, I always stop myself, thinking, do I really need sex? I feel like women are still interested, but they are afraid of me (in a sense that they would not dare to even look at me). So I go around thinking, If she can't even look at me, is it really worth my time, to tone myself down, just to accommodate her (you probably would say, of course, you should accommodate her, but that's how breakups happen because people can't be themselves around each other).

My family keeps telling me to go and just meet a girl, but I get frustrated because I do not feel the genuine desire (I have a sex drive, but not romantic/relationship drive), coupled with women not giving subtle signals anymore.

I’m planning on going out with a girl soon but I’m starting to have second thoughts.

I am pretty sure she likes me but her past makes me think there’s no point in going out with her.

She has had an ex-bf and a hookup in the past where as I have never done anything with a girl. Because of this, I believe that if we ever kissed or done anything sexual it won’t even feel special to her because she has already done that with other people.

For me on the other hand, it would be a big deal. However, why should I go out/ date someone if it won’t even be special to them compared to the way I would feel?

If we had the same experience then yes I think it would be different but we don’t.

As the only way to know if someone's a virgin is by asking, i need some suggestions on how to do so without sounding rude or creepy.

**How much information should you disclose about the pitfalls and failures of your previous relationships/marriage?** 

I don't want to sabotage a future relationship with someone by discussing why my previous marriage ended without them first understanding who I truly am. I also feel like I should be honest with the people I am dating about some of the challenges I have had in the past. I have PTSD from military service which caused a lot of self-hate towards myself. I have been getting treatment for the past several years, but it is something I will likely need for the rest of my adult life as part of my mental health maintenance. I know I wasn't a perfect husband, but I didn't deserve to be put in the situation I am currently in.
