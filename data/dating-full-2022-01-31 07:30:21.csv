We lived in different countries, but I had plans on moving there to work.

We talked for 5 months online. It felt like a relationship, he called me cute names, said he wanted to make me his girlfriend, we made several plans of our dates and stuff that we could do. Looking back some of the things he said were maybe love bombing; but because he felt so genuine; I just thought he’s very honest about his emotions and really liked me.

It all ended when I realized I wasn’t the only one who probably got the same attention. Eventually he revealed having other options by sending me a screenshot of his private story that was dedicated for nudes, which I found really surprising - why would he want to flaunt other options in my face and make me feel like one of many, suddenly?

Tbh, I wasn’t THAT surprised cause from the beginning we were both quite sexual with nudes and sexting every here and there, but it was a big turn off when he purposely showed that screenshot to me after claiming he doesn’t do hookups and needs connection to have sex. But Why have a private story for that nudes; then.

I told him later that it turned me off quite big time, and the reaction I got from him was basically equivalent to this: “oh is that a problem? we don’t have to talk then if you don’t want to” and blocked me.

**I feel so dumb and naïve afterwards, I really liked him and did know deep down that I’m not the only one as he sent the nudes quite early on, but I had hope because of the beautiful things he told me and how he remembered** _every single little detail_ **I told him**.

How should I move on? I feel horrible knowing I was genuine all the time, whereas he probably kept me for an ego boost.

It’s now been over 6 months. We see each other a few times a week. He works 60+ hours a week but always leave work early on the day he sees me.

When I was not feeling well, he drove over an hour (taking time off work) to take me to a doctor even though I said I can drive myself (doctor is 5 mins away from me). 

We never just have sex and always go out doing things. We lend each other books and discuss them. Sex is amazing though. If he’s away, he will talk/video call. 

I recently had a “what are we doing” talk and he said he thinks we’re pass the fwb a long time ago but he wants to keep going. He also told me he hasn’t gone this far with anyone before (he’s in his mid 20).

He also said he really likes me as much as he can like anyone. Obviously I am now starting to get attached and really like him. 

Issues:
- I have yet to meet any of his mates or his family. He told me a lot about them but they lived in another town. 
- He said love is just a chemical reaction so he doesn’t believe it’s real. 
- In the beginning he said he doesn’t want anything too serious and he doesn’t/ still can’t get attached to anyone.


I have been screw over so many times in the past and always feel like I’m a female version of good luck chuck (one guy married a woman see saw while he’s also seeing me). I am scared. Is he in denial or does he mean it when he said he doesn’t get attached? Will this end terribly for me one day?

At all. 

Growing up I never had a relationship, I had a few crushes that never worked out and guys never really approached/wanted to be friends with me so that organic friends-to-lover thing never happened. 

This also led to a whole bunch of self esteem/hate issues but that's another story lmao

Skip to university, I still have no relationship experience in my third year. I downloaded dating apps (hinge, bumble) clearly (imo) stating I'm looking for a relationship but so many first dates seemed to be looking for something more (clearly sexual in my opinion) or we just didn't click.

I don't have a problem with people who have casual sex. I'm glad you're having fun and have the confidence to do it. I personally don't think it's a good idea for me. Again, I have no relationship experience so I think a casual/FwB relationship would end up with me getting WAY too attached and getting played.

I feel like I have a good idea of how (a lot) of guys on dating apps (and beyond) work based on listening to my friends experiences. A lot of guys my age want sex. That's fine! However, a lot of guys that just want sex don't want to admit that and like to play this game where they'll pretend they want to get to know you and date and then when he finally gets the sex he wanted, it's ghost time. Again, of course, not all guys and all that but it's very common.

I do NOT want to have to go through this. I think this has led me to become extremely cautious and picky which is uhh not a good combo with dating ig

My friends have told me the old ""it'll find you when you stop looking,"" well it's been a while and tbh idk if I'll be able to ""not look"" for it, I'd like to experience nice things too. They've also said that I may be better off meeting someone in person somewhere and kinda hitting it off from there. Sure! A lot of my friends have found their boyfriends/partners after real life encounters. Unfortunately, I'm just not social enough. I have NEVER had a close guy friend or talked to a guy who wanted to hang out beyond one interaction.

I (26F) Matched with this guy (26M) just over a month ago and we’ve been talking everyday. We’re on the same page about what we want in a relationship and also lifestyle-wise. The thing that’s bothering me though is that we’ve been communicating less and less the last 2 weeks and it’s starting to annoy me a little. 

I’ve been initiating our convos lately. He tends to message only in the late evening like 9pm onwards. Which I understood at first if he had a busy day cause work and grad school. but now he just doesn’t really say why like he used to. Before he would always mention to me if he wasn’t going to have his phone or if he was going for a run, or hanging out with his buddies and would tell me when he’s back and free to talk. And we’d text throughout the day (every couple hours as we both have school &amp; work) and then we’d talk after like 5pm till bedtime cause that’s when he’s done work/school and winds down (he lives on his own). but now it’s just silence most of the time. 

He responds really late and then always says he’s tired he’s going to sleep. Or falls asleep on me and doesn’t respond until the next evening which is like 24hs and sometimes more. Like dude I see you’re online and received my message.

I’m concerned mainly because I’ve been ghosted by several guys in the past few months and I always just get frustrated as to why they just can’t properly communicate and drop the ball on me like a hot potato. Even though they all say I’m cute, they like my personality and want to know me…then after a couple of great dates, POOF! No text no call, even if they’re actively online.

This guy though hasn’t asked me out on a date - even though our conversations show he really does like me - we joke and laugh alot, both attracted to each other, on the same wavelength, similar interests and have pretty clear cut and similar goals for life in general. 

He said a few times that he really likes me, thinks I’m very cute and enjoys having a good conversation together. we talk about many things which he says it’s a really hot trait of mine, and it’s attractive that I can have a genuine good conversation. We talked for a while this one day on the phone and he even got a little horny and said it’s because I turn him on. But why hasn’t he asked me out then? Is he shy? Is he being cautious? 

maybe I’m just naive and believing what he’s saying cause I try to believe the best in everyone? I know people say when someone keeps saying they’re busy they most likely don’t want to talk to you otherwise they’d make time. Even a simple text to ask how’s your day or week going? 

I’ve heard similar stories like this and I’m starting to get the gut feeling that he’s slowly withdrawing himself from me idk why. He did apologize about it and said he felt bad. But like nobody works till 10pm Monday-Sunday. And I’m not sure anymore.

I guess I can just say I know a lot of ghosts roaming around 😔

Am I the issue here? I only need honest objective answers please and thanks




TLDR: been talking to this guy for just over a month. He said he really likes me. Started off with great conversations and talking everyday, we’re both attracted to each other similar life goals and relationship expectations but I feel he’s withdrawing as we don’t communicate as often as before. takes 24hrs (or more sometimes) to respond and I’m initiating conversations now. He keeps saying he’s busy and tired a lot; (we’re both working and in grad school). been talking less and less last 2 weeks. He hasn’t even asked me out.

He just told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. I told him that I’m not ready to settle down and I love him but not that way.

So he told me that he wanted to go no contact and that he couldn’t do it to himself to be around me and watch me find someone else cause it would break his heart. He told me he would still talk to me at work but only to be polite 

I had two weeks off work and gave him the space that he needed. I went back today and he was so cold to me and treated me like I didn’t exist, we were really close before, hanging out and texting all day and everyone was asking me what was going on cause it was so noticeable.

Though he said and insisted he can’t/will never get attached. Is there a real life fwb relationship that actually turn into a proper long term relationship or will this just going to end badly?

Starting off as casual. He was exclusive with me since he started seeing me and deleted all his dating profiles the first time we had sex (I didn’t requested it). I, on the other hand, continue to date other guys for another few months before being exclusive with him.

It’s now been over 6 months. We see each other a few times a week. He works 60+ hours a week but always leave work early on the day he sees me. If he’s away, he will video call me. We lend each other books and discuss them. He has cute nicknames for me  and also bought me Christmas present. 

When I was not feeling well, he drove over an hour to take me to a doctor even though I said I can drive myself (doctor is 5 mins away from me). 

We never just have sex and always go out doing things (he usually do whatever I want to do) but sex is amazing. 

I recently had a “what are we doing” talk and he said he thinks we’re pass the fwb a long time ago but he wants to keep going. He also told me he hasn’t gone this far with anyone before (he’s in his mid 20) and that he sees this as long term.

He also said he really likes me as much as he can like anyone. Obviously I am now starting to get attached and really like him. 

Issues:
- He said love is just a chemical reaction so he doesn’t believe it’s real. 
- he said he doesn’t/ wont get attached to anyone.
- Due to my past, I have disorganized attachment style. I don’t think he knows how to deal with this.


Is he in denial or does he mean it when he said he doesn’t get attached?

In my course, I met ‘Danny’ (M32). ‘Danny’ is a super extroverted, really sweet guy who is affectionate and friendly to absolutely everyone in the class. Immediately just a really loveable guy. But because of this, I’m finding it really hard to discern if he’s into me/flirting or if the things that make me suspect he is are just his personality.

Some evidence that I think points to yes;

- We have lunch together pretty much every day with a group of 3 other people. Our course is very exhausting so some days by lunch time I’m happy to just quietly sit and listen to the others chat while I recharge. He always checks in with me and makes sure I’m okay in these instances.

- The course group has a WhatsApp chat and he got my number from there and has started messaging me individually. Just little funny things and inside jokes from the day - nothing too serious. But from a comment he made yesterday, I don’t think he’s messaging anyone else from the course exclusively.

- As we get to know each other, we’re finding out that we have a lot of shared interests. Every time a new one comes to light he gets really excited and says something like ‘you just get better and better’. 

- He’s a tactile guy and at least once a day touches my arm either when saying hello in the morning or to congratulate me on something.

- The other day after a particularly exhausting day he gave me a hug as we were saying goodbye. I don’t think I’ve seen him hug anyone else goodbye.

- The other day our friend made a comment about having to borrow his girlfriend’s car. ‘Danny’ made a sarcastic comment about it reminding him that he’s single. It was a very out of the blue comment and kind of awkwardly placed - maybe he’d been trying to find a way to slip it into conversation for a while?

Problem is, like I said, he’s very friendly with everyone. If he told me tomorrow that all of the above was purely platonic I wouldn’t be surprised - that’s how affectionate he is. 

I’m also a very average-looking girl, whereas he’s quite conventionally attractive, so it’s hard for me to reconcile in my head why he would be interested in me.

Six months ago I (29f) got out of an extremely emotionally/borderline physically abusive relationship. I was working my dream job across the country and ended up packing up and leaving overnight to come home and restart fresh. The issues started when I caught my ex (30m) going behind my back talking to his ex. I let him know it made me uncomfortable and he  agreed to stop but continued to do so through different avenues. This turned into me losing my shit and him realizing it was messed up. He was friends with other exes but it was cool because they were legit friends, whereas this girl was still clearly hung up on him. A few months after this fiasco I caught him liking other girls on Instagram and blatantly flirting with them. This went on for months with constant gaslighting on his behalf telling me I’m crazy until I lost it and he realized how badly it affected my self esteem and deleted every chick who wasn’t an actual friend. (No, this wasn’t forced by me but clearly the temptation was too much if they were coming up in his feed so he deleted them.) I should’ve taken these red flags and ran from the beginning but being 1200 miles away from home with no friends or real family close by made it hard to do so and things only got worse. 

Fast forward to today. I’ve been talking to this guy (27m) for about two months now. We’re not official but we’re exclusive. He’s kind, thoughtful, and doesn’t intentionally trigger my anxiety but is patient and is actually truly helpful in those situations. (Like reteaching me how to drive in the snow rather than getting mad at me for getting scared and anxious.) My biggest downfall is I creeped on who he follows online and how he reacts to their posts. (I know, this is extremely toxic on my part but because of the past I can’t help it.) I really want to set the boundary that this isn’t okay with me because of my past but don’t want to come off as crazy. 

So I guess I’ve got a few questions: A) How do I stop from creeping on guys online activities to stop myself from comparing and having toxic thoughts? I don’t want to be toxic but I know how bad that is. B) Is if worth talking to this new potential dating candidate about it or should I just focus on fixing question A? C) If yes to question B, how do I go about it? In the past I’ve tried to approach these situations with honesty and not being accusing but just open about how those actions made me feel and it resulted in months of gaslighting and me questioning myself on so many levels. If I do bring it up I just want to do it the right way.

Unfortunately she’s not in the wrong here, this being my first relationship I panicked when this all happened and when I asked what was going on.  She acted like she didn’t know what I meant and then I got mad and I asked to have a official break or an official break up.  She said she wanted a break and she still cared about me.

I told him I was definitely still down if he was. He said he was. Told him how great a time I had and that I'd see him Wednesday.

So normally, he texts me throughout the day while he's at work. Today is my first day back to my full time job since he and I met, so that could be why I haven't heard from him much. But of course, it just happens to be after the third date and out first kiss, so I'm a little wary that maybe the date didn't go as well in his mind as it did in mine.

She's much younger than me, I'm 30M she's 20M but we live in a very small town so it happens that I see her very often since we are in the same group of friends (from 18 to 35 years old people).

She was in a long relationship of 4 years with another person of the same town, this until around one month ago, when she dumped him. So now she is freshly single.

We kissed twice, once when she was still in the relationship and once one week after she left her boyfriend. We never went further than very hot french kisses. She never wanted to go deeper and that is fine for me. She's only had sex with her long term past boyfriend so she is kind of unexperienced - told me she doesn't even know if she had an orgasm.

Now, to make this shorter, this past weekend we had a dinner together with other people and at the end of the night I invited her and another guy to come sleep at my home since they didnt want to drive their car back home (we where a little bit drunk) and they both agreed. I let the other guy sleep on the couch in the kitchen and she went to sleep with me in my bed. We turn the light off and I said ""cmon give me a kiss"" and She was like ""mmmm no, that is not a good idea, it wouldnt end up in a good way"" and I was like ""cmon just a kiss"" and she said ""nope Im crazy these days a d I don't know what I want"" then grabs my hand and brought it on her belly making me hug her and keeping me hand in hand. We fell asleep, woke up early and talked about private shit, family related stuff and so on (She was mainly talking) for hours in the bed. 

After this we all woke up, had lunch and I invited some people at home where we had an afternoon party. After this we want to her home and kept partying with music and alchol. 

At one point I grab her and talking very close to her I something like ""so, it is a yes or a no?"" And she says ""for now it is a no, I just got out of a relationship and I want to stay alone"" and I ""well we can just have sex"" and she ""It is still early for me to sleep around with people, especially with people of my same town (we all know each other here and she doesn't want to let people know about herself)...but thank you very much for listening to me and blablabla"" and I ""no problem, I do really care about you"" and more or less it was it. That night I slept at her home but in another room, she was sleeping with a girlfriend of her.

Now, I have other relationships going on, but I give the priority to her. For now, until she makes up her mind, I don't want to push her, ask her out again or something. She needs her space and Im aware that, keep pushing isn't the right thing to do.

What I want your opinion about is: should I try to make her jelous showing my other plates to her? It happens that we have dinners and partyes with all the group of friends (20-30 people) and Im not sure if I should be bringing one girl from another town Im in a relationship with since around 3 months. I would just do it if it weren't for this young girl I like but I'm not sure if doing so I would push her away or kind of make her a little bit jelous and maybe bring her closer to me.

I feel like a lot of people are looking for an easy way in. With a bit of introspection I realized that that’s how I am. What I mean by this is being able to open up your heart. It is impossible to build any kind of lasting relationship unless you allow yourself to be vulnerable. It is a fear that I’ve had for years and I’ve honestly never realized until now. I might have subconsciously known this but it is only now that I recognize it, accept it, and want to change.

I desire so much to bond and to share my life with someone special, I want someone who I can let my guard down with, just be silly and say whatever comes to mind. I want to be with someone I can spend the best part of my days with, someone I can go to whatever event I’m thinking of going to with. These are all things that can happen but will not happen because I can’t get past a certain point in a relationship. The fear of opening up.

Why fear? Well, I don’t really know. Perhaps it’s because I don’t like who I really am? Is it because the real me isn’t as “cool” as the person I think I should be? Is it because the real me is someone most people would consider “different?” I’ve had to accept the reality of those possibilities, I don’t want to be seen as different but I want to be seen as genuine. With these two written codes in my brain, I’m left at a stalemate. I can’t progress so I may as well be regressing. Unless you are sincere, you will not be able to bond. Unless you communicate, it will not stick.

This fear of being hurt is a protection, but it also feels like a curse. Not knowing why you feel a certain way makes it hard to know how to address the issue. There is nothing wrong with seeking professional help, there is nothing wrong with being introspective, there is nothing wrong with admitting you have issues. I understand why I can’t enter a lasting relationship, I don’t know how to fix this,for a few years now I’ve been used to bottling up my real feelings, my passions. My opinions are quite controversial so I avoid saying much so as not to stir a pot. I hate how different I am and I’ll admit that I’m not comfortable with it. This is something that perhaps everyone doesn’t go through, or at least not to the same degree, but it doesn’t excuse my unwillingness to be genuine. People like authenticity, I like authenticity but I myself am not doing it, or showing it.

So I (27F) have been seeing this guy (24M), for a month now. We have a great sexual chemistry, maybe one of the best in sex i have had so far in terms of sexual skills and taking care and full attention on how to please me.  He is kind too and we get along well with each other. 

The last time I saw him though,  he shared with me a bit of extra details about his past that kinda turned me off and made me a bit disgusted. He told me that in the past and also two months ago, he had payed for sex with prostitutes and also visits frequently strip clubs. And also told me about his last relationship and why he broke up , because he was visiting strip clubs and getting lap dances whilst in relationship.  


At this point I wanna add that I like this guy but I'm not looking for something serious, I'm just having something casual with him. But I felt kinda grossed out and turned off for his visits to prostitutes and all these details he shared. I am not a prude and I also have many experiences , I just don't think high of men who go so often to strip clubs or even worse to brothels and paying for sex. 


Another thing he shared with me is that his uncle is in Canada and made lots of money by illegal activities and selling drugs and he suggested him to get to the businness. I told him not to,  he said me he declined also but the last time he changed the story and told me that he found another job in Canada as a manager in a pharmaceutical company which smells as a lie and will go there in the next months and stay maybe for 1 month and his uncle will give him his own house .


So I can only see him as a purely sexual experience but after these stories I feel very turned off and disgusted.

She looked interesting and I originally kinda messaged her looking for friends in my area. We chatted back and forth and I kinda got some vibes that she liked me but I wasn’t sure. We moved it over to text and chatted some more. She asked me out for a coffee date. I agreed but was unsure if she meant a coffeedate or a coffee date. I realized a bit later she meant the second one. I decided I wanted to meet her anyway since she seemed cool and we clicked. We chatted some more and sent silly pickup lines back and forth and talked about our lives. She suggested talking on the phone a few times. I started liking her somewhere in here and was excited about meeting. I had some things I wasn’t sure I would like about her but still wanted to meet. Also in the course of chatting some of the things seemed less important and became less important. She mentioned her ex a few times. We chatted more. She mentioned them again. I asked a question or two. She sent me a post or theirs and told me she was mad about something they said on social media about her. I texted back that I thought they just wanted her to see it and she seemed nothing like what they were saying. She also told me that her two exes were dating. (One of them made a tiktok about it). At this point I tried to turn the conversation away when she said something about me punching one of them if I saw them. (I’m not sure if she was kidding or not.) I briefly succeeded saying I’d rather be out with her. After a bit she asked if I wanted to talk in the phone. I said sure but that I might have to hang up soon as my family was coming back. She said that was cool and called me. I was very excited. I immediately answered when she called. She said hello. Not only was her voice not at all how I imagined it, I immediately didn’t like it. It made me not like her immediately and not want to date her. She started talking about her exes again. I sat in shock and tried to keep up the conversation for maybe ten minutes. My family came back and I had to hang up. Now I feel like somehow after hearing her voice I’m just thinking of all the things that irritate me about her and I’m kind of annoyed she kept bringing up her ex. It also looked like she used to be their fiancée from the vid she sent me. 
I now feel like: 
1 we are in very different places if she has been someone’s fiancée and I have not even been in a relationship before. 
2 think it’s seriously uncool that she keeps bringing up her ex. (Even if she did apologize for sending the vid after she did.) 
3 I REALLY don’t like her voice. Maybe that sounds shallow or something idk. I also don’t see myself ever liking her voice or super getting used to it. 
I’m wondering if we could maybe be friends although I’m getting tired of this whole thing. 

My question is: what do I do? 
How do I now after voicing my interest in her and even saying I wanted to dance with her (🤦) say that all of a sudden I’m not interested. Do I go on one date and then say “yeah I don’t think it’s gonna work out”? 
I can’t imagine the right idea would be to just tell her; “yeah I don’t like your voice. I don’t wanna date you.” 
I don’t particularly want to ghost her for a variety of reasons. Some of them being it’s a shitty thing to do and I kind of still want to be friends with her.

We went out once and played tennis then went back to hers. She went to Uni and we continued to talk over Snap. 

In my eyes, this relationship I had with her has been more than a typical friendship she'd have with another boy. We'd talk for 4 hours plus every day as we have such a natural connection. She'd always come to me with problems and I'd go to her with my problems. 

As you would expect a uni student gets drunk and has fun. She'd always message me on her nights out sending me photos and showing how much fun she'd be having. Often on these nights out she'd be more than ""just friends"" with me. She'd tell me to say that I love her, tell me kinks and take the relationship further than a typical friendship. She wanted me to visit her at uni but seeing as my parents hadn't met her and I had to travel across the country to see her my parents weren't comfortable with it.

She came home mid November and we agreed to meet up and we went to the cinema. General good night I put my arm around her and she was comfortable with it. She felt tired I took her home at 9/10 PM and we said our goodbyes and she went back to Uni. 

Her general behaviour of being borderline friends but more than friends while sober then being clearly more than friends continued while she was back at University. Her flatmates called me early hours of the morning  just informing me she'd had a bit too much to drink and was in a bad state. This for me was a sign that to her flat I was more than just a friend. There were other people showing interest in her but she had shut them down and one of them had a personal problem with me without having met me suggesting to me that I was seen as competition or the man to beat in a sense.

She was back over christmas and continued with the relationship that we had meeting weekly going out to do an even such as golf then going for drinks after often ending in me walking her home. One night I admitted that I liked her more than a friend and suggested we should be more than friends which she agreed with.

Saturday was my last night with her and I made the most of it. We went for dinner and drinks our usual kind of evening. I walked her home with my arm round her and had in the back of my mind that I wanted to make the relationship official and go for the first kiss. In her words she's quite an unaffectionate person who doesnt often like to hug people but she'd always been happy to do it with me. We was saying good byes and hugging to which I asked if she wanted to kiss. She said yes and we proceeded to do so. We paused and she asked if we was officially boyfriend and girlfriend and I said yes and we continued to kiss. I'd try to leave but she'd pull me back in for more. For me this was natural and was meant to be. We said goodbye and I went home to bed obviosuly estatic that I'd pulled it off.

Fast forward a couple hours when I'm deep into my slumber I get a message at 1 am saying she was angry and that she shouldn't have done that. She said I'd taken advantage of her in that state and that I'd upset her. I obviously apologised and said I'd never take advantage of her or any other person as its not within my nature. We talked things through and she realised she was just overwhelmed in the situation as it was her first time as well as my first time  and we had a small joke. We both said good night and I thought it was over. 15 minutes later I receieve a message saying I'd upset her and that she just wants to be friends and that she wasn't ready. I apologised again and said I'd respect her decision but showed her how much I cared for her and she said she was just overwhelmed and it was a new experience and that she wanted to take things slowly. We worked things out and said we'd work out the long distance later that day and take things slowly. We eventually went to sleep at 4 am and I knew it wouldn't be the end of it.

Midday the day after we kissed I recieved a message I knew I would receive. She said she's not ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on university. She was worried she was being selfish by being at Uni separate from me after I explained countless times I don't require a physical relationship to be with her and value the emotional relationship over everything. I asked why she didn't want the relationship when we'd been only a step away from being in the full relationship and it being in touching distance and I feel her only excuse was saying it was ""her not me"" or ""im not ready for a relationship"". I said I cannot see us as being just friends as it had always been a bit more than that and it would pain me too much to be just friends with her. She said she might be open to having a relationship in the future and In my emotional state snapped back asking ""whats the future? 3 months? 3 years?"". I told her to go back to uni, settle in and come back to me with a reconsideration.

The girl I was with Saturday night was a polar opposite of the girl I spoke to on Sunday. She admitted to liking me, agreeing I treated her well and that she wanted or enjoyed the intimacy but wasn't ready for a relationship. I feel I've been low blowed 3 times here and it felt like a knife in my side getting twisted. I broke down yesterday and can't stop thinking about it.

I need advice on this, I've never had such a genuine relationship with a person in my life. I'm genuinely confused and at a loss on what to do. My questions are the following:  


Does she actually like me and genuinely not ready for a relationship?  
What does not ready for a relationship even mean?  
Should I message her first or let her message me? I want to tell her that we're virtually already there in that relationship but I'm not sure if to give her space and let her message me or leave it a couple days and persue her.  
If she genuinely likes me, do I wait for her to be ready for that relationship?

I will say I’m unlucky, I don’t think dating is this hard for the average person. In fact, most people have it easy as long as they’re attractive. Since I’ve been on dating apps on and off for years, that’s the only way I’ve met people but I just never catch a break. The one time I saw someone short term, it felt like settling because no one else gave me attention &amp; he wasn’t physically attractive to me but treated me okay. I always get pursued by the ones I don’t want, if they’re attractive they’re dicks or there’s no connection OR if they’re good looking but decent personality they’re too short for me. 

Sometimes the guys on dating apps message and we speak for a little while, but things fizzle out. Out of no where in some cases, they reach out again and come across as unstable or a total asshole wanting to rub something in my face. Look at last post, is this standard of dating apps or am I unlucky?

I really don’t have a desire to be social and meet people in person, it’s so hard to make friends.

-If you ghost someone who you agreed to be in an exclusive relationship with or someone who played a pivotal role in your life for years…..you’re scum of the earth (unless it was an abusive situation)

-If you get ghosted by someone you were talking to on the dating app who made no promises to you and never met you in person…..it’s no big deal and if this honestly upsets you then you probably need to re-evaluate yourself 

-If you were chatting with someone on the dating app and arranged a specific time, date, and location to meet up but you ghost them before that time arrives, that’s very bad manners and there’s no excuse for it

-If you ghost someone who you met in person 1-3 times and made no promise to meet up again……yeah,it might have been nicer to inform the person that the connection is not there  but I don’t think ghosting them will make you the antichrist either

So my back story, I’m I guess a late bloomer, I was obese from 10 to 20( my best was 265 lbs for 5’9, now I’m around 155).


Because of that I didn’t had any confidence with girls and people in general ( i was afraid of my reflection, i didn’t like myself back then).

I had many male friends but no girl friends.

Since my diet I have gained confidence and now I really like myself and what I have become.

Since I was a noob in dating, I started to go on Tinder .

I had good results I think (not fan of number but to visualise around 200 matches in a month).

Lost my v card easily but after some time I realized that was not the way I wanted to gain experience, I thought I was just seeking confirmation so I stopped.

I want to take my time to do things slowly, more naturally .

So my question is where or how do I need to start?

I understand why men more specifically suffer from this 'nice guy' thing. 

To me it seems everyone wants someone who can love themselves as much as their partner. Relationship's of all kinds require attention and work from both parties. When one party requires constant validation and the like it becomes quite taxing. I have definitely been on the offending side of this and with more emotional maturity as I've gotten older I've began to see it in small ways.

 After reading loads of articles on top of reading this sub I also got the idea that this kind of needy behavior can, in extreme cases, lead to manipulation. 

My previous experience a few months ago really hit home that I'd like to change and become that person. It's certainly a healthy thing to want to grow but it can seem overwhelming. Even with counseling I find it hard to see what habits need to be prioritized in order to implement positive change( tbf I probably need to find a more suitable counsellor). 

I came to the realization I think that I wanted an LTR for the wrong reasons. For someone to share my insecurities with and someone to talk to. Putting that role in a 3rd party, a therapist, is probably a good place to start. I really thought for years that I should be myself whatever the cost and that jf people can't accept an anxious and needy me then they're just not for me. A comment I saw from here which has helped with that was 'dont be yourself, be the best version of yourself you can be, for yourself'. 

Another comment I saw here said that 'romantic relationships are a privilege,not an entitlement'. You gotta work to put yourself out there and fail a couple times. That definitely helped too.

Bad dating experiences do happen everywhere, so let's not demonize the apps, and instead try to help people who are having a hard time on what they could be doing wrong and we ourselves can stop approaching the apps with such defensive pessimism.

Also, what's the hate with Tinder? Dating is a numbers game, so most people go there because it's the most likely place they'll find someone, so stop saying it only for hookups. If you're only meeting people who are interested in hookups, you should look inwards and see why you're swiping on those kinds of people and if there were warning signs.

And for God's sake unmatch people if you're no longer interested in talking to them. It declutters your conversations and makes it easier to have meaningful conversation. Unless you're looking for attention in seeing how many like you can get, in which case, fuck you and your eyebrows.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half. 

We have had conversations prior to this where he has talked about moving before and had mentioned that he isn't particulary tied to the state that we live in. He has also mentioned that he thinks it would be easy to find a job for him and he has already been contemplating leaving the company he works for. 

It was recently anouced that they are closing the base I am at for pilots. They have already been shrinking it for a while for both pilots and flight attendants. So far they have not made any plans to close it for flight attendants.  I was talking about this situation with my boyfriend and I asked him if he would break up with me if I had to move for work and he said he didn't know. It caught me off gaurd because I was asking more for like affirmation it didn't even cross my mind that he might actually break-up with me. He then said he didn't really want to talk about it right then and it's something that he would need to think about so I said ok think about it and then let me know. 

I asked him about it again last night after giving him time to think and he still said he doesn't know and that might not ever happen so there is no point in talking about it unless we are actually in that situation. 

I told him for me I would have a lot to figure out with what it would look like to swap bases. Would I move where I live or just fly into work the day before which eats into a lot of my days off and costs extra money because I would have to be paying for my apartment as well as hotels the day before and after my trips?  Would he move with me? How often would we be able to fly back and forth visitng? I am currenlt working on my pilot liscense so how long or short term these arangment would be too also effects things. I don't know exactly what it would look like but I do know that I would try to make it work with him.

He thinks it's eaier for me because I already travel and I have already moved states. He doesn't see a point in talking about it. To me though if someone is your partner and they're someone you potentially see a future with the you are gonna do your best to make it work even if the circumstaces are not ideal. Considering we both have flight bennifits and could fly for free it's not a situation where we would never get to see eachother.

I'm tired of the straining searches. Being lead on by other people. Leading other people on to help them feel not alone when I know it's going no where.

I'm just going to accept that there is no one out there for me. I'm too specific and I just don't have nearly all of the qualities in what it takes to hold a relationship. Too knee deep in wanting to live life as a single individual to be crawling back into wanting a partner.  


Been in over 23 relationships in my life, both offline and online. Some of them could've been better but it is what it is. The people I really want are in committed relationships that I cannot ever hope to outlast in waiting until they're available because they've been in them for 10+ years. I've missed my chances to get them when they were available but I got too reluctant so my loss.  


At least from giving up dating, that'll mean no more cringe inducing conversations with people coming up to me to just waste my time with small talk. No more desperate people wanting to hook up with nothing built up in any prior experience. No more of me trying to juggle life while juggling someone else's life that's with mine.  


Most importantly, no more damn hurting. I've already suffered being emotionally hurt when I thought I was going to be with someone I immediately clicked with, only for them to go with someone else behind my back when I was taking time off to focus a little on myself to improve so that way I can be more prepped and refined to handle the possibility of a relationship with them.
