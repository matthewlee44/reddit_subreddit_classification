I ask this because I saw a ton of people lately in dating places that go with the idea that if you're not treated as a god by your partner and he's not willing to die for you. While if something happens to them you're immediately allowed to leave them. Those people don't deserve love then?

Of course if you work hard as well then you have absolutely every right to complain and so on.

But when I see a post about someone needed to get 300k from their partner as like an allowance and as soon as that is cut they think of leaving them.

I'm sure this is a simple case of ""he's just not that into you"", but I need insight.

There's this guy I have been friends with for years. We saw each other again recently a few weeks ago and there is definite chemistry. We have been texting a bit back and forth, but this guy is SO flaky and hot and cold with his communication. I initiate the conversation sometimes because I don't play games. But I also know that men like to pursue.

For example, twice in the last few weeks he's said ""I'll call you tomorrow."" ""Would you like to get together next week? Great, I'll call you in a few days."" Well, he never follows through. And I am way too understanding.

BUT...this is the part that drives me absolutely insane. He likes my pictures on social media. It is obvious he's not that busy, he has his phone, and it is super insulting to me that he would put in such a low investment form of communication, but not follow through on his word to make plans. Social media means nothing, but he obviously knows I can see it and that I also can see that he's avoiding me.

I am kind of getting the feeling that he either:  
 \-Doesn't like me or want to see me and is too shy or too cowardly to say so.  
 \-Doesn't see me as a challenge?  
 \-Has a lot going on?  
 I am matching energy on this connection going forward. I've done my part. I will not reach out again, because this behavior is annoying and childish. But the thing is, I like him and don't want to jump to conclusions. Should I just drop it and move on completely, or what should I do if he reaches out again?  
 I want to make it clear as politely as possible that I don't tolerate inconsistency, that I expect directness no matter what. I have standards for how I expect to be treated.  
 I just feel stupid and embarrassed for putting myself out there, pursuing, and being complimentary and too understanding. I want him to chase me. But I feel like I did something wrong, or he's just a loser who can't speak his truth. I feel lost.

I had my second date ever with my gf recently. Since I'm the only one who can drive between the two of us, I drove down and we met at a park near her house. I brought Timbits with me, but I did something mischevious that I am rather proud of. 

The Timbit ""surprise"": My gf likes to explore different flavours of food whereas I only have one flavour I stick by (No matter the food, if I see the flavour I will get it). We always joke about my ""lack of taste"", so I thought I would make the Timbits reflect our inside joke. What did I do? I bought a 10 box filled only with the flavour she teases me about. When I handed it to her and she opened it, she laughed and was pleasantly surprised. I also bought an assorted box of 10 Timbits too so she could try all the flavours the store had.

After the Timbit surprise, we sat down on a picnic blanket and watched the second half of Hamilton (we watched the first half on the first date) and then played a game of chess. It was very fun and we had quite a few laughs as we made stupid moves on the board (we both cannot play well). I let her kill some of my pieces (queen, bishop, castle, etc.) before I decided to go for the win lol.

At the end, we walked over to my car and had the classic awkward silence moment at the end of the date – the point where you question if you should make a move. On our first date, I ended with a simple ""I'll see you later, man!"" which was really CRINGE lol (it was my first date ever, you can't blame me XD). This time I was determined to do better, but this is how it went down:

\*awkward silence\*   

Me: “heh, I really never know how to end these things” (kinda funny because it’s my second date in my life)  

Her: \*chuckles\*   

Me: “how about a hug?”   

Her: \*smiles\* “okay”  

\*hugs for a second. I probably accidentally hit her with my shoulder\*

I (21) really struggle with sth. I met a guy (27) on Tinder and we texted a few weeks before our first date. I wasn’t around for that long unfortunately, so a date wasn’t possible sooner. I actually appreciate he was that patient. 

A few days ago, we had our first date. It seemed to go well and he checked up on me the same night. The next day he already told me that we could meet up for a second time soon. 

Sounds good and all, but the problem I have is that I am really unsure about him. Not like he wouldn’t be my type and all, but he while texting everything seems so different. I text him and get an answer 5-10 hours later. Sometimes I see that he’s online and isn’t answering back. And that’s a huge red flag for me, since it just shows he doesn’t want to deal with me at that moment. 

He just seems not interested anymore, although he always tells me how nice he thought the date went and he wants to see me again. 

But if a guy isn’t answering me all day, I just don’t think he’s interested or ofc another girl is more important.

I (25f) was in my first serious relationship from 16-21. It was a very toxic and abusive relationship. Once that ended I did the hooking up/casual sex thing. During this process I ended up in a once again, toxic and abusive “situationship” (lasted 2.5 years) I finally ended that 7 months ago and I have been trying to start *healthy* dating again. 

This sh** freaking sucks. I was recently talking to someone and everything seemed to be going so well and then he just flipped a switch. This is exhausting. I am used to toxic dynamics where it is so intense and passionate and exciting at first and then it comes crashing down (I still think I want to chase that “high”). I’m trying to get used to the slow progression of things but for some reason this seems harder? A part of me also misses the toxicness of past relationships. Specifically with my situationship when we were “on” or things were “good” they were so good it felt like I was on cloud 9. I’m having a hard time getting used to what regular dating looks like. 

I truly have no idea how I’m supposed to find someone I’m compatible with, attracted to, has similar goals, has similar lifestyle etc.

I know that, I'm a walking red flag but I'd like to get there someday.

Bg: I (34F) married my first boyfriend ever and we were together for 15 years.  I was madly in love with him but I did catch him being shady over the years, but never caught him cheating until our relationship fell apart last March.  I found out he had cheated on me extensively throughout our relationship including fathering a child that he didn't see or support.  It was horrifying and devastating.

We have four kids together between the ages of eleven and three.  Yes, four kids.  That's red flag number one.  That's a lot of kids.

Red flag number two: I was going back to school when this happened.  I'm halfway through a nursing degree and a single mom of four kids.  I'm not working.

Red flag number three: I got diagnosed with breast cancer last fall despite having none of the risk factors.  I'm a healthy weight, I exercise, eat pretty well.  I had chemo and lost all my hair.  I also had surgery and haven't had reconstruction yet.  My prognosis is excellent though because I found it fairly early.  This added an extra year to my studies because I couldn't attend in person clinicals while doing chemo.  I am an honors student still though.

I'm not going to lie though, I miss the companionship of being in a long term relationship. I have never dated and the whole idea is terrifying to me.  I want to have hope that someday, it might be in my future.

So I'm thinking I need to wait several years, have reconstruction, grow my hair out, wait until my kids get older and finish school.

We’ve met each other’s families, we talk daily and see each other a few times a week. He spoils me with love, talks about marriage and wants me to move in with him. In discussing our pasts, he mentioned that he cheated once on a girl after she cheated on him. However in another convo, he mentioned that his last ex who he lived with for 2 years became cold and distant so he went on dates with other girls unbeknownst to her. He’s also asked me how I felt about cheating as if it was a question. We discussed where I stood, and he said he never wants to sleep with anyone else but me and that I’m the healthiest relationship he’s had. We also talked about remaining “friends” with ppl we’ve slept with which he didn’t think was problematic but I told him it bothered me and he said he would not stay in touch with past lovers going forward b/c he never wants me to be worried about things or feel unconfident in our relationship. His phone cover is my photo which would make me think he can’t possibly be cheating, and he never tries to hide his phone around me. In fact, it’s often unlocked on the text messages screen and in the first view of messages, I never see anyone I don’t know.

Well, a few weeks ago, he asked me to check something on his laptop and I’m trying to do so, I noticed his iMessages was open and so many numbers I had never seen were on there. I quickly scrolled (I know this was wrong plz don’t waste your breath lecturing me about privacy, I feel guilty about it as is) and I saw a few recent threads with very flirtatious tones. One where a girl told him “I’d love to show you the vegan spots in town” and him saying “stop talking dirty to me with eye heart emojis” and one where he called some girl “sexy”. I scrolled fast so it was kind of a blur but as much as I want to make excuses / convince myself I may have misread things, I saw what I saw. And the dates were recent.

I kept it together but have since cried my eyes out numerous times. To make matters crazier, his mom recently went to the ICU for an injury and might be paralyzed so he’s been under a lot of stress and I’ve been in his corner supporting him through that which he says means so much to him. I want to confront the issue but Idk how, or if it’s fair while he’s going through this. But I can’t get the feeling out of my head that he’s seeing other people. Yesterday he asked if we could FaceTime early b/c he was getting dinner with his uncle wnd when I asked how it went this morning, his explanation was really short and generic as if he wasn’t expecting that I’d ask. He had messaged me around the dinner time but after my last response didn’t get back to me till this morning.

I don’t know how to move forward. My gut, and what I saw, makes me feel like somethings up. But I know he loves me as stupid as it sounds to say it. We get along very well, never fight, can talk for hours, and just feels like the most special love I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime.

Another curve ball is that he does have bipolar disorder but he’s being treated. He gets depressed / down on himself from time to time and his manic episodes seem mild and he talks very openly about his condition but I can’t help but wonder if that makes him more prone to infidelity from things I’ve heard others say… What do you suggest?

I rarely find anyone physically attractive without knowing their personality. My previous relationships were with friends.

Anyway before I knew I might be demisexual, I matched with a guy from an online dating app. We have such similar interests, which is rare and we also go to the same university, which is convenient. My types are nerds and often they don't take care of themselves etc. but this guy is kind and takes care of himself and has friends etc.   

Unfortunately, I am not attracted to him despite 3 dates (he's physically not unattractive). I have kept him at such an arm's length as well that it is probably difficult to form an attraction anyway. At this point I feel like I'm leading him on and maybe leading myself on. I feel like I'm investing time meeting him just because I know technically we should be a match but I don't feel any chemistry. Furthermore, when I don't have a crush I am much more talkative, open and flirty. But I feel like our conversations are becoming a bit stilted. Pandemic means the only dates we have are just chatting in a park.

Also he's never had a girlfriend before so it seems like he doesn't know how to flirt and is a bit shy.

So I'm 20, I've never dated and never had a relationship. The reason for this is because I've never even tried to because I just am not interested in dating, and don't really want a relationship.

I don't want a relationship for a few reasons. One is that I don't think I'd be a good partner, two is that I have some really strange standards that are surprisingly common turnoffs (never want children, never want to marry, don't want to have someone cook for me), and three is that relationships seem to be quite expensive and time-consuming (people joke about not having any savings because they spend all on their spouse). 

Looking at how people view others who don't want romantic relationships shows mixed responses. Some people say don't worry about relationships if you don't want them, but others say that you'll end up wanting one when you're older, sort of implying that you should be dating people even if you don't really want to. It's confusing.

Doesn't really help that I get crushes on people too. I hate having crushes because it makes me question my view and makes me really resent my brain for forming crushes. I also hate my sex drive for how useless it is and the fact that no one will tell me how to get rid of it, it's so annoying.

I guess what I'm asking is, should I date even if I don't want to? How do I handle crushes? What happens when I'm older and for some stupid reason change my mind on relationships? I don't understand anything.

Now, she has started snapping me again and I have not been as prominent but have tried to start conversations and sendt funny snaps again, she then post on mystory(she has a smaaaaallll vlog, not regularly): Is a ""Pick me boy"" who keeps snapping me, its so cringe, you're probably tired of me, I would be, mf we don't even speak.

I'm pretty sure she talks about me. If she thinks I'm cringe, why does she keeps snapping me all the time and just don't block me or stop sending photo's. I don't play games and I'm direct about wanting to meet/how I feel.

And yes, she seems like a C-word, but I don't have a lot of options and she is really Pretty. I'm personally really bad at small talking over snap that I don't judge people on snap, I rather love meeting up or have phone conversations before I judge.

I told her I was stupid for trying to lie to her because I shouldn’t lie to her if I’m dating her because I shouldn’t have anything to hide. Now she is very annoyed and pissed I lied to her and does not want to talk to me which I understand and totally deserve it for lying.  Now I feel like I have stressed her out more because she is also studying for her boards exam she has next week.

My dilemma is that I see her a lot and want to talk to her and build a rapport then ask her out. Problem is I have no idea how to do that. On top of that I have no friends to turn to for advice. 

I’ve probably only spoken with her once and it wasn’t an actual conversation. So please I’d love advice on how to start talking to her and how to build a rapport and eventually ask her out.

Well this story will put you on a turn wheel of confusion and truth

Let me tell you a story about the one that I meet years ago during my younger years. It's been about 8 years ago, yes more or tell. I was only a young gentleman at the time with the age of 19.

I meet her on a porch she was lying on me after a few stories she told. She then mentioned she never kissed a stranger before. Me being young man at the time as she was the same age.

 We looked at each other for what should have been less than 30 minutes or so. However when her lips meet mine it felt like eternity.

I thought this would be a long decent relationship with a good amount of hope and honesty behind it.

However the story only grows dark and truth breaks through.

Less than 5 weeks or so during the relationship she decided to break up with me. I simply asked why as anyone would. She never really said a proper answer and I was left in quandary. 

I asked around until a answer broke through. A different person I knew about has broken into her whispering eye. 

I was furious as she decided to blame me for the break up. I simply told her that she was full of it and ended the relationship completely.

Had a Bumble meetup with a white American woman 10 years older than me (I am in my late 20's). We are both fully vaxxed. Although I am Roman Catholic, she was looking for someone more Christian (I do not go to Church regularly). But she thought I was cool so she wanted to be friends. I am at a point in my life where I am cool with that. I needed more female friends anyways. 

I invited her to lunch near her. A 25 minute drive from my house to make it convenient for her. Asian food. We ate, had a good chat, and enjoyed ourselves. Despite being strongly Christian, she has mad progressive stances on a lot of topics.

And then....we get the check.

I immediately ask for us to pay seperate w/o consulting her (not half/half b/c I ordered a drink &amp; she did not). She immediately says she is cool with that as if she was forcing a sentence to get a voice in a fast paced conversation w/ two other people. Or maybe to say it was her idea too. 

But.... on the way out we didn't hug or anything. Sign of the times. I almost think I saw a look of disappointment on her face. Maybe its because I drive a Tesla or something. But most likely it could've had to do with the check.

**When you meet a woman for the first time off a dating app &amp; its clear she just wants friendship, but you invite her to lunch, do you pay or split the bill?**

I don't pay for any of my friends (mostly guys). 

\-------------------------

My only reference experience to this is when I worked at Microsoft two years out of college. A Mexican national classmate worked there so I reached out. We ate at a higher end restaurant on campus. I told her I did real estate on the side. Maybe she thought I was trying to sell her. I wasn't She talked about how Trump made the immigration situation difficult for her to want to invest. Other convo...bill comes and she is like - nope not budging with her body language. I paid for it confused. Maybe this was Mexican culture? She has a husband. I knew that back in college. Maybe she felt entitled b/c she thought I was trying to sell her. I didn't like it. It felt presumptous of her b/c A. I was not selling her B. I was just trying to connect &amp; C. I never asked her for anything or talked to her again. 

\------------------------------

But I digress. Back to this Bumble meetup: 

Paying for her would've been too presumptuous &amp; given the tone that low key thinks its a date. Maybe even sexist if she is a strong feminist. A power move for sure. But to some women it can be interpreted as ""You don't think I can pay for myself, huh?!""

Maybe I should've offered and said, ""Do you mind if I pay the bill?"" But then again we are just friends. Why pay?

Before I start I just wanted to let everyone know my boyfriend does have strong anger and does tend to say what’s on his mind even if it hurts others.


Today we were in the park enjoying the sunset and I wore a tank top and shorts. He felt my stomach and he asked why there was a bone there and so I showed him and my stomach was flat.

I’m around 5’7, 28” waist and around 108 pounds.

He started off by saying in the last six months he’s seen me get significantly skinnier; he was concerned. I asked him why he didn’t tell me earlier and he said it was because he heard that guys aren’t supposed to comment on their girlfriends weight.

He told me that his sister was four years younger than he was the same weight as me and that it was unhealthy but in a tone i can’t unhear.

He then said this 


“Idk man I’m keeping my mouth shut take it up with your doctor not me”


At this point I was ready for tears start flowing down my face like a river. I know that I am skinny and I know that no matter what I eat I will always stay skinny. I have no eating problems, I eat steaks burgers  healthy food , smoothies many things a day.

I eat three meals a day plus snacks , and I digest within an hour ready for my next meal.
But I GAIN NOTHING. 

He knows that I have a FAST ACTIVE METABOLISM like my mother (who was the same at my age) but thought I stopped eating etc.


The whole conversation was awkward I felt so out of place and I felt that no matter what I eat I will not gain any weight anymore. I’m not looking to be muscular but I’m not looking to be skin and bones either. 

I don’t know what to do when I feel like the way he said it in person during this date was very unnecessary and rude. Does anyone have any help? It’s just the tone that he said all of this and was rude aggressive almost like it was body shaming.
