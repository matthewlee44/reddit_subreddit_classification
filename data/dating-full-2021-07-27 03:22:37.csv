For the first part of me knowing her she already had a BF but would never mention him. Got a little weird when she would tell me shes going on vacation with friends when actually she went with him and so on. Then I finally found out from her and met him at an event. In the past 5 months or so things kind of changed a little. She suddenly added me all over social media and we started texting a lot more often and messaging more often (usually banter or light flirting) (went from 0 interaction outside of work to every week). 

At work it's usually very fun. We flirt with her. A lot of these interactions are started by her. She playfully calls me names or teases me. Sometimes she gets pretty touchy where she holds my hand or grabs my arm. 

One thing I noticed is that she gets pretty territorial or jealous when I interact with other girls who are single.  For example, if i start talking with one of them she will swoop in and interrupt or stand super close to us and listen. Once i was chatting and flirting with another girl and she sat beside us and was staring at a blank computer screen (lol). Another time I was hanging out with another girl coworker outiside of work and posted her on my snap story and she kept asking me where we met and what we did and so on.  Also if someone says ""this girl is good for him"" about any other girl she always says ""no way"" or gets upset.

Why can't you be that instead? I'll let you take charge, you can wear the pants in the relationship because I'd rather be wearing shorts.  


I'll never understand this. Sure, nobody likes or admires people that let others walk over them or people that have no personal dignity or anything like that. But the 'confidence'(tm) advice that people dish out is often confused and conflated with arrogance and at the end of the day the underlying message for men continues to be ""be assertive, outgoing and charismatic"" etc, it's just buying into the same old status-quo and nothing changes or grows for the better.  


Why are men still specifically required to be confident, outgoing, assertive? It's buying into some weird caveman logic that only the strong survive, the strong are the ones who get to have partners, have kids etc It's absolutely weird.  


As a guy, I resent the expectations and standards that between the two of us I'm supposed to the more dominant, assertive and outgoing, I'm supposed to be a leader and not a follower. But you know what? I don't care for that at all, when I think about what I want in a partner, confidence doesn't even come up on my radar, I give zero shits about it. I know my worth and I'm not a doormat but I also struggle with vulnerability, insecurities, flaws because I'm a human being. Men are told daily that we can't have any of those or that they must be dealt with privately, out of sight and out of mind.  


I know my worth, I'm not going to be with someone that treats me like shit, that's confidence right? Nope, that's not enough for most of you, when you say confidence it means arrogance and conformity to socially-acceptable standards on how men should act or how they're supposed to act as opposed to accepting that men are not monolithic beings either and we all have our problems too.  


I'm frankly just fed up with the idea that I'm required to be confident. I'm not confident, I'm only human like everyone else, please stop equally putting men on pedestals as paragons of mental and emotional discipline that have mastered the ways of traditional masculinity while also adhering to modern standards of showing some emotion as opposed to none, but not too much because apparently that's still weird or creepy when men cry about anything outside of a relatives funeral",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,921242,public,self,Why is confidence and assertiveness such an apparent requirement for men in relationships?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osf3yp/why_is_confidence_and_assertiveness_such_an/,all_ads,6,,,,

We’ve gone on three dates (the first two she asked me on) and it always ends up at my place. She will spend the night and we make out almost all night. She will be in her bra and panties. I try to lead it to sex but she says she just didn’t wanna do that yet. Which is actually cool with me because I think she is more conservative than most girls. I told her “well I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wanna have sex with you, because I’m a red blooded guy and you’re a intoxicating girl, but I really respect that and I’m probably still gonna get a little handsy but I respect your mindset and appreciate that about you” she laughed and kissed me. During the dates it’s always effortless. We just click. Between dates I don’t text her unless it’s to set up the next date. The first time we met we drove around and I took her home and kissed her right before I dropped her off at the door and she told me to come with her to this event 2 days away. (I usually don’t ask for a next date during the date we are on now to not seem needy but since she asked I agreed) we snapchated a little bit but I tried to keep the contact low over the phone so as not to talk her out of me. The next date was another effortless fun date that ended up in my bed for a make out session. She went home the next day and said she would be at a lake for a week. So I didn’t text her or Snapchat her at all until I knew she was bk in town. That Sunday when she got back in town I texted her asking when she was available to meet up. We set something up for Thursday. I again did not reach out to her between the days and just 2 hours before I was supposed to pick her up she texted me “Are we still on tonight?” I replied “of course! I’ll pick you up at 8:00 like we agreed” and we had yet another effortlessly fun date that ended up with a make out session in my bed all night. (I would gently go as far as she would let me go then back off if she would say something) we had pillow talk about what our love languages where and what qualities we appreciated in each other. She ask my body count and I just played it cool “I don’t kiss and tell and I only hook up with girls that I actually see it going somewhere” she was talking about having me come over sometime to see her animals and then talked about how we should build some dog collars together. So I took that as a hint that she wanted to see me again. So the next morning when I took her home I asked her to go out again in a couple of days.( I usually don’t ask for a date at the end of a date but I thought she was hinting at it ) She agreed. Saturday comes and 5 hours before we were supposed to meet she texted” Hey something came up I’m gonna have to take a rain check on tonight”. I admit I was scared and wondering wtf happened but played it cool and an hour later I texted her “No worries, thanks forletting me know.” Hoping that her next text would be her trying to pick a day to re-schedule. 5 hours later she texted back “Ya for sure” so I texted her (fearful I sounded needy :/  ) “what evening would be better for you?” She never texted back that whole night but the next day at around noon she texted me “Tuesday?” I said “sounds good” and she texted back “okay sounds good”. Now I need advice on how to go about this date. I think she went out with her friends and they probably met up with some guys (which is cool she’s not my gf) but I don’t think it was a emergency cancellation. I went out as well that night to try and keep going with my life. So since she was the one who cancelled I don’t wanna be a pushover and act like it’s no problem that she broke the plans with me. I wanna keep it playful when she comes back out to my house on this next scheduled date and say things like, “oh I don’t know how you’re gonna make it up to me” or “hmmm funny how you had to cancel our date on National Tequila day, what a unfortunate coincidence” but say it playful and just kinda bust her balls so she knows that I’m not gonna be a pushover and she’s gonna have to play harder if she wants me. Anytime we go out I feel like I do a good job and it always ends well. It’s the inbetween the dates that I struggle with. If we do text or Snapchat she takes forever to respond so that’s why early on I just kept it at a minimum with phone contact. How should I go about this? I’m prepared to move on if she cancels this date but I really like this girl. I feel like I have made no penalties to disqualify me from her list and I wanna keep doing things right so over a few weeks she will want a relationship.

So - me, M37 (no kids, no ex-wives, looking for the perfect partner, but prepped to die alone) met someone I liked. F31 (single, no kids, no ex husbands, etc.) She is currently in therapy due to trauma from her last relationship, that ended in March of 2020.

When we met, I suggested we do a FWB situation (this was after a few dates of getting to know her - I thought she was great, but I wasn't expecting anything serious from her...and told her that was my capacity) She declined, we bargained and I suggested we see how things go from ""day-to-day""

So...she's not one for casual hook ups - she has only had long - term relationships, and explained that. She said this was something new for her, the above casual dating but not quite yet a relationship. I'm not seeing anyone else, and she deleted her app after about a month of seeing each other - she said she can only see one person at a time, and since we started sleeping together she felt like she would be wasting everyone elses time on the app, plus she made it clear she wanted a future with me.

Fast foward 3 months - she freaks out on me for a few things:

1. She said I don't spend enough time with her (we see each other 2x a month, and I don't plan; it's last minute)
2. She hates the last minute spur of the moment (I call her Saturday evening...to hang out Saturday evening...) she said after three months, I should have an idea of what I want
3. I text her here and there (almost every day, but I hate texting) she said she wants phone calls here and there on top of the texting, especially on weekends where we don't see each other
4. Last weekend, I didn't answer her text from Friday night; she called me Saturday and I forgot to respond so I texted her that I couldn't see her Saturday and to have a great day
5. To the above, she cried about it to me on Sunday and said that it triggered her issues; that her ex did the same thing and he was cheating on her. She said that she had been trying to connect with me and I'm just rejecting her - she went as far as to question me if I'm seeing other people (i'm not) but she assumed I was because I don't spend every weekend with her. I didn't tell her what I was doing because it didn't cross my mind to inform her I simply texted her ""can't see you today. Sorry. "" and that set her off.
6. So now we are not on speaking terms, although she apologized to me for ignoring me a few days after the fight. Now, I'm not speaking with her because the way she behaved triggered me. She freaked out about something she had no idea about, then cut me off via text telling me this wasn't working. 

Not sure what to do at this point - she is kind, good, super smart, doesn't have any issues, although she is a bit moody and can be self-centered at times and a bit demanding of my time.

I've been single for about a a year and a half, in that time I have been on maybe 20 first dates and dated 5-6 girls casually, given up a few times and just had casual sex, tried again etc. etc.

Whenever people complain to me about the quality/type of men/women in their area I usually think to myself that it's basically an excuse for being picky or not trying hard enough, that there is enough variety in human beings that no matter where you are, you should be able to find what you're looking for.

I have to admit I am starting to think that might not be the case actually. I know you will all be super quick to call my pretentious but over this year and a half I've found that I really don't share much in common with the women in the country I am living in right now (not the country I was born in btw). Drinking is a big deal over here, and don't get me wrong I love a good drink but I wouldn't consider it a hobby, whereas here it is more or less the centre of people's social lives; a weekend not spent drinking is a weekend wasted for a lot of people here.

Also I have essentially not met anyone with interests in things like art, cinema (as opposed to just watching the main blockbuster movies), different cultures, history etc. It's a country that is a bit isolated and even though it's very diverse there just seems to be a general disinterest in the rest of the world, whereas for me that is basically my main interest and drive in life.

For sure there are exceptions to this, but what I mean is, I feel like my options are so limited when I select for these shared interests.

I recently switched my Tinder account to France where I have family and was basically stunned after an hour or two of swiping; beautiful women with really deep unique interests. I matched with quite a few and straight away they were engaging in the kinds of conversations I really struggle to find where I am.

I have been mulling over the idea of moving to France for a while, it would be a big upheaval but I am starting to think that if I am serious about finding someone to settle down with that really vibes with me, maybe I will actually consider moving there for someone.. I mea I'd first go and spend a few weeks living there and do the usual dating thing, but seriously consider moving if I met the right girl.

She's really sweet, and I honestly never would have guessed she would tell me this, but yesterday, she told me she was once in a relationship with an older man who was married, and her boss. We were talking about something else when she told me about this, and as she was telling me, I kinda said... ""Hey... hey... okay... maybe I don't want to know all this. Ya know??"" She seemed embarrassed, because I don't think it had occurred to her just how TMI she was letting rip until I stopped her. We kind of talked for a few minutes about it. Long enough for me to say that I don't think it's good to talk about past bfs/gfs. I don't think she'd like it for me to talk about my old gfs or ex-wife... and I certainly don't need to hear about her past business. She agreed and apologized. 

Now... of course... it's kind of eating at me. To be perfectly honest, I don't really care at all about hearing about some other guy. It's not a jealousy thing. It's not that I don't like the mental image of thinking of her with some other dude. It's... that he was married... and she obviously knew it. And... he was older. And... he was her boss and a prominent business man back in the city where she used to live. I don't know who he is... no names... no details... all I know is what I've said here. And then I cut her off. 

My instant reaction was that it's no big deal. I didn't flip or anything like that. I just... put the kibosh on the talking about it... and we moved on. But then... last in the evening, after I was home alone... it started to creep in... ""He was married.... and she KNEW he was married. Hmmm... That f\*\*\*\*\*g sucks!""   Thing is... about 6 years ago... I fell insanely in love with my ex-gf. She was also married at the time. And I totally knew. I used to even go over to her house when her husband was out of town. So... I guess I really don't know what to think about it all. I do NOT think of myself as a ""cheater"" type of guy. I have always been a super rock solid kind of person who would NEVER cheat on anyone. But... I think my impression of myself is obviously not in perfect alignment with how I did in fact behave. Of course there were tons of things like... she told me the whole time that she was unhappy, and planning to leave him. etc etc. So for the longest time I would tell myself that I'd done nothing wrong. She did in fact divorce him several months into our relationship. So... I never allowed myself to feel like I'd done something wrong. 

But now I find myself wanting to steer clear of this girl I've been dating... because I don't feel like I can trust someone who would have a relationship with someone who they knew was married.

She replied: ""I'd kick his ass and send him to a gym and make him lose that weight"". 

I hate how people say that Attractive Women have shit a personality but almost won't realise there are some Unattractive Women who have put up a façade on their faces of being a nice person to get a Boyfriend.

It's alright for a Fat Girl to demand a Decent Boyfriend, but what she said about being so angry on her boyfriend, when it's the other way around is really illogical. 

Then what's the difference between, (this girl who said this and an attractive girl who has a shit personality?)

And some other girl in my college was talking to her friend on how she could've fucking ignored and rejected so many guys had she been Attractive and Hot, and she's saying how she's forcing herself to be a nice person.

Dear Unattractive Women, I have read a lot of answers on Quora and read a lot of posts on Reddit, on how Unattractive Women aren't asked out or made a move on them. But in reality is that even Guys want to be with a Woman whom he finds attractive it's not that he's supposed to date/love or marry a Woman just because of her personality and not her looks.

Looks and Personality go hand-in-hand, these examples that I gave are just tending to have a good personality because if they don't, then they won't even get a date.

We see each other maybe twice a week and it usually ends in a sleepover, where we will have sex. The sex is surprisingly good - I was nervous before the first time because I wasn’t 100% sure how sexually attracted to him I was (he’s not my usual type!) - but he’s super attentive and always gets me off. 

My only criticism is that I’d like more sex, and perhaps a little more variety. We only ever have sex when we’re already in bed if that makes sense - usually in the morning after waking up but sometimes before sleep. In my previous relationships I’ve had that “I need you right here right now” thing going on, which I’m not sure exists between us. There’s certainly still nerves from my part, sometimes I find myself having to psych myself up to put my hand on his thigh or go in for a kiss!

Any words of advice, Reddit? I don’t want to like jump him in the kitchen because I have no idea how he’d respond and I don’t want to scare him off!

I met this guy from social media and decided to meet him irl. So i was really excited that day , he told me we can have a lunch date after my work. So fast forward the day came , i dress up nicely and put on a little makeup to make sure ill look great.
I messaged him sayin *hi im here good morning* its 11am that time. I didn't received a response , so i waited cause maybe i am just early. And i waited for 3 hours more and decided to go home. After few hours he messaged me and said * Im sorry i did not wake up on time , i had a drink last night maybe we can reschedule*, i said no and didn't dated for a while after that.

Last Saturday July 24,2020 i give it another chance.
With my eyes very hopeful and my heart once again excited. Same drill i met this guy online and decided to meet him because he wants to meet badly. This time he's the one that wants to meet and he planned the activity all day. So we're gonna have breakfast after my shift then we will go to his place to play ps4 * we're both gamers*, then ill go with him to do groceries and will cook pasta for him by lunch. After that he said we can take a nap after lunch cause we're both tired and have a dinner then he will take me home.(sounds like a very good plan right)

I talked to him all night before the date because he can't sleep because he's so excited. Im already feeling that this will not go well. He slept 3:30 am and we're gonna meet 7am * i work at night*.
So my work is done 5am , i get ready this time i made sure i look great , smell great and look at my best.  Its raining that morning *heavy rain* and there's an new covid variant in the area *delta*. 
I went to the bus station and travelled for 2 hours and its around 7 am he's still not online , i am praying in the bus * god please not another trauma , please make this one came even if he's late*.
I arrived at the location very hungry , good thing mcdonald's was open so i ate while waiting. 
Waited for 3 hours and same as before no one showed up, its been the 3rd day now and i got no response or apologies. Wow how can someone be so bad like that.

So nearly 6 months ago I matched with this guy on tinder and we had an instant connection (to both our surprises). It was incredibly easy to talk to him and he seemed very sweet and kind (which he definitely is). I think it's also important to mention that we're both fairly young and inexperienced.

We've known each other for a long time now (for tinder at least) and he has shown consistent interest in me. A few examples: we text a lot (nearly everyday); he's always there for me when I feel bad and always tries to help me/give advice; he has called me things like cute and attractive more than I could count. In short: he has made it clear to me that he likes me and enjoys talking to me. 

We have met before...only 2 times and that was after about a months of talking. It is obvious that we're both kind of awkward/shy but our ""dates"" were still really nice. Like for our second one he drove from his smaller city (which is around 30 minutes away from the big city I live in) to my apartment, to pick me up in the early morning hours so we could watch the sunset together. Which was incredible sweet to me.

Now he just doesn't want to meet up and is content with just texting. I have talked to him about how I would want to spend some time with him because I do like him and I asked why he didn't want to. His response was always that he isn't in the right headspace because he has a lot of stress and other things that plague him. To clarify we are both university students so we obviously have a lot of stuff to do most of the time so I understand that. And I know that he has a horribly toxic family member who he has to live with unfortunately and I suspect that that fucks him up more than he is willing to admit.
So I do want to understand him and be supportive but maybe I'm just to selfish. Because I know that we're both on summer break right now and he constantly tells me that he has nothing really going on in his live and that he doesn't go out much. It does hurt knowing that he could spend time with me if he wanted to but he actively chooses not to.

I have told him how I feel and he basically told me that he's not forcing me to text with him if I don't want to and that I should do what's best for me. So I know that it's my fault for still talking to him and being hopeful but I just really like him and the fact that he's still a very sweet guy who is always there for me (even if it's only over text) makes it so difficult for me to get over him.

One day you might have the most amazing relationship in the world, and then next you might feel like your man is little more than a stranger.

Sound familiar?

Many women (and men) in relationships with men find themselves dealing with problems like this at least once in most relationships, where the man suddenly withdraws emotionally and pulls back.

So why exactly do men pull away? What is it about them or you that causes them to pull away? Is it because he’s emotionally unavailable?

The answers may be different than you think.

Keep reading to learn why the person you like might be pulling away from you and what you can do about it.

What does it mean when someone pulls away?

Pulling away from someone comes in a few different forms. 

For some, it may feel like a bit of distancing. Maybe you’ve been in a relationship with the person for a while and they seem “distant.” They’re short with you, every time you’re together it seems strange, and so on.

For others, the man may pull away during the initial stages of a relationship. This is usually when you get ghosted. That means they stop interacting with you completely.

No texts, snaps, DMs, or anything else. All of a sudden, they disappear. You may reach out to them a few times, and each time, there’s no response.

The person pulling away is putting in effort to distance themselves from you.

3 reasons men pull away

When a guy pulls away, he may stop responding as quickly, fail to follow through on plans, or just not talk to you at all.

Whatever the reason is, you’re probably left wondering what’s going on. Are they busy? 

Pulling away can happen for a number of reasons. One day you think everything is great, and the next, you’re lost.

Maybe you’re overreacting to it, or maybe they really are just trying to get away from you.

But the real question is…Why do they do it? Here are 3 common reasons why a man may be pulling away from you.

1. His feelings scare him or make him uncomfortable

**How you feel about it:** This is the best relationship you’ve ever had in your life. You’re feeling levels of love and companionship that you’ve never experienced before, and you love every minute of it.

Sure, it might not always be the best – there are fights and arguments like in all relationships – but you just know that you’ve finally found “the real thing” and you want to do everything you can to hold onto it.

**How he feels about it:** He might be feeling the exact same thing: this is the best relationship he’s ever had in his life, and for the first time ever he’s finally found a partner who is willing to give him the unconditional love that he knows he deserves.

But though he is in love, he is pulling away because he’s afraid. These new feelings are essentially that – new, and he doesn’t know how to deal with them.

Most men need the feeling that they’re in control, minimizing the amount of surprise or unknown factors in their life.

The further your relationship grows and evolves into uncharted territory, the more terrifying the feelings attached to it become.

So he tries to ease away because even if he loves you as much as you love him, the reality of that love isn’t something he is sure he wants to handle.

He needs time to understand what this is and whether he’s really ready for these changes and this commitment.

**How to fix it or help him**\*\*:\*\* Ask him what’s going on and give him the time to adjust. If he needs to take it slow, then decide if you are willing to wait for him to adjust and get used to this new chapter in his life.

Hold his hand through the process and show him you aren’t going to leave or abandon him, or that the “good vibes” aren’t just a temporary thing.

Guide him into being the type of partner he knows he wants to be but is afraid to try being, because he’s never done it before.

2. You make him feel unessential

**How you feel about it:** As a woman, you’ve been taught that guys need to work for it. You’re emotionally invested in this man but you’re worried that being too open about your feelings will cause him to take you for granted.

**How he feels about it:** You’ve done too much of a good job pretending you don’t like this guy to the point that he actually believes it.

He’s pulling away because he’s convinced you’re simply uninterested in him, and that all further efforts will be stonewalled.

For a man, feeling essential to a woman is often what separates “like” from “love”. And feeling unessential is a common trigger for pulling away.

Don’t get me wrong, no doubt your guy loves your strength and abilities to be independent. But he still wants to feel wanted and useful — not dispensable!

This is because men have a built in desire for something “greater” that goes beyond love or sex. It’s why men who seemingly have the “perfect girlfriend” are still unhappy and find themselves constantly searching for something else — or worst of all, someone else.

Simply put, men have a biological drive to feel needed, to feel important, and to provide for the woman he cares about.

Relationship psychologist James Bauer calls it the hero instinct.

As James argues, male desires are not complicated, just misunderstood. Instincts are powerful drivers of human behavior and this is especially true for how men approach their relationships.

So, when the hero instinct isn’t triggered, men are unlikely to commit to a relationship with any woman. He holds back because being in a relationship is a serious investment for him. And he won’t fully “invest” in you unless you give him a sense of meaning and purpose and make him feel essential.

**How to fix it or help him**\*\*:\*\* How do you trigger this instinct in him? How do you give him a sense of meaning and purpose?

You don’t need to pretend to be anyone you’re not or play the “damsel in distress”. You don’t have to dilute your strength or independence in any way, shape or form.

In an authentic way, you simply have to show your man what you need and allow him to step up to fulfill it.

In his new video, James Bauer outlines several things you can do. He reveals phrases, texts and little requests that you can use right now to make him feel more essential to you.

By triggering this very natural male instinct, you’ll not only give him greater satisfaction but it will also help to rocket your relationship to the next level.

3. He’s prioritizing his identity

**How you feel about it:** You’re constantly doing things together and you’re excited about sharing your interests with him.

You invited him to activities you used to do before he came into your life, and even tried to find new things to do together as a couple.

You also invite yourself to things that are close to him because you want him to know that you support his hobbies and are open to new experiences.

As his girlfriend, you attend games and even spend nights with his guy friends, basically making your presence felt in creating an open, supportive relationship.

**How he feels about it:** It’s not that he doesn’t like spending time with you, it’s just that your boyfriend might be feeling like he’s losing a part of himself in the relationship.

Males are primarily territorial and they will guard their mental and physical spaces with their lives.

Think of it from his point of view, before you came into his life, he had a schedule that he stuck with.

He had hobbies he did and enjoyed on his own, and friends to catch up and hang out with. If he’s pulling away, it’s because he’s worried that he’ll lose what makes him him.

Pulling away to preserve his identity isn’t about not liking what you’re bringing into his life.

He just values who he is as a person and wants to set up healthy boundaries moving forward into the relationship.

**How to fix it or help him**\*\*:\*\* Give him the space to invite you. If your partner is an introvert, there’s a high chance he simply prefers to enjoy things in solitude so don’t take it personally.

Otherwise, take comfort in knowing that he’s just adjusting to having you in his life, and having someone to share his life to.

You can reassure him that spending more time together or engaging in new activities isn’t going to change who you are.

He needs to know that his partner not only respects who he is, but that you also have a strong sense of self and are mindful in preserving your identities in the relationship. 

Also, try and determine if the withdrawal is temporary or permanent.

Is it a reaction to something you did or a slow burn culminating into something more serious? Some guys only withdraw temporarily to recharge themselves.

If you see that he just pulls away as a way of staying in touch with himself, then there’s no reason to worry.

I am just simply a person who is concern about the future implications regarding this and wants to start a discussion.

I saw a study by the Washington post stating that young male virginity is on the rise from 1989 to 2018 with a **sharp** increase starting from 2008.  This to me is very concerning about future of western/developed societies. 

Usually on average most men work hard to provide for their families but if male virginity is increasing this implies that less men are having romantic relationships and therefore less familes. If less men are having families , what reason is there for those men to work hard?

An example of this is Japan herbivore men which are men in Japan who have basically given up on marriage and love entirely either because they cannot afford it and/or don't want to work to death raising a family. Instead they have **mainly** indulge in anime, gaming and internet to keep them occupied.

This is just one example but if male virginity keeps on **sharply** increasing I fear that less males will work as hard as older generation of men. Men  will only need to work hard enough for one person (themselves) to survive which is much less harder than if they had a family to feed. 

This makes me think of well paid, hard and taxing jobs **in the future** like for example construction if more and more men check out of these jobs  since they do not need to make as much compared to if they had a family, who will keep society infrastructure strong and well maintained? 

The only men I can think of that will work hard are those who crave money and desire to be rich and I do not think that is the majority of men.

Most men are okay with living a simple life and do not need a lavioush or luxury lifestyle, to be satisfied, think of Japan's herbivore men. Sure they may wish they had a family they can love and care for but the way male virginity is trending that seems unlikely.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,921883,public,self,"As male virginity increases, what are the impacts this will have to the future of society.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osmthg/as_male_virginity_increases_what_are_the_impacts/,all_ads,6,,,,

I honestly think that’s why so many relationships fail and I don’t even think I’m saying anything groundbreaking. Some people date and get into relationships without actually caring or genuinely liking the people they’re with. I’ve dated/ been in relationships with guys who claimed to like me but it turned out they actually only cared about sex or they were just lonely. They did not make an effort to know me on a deeper level. Please stop doing this. So many people date for the wrong reasons : ego boost, loneliness, sex or just for the sake of being in a relationship, so many people don’t form connections. It’s fine if you’re only looking for sex and the other person also is, that way there is no confusion. But why tf do people who are not looking for serious relationships pursue people who want the complete opposite ? I hear so many stories of friends being in relationships and their partner breaking up after months or worst years because « oh I just realized I actually don’t really like you » how do you not realize you don’t like the person you’re seeing ? I’m genuinely asking because I feel like people just lie to themselves in these situations. Stop forcing relationships ! just because you think that person is nice it doesn’t mean you have to date them, if you guys don’t click it’s okay, just move on. It’s better than engaging in dates/relationships where you’re not putting 100% bc deep down you don’t genuinely like the person you’re just lonely or horny.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,921897,public,self,Stop dating/ getting in relationships with people you don’t actually like or care about.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osmzwh/stop_dating_getting_in_relationships_with_people/,all_ads,6,,,,

He would go on and on about how much he liked me, text me two, three times a day just to ask me how it's going, talk about how he was only looking for a serious relationship, introduced me to all his friends.  After the third date (and having sex) I found out he was dating someone else just as seriously as me.  (He also seemed like he wanted me to be mad about it, arguing that if I was doing the same things he would be upset and jealous.)  I was not okay with this but decided to move forward with the relationship thinking that I could get around it and try my best.  We had a discussion about it and I told him there would be a point were he needed to choose and he seemed okay with that.  

Now, this isn't a post about how one person has severely messed up my ability to date or that he is entirely a garbage human being because there were a lot of parts of him that I liked, and still do like, which just makes things harder.  I have had many dating experiences that have corroded my ability to trust other people in a romantic setting.  I can be intense when I have decided on someone, and my anxiety disorder does not lend well to that. I have always felt pressure to be a happy-go-lucky person when it comes to dating men because they don't want to see the bad stuff and if they do they see it as a red flag and immediately discount you.  So I tend not to admit what I'm thinking besides the good things and I made the mistake of trusting too early on this one.

Last night, we had sex and he was very distant afterwards, wouldn't touch me which is a big deal because aftercare is an incredibly important part of the sex I like.  Because I am incredibly blunt person (again not my best quality) I asked him whether he liked me or did he just like having sex with me and he said he did not know. which was not what I thought he was going to say.  Keeping in mind he spent the last month telling me how much he liked me and the six hours previous of us hanging out together making plans for the future, holding hands, cuddling, etc.   He said that if I had asked him last week (before me having the honest conversation about dating other people) it would have been a different answer.  

I don't think I've felt like that in a long while, my entire body went cold and I immediately started having a panic attack.  I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he explained why he couldn't commit to me as a person and that he didn't want to see me anymore because I couldn't physically leave, my legs and arms were complete rocks and I think in my head I wanted him to take it back.  Then I drove 45 minutes home back to my apartment alone because the idea of staying overnight there made me go into a deeper panic attack.

I think this incident might be the last straw for me for a while.  I don't think I'm ready to date in the way that so many people my age do, where there is always someone else you have to compete with for the persons attention.  I just want someone to choose just me (is that selfish? I don't know).  I don't expect complete commitment so early but there is so much dishonesty in acting like you're in a relationship with someone while still actively seeing other people.

Walking up to someone you may find attractive in a coffee shop, bar, or supermarket seems to be few and far between these days. The increase in fear of rejection supersedes the potential of even approaching someone (usually). 

As someone who’s dated a LOT, I’m talking having gone on over 100 dates in the 3 years I’ve been single- my inner hopeless romantic always hoped I’d *still* meet someone the traditional way; in a normal, non-virtual setting. It’s hard remain optimistic, to not get discouraged with all of the flops that come with the territory of dating.


For the last year, a man has been living in my apartment building, who also parked his car on the same side as me. Naturally he always piqued my interest, but we never exchanged more than a “hey” or the standard “how are you”. I would see him all the time. I’m talking multiple times a day sometimes. My growing curiosity made me hope I would run into him every time I walked into the lobby, got into my car, or was outside our building. 

About a month and a half ago, there he was on a Sunday morning. He saw me sitting outside, getting ready to walk back in, and waited in the lobby for me to say something. He told me he was moving out that day, we chatted about what we both do, where we’re from, etc., And then he finally asked for my number. 


Last week, I got back from visiting family in New York; incidentally he was there the same time as me. One of the nights I managed to catch a break from my family and met up with him in the city. We stayed the night in a hotel room, had an amazing dinner in Meatpacking District, and he introduced me to one of his oldest friends.  Everything planned and arranged by him. We’ve been going out and speaking regularly ever since he finally bit the bullet and saw me one last time in the lobby, waiting to get my number. It’s all so romantic that I have to remind myself I’m not in some Romcom/ Sex and the City set up.

I am now a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug last month after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and extreme introversion.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations. 

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, especially since I live in a remote area. Small town of 2000 people, almost 2 hours from the nearest city with a college.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. On top of that I am waiting for marriage which reduces possible dates even more. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Extreme introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"".

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated in a rural area and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I dont know what.
