I was always pretty shy and introverted so I never really had success with women. I'm not ugly at all, and women have liked me in the past, but for some reason I never really paid much attention to it, which kinda makes this whole thing worse. Everyone thinks I'm totally normal albeit kind of a hermit. I dont really have issues talking to people. I think I must just be an anomaly.  I'm in my lower mid 30s (fucking shocking and sad, I know). Anyway, I basically have **zero experience** with women. I always wanted to be with women and was sad I wasnt, but it didnt bother me that much and I assumed it'd just kinda work out and I'd find someone when I wanted but the world quickly passed me by and now I realize that putting in zero effort in gets you basically...nothing. 

Around a year ago I realized my situation is pretty likely completely fucked and I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life and I dont want that. To be frank, I think its too late. Its like I just woke up one day and realized how dire my situation is. I have finally taken the time to work on my appearance and I'm proud to say I've developed a pretty nice body and I dress nice. Mentally, I'm (obviously) not doing that great and I intend to take steps to fix it. Living situation sucks (renting from parents) and I'm trying to go back to school. But I basically have no friends as I pushed them all away, am as sexually mature as a speck of dust, and my career is nonexistent (hence school). Is it even worth it for me to pursue relationships/sex? If so, how? I just feel like such a weirdo. Like I've been asleep the last 20 years of my life and now its too late to get it back. I do intend to talk to a therapist about it as soon as I can figure out how.

Background: This is way out of my comfort zone and I kind of feel like an imposter. I'm a final semester senior and few months behind when I should have graduated. I feel like I might be too old? This is the first semester I haven't been online since the pandemic started and I don't really know any of my fellow students.

I'm 6.1ft, somewhat fit, and about average to slightly above average looks (weird thing to say about yourself).

I don't think I'm anymore awkward than the next person when communicating; however, I had a lot of anxiety about flirting or conversing to girls. It's probably a lack of self confidence, but I playback situations over and over until my only memory is some minor thing that was awkward. I am not afraid of being turned down. I hate the idea that people (even random strangers) will think less of me for even trying. I don't mean to sound defeated, but my online dating experiences have left being ghosted before dates and it kinda was taken a total.

We met in person 2 and a half months ago and became exclusive about a month and half ago. I was happier in the beginning but things aren't continuing as well as I would hope.

I told him I was very excited about our monthiversary and we talked about some plans. I know it's kind of a high school thing to even care about but I've only been in one relationship prior and it was really really bad. So a month together with a guy I was happy with felt worth celebrating. I came up with the idea to return to where we had our first date and he thought it was a cute idea and offered to make me dinner after that and maybe watch a movie. I left work early and skipped eating in anticipation of this. I spent hours finding the best outfit and doing my hair and makeup. He gets off work later so I went to his place when he told me he was ready. He answered the door in pajamas and put on the movie we talked about after a few minutes of me being there. He mentioned I looked really nice and that my shoes were ""fancy"". He got out of his chair saying his back was sore and laid in bed and fell asleep promptly. This was all within probably 45 minutes of me being there. 

I teared up a bit while I sat alone watching this movie I didn't care about. I just got up and grabbed my stuff and left. I cried in the car going home. I was still hungry and stopped by a grocery store for some sushi. The place was decked out already for Valentine's Day which made me feel worse. They were out of my sushi roll too so I just gave up and went home. I washed my makeup off and put on my pajamas and ate a lean cuisine meal I found in our freezer. He apologized and said he felt bad and things were strained. We didn't see each other for awhile but it kind of got turned around to me being too harsh on him for being tired after work so I ended up apologizing and trying to make it up to him. We never really talked about anything and nothing was really resolved. We kinda just moved on. Well I didn't clearly but that's where it's at.

That was a couple weeks ago. He has a night class on Mondays so I thought maybe he would try to do something with me for Valentine's Day this past weekend. Well we had some cheap Chinese food for dinner on Saturday and we came back to my place. We had sex and he fell asleep shortly after. I was on my phone for awhile until eventually going to sleep too. He accidentally woke me up early in the morning and we talked a bit and had sex again and he fell asleep shortly after again. Later on we got up and I made him a huge breakfast. He ate and then left at noon. He didn't text me for the rest of the day (Sunday). Well we texted some today and I was 99% sure he wasn't going to do anything for me. A small part of me still had some hope. He knows my address after all he could have always had something sent to my house. He mentioned in a text that he was happy we already celebrated. I asked if he was referring to the Chinese food dinner and he said ""well the whole time together I suppose"". So that pretty clinched it for any hopes I had. In his mind he did the Valentine's Day thing with me already so there was nothing left to do. 

I talked to my friend about how disappointed I was with it all and his first suggestion was communication. I just have a hang up about telling a 25 year old man how to treat me or asking him to do things for me. It kinda defeats the point for me. At that rate I can just do it myself. In his defense he's only been in 2 relationships before me and was a virgin when we met. It doesn't seem the longer term relationship (just under a year) was as serious as I thought because he said he's never had anyone meet his parents before. He also hasn't dated anyone in the last 2 years. So my friend was playing the devil's advocate and said bf is just dense and inexperienced. Since my current approach isn't getting me anywhere I thought okay I'll do something for him and try to go all out so he knows he can do the same for me.

I spent 3 hours this evening making him a nice dinner and dessert. I brought it to his place to surprise him before he got home. He mentioned needing a new candle so I got him that in addition to a Valentine's Day card with a handwritten note inside. I set it all up so he'd see it as soon as he walked in with little candy hearts spread around. When he got home, he said he felt really bad and was sorry. He thanked me and said it was the sweetest and most incredible thing anyone's ever done for him. I said it wasn't a big deal it was just some food, he said no it's so much more than that. He said he thought I was the best person ever. He said I made his day. He said I was going to get ""so many hugs and kisses"". So I honestly don't expect any grand gestures based on those responses. He didn't mention ""I'll make it up to you"" or any variation of that.

I'm starting to feel under valued and under appreciated. I don't feel much effort being made anymore and we haven't even been exclusively dating for 2 months. In the 30 some odd dates we've been on, he's picked what we do or where we go once maybe twice. I've told him it wears on me to always have to pick everything. He responded that he was sorry he just wanted to do what I like. We hardly do anything anymore even on weekends when he's not tired after a 10 hour work day. This past Saturday was just sex, sleep, repeat, breakfast the next day. If I see him on a weeknight, I go to his place, he might make some small talk, we might make out and have sex and he'll fall asleep after. Or he might put on a movie where he falls asleep not long after. I told him we quickly moved into doing just a few of the same things and his answer was that he wasn't bored, the way he feels about me keeps getting stronger, and he was happy doing anything with me.

He's not a bad guy by any means. I was with an actively bad guy for 3 years so I can see the difference. I think with this guy there's an unfortunate mix of him being inexperienced and fear of scaring me away by doing something minor wrong (like taking me a place I don't like). He has told me he's never felt like this with anyone, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him, he feels so lucky, that sort of thing. I think his feelings are genuine. He's not very forthcoming either so we hardly talk about anything very deep or of much substance. The most significant it gets is after sex before he falls asleep. Tbh I look forward to that more than the sex because I get to know more about him and it's not something that happens very often or for very long because he just falls asleep.

I'm just getting discouraged from the monthiversary and Valentine's Day disappointment and not having great communication is wearing on me too. All of it together is kinda hard. I just expected that I'd have a bit more of the honeymoon phase when getting into a new relationship. It has me doubting what I'm getting out of this relationship. I feel like I'm constantly wanting to prove my worth and the value I bring so maybe he'll step it up and do more. I don't like how I'm upset a lot of times now. I wouldn't have these feelings if I was alone. Yes breaking up with him would make me sad but I haven't known him that long so I would move on in due time.

The other concern I'm having is his mom asked to meet me so he invited me to dinner with the two of them at the end of this week. Like I said he's never brought anyone to meet his parents. Being that I'm not feeling on solid ground with him, I don't know if it's a good idea to meet her. I would feel horrible to meet some woman when I'm not even confident I'll be with her son much longer. I can give an excuse not to go but I also don't know if I'm being unreasonable with thinking about ending the relationship when he hasn't done anything that bad. If I am staying with him then I think it'd be nice to meet his mom. I've never met a significant other's parents either.

I really need some advice. I keep venting to my one friend but I think I'd benefit from more perspectives.

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so pls excuse me if this isn’t the right place or something is off :)

So a little bit of backstory, I am currently 20f and when I was 14 I was dating a 17m. I remember feeling so cool that he would choose me out of anyone. He was my first of everything - kiss, oral &amp;penetrative sex… everything. I thought I loved him, but we only dated for maybe 4 months. And he did some pretty weird shit in hindsight. Like,, after we had sex for the first time he FaceTimed his best friend (who lived out of the country) to tell him he’d finally lost his virginity and flipped his camera around to me. After I broke up with him (bc my parents were w me when he sent me a picture of his dick &amp; I was so embarrassed I ended things), he made me call this same friend again to justify the breakup. 

I know this was just a high school ‘romance’ that means nothing but for some reason I can’t move on. Even 6 years later. For the majority of the last six years I’ve hated my ex for what I feel like was a *loosely* unconsensual relationship. Lately, I’ve even been romanticizing the relationship in my head and listening to the playlist he made me (which I haven’t done in years). And I know one of the reasons might be that this is my only real experience w the opposite gender. The part that is really frustrating is that I swear I’m unable to allow myself to date / pursue relationships now bc of how I associate relationships w this old boyfriend. 

I’m in college, and I’ve had at least three distinct guys ask me out on dates where at the last moment I freak out, have an anxiety attack, and bail on the date. Another weird element is that I hooked up with another girl last year with absolutely no anxiety or attachment. 

I guess my question, and reason for posting here is why do I do this w any new relationship? Does it have to do with my ex-boyfriend? Am I justified in thinking this relationship was inappropriate? How can I overcome this for the health of future relationships?

Neither of us remembered it was V Day when we agreed to get dinner today, but I remembered late last night.  She likes to bake, so I got her flours instead of traditional flowers since I thought I should get her something for the day.

She laughed when I gave her the flours and we went to dinner and enjoyed a nice meal.

I wasn’t sure how she was feeling when I walked her to her door, but said I’ve been having a really nice time and was wondering if she felt like a kiss goodnight.

She said “sure”, so we had a polite first kiss and then held and looked at each other a bit.  “Did you want more?” She asked. I laughed and kissed her again, this time for longer, then we smiled and parted ways.

We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. For the first several months, we would talk frequently. At first, I was the one always having to initiate the conversation, so I stopped. I only stopped for a day, though. That day, I said good morning to him when I came in, goodbye when I left, and I'd talk to him for work related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to speak to him about trivial things. The next day, he came right up to me and started talking to me. He started initiating for a while then. 

At work, he would frequently help me, even when I didn't ask for help. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now. 

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager. 

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been acting somewhat back to normal again. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly like before. Today, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. Today is Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers.

I have been talking to this girl I met on tinder for a few days now and last night decided to finally shoot my shot and ask her out for an at-home date night type of thing for V-Day. Amazingly she said yes and I got to preparing. She arrived at 8:30 today and we began by making some pizza because I decided it would be a good idea if I prepare all the ingredients and toppings and make a pizza “station” where we can throw the toppings on some dough and make a his and hers pizza. Food turns out great, at least imo, and we begin watching a movie on Netflix with our pizza. The entire night, I feel a connection with her, and I can tell the feeling is mutual. She leaned in to snuggle while watching the movie, and was overall very “close”. I decided to just go for it, so I look her in the eyes and go in for a kiss. The kiss was fantastic and I felt that “spark” that I thought was just in movies. I assume she feels the same because she immediately went for a kiss to reciprocate. Things get more touchy from there and we move (run) to the bedroom. Its super obvious that we’re both really attracted to each other. We both start taking each other’s clothes off, and then she pulls down my pants and my underwear with them. Immediately she stops and takes a step back, she then IN FRONT OF ME tries to stop herself from laughing and says she needs to go out of nowhere and just storms out. I’m writing this in the same position I got stuck at after this and haven’t been able to move. I can’t even think straight. Did I do something wrong?

Also English isnt my first language.

I(26m) have been dating this girl(25f) for over a month now and am starting to develope feelings. This is sort of new for me since I came out of a relationship which took a lot effort to get over. Mind you it has been years since I dated anyone.

I met this girl on happn and we hit it of pretty good. That being said we both work a lot and study which takes a lot of time on a day to day basis. We both had deadlines to work towards which was stressfull to say the least. Besides that, the girl lost a good friend from work due to cancer which was also rough for her. 

So the thing I'm struggling with is the amount of time we want to spend on eachother and I feel like there is a inbalance in the way we want to see eachother. I try to set up dates, while she cancels them. I make time while she limits it. It has been like this since we started the dating process. Even though I initiate I feel like I have been holding back on asking her out because it would be to much for her. This because she told me she isnt in the right headspace a couple of times. 

We had a date last sunday and it was fine, I noticed she only talked about her own life and didnt ask about mine. It has been like this before as well. Besides that she was on her phone a lot talking to coworkers about the recently deceased coworker. Like I said, this man ment a lot to her. At the time I didnt make much of it but yesterday I had this weird gut feeling. Like I said my relationship before this has been one sided as well and even abusive. My part in this that I enabled it but still, I ended up with physical scars from it.

This gut feeling was not going away, so I decided to open up about her to what I was feeling in person. I think this was a mistake, she didnt acknowledge my feelings and instead turned it around to that I was asking to much of her. Also she told me I was making her feel bad because I put effort into seeing her and she couldnt do the same. After arguing a bit we decided the conversation wasnt getting anywhere en left it at that. To be continued so to say, we would let it all sink in and talk about it in a week or so when things would settle down. 

So now I'm thinking that this isnt the right way to start a relationship. I feel like we both arent happy right now and its taking a lot of effort for us both to stay together. Which isnt healthy. The thing thats holding me back to break it off is that I really like this girl. She told me she likes me too a couple of times. The question still remains,

Work on your kissing and other foreplay skills will help too. Those things matter more to most women than penis size.

Hey guys, I (31M) have been dating this girl (23F) for about a month. Every date except our first date she has spent the night and we have sex, our dates usually last about 24 hours. Our last date (last sunday) she initiated sex twice. I asked if she wanted to see each other more than once a week, she said she is busy with work during the week but said she had free time on thursday so I told her I would call her wednesday night to make plans, she seemed happy about it. We already have plans for saturday night/sunday.

just based on this, it seems pretty clear she likes spending time with me. now, onto the not-so-clear things: our last date she brought up that she isn't a big texter (it usually takes her several hours/days to reply to me), I replied I was wondering what was going on and she said that she just doesn't like texting but wanted to tell me so I wasn't confused with mixed signals, ok cool. She then went on to talk about her emotionally absent father who never told her he loves her, she describes her relationship with her dad as only superficial. She went on to say that because of this she has a hard time opening up and being affectionate. I told her I understand. I also learned that she has never been in a relationship that lasted more than one year (red flag?). One thing I've noticed the most is that she rarely is the first one to text. I have been doing about 95% of the planning for dates and initiating contact which also makes me wonder about her level of interest in me.

I can feel myself falling for her and am wanting to ask her about exclusivity but feel it might be a moot point since she is already spending the majority of her free time with me. Have any of you guys been in a situation where you were dating someone you really liked but they had emotional intimacy problems due to bad parents?

I have a great job and plenty of friends.  So, I met a her on Tinder exactly 6 weeks ago, first date I  kinda got drunk and said some stupid thing. I tried to kiss her and she gave me the cheek. So I just said fuck it but she concacted me day after. I was kinda cold and ignored her last message.

 Week later I meet her at the bar and we talk for a bit, she messages me tomorrow and asks if I wanna grab a drink. I decline but I say im available at Thursday and  she agrees. We have a great date, she hugs me and kisses me on the cheek, so I take her home and a week after that I ask her out and she immediately agrees.    
We had drinks and I was cool and patient. Later that night we were sitting in my car and all of a sudden she starts kissing me, long story short, she spent the next 2 hours in my arms kissing and cuddling. She also memorized my number even tho I only told her once. Next date I also waited for a week and called her.  When we met up she gave me a kiss on the lips and looked really happy to see me. We were having fun and she invites me back to her place. This is where the story gets terrible.  
 We were making out and she takes me to her room, and i start giving her oral sex and she finishes. She wants me to take my pants of but I can't get hard. She says whats the problem I say I had too much to drink. So I ate her once again and she fell asleep in my arms, tomorrow night she calls me again to her place and same shit happens, she says whats the problem I say I like her too much and I'm a bit nervous, she brushes it of and says she likes me really really much, so we kept  hugging and kissing me and says she wanna crawl under my skin and can't let me go. She also said wants me to buy me a toothbrush so I can stay over more frequently.   
So she messages me after our date and I we exchange 1-2 message per day. I respond to her message on Friday and say to her: ""Hey, are you free tommorow night, I would like to see you"". She says maybe, I have to study for upcoming exams but she wants to see me too. But..she really messages me and asks me out around 8 at night. I actually went out with my friends and say I can't do it tonight because I only saw her message. She got kinda mad but I kept it playful and asked her out on Sunday.   
She agrees I pick her up, she is kinda eager around me but I am teasing her and she sits basically in my lap and touches me. She also said I bought you a toothbrush when you come next time. So, we joke around for a bit and I say let's drive around for a bit. She pays for our drinks and we leave. In the car she asks me why arent you cuddling with me, so we started kissing passionately and once fucking again, we get to the point and same thing happens. I can't even explain to you how embarrassed I am.   
Then I have another mayor fuck up and say to her I like you so much I don't think I can fuck you, I wanna make love to you. She says I'm super cute and she wants to teach me to make love to her. Long story short, we kissed the rest of the night I left her at home earlier than usual. She texts me that night and says did I get home safe, I said yeah but i'm really sleepy and said good night, she also responded good night and that is it.

For example he talked to me like shit and when i got upset he just said « ho come on you took it wrong »

Then i will take some distance because it hurts me when he doesn’t try to understand and after some time he will come to me and change back to the perfect guy… until the next time.
