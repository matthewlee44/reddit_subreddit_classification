0,ruimyu,1641155487,How to respond to her forgetting our plans?,"Hey. I'm M20 and there is that girl in my university i think is cool. I don't know if i like her yet, but we're on a project together so I'm gonna get to know her either way.

Now because of lockdown we had never actually met before so a few weeks ago i ""asked her out"" just to get to know her. I didn't think of it as a date, since like i said we're currently project partners.

Anyway, we were totally on the same page and agreed to meet again to work on our project. That would've been tomorrow, and i had planned to ask her on a real ""date"" once we were done with this project and didn't have any obligations towards one another. Anyway I asked it tomorrow was still on and she told me that she had forgotten we'd made plans, but she would be able to come the day after tomorrow. 

This can happen, of course, but it still bugs me. I value my time alot and i don't like it when people disregard that. And even though i really like what I know of her so far, this is a personality treat I can not tolerate. When we first met she postponed too, for about an hour.

Now how should I handle this? 

 &gt;Should i stay cool and tell her that the next day is also good

&gt;Should i tell her how i feel and that i don't like it if my time and effort isn't valued? But accept

&gt;Should i just tell her nevermind and finish the project on my own without her help (she'd still have to do her part on her own) 

&gt;Anything else? 

&gt;Last but not least: Do i, in this case, have the right to ask what got in the way? 

Thank you for your help!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruimyu/how_to_respond_to_her_forgetting_our_plans/

6,ruit5l,1641155963,Help. I don't understand my girlfriend,"I am a 20 years male, in a relationship with my girlfriend 21 years. Our relationship is a long distance one a 8 months so far.

We have weekly videocalls,and also daily calls at night before bed.

I love her, I wrote poetry to her, I talk with her, I understand her , but I got a message that I got also some time ago and please understand me, I don't understand what she wants from me.

She tells me that she wants to be always pursued, always always, she says that she is felling that she is pursuing me not the other way around.

But I don't know what I can't do more than this. I talk with her, I love her, we have long talks, I made a craft one day for her, that I have sended, I song a song the other.

She told me also that she feels like we go each other about our day and then at then end we talk about it.

But what am I supposed to do? To call her 3 in 3 hours? I also have my day, I want to become an engineer and I am in college so I need to study because if I don't do so I will not become an engineer.

We plann to get married when I finish school but for that I need money so I am trying to study and to get there.

What am I supposed to do? I don't understand. She is always dissapointed of me, she tells me that if we continue like this , our relationship will not be well.

But we are at long distance. What can I do more?? What?

Should I write poetry every day?? What ? She unsatisfied.

Should I drop out of college and marry her . Because being close togheter we can show our feelings more to each other. She also tells me that she needs affection that she is not getting from me. How can I show her affection online. How?

7,ruivxt,1641156142,My bf has anger problems. Will he ever be able to learn to manage this?,"I’ve been with my bf for a year now. A lot of things started unraveling when we moved in together. I didn’t know he had anger issues until I learned it myself. He says he will get help through medical but it’s been a year and he hasn’t. When he gets angry he doesn’t listen, he gets so angry he yells and cusses and loses control. He will break things and sometimes he gets physical with me too. I’ve done things like set my boundaries but he will cross them when he’s angry. I keep holding on because I hope that he will get help to manage his anger and his own trauma. I’m not perfect but I know that I’ve never treated him this way or crossed boundaries with him. I am in individual therapy myself for growth and to manage my anxieties. I am in grad school and am a part time sub. I can’t tell my friends or family because I know they will never see him the same or offer him the same chances as me. He’s an overall great person when things are good between us but when there’s conflict or just a disagreement his anger gets the best of him. He doesn’t act this way to his mom or his uncle or in public. I know there’s disrespect there. I know I’m being stupid for seeing him as someone who can grow out of this and learn to manage it. But he hasn’t. Am I wasting my time? Do I continue to stick by him to support him and continue to be patient so he can get help. Or am I being delusional?

14,rujigd,1641157785,Cheesecake: A Story of Putting Myself Out There,"A little context, I have very low self esteem and a history of mental illness so i’ve never put myself “out there”. I’ve made some progress this last year in my social skills (even while taking online classes) and have better confidence so I’m really working on getting experience. Here’s a story of my first real attempt to get close to a girl.

I [M22] met this girl [F20] online last March who goes to the same University as me. We chatted online for a month and a bit. I somehow ended up promising her cheesecake during finals (She said I owe her some, can’t remember the context lol) and eventually we got busy and didnt speak for the rest of the summer.

Just before we went back to in-person classes in September she messaged me and we started talking again. We talked about meeting up and she suggested catching a movie, me being scared I didnt follow up on it. We tried meeting up but things kept coming up (She was busy, I had a bunch of stuff going on with classes and friends drama). Eventually we ended up meeting in October, albeit for like 2 minutes since she had to go home.

The following week we got together and roasted marshmellows at the school’s firepits, and then went for coffee. We sat and chatted for maybe an hour in the cafe and she told me how she loved being able to talk to someone here in our mothertongue. I made her laugh, and her smile was seared into my memory. I walked her to class and we said goodbye.

We talked for a little bit and then in another couple weeks we ended up getting coffee again. I met her and her friend and she and I went for coffee. We talked and talked for an hour till she had class and we said our goodbyes. I had so many questions I wanted to ask her, but I didnt want to come off too intensely.

Fast forward to the end of November, I remembered that I “owe her cheesecake” and ask what her favourite flavour is. Oreo. I think about it, maybe its time I ask her out. I’ll take her for a movie like she suggested way back then, and then a nice Cafe for food n cheesecake.

I read a post her about someone making cheesecake for someone, and the idea floated into my mind. I asked for suggestions for Cheesecake places from two of my female friends, and with one of them jokingly said I should just bake it myself. My friend immediately pushed me to do it, saying it was a cute gesture and my other friend approved. I was a bit unsure if it would be weird or not but they pushed me to try it and gave me recipes.

The cheesecake. I hadn’t baked cookies for years, and never tried making cheesecake. So, I decided to make mini cheesecakes instead since they’re easier. I found a couple recipes, shopped for the ingredients and attempted to make mini oreo cheesecakes. 

She knew I was bringing her cheesecake, and the next day I brough a box with me to school. I was nervous, based on her reaction I was prepared to ask her out. For the first time in years I found someone I genuinely attracted to on multiple levels. I got a haircut, dressed up decently and drove to school with the cheesecakes in tow.

I attended my first class, letting the cakes soften after chilling overnight. Afterwards we met up and I gave her the box. She looked at them and was surprised. She proceeded to eat all 5 of them over the next 3 hours as we sat and talked about a myriad of things. I felt amazing, and was so ready to ask her out.

We we’re talking about something, and as she goes on while I listen to her, she mentions “and my boyfriend back home…”

I’m lucky I was wearing a mask, as I couldn’t hide my reaction. I immediately fixed my expression and continued talking and laughing, though I was shocked. Eventually we finished up and she walked me to see my other friend before she went to class.

I took the last couple of cheesecakes to my car and on my way I slipped and fell. Dropping the last two I had after giving some to my other friends. I then went to my car, and felt heartbroken. I broke down and cried for an hour until I steeled myself to carry on functioning and study for my finals.

She thanked me the next day, but I couldn’t help feel empty and depressed for the next three weeks. Eventually I came to a breaking point in my self worth and made the decision to improve myself whatever way possible. I knew that I would never be happy until I tried working on the things I can change about myself. 

And now here I am. We talked every one in awhile, but I have difficulty talking to her. I really do like her and want to stay connected but knowing she’s taken I don’t think I can bare being “just friends”.

The experience changed me fundamentally and has motivated me to give a shot at self improvement and self love.

tl;dr

For the first time in a long while I put mysef out there and met someone I connected with on multiple levels. I baked her favourite type of cheesecake and felt heartbroken after learning she already has someone. My overly emotional response to this signalled something is really wrong emotionally and the experience has pushed me to want to improve and love myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rujigd/cheesecake_a_story_of_putting_myself_out_there/

20,rujxda,1641159046,Advice for dating a woman who was abused in her past?,"I am a 34M, and she is 33F. 

Hello. I'll try to make this brief.

I took a step back from dating years ago, but about two months ago, I met a beautiful woman who I really connect with and we have a lot in common. We're both into fitness, our Christian faith, and we both live very independent lifestyles. We also both like to volunteer in the same volunteer group. We have a common friend circle. Our birthdays are only four months apart (I'm older). I think she's very sweet, kind, and mature. She comments about being inspired by my fitness and weight loss journey.

I like our conversations, and to be honest, I'm starting to wonder if we're running out of things in common. I'm trying to avoid developing feelings that are too strong too fast since I don't want to come across as desperate and needy. I'm not even looking for a relationship right now. **I'm just interested in getting to know her better.**

I've had some very bad experiences with dating in the past and felt like I was taken advantage of and not doing enough to improve my own life.

Anyways, this woman **never told me the specifics of her past and childhood**, but she told me she suffers with C-PTSD and had to get therapy because of past experiences. It sounded almost exactly like therapy and counseling I got two years ago. I had a pretty bad childhood myself, via school. She also just got surgery back in the last week of November and it will take her eight weeks to recover.

Clearly, I don't know the details but I have a very strong suspicion that she was abused in her childhood and teen years (possibly even sexually abused). She also told me she does not date due to trust issues arising from her past.

So, any advice before I pursue this further? All I'm interested in right now is getting to know her better but it seems like both of us have huge trust issues and walls that are six inches thick. If anything were to happen, great. If we date for a while and it ends, I know we'll end amicably.

I've come to the conclusion that one of the reasons I'm single (there's a lot but that's for another post) is because I don't use a lot of social media. I have this and sc, but I barely use them to actually connect with people. It's usually just a few posts a month or so. I've always preferred talking face to face, which covid kinda ruined, so it's not exactly easy for me to meet new people online. I get bad vibes from social apps and there's just too many creepy men on the internet.

We have met up just the once. She has told me she’s busy during the holidays which I don’t doubt as the texts are much more frequent when she’s at college. She usually visits families during the holidays. 

Our date was nice. She was touching my hands and complimenting me. However, I have noticed that she hasn’t said much in regards to our date and I have only had a few short exchanges with her through text. She did remind me that she’s busy and that she can’t wait to talk to me “tomorrow”. Today is “tomorrow” and she’s watching Netflix and not actually talking to me and leaving me on read (note: I don’t double text her. I only respond when she does and don’t act clingy). She sends me videos via tiktok but doesn’t read my messages for hours on end or even until the next day. 

I would also like to note that I did pay for both of our meals and a few items she wanted when we passed the shopping mall because she asked if I could pay for it as she had no money. I felt bad saying no. I’m kinda getting the feeling she might not like me as much and probably is interested in what I have to offer superficially? 

Overall, she is sweet and nice but I guess getting Reddit’s judgement of this would provide some clarity on what this is exactly.

We get on really well and make each other laugh a lot. There’s been quite a bit of flirting when we went to the pub and have also been flirting while messaging.

It took me a while to make the decision as we work together and I didn’t want to make it awkward between us, but I asked her out and initially, she seemed very excited. As we got closer to the date, she couldn’t make it but suggested we reschedule for the next day as she was busy. As we got to the day, she said she was unwell and suggested we do something when she’s better. She loved the date idea and again seemed excited. I messaged her to see how she was and to see what she wanted to do something and I haven’t had a response from her and she has seen the message. I’m guessing she’s no longer interested , which I’m not too upset about. I’m just worried that it’s now going to be awkward at work and has ruined the relationship we had as friends before I asked her out.

We get on really well and we’ll be working from home for a while to won’t be in the office anytime soon, but does anyone have any advice on how to make it less awkward? Should I message her? Should I talk to her when we get back to the office? Or should I just wait for her to talk about it?

im gonna be hitting 22 in a couple of weeks.
my first and last ""girlfriend"" was around three years  ago (Feb 2019) when i was 19 where i got very excited about it and all, a week later i discover im a rebound and she still got feelings for her ex, that basically threw me in a pit of depression and self doubt, after a couple of months pf trying and dating and obsessing over any sort of ""potential"" i realized that i gotta work on my self mentally and improve my lifestyle before goimg into relationships, which is what i exactly did,
during the end of 2019 i joined the gym  to work on my self, after covid it i got into freelancing and helping other students in their coursework and exams and made good money, o chamged my hairstlye and clothing style to something im comfortable and confident in, started learning to play guitar in mid 2020,

Today i use my instagram as a way to give people an idea aboit myself, im. able to play thr guitar really well, im gonna graduate this year with a degree in engineering, and i made great progress physically and mentally.

What i tried, i asked out alot of the girls i was attracted to and connected with in 2021, i asked out girls from engineering classes, i asked oit girls that i went with during highschool, i tried approaching a cute girl at a coffeeshop, a random girl from a party that i made eye contact with, i even tried my chances with a girl that also plays the guitar, all led to the same result, some excuse as to why they ""can't hang out"".

I have no idea what to do at this point, i tried everything im supposed to do, focused on myself before focusing on girls so i don't obsess, and im not obsessing, but after many failed attempts i can't understand the problem.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruku87/ive_been_rejected_by_every_girl_i_ever_approached/

We've hung out a couple of times and he has introduced me to his friends. I don't know really what we are but we have a situationship going on.

Since I've been feeling confused over all of this, I've decided to back off a bit. I don't initiate contact with him anymore and don't answer his snaps unless he directly ask me something and I try to hold it short.

Yesterday morning at around 5 AM he sent me a Snap pic with the text ""new year new possibilities"". I opened it but didn't answer.

Then late night yesterday he sends me two videos of really dark, insensitive offensive jokes, knowing that I find it offensive (he did that this summer and I told him off and he was like its a joke I have dark humor.), and I was like wtf dude? And he said oh sorry, I misjudged you. I thought you liked my dark humor. I was like dude there's dark humor and then there's what you actually sent me, which I don't find funny at all.

I'm now wondering if this was just his way of hinting that he doesn't like me, so he decided to send something offensive to also hurt me in the process. What do you think?

I am M32 and the girls i am dating is 26..we met on bumble 2 weeks ago swiped and matched..we had a good chat and it kept on going for 2-3 hours decided we should totally go out.So we went on a coffee date next day..we liked each other and she looked beautiful and cute much better than her pictures and she told me the same..texted after date and i asked if she wants to meet again.

Date 2 i took her out for dinner and after spending time eating and having conversations about life and all..we went back to my car and I kissed her..somehow the kisses didn’t stop and we had a full make out session for an hour i dropped her home and said goodbye.

Date 3 we went for a movie i was so totally into the movie but couldn’t keep my hands of her and we made out and touched each other while i tried to semi focus on the movie after the movie we ate some street food and said goodbye.

Date 4 This happened 2 days after the movie..I had a busy day but decided to invite her for dinner but she said she will grab something for me on her way.she got me and her sandwiches we ate and chilled and later on had the most intense sex session i have ever had it was just incredible..we cuddled after talked about life stuff.

All of this happened in the last 2 weeks and somehow we cannot stop texting or chatting with each other and she wants to hangout again soon but i am occupied with work.

We are both looking for a serious relationship.she broke off her engagement one year ago and have stayed away from dating she only went out with one other guy before she matched with me.

Now i don’t know whats going on but she just understands me,we both have same sense of humour and like same type of stuff in general when it comes to movies and tv shows..somehow i feel like i have started developing feelings for her and like her very much.

Is this normal ?? like we just met how come i can like her so much and she also likes me too??

46,rulvr7,1641164141,Saying You want a Good Communicator on your Dating Profile is my new red flag,"I keep coming across profiles on Tinder, Hinge, Bumble of women that put in their bio that they want a man who is a ""Good Communicator"". When I match and try and have a conversation that doesn't feel like an interview, its them who are poor communicators and I am the one who gets left on read within the first few messages. 

I understand if you get to know someone and then you say ehhhh I am not into this person and end it, or a match and never respond. But to message for a day or 2 and have semi fluid conversation and start to get to know someone and then ghost when you are the one that said you wanted a good communicator is just rude.  

I use to be the type of texter who would respond within moments of getting a message as that's how I am with friends and anyone outside of dating apps etc. But I have been told by friends that are women and been told on reddit that I shouldn't be so responsive in the dating world as it makes me seem desperate. Additionally I have been told if I haven't gotten a response in several days then to take the hint and let that match go. so I have learned to limit myself and regulate how quickly I respond because that's what I have been told.

But that seems to be that isn't the answer either it just seems that if they are searching for a ""good communicator"" then it is them who is not and its just a red flag.

Also I want to add that if you say that you ""never respond"" or ""reply in your head and never hit send"" then I am immediately going to swipe left. Why bother trying to have a conversation with someone who cant be bothered to text back.

I'm(32m) very insecure and an overthinker. I've been open about this with the girl (26) I've been dating. We've had extremely long talks and long-form text conversations. And she seemed to like me because of these. She's the first person I've kissed and been physically intimate with (which I wasn't expecting or mentally prepared for at the time). I'm also a virgin still and only have a few months of total dating experience. I really like her and want to keep this healthy and long-term.


I think about her all the time, but I don't know what love is or if it's an obsession or an attachment thing. A friend told me this isn't an actual relationship yet, so I need to chill out and just keep suppressing all these feelings so I don't come off as needy and desperate. But it feels like I'm trying to kill my feelings.

I felt we had amazing chemistry on the first 3 dates. I just went on my 4th date yesterday morning and I felt I was quite boring since we didn't have a chance to sit for a long chat. I also asked I question that she already answered previously, which I think she noticed,  just to make small talk. I also made a disgusting comment/joke during the date.  I'm terrible at small talk but have been trying to push texting to touch base every day even though she said she enjoyed having long conversations instead. I also accidentally phrased a question via text with a negative vibe which she read but didn't respond to. I really want to apologize for these things at the moment, but I feel this could just be overthinking, and bringing it up would indicate more of this behavior in the future and I would come off as annoying. What should I do now?

Woman three/ Oi same as woman 1 and 2, shes emotionally stable and gives feed back. Only thing  you cant stand is how jealous she can be at times. Could be talking to your female coworker and she think your cheating on her.

I’m at a place where I’m figuring out this part of my life. My religion has helped me and my family in dark times, as well as it being tied to my culture. However, I find myself being more progressive in my beliefs and know that the Bible has a lot of conflicts with that. I won’t go too much into detail but basically my core beliefs are contradictory to some of the churches teachings. But, I don’t want to separate myself from Catholicism either.

Back to the main point, I am open to the thought of dating people of other religions or none at all.

After the third we just kinda... Chilled in my bed, hung out, cuddled, talked for a couple hours... She fiddled with my beard, kissed me, all that sappy stuff. After the whole covid dry time, it was incredible, and I just can't get it out of my mind, I want to spend as much time as possible with her. I'm scared I'm catching feelings, and I don't know what to do.

Since we've only been on three dates I don't know if she's dating several guys at once or what her intentions are. I definitely wanna keep nurturing this. I like her a lot, but the 3rd date feels so early to try and advance things and I'm scared doing so will push her away. On the other hand I'm scared that not trying to advance things gives a window to one of the other guys that she might or might not be dating to take that step before me.

I'm reading way the fuck too deep into things now, we celebrated new years apart since we had plans in place since long before we met, so of course my mind is telling me she met an ex or someone new at her party. We've texted briefly roughly every 2 days or so between dates, I've been trying to ramp it up a bit, but she's still a very inactive texter, which she did tell me in person. My gut tells me that's a bullshit excuse, and that she's just not that interested, but on the other hand she's extremely into it during our dates, asking questions about my life, getting into deeper topics etc etc, haven't had a single weird silence with her so far, we always find things to talk about. It's a really goddamn weird feeling to me since I'm usually able to be pretty straight forward and blunt, but I really don't wanna fuck this one up. She's gorgerous, smart, shares so many interests while also having just enough differences for us to complete eachother and keep things interesting, I fuck this up and I have to deal with a ""the one that got away"" to keep me awake at night.

Do I take the plunge and just tell her I felt something really special when we laid there, ask her what kinda intentions she has for our dating, try to find out if the feelings are mutual or if I'm more of a fwb to her?

So basically after that she became more dry, she doesn't call me as she used to or she doesn't even hug me or hold my hand. I'm extremely confused cuz I really like her and ofc I would like to have something with her in the future. But still it kinda hurts, i asked her if she's still feels the same feelings for me and she said that yes that nothing has changed. But I'm still really confused because of the way she acts.

63,run71t,1641167616,"Getting divorced, not my idea but I'm at the point of just wanting it to be over. Help? 2part","Part 1] I (30M) am in the process of accepting that my (35F) wife is absolutely dead set on divorce. I've been fighting for the marriage for the last year and it has felt like I've been the only one who gives a damn for pretty much the whole time. I love this woman with all my heart, and this whole long drawn out process has had some pretty serious damaging effects on my overall well-being... I don't sleep for shit, I've lost a ton of weight (always been thin but anymore I'm straight up skinny), and my emotional health is... let's say shaky, at best. The kicker in all this is that, while she's certainly gung-ho about ending the relationship, she's been in exactly zero rush to actually make any progress in terms of packing, finding a new place, and giving either of us the chance to move on with our lives. I'm a self-employed woodworker, by the way. My shop is in our garage and frankly to hell with packing it up and moving it because of a decision she'smaking, and our two roommates are effectively ""my friends not hers"" in that they would both much rather I be the one to stay here than her - to the extent that they would find a different residence if I were to move out. This all means that I have no way of escaping what's happening in all this... I'm steadily deteriorating mentally more and more each passing day. How do I impart to her the importance of actual separation in a timely manner? And is there a way to increase the odds of her actually caring? I don't want to end up hating the woman I've loved for this long and planned to spend my life with, but the mounting resentment is getting exceedingly difficult to ignore...
Part 2] This bit will probably be seen as a much more shallow issue, but it's also really wearing on me... we haven't had any (and I do mean ANY) intimacy in 6 months. No sex, no making out, no hand holding, any attempts I make at flirting or being at all physically or emotionally intimate have been blatantly ignored at best and ridiculed or snapped at at worst. I (somewhat) adhere to the school of thought pertaining to love languages, and physicality is very much my primary. I feel like I'm starving after this long with no intimacy, particularly in the physical sense, and I'm kinda losing my shit about it... I'm not generally big on the whole one night stand concept as it feels very surface level-y and I crave a much deeper experience than just throwing a few thrusts and then rolling over to pass out. I absolutely love foreplay, and I'm very much one to spend as much time as is allowed exploring and pleasing my partner's body. But at this point, after this long, I have been thinking about it just to get the experience of connecting with another person again. I can't shake the thought of a girl with a nice bum sitting on my face for an unreasonable amount of time (ha) and just... having that feeling again. My wife and I used to have what I considered the perfect sex life. No judgment, very open, very communicative and honest, I've always been much more of a giver but that was always ok cause it's kinda my thing. I got off in getting her off, if that makes sense. This last year there was a steady decline up until the last half of 2021, at which point it completely ended. I've been trying everything I can think of to find that spark again with her but she's been incredibly resistant and I've obviously had no luck. So I guess my question is... How do I put myself out there again? And is what I just described as far as my sexual predilection going to be seen as too much? I'm not necessarily a bad looking guy, I don't think, but I'm a bit awkward and often have a hard time with casual small talk in an attempt to forge a hook-up sort of interaction. How can I go about this in a way that won't put women off and/or leave me feeling gross and hating myself for not being genuine?

P.S. There are obviously a lot of details in and around this development that I'm leaving out here. If you feel as though more explanation is necessary in order to help me out by all means let me know and I'll dig a little deeper, but I figured for now I'd just get to the point of where my head's at currently.

She was the only woman to ever be interested in doing anything with me.

Now I know that's not with everyone, but especially when I'm dating guys(I'm bi, therefore I've also dated girls), even if it's said that it's not an issue and there won't be any, I feel like there's still this expectation, whether that's now or in the VERY near future.
Like for example, one of my colleagues started dating a guy and she was talking about how ""he was such a gentleman"" that he didn't even try to have sex with her for 2 weeks. I said that I thought that was the bare minimum to which my other colleague(F) replied that ""2 weeks is a long time for a man"". This kind of reinforced the idea I already had.
Now it might just be me, I realise this. I also have vaginismus which I have been in treatment for, but I haven't had sex with a peen involved in over 2 years.

Me and this person could take forever which i have never been able to do this with anyone.

Basically, I thought the date went amazing we hung out at her place after and talked for a while until she ended up kissing me and we continued to make out and she would cuddle with me and whatnot after as we would talk. She brings up the idea of dating and basically sounds like that’s what she wanted.

81,ruocfm,1641170780,A genuine honest question,"tl;dr: How do men and women feel about dating someone that doesn’t match with them in a financial standpoint and seem complacent?

Backstory: I grew up in abject poverty to an alcoholic and abusive father who beat my mother, (didn’t really know about financial literacy - no good examples growing up) worked right out high school and through very hard work I was able to get a full scholarship and go to college and get my degree. But met my ex husband at college (who was controlling, insecure, financially abusive, made me give up wanting to work to be a stay at home wife who cooked and cleaned for him - I hated it, spent way more than we had and ran up so much debt. I was left with it after I couldn’t take it anymore and asked for a divorce - spoiler; he cleaned out what little savings I kept and took my dog and everything I had while I was out, and would only sign the divorce papers if I agreed to give up trying to get my my dog back, the only thing I wanted back). 

I worked hard for a year straight paying off his debt (didn’t want him to ruin my credit as I was joint and since he refused to pay it). Hated debt way before him but after that I learned more about being financially secure and became debt free. I’m thankful I have a wonderful job (kept the job my ex husband wanted me to leave yet again for him, did this twice for him) that pays me very well. Because of this I’m cautious about who I date. I’ve only dated one guy seriously for a year after it, we were very compatible in our thinking and a lot of ways, ended things as he’s avoidant (also learned about attachment theory after him). I’ve been thinking about getting back into dating. 

Which leads to my question. I’ve had a few coffee dates and talked to a few guys, but I’ve found they have a lot of debt, don’t care about being financially responsible, they have a job but seem complacent about how their life is. That’s fine for them and I’m not judging. This just throws up some red flags for me. My question is, how would you feel when dating when you meet people like this and seem to be okay with how their life is? Should I let them know their reasons of how their life is as to why I don’t want to pursue things? Is that wrong, should I be diplomatic? I believe in being honest so I’m looking for advice",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruocfm/a_genuine_honest_question/

Today he basically called me immature as an insult. I didn’t argue with him, or say much. Just blocked him and moved on. But I thought I’d share bc of the irony behind all of this. This guy is literally a single dad at 21, with addiction problems, an okay job, uses Snapchat as a form of communication, and he lives at home with his mom.

So after I went back to him we were chilling at the couch and someone called him and he didn’t pick it up after 2 minutes the person calling ( a woman ) send him a video of her stupid tree and tv and the decoration and I asked him who is that ? He said I’m not gonna tell you I asked 2-3 times who that person was and no response given . After that he said you always fight with me whenever you come over I’m like there is a woman who is calling you and sending you stupid videos 😒 duh , I left cause I was ready to explode and never texted him anything we both went no contact for 3 weeks usually it’s only a day or two the most that we may not talk to each other if we argue I decided to text him only because I had a bad dream of him and he change his number ……….

87,rupay3,1641173491,Feel like I might’ve screwed up with this guy. Thoughts?,"I did a dumb thing, and after getting advice from my fellow Redditors, they encouraged me to fix the wrong I did. I (21F) really like this guy (26M), but I made a dumb decision based on assumption. We spent NYE together in the city, kissed, hung out for an entire week, etc. I tried to fix it with him, but I’m having difficulty figuring out his response lol. I have the exchange below.


Here’s what I sent him:

“Hi, Good morning :)
I hope you’re having a good first day at work! I just wanted to reach out to you and apologize. I had a really good time yesterday—and the last few days—with you, but I just felt really bad about yesterday. I was embarrassed about the fact that I couldn’t get you off. I’m not really experienced in stuff like that outside of occasionally watching porn. So I overreacted, felt weird about it, and unfollowed you, which was stupid and immature. I just wanted to say I’m sorry, and that I didn’t mean to make things confusing if I did. You’re a great guy, and I’d love to keep talking if you’re open to it. Or if you want to be friends or acquaintances or Instagram friends...lol. I’m open to any of it. I wish you a great first day at work and rest of the week! I wish you best if we just remain friends or acquaintances. Happy Sunday! :)”

His response:
“Lol yeah no worries, that’s completely up to you.”
“I’m still down for whatever and trust me I always have trouble getting off. With anyone so don’t think that was because of anything you did”

What are your thoughts on his response? Did I completely screw it up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rupay3/feel_like_i_mightve_screwed_up_with_this_guy/

I already thought that I moved on from the event, and thinking of starting to date again. However, due to the lingering pain and trauma, I still don't know what to do.

89,ruphbq,1641173975,She’s talking about her ex….,"Hi everyone I’m super new to this, never actually posted anything on here just always read other peoples things, but this has been bothering me for a while now and I just needed to get some advice from others. 
I’ve been dating the same girl for almost two years now (we are in our 20’s, have talked about being together long term, etc.). She had dated a guy previously who was a serious jerk to her, and occasionally he requests to follow her on social media and even dm’s her. She never really answers him but it has made her upset in the past. 
I always usually let it go because I know he really hurt her and it still effects her. The last time he did it was over the summer but it wasn’t a big deal. Today, he did it again and she explained that she wanted to let him follow her so he could see her resent post and “how hot she still is”. I told her I thought that was weird and it made me uncomfortable, as we’ve been together for so long, not sure why she still even really cares about him and that’s how it seems to me when she still says things like this about him. 
I tried to explain this to her but now she is sad/upset with me and won’t talk to me about it. I’m worried that maybe I overstepped this time, or that she’s going to talk to him now just without telling me. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? Am I crazy for being worried and sharing my feelings about it with her? She says she would never do anything to hurt me or even wants to talk to him, just wants him to see she’s fine without him I guess. Is it weird that makes me feel like she still cares?

Prior to me asking she liked me on Tinder and then we started talking. The reason I’m posting is because I just need some helpful advice. Since it’s been a few days and she hasn’t let me know when she’s free should I just ask her if she’s still up for it or should I just wait. This may sound like a dumb simple question but I’m riddled with OCD and Anxiety so I constantly overthink these types of things frequently. I just don’t want to seem like I’m forcing it or pestering her with it. It’s all that’s been on my mind for the past few days so I’d appreciate the advice.

93,rupmhp,1641174385,How to “take things slow” and enjoy the process?,"I’ve been seeing someone for a few months and they’ve been clear that they would want to really take time to know each other before committing to a relationship as they find that such relationships tend to be stronger. 

I respect their wish but as I’m starting to fall for them, I notice it’s triggering my fear of not being good enough. Relationships for me have always happened very quickly, maybe 1 to 2 months of getting to know the person and this is a very new and unfamiliar dynamic that I’m struggling to adapt to. I admit that I fall in love very quickly and easily. 

Things are progressing well generally, we spend time regularly together, we enjoy each other’s company but I’m honestly having a hard time dealing with the anxiety that I seem to have no control over the process.

So I[19F] and my boyfriend[21M] have been dating for 11 months. To give some background information both my bf and I identify as Agnostic and his parents are hard-core christians. And we are both in college and hes finishing up his last two semesters. He has a sister[19F] that is 2 years younger than him who I was close too. She had asked me if I lost my virginity to him, I honestly didn’t think much of this because I was raised with a very open family that never lied about anything. Nothing arouse about my sexual relationship with my bf aside from the fact that I informed her we never did anything in their parents house (out of respect). Shortly after this conversion his 22yr old sister had seen me taking Birth control and said she took it for pimples then asking me why I took it, where i replied so I don’t get pregnant. These conversations never seemed bad to me and I didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t until his mother found out we were having sex. She then found out that I had told his 19 year old sister that I lost my virginity to him. From there his mom had all his sister unfollow me and block me on everything. For a couple of weeks his parents had told him they don’t feel comfortable with me being there (as if I wanted to go back after everything I found out they said about me to my bf). A couple of months past and I felt that it was time to speak to them as it really effect my mental health for a couple of months. When I went back to talk to them I apologized on my end for even saying anything related to sex to his sisters and I also expressed how judged and thrown out I had felt. They didn’t apologize for anything and instead told me “actions have consequences” the closest thing I got to a apology was “Im sorry you felt judged”. Which to me is a very very bullshit thing to say. There was a point where his father told me he doesnt know his son anymore because of me, and my bf had to step in saying he was always like this. They also told me it was the “truth” about sex before marriage. For almost half the conversation it felt like they were antagonizing me and attacking me for everything. The conversation felt to emotionless to the point i had to stop them and tell them they had no emotions when speaking. At the end we agreed to respect one another but it still felt so bland. Am I in the wrong for not wanting a relationship with them? I know I made the idea present that we should talk but I don’t feel like having a relationship with them anymore. And I am truly in love with my bf, and we’ve talked about how as soon as he is finished up with college he will move in with me (I have an apartment in a different city because I go to college in that city). I have come to terms with seeing them during holidays and special occasions but I don’t want a relationship with them. I feel guilty of feeling this way as they are the parents of my bf who I love so deeply. Im not sure what else to do and I don’t know if its fair for him to be with me when i feel this way. Ive expressed my thought with him and he told me he was with me 100% of the way and he with me as I am with him and not his family. I just think about the future and I want to raise my children without being forced to believe in something they don’t want to. And I know they will criticize me and my children when the time comes. And to be quite frank I am not even sure I want my children to be around people like that.
