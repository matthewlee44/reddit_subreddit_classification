0,oucecu,1627614220,I finally knew his mysterious friend,"I've been getting closer to this guy friend over the last few months. He asked me to introduce him to my close friends (which I did), and he likewise introduced me to his close friends, EXCEPT for one, let's call him friend A (also a guy). 

I know they're close and he sometimes shows a snippet of their funny conversations to make me laugh (which is how I know they're close). However, when he organized any activities for me to spend time with his friends, friend A was never there.

Or when he's spending time with friend A (and others), he never invited me, I just bumped into them by accident one time, and couldn't stay long. 

Last week, I bumped into friend A by accident again and I instantly understood why.

I and friend A have the exact same hobbies &amp; interest &amp; lifestyle &amp; priorities &amp; life goals, and our personalities meshed together so well. We were talking from afternoon until midnight, and I didn't even notice the time. It was so so easy.

I’ve been talking to a guy for about a week, conversation has been good. He seems interested, I’m interested.

I told him I got it but I disagreed. He claimed that he’s not political but thought it was funny. I don’t think he’ll do it again and I’ll give him another chance because he seems like a nice person, but why he thought it was a good idea I’ll never understand (especially because I’m not shy about identifying my political ideologies in my profile)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oucmx8/advice_for_early_stage_texting/

3,oucnta,1627615243,How do you tell if someone is not confident? You can be a full range of negative emotions and still be confident. You can be at any stage of life and still be confident and yet so many men are still single.,"So many people say that men need to be confident and like themselves but as a man who's teeter-tottered between depression and mania and then depression again, I'm really not seeing a difference at least in my own personal life

And to be honest, and as much as I wish it would have happened to me sooner I didn't start having success in women until recently around the ages of 22 to 24 now. And not only that I'm arguably in the worst mental state I have ever been in since I'm still dealing with bipolar disorder post diagnosis.

When I was younger and when I genuinely personally felt like I was at my best no woman was really into me or at least I could not notice it

But I think about why people give this advice it sounds great but if you are social and a people person like so many people on Reddit claim they are then you would know that no human is an island and I have yet to meet a person who was 100% confident

When I do meet someone who gives off this vibe is usually never because that their life is so good that they can walk out with no problems in the world.

I do genuinely believe that people spend their lives working on giving off this perception though and as a man I can understand

When you are told since birth that all of your worth is derived from what other people can get out of you and how much of a performance you can master, it starts feeling a little redundant and stupid

I really do feel like when people say confidence they mean a certain type of masculinity and I am very much under the impression that masculinity is a performance

As a big black guy I have been on both sides to wear people have called me too soft or too nice because of my personality until I start giving them negative energy back and then they act super scared of me

Throughout my life this is a type of thing that keeps getting reinforced is that it's not that a man is just simply a man or even if he works on certain traits and then becomes a man. The man who can Master putting on the performance of masculinity is usually the one who was perceived to be the most manly or confident.

When I look at my father and grandfather I see this very thing and I can see why because they come from a different generation and we're taught that emoting or expressing their feelings was weak and even then that still a very slim thing that they do

I have stood up tons of people and I have stated my opinion that many people did not expect of me because they already perceived me to be a crazy manly man

Which I find very enlightening being in this weird position because you see how people's desires really are and it's crazy how they line up in real life

I've had girls and ex-girlfriends who did not like me because of whatever trade and yet the same traits I have, other women found them to be desirable

So I ask myself which is true. Does a man have to reach this arbitrary level of confidence or the perception of confidence to be successful or do they need to just find someone compatible

My ex-girlfriend's definition of confidence will most likely be for a guy to completely Master what she believes to be what a man should be. Which is ironically be seen and not heard

Why we broke up is for the fact that I am an extrovert and I can make friends with anybody and I generally don't care if someone makes fun of me or tries to misconstrue my character

But for my exit was such a big deal that she used to complain about it all the time. Looking back it wasn't my lack of confidence or social skills but it was the fact that this girl in particular was jealous of me, her boyfriend.

Ironically for having so many traits so many girls said they wish they had such as assertiveness and being outgoing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oucnta/how_do_you_tell_if_someone_is_not_confident_you/

12,oudobm,1627619177,I (26 M) have had an epiphany and have no idea what to do about it,"The only time anyone has ever informed me of why they were ghosting me, they said the following: ""you act like someone who's not single"". And I've often pondered that. I never understood it, it didn't make sense to me on account of the fact that i was in fact single, the quoted person in question notwithstanding. But I've finally figured it out.

I don't flirt. I'm not flirty. I'm shy (although i can quickly open up to people i think are cool) and oblivious, and these things result in me not flirting and not knowing how to. This doesn't make the previous quote make any more sense, (the quote implying I'm a cheater, but it's self evident that a cheater would be flirty,) but nevertheless it helped clue me in. A more likely alternative to this paranoia is that women don't think I'm interested in them... Because I'm not flirting with them!

But my inability to flirt is perfectly well founded. My dating life has seen people do things that make no sense that discourage me from trying to flirt, and further increase my confusion on flirting.

I've had girls play hard to get and then get angry at me for not chasing them. I've had girls initiate very clear and open flirting with me just to turn around and chastise me for reciprocating (ladies, I'm not invalidating your public humiliation fetish, but jeez be tactful about it). I've even had girls explicitly and in no uncertain terms request this dick, if you'll pardon the expression, but then be nowhere to be found at the time and place for the scheduled dick delivery.

So I'm kind of stuck. I'm 100% certain that if i just say flirty things as they come to mind, it'll crash and burn and fail horribly and I'll just be stuck with more rejection. But i can't exactly Google ""how do flirt"" because that just sounds like a tailor made recipe for womanizer cringe. So what do? I don't know, but for anyone reading this struggling with getting ghosted, consider it a possible explanation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oudobm/i_26_m_have_had_an_epiphany_and_have_no_idea_what/

(No offence to the other guys i ever asked out but this guy is just something else haha)
We don't know each other, we are just in the same uni year and i accidentally contacted him about some tasks and found out he was the wrong person.
Then i looked at his pic and was like damn. Such a hottie. 
I initiated a small talk about which vaccine he has gotten (in our country its the turn of 18-25 year olds to get their jabs) and now i texted hey i want to know whether you are available and interested to get to know each other better because i find you really cute!
Idk folks😂 if nothing comes out of it (99,9% sure of that) at least it will make his day i hope.

Because I am transgender and a AMAB a person's sexual orientation also comes into play as well as their childhood up bringing.

Another factor I have to take into account is the fact that assault and homicide are very real thing with transgenders.

46,ougowj,1627633751,"So, it finally came to this ...","Yeah, I have finally lost all my hopes in dating, more so for the Online aspect. I'm going to be completely honest here, after my horrible relationship of 6 months have ended, I have decided to sign up on as many dating apps as possible after I had break for a few months to clear up my head and be ready to date again. I registered on them dating apps around a month or three ago, can't remember exactly as I didn't count the days.

Anyway, I have quickly became overwhelmed and that made me feel very exhausted on the first day as I tried to actively find someone for a serious long term relationship. Obviously having multiple apps would help to maximize the efforts of finding someone. At the end I have sticked with an app that I have paid for a full year and had decent success there but it was still crappy. I still used other apps but less often. 

Online dating is like winning a lottery, you have 0.000001% of finding someone. I have experienced a lot of cut contact, women taking days if not weeks to reply to the conversation after we have exchanged numbers and setting a date on specific day, women reading my messages but not even replying, bailing out when it came to exchanging numbers or 2 weeks of chatting and planning to meet up after I bought the tickets for activity then for that or another reason not being compatible and just cancelling the date altogether.

It's all just a damn mess. Another thing is that them dating apps keep you hooked despite feeling hopeless or bad about yourself via notifications that bring a dopamine hit at first but then it goes away. Whether or not the said profiles are fake is a discussion for another time.

What I noticed over time with using a dating apps was that my confidence was shattered more and more to the brink making me feel ""What the fuck is wrong with me ?"" and affecting my mindset in a negative way. I also noticed that many profiles says they look for this or that type of person but that's just not the case for some reason.

They will write stuff like looking for a caring, funny and tall guy but they don't even check your messages or reply to you. My bio wasn't an issue as I had put a lot of effort into it and it highlited that I'm looking for a serious relationship and other things about me. Some of the apps were horrid, with women having a list of demands that no one can meet lol.

The whole online dating experience left me in a negative space and recently I have finally removed all my profiles and dating apps from my smartphone altogether including the paid one because having premium and solid bio apparently doesn't show that I'm willing to commit and being serious about it all 🙄 🙄. After all that was done, I'm slowly feeling better about myself and decided to transfer my wasted time and money from dating apps into my hobbies or other more important things in my life. 

Nearly all of my relationships started online then became formed in the real life. This is because I'm introverted and nerdy guy who have a shit dating\\love life and not being able to approach women in person to ask them out. I tried once and I was misread by the other person. This also makes me a late bloomer as I lost my virginity at 27,  BTW, I'm a straight male. 

I'm 28 at the moment and will be 30 in two years which doesn't bother me but would love to have someone on my side to form a family. I was raised old fashion way and I value the things that are old school, unfortunately not many people are left like that nowadays.

The only date I had offline was with that one woman who I knew was interested in me as her signals were sticking out like a blinding lights so I asked her out and went on a date with her. At the end she told me that she was looking for a guy with a house and I noticed during the date that the moment she knew I didn't had a house, her interest quickly dropped 🙄 🙄.

I would love to be in a committed relationship as I like to care for the person I'm with, have fun toghether and make them smile besides just having sex. I'm not the type of guy who is only after sex as I love a lot of hugs, doing things together like playing board games etc. There is more on the surface then just sex here.

For me it was so refreshing and fun being in a relationship after years upon years of being single so now I need to once again switch my mindest into the single mode and move on with my life. My whole dating experience altogether is horrible and can't find someone let alone a date so fuck it, I'm going fully AWOL and if I meet the right person in real life that's fine, if I end up alone till the end of my days, I fine with this also. 🤷‍🤷‍🤷‍🤷‍

When I meet someone and have a good relationship, I might post my success story on this sub if I don't forget 😅😅😅😅.

I'll meet someone, get along and go on a date. That person is beautiful, fun to talk to, similar hobbies, overall a decent human being and after the first date or a few dates, they will confess that they want to take it to the next level so a relationship.

My problem. I have a great time with my date, but I treat them like I would a close friend. I don't feel butterflies or a spark from me to them. I don't feel nervous on the first date, it's just like hanging out to me. 

They'll confess, some will try to get sexual. And I'm just here thinking ""Is this normal? How can they feel that way towards me after a few dates?"" I don't feel 'Love' towards them so I don't actively pursue and I'm not interested in hooking up. But should I? Should I just go by 'Lust at first sight?' It doesn't seem right to me, for sure getting intimate will strengthen the bond, but what bond is there if you've only talked to eachother for a little bit?

When they confess to me, is it really love? How can they say it so fast? How do they catch feelings so quickly? Why can't I? They're wonderful people :(

70,oujugu,1627648905,Took a big leap of faith and it has worked out,"TLDR at bottom and sorry if formatting is bad this is my first long post on reddit

So I(22M) was in a workshop for one of my Uni classes and got put in a 4 person group with a girl that turned out to be quite nice, I wanted to get her number after class but she left early (Probably wouldn't have managed to do it anyway) I made sure to make a note of her name, so when I got home I looked up the class list on my Uni's site and the only contact method I could find was an email, So what do I do, I take what feels like the biggest leap of faith to this day, I try to keep it short but sweet (I guess)

&gt;**Subject:** Hey, It's B from the workshop  
&gt;  
&gt;**Message:** Hey H it was nice to meet you today, You seem like a pretty cool person, anyway I was just wondering if you would like to grab a drink some time as I would like to get to know you, If that is something you would be interested in feel free to chuck me a text on \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cheers B

Now I sent the email fairly late so I didn't expect to get a response that night but I still end up going to bed thinking what have I done I hope that doesn't come off too creepy

So the morning after rolls round and my phone goes off and to my surprise its H

&gt;Hey B :)  
&gt;  
&gt;Just H here.  
&gt;  
&gt;How are you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your email you seem like a cool guy I would love to catch up for a drink or something :)

I send her off a message an hour later and didn't get a response till later in the day, and after that we bounce messages back and forth for the rest of the night, It was great, I felt such a good connection and not a dry moment of texting.

Next day rolls around and we are finalizing the details of the meetup, at this point I am unsure of what sort of a meetup this is so I fire off another leap of faith message

&gt;Umm is this just a normal meet up or is it a date, I'm happy with either just want to get on the same page?

To which she replies ""What would you like it to be?"" I didn't want to come off the wrong way so I was thinking about what to say but before I could reply she wrote back ""Let's just call it a date. :)"", That is absolutely what I was hoping for, We have a bit of a laugh about it and finalize when and were to have the Date(OMG I still can't believe it)

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have to wait till next Wednesday rolls around and I guess if this post gets a bit of traction I can post an update

I matched with a gal and we had one back and forth (I asked a question, she replied, and then I replied to her) before she stopped talking.  I waited and she didn't post anything new, so after a few days I asked how her day was going and got no response.  So after a few more days I cracked a joke about ghosting and told her it was nice meeting her but we just don't seem to be clicking.

She then responded that she doesn't use the app much, and said that I didn't ask to move it to another app so that's why it doesn't seem like we're clicking.  I responded saying that if she didn't respond to my second message then it didn't see like she was interested.  She said I assumed too much and gave me a ""good luck buddy"" before unmatching.

**The Question:**  I've always thought that you should have a couple back and forths (minimum 5-6) before you decide to move over to different social media or exchange numbers.  Am I wrong in thinking this?  I just assumed she wasn't interested and even though she doesn't ""use the app much"" she should still get a notification when I reply (hence her responding so much to my ghosting joke).

73,oukg11,1627651150,Protip: Stop trying to solve their problems. Just let them vent and acknowledge their frustration.,"TL;DR: They just want to vent to you. You don't need to solve their problem; just listen, acknowledge their frustration and let them vent it out. 


Everybody in the world loves to vent. We are all going through SOMETHING that is stressful in this crazy world, and it is a great feeling when you can just vent all of your frustrations to someone you can trust.

Whether it's drama happening at work, an exam coming up that is stressing them out, a best friend isn't texting them back about their dinner date coming up soon, the pancakes were a little overcooked in the morning... we all have little itches of things that piss us off and we wanna vent to someone about.

The problem for me was that I was always trying to solve the problem that they were having, when really they just wanted someone to vent to about it.



They don't want you to solve their pancake problem, they just want to vent about it.


Don't say:

""Well then maybe next time you should try and turn the burners down a bit so your pancakes don't burn."" 


Say:

""Damn that fucking sucks, burnt pancakes are the worst.""



Pancakes are obviously a filler, but the same goes for any frustration they might be having. A lot of the silly problems in our lives don't really matter that much in the long run, such as our pancakes being a little overcooked or that exam that (once written) will not matter anymore.

So stop trying to solve your SOs problems and just let them get their stress out! Show them that you understand their displeasure, acknowledge that it does suck, and then give them a bear hug to get their mind off of that silly problem. Or suggest that you make pancakes together that weekend or go out to that diner you love.

Problem-solving is a great ability to have in the context of work and for conflict, but we don't need to try and solve ALL of our SO's problems if all they want to do is vent about it. If they really want help with something, it will be in the form of a question and not in the form of a rant. 



All they want is for you to do is listen, acknowledge what they are going through, and get it off their mind. Not for your dumbass to fix their silly pancake problem.


Listen. Acknowledge. Bear Hug.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oukg11/protip_stop_trying_to_solve_their_problems_just/

She‘s a girl from my old class (I dropped out because of my bad mental health) and last year she asked me through WhatsApp how I was doing. I read her message that same day but never answered. I felt really bad because of this so a few days ago I decided to write her an apology although it had already been over a year since she wrote me. She told me I didn‘t have to apologise because she knew that I was doing badly mentally but she also said that she thinks it‘s really nice of me. I then proceeded to tell her that I got diagnosed with Aspergers and that I struggle with making friends and she said that she can relate at least a little bit because she has really bad social anxiety. We talked about music and other stuff and she also told me that she‘s always thought that I was very nice and empathic :) She also told me that she often prefers the company of animals as she has problems with other people because of her social anxiety. She‘s really cute, nice and empathic and she has a very calm and introverted temper which I really like. She also has a pretty smile. I definitely have a crush on her and she sent me a message in which she said that she usually doesn‘t talk much but sometimes she does with people she feels comfortable with and she sent this ;) emoji in the same sentence. I think she might be interested but I‘m always very careful and don‘t want to come across as intrusive or hurt her feelings (obviously). So I wrote that I‘m the same with people I like and sent this ;) emoji as well. I also wrote that I’ve always found her really nice and that I’ve always liked her calm nature. I thought that was appropriate in this context as she already told me she thinks I’m nice and she likes talking to me. Do you think that this is a good reply? Do you believe she might be interested in a romantic way (I definitely am 😅)? How could I possibly find out whether she‘s seriously interested in me?

People they can go on dates with do romantic things with and have sex with but without  feelings, a label or exclusity.
Especially the no feelings part confuses me because why would you wanna do romantic stuff with a person  you don't want to or have feelings for?
Don't feelings develop over time if the person is your type and  you treat that person like you would tread a girlfriend?

I started talking to them at the same time on dating apps, but physically seeing Mr A sooner than Mr B. 
Mr A and I have been on 4 dates but haven’t had sex yet. I am getting the impression that he thinks that we’re exclusive, which I am very open to however, anytime I try and ask him he gives me weird answers- such as last time he told me that he just didn’t want kids or he simply shushed me in a jokey way when I asked him if he was seeing anyone else. So I get the impression that he thinks we’re exclusive but I’m not certain.
This wouldn’t be an issue but my conscience is catching up to me, as Mr B and I who have decided that we should be FWBs since we seem to be very sexually compatible. Mr B knows that I’m seeing Mr A but Mr A doesn’t know about Mr B. Mr B is also seeing other people.
My dilemma is that Mr A is out of town so I can’t confirm that he wants to be exclusive (since he won’t have access to his phone either), at the same time Mr B will be in town and we have plans to hook up. 
Do I tell Mr B that I suspect that I’ve given Mr A the impression that we’re exclusive? Do I still go through with hooking up with Mr B?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oult0t/moral_dating_dilemma/

90,oumvza,1627659201,Did I make the right decision ending things with this guy/vent sort of,"So me and this guy (both 22) went on 4 dates. We met on tinder. No sex was involved, only oral on 2 dates. We both live at home and weren't able to really just spend a night in so there were no real opportunities to have full on intercourse (which is important to me in a relationship as well), and I did have feelings for this guy, still maybe do. But he talked a lot, which is fine, but I realized when I got a chance to talk, I didn't know what to talk about that he can relate to that will lead into a greater conversation. We don't seem to share any real major interests and we seem to lead pretty different lifestyles, which is a problem for me. I'm pretty much a type A personality and he doesn't seem to be. He drinks regularly, I don't. He smokes weed regularly, I don't (used to pretty heavily, which might be why its sort of bothering me). He likes the nightlife, I sort of do but I'm more a people watcher, not someone who likes to really be part of the action. And that's not to say type A and type B personalities can't get along (they 100% can) but I'm very dedicated to academics right now and plan on being dedicated to it probably throughout my 20s if not beyond, and he doesn't seem to show interest in that which is fine! Its not everyone's thing. But the type of relationship I'm looking for is someone who can relate to that as well... 

I know there was lust there, but I'm not even fully convinced he was starting to like me for my personality or just because he was attracted to me. He also seemed to have some hang ups about his last girlfriend from a few years ago and was really comfortable talking about the different girls he hooked up with after she dumped him and I kinda got the impression he hasn't been in a serious relationship since her. I don't think he's a bad person by any stretch of the imagination, and overall I liked spending time with him, but I think I realized during those little moments of silence that I felt like there was nothing for me to talk about that would've elicited a response other than, ""Oh, yeah."" Our most ""lively"" conversations were about sex. I guess its hard because he genuinely was/is a nice person, but I didn't wanna keep him in this longer than necessary if I wasn't 100% sure about it. And I think now is a better time than 3 months from now when realer feelings might be involved and then one or both of us realize there's no ""glue"" to keep the relationship together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oumvza/did_i_make_the_right_decision_ending_things_with/

Ghsv1 is extremely common it's probably the most post I see about on the herpes forum. Also, do people whom don't want to date someone with herpes ask a potential partner prior to kissing them if they have ohsv1?

I'm also curious as I saw comments saying I get tested and I'm clean, having an sti doesn't make you dirty or clean but that's a whole different topic so my question do you get tested for the herpes antibodies? Because standard sti testing doesn't check for herpes and if you had example come back positive for hsv1 how would you determine if it's the oral region or gential region. Also, given how many people are asymptomatic do you just trust someone whom says they don't have herpes? I'm just curious as to the knowledge of those who don't have herpes know about how the virus truly works for when I disclose and navigate dating myself.
