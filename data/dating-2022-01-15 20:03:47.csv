4,s50xe9,1642299456,i need help,"so i’m 16, my gf is 16, we’ve been together for almost a year. Last night i learned that while she told me she was with her friends, she was actually out drunk with a guy that she likes, i found messages saying she wanted to kiss him and her friends hate me so they wanted her to fuck him and cheat on me and break up with me, all while i thought she was just at their house. This isn’t the first time this has happened, a little over a week ago she told me she was hanging out with a friend from her old school, only to find out that she was with this same guy from last night. Obviously i was heartbroken and extremely upset. she has a history of lying and being unfaithful and making dumb choices. She also constantly chooses her friends over me and all it does it leave her sad, drunk, high, and depressed. I know the safest and most obvious answer would be to break up. i’ve thought about it and honeslty i want to, but if she doesn’t have me, she’d only rely on her friends, she has so much potential, she’s smart, has state officer roles in her clubs at school. with her relying on her friends all she would turn into a druggie and would lose everything. I love her so much and the thought of her losing everything is so painful. i want to take a break from her but i’m so scared that while i’m on this break trying to fix myself and have trust in her again, she’s going to be fucking around and doing stuff she shouldn’t be.

5,s50ypx,1642299578,"I was in love with my best friend years ago, now she’s breaking up with her boyfriend and I’m starting to feel like she only ever kept me around all this time as her romantic ‘Plan B’","This will be a long ass post because it’s a long history lmfao.

To boil it down I met my best friend years ago now. We instantly clicked. We first met through work just after I’d finished high school and we instantly clicked. We’d constantly be around each other, joking around on shift, and I remember there was just a mutual feeling of how much we enjoyed being around each other, which we both made clear. Over time it progressed to us hanging out during college and we ended up kind of inseparable. If we weren’t hanging out we were messaging all day and I soon found out we had the exact same interests, felt the same on so many topics, she was stunning and interested in me as a person which I just wasn’t used to and before long I was head over heels. To this day I think it’s the only time I’ve ever been ‘in love’. I couldn’t stop thinking about her and could barely eat, just constant butterflies and all that shit everyone always says.

Thing is, she had a boyfriend. And so I just hid it for a long time. I saw her everyday, I spent almost every waking minute talking to her, being with her, or thinking about her, but I knew it would never happen. But I was driving myself crazy; I could barely concentrate on anything, I had to see her in college, at work, hang out with her all the time, and while I couldn’t stay away from her it hurt pretty fucking bad. I was getting down about it all and before long I left my job (I knew if things didn’t go well I couldn’t be around her everyday), and came clean about how I felt. Stupid, reckless and inconsiderate, but I was stupid and had never felt like this, and I was so sure she felt the same, there were loads of little signs that I’ve long since decided I just read too much into because I wasn’t used to being this close with anyone, let alone someone I was attracted to. She told me she didn’t feel the same, her and her boyfriend stayed together, and we took a break from speaking for a while. 

Eventually a few months later she reached out because her and her boyfriend were breaking up and she realised she ‘needed me in her life. So we reconnected, I briefly thought for a week or two based off that that she might have decided to leave him and had thought about being with me, but they ended up staying together. Looking back I think that was maybe foreshadowing how things are now. Since then though, for around 4 years, we’ve been great friends again. There’s been a respectable distance; we rarely hang out in real life at all, just message everyday, but we’re still very much in each other lives and always have been since. Over time I managed to get over her and I was proud we kept the friendship going after all of that, I knew after that we’d be life-long friends. Since then I’ve very much got over her; I see her faults like you do with any friend, I call her out on her bullshit, she does the same to me, and it’s so much more relaxed. I still never wanted to be so intense with her again, but I think that was an unspoken mutual agreement with us, I think we both realised we couldn’t hang out constantly like before while she was in a relationship. I’d said what I’d said and it would never be the same; we’ve never really talked about it since it happened, but it’s always there, the big elephant in the middle of the room keeping a distance between us. Now I look back on that whole thing kind of fondly without all the emotions attached as anyone would looking back on being very young and feeling like that for the first time. But it’s not really something I dwell on anymore much at all.

Anyway, since then I’ve had nothing but a string of unrequited crushes and tinder matches, and she stayed with her boyfriend.  I’ve had terrible luck in dating for a variety of reasons (mainly mental health shit that makes me too anxious to do it lmfao), so now I’m 22 and still never been in a relationship or even had sex. Recently, her and her boyfriend have hit a wall. She told me he’s barely making any effort at all, it feels like they have nothing to talk about and the interest and spark is gone, all that stuff that happens when the initial fire fades in a relationship. I keep telling her I think they’ll be fine, but she seems to have emotionally checked out of it all already.

Anyway, tonight she was messaging me about it and she kept saying over and over how she’s been thinking a lot about how she can have such a shitty time with him but have so much fun talking to me, how she doesn’t know why she’s staying with him when she knows there’s ‘other people’ who will treat her how she wants to be treated, how it feels so much easier just talking to me and how I have no idea how grateful she is I’m in her life, etc. 

That obviously means a lot, but it feels like she’s making insanely obvious hints that she’s been weighing up how things might have been with me instead. I’ve just pretended not to notice that side of it and comforted her about her boyfriend instead, but I don’t feel good about that for some reason. I spent so long getting over her, I truly value the friendship above anything and while I care for her a lot, I don’t think I have any romantic feelings at all left. And yet the way she’s talking it’s like I was there as some kind of back up and now that things aren’t working with her boyfriend she’s like happy she’s got other options such as me?

I don’t know man. I made myself get over her and was always sure to never approach that whole topic again out of respect and for the sake of our friendship, and now it feels like she’s just trying to dredge all that back up and complicating things for no real reason. I just don’t feel good about it for some reason. I feel like she’s seen me as some lovesick idiot who was just gonna wait around for years until she got bored of her boyfriend and decided to ‘settle’ for me, and that was never the case; in my eyes it was clear from 4 years ago onwards that all we’d ever be is friends. I’m happy with that and I don’t think I’d want to change it now despite all that happened in the past. I just hate thinking this whole time my best friend just kept me around as a romantic backup for years on end when we worked so hard at our friendship for so long and made it work. I just don’t know how to feel really, it’s just brought back a lot of emotions that likely went unresolved and so I’m probably being dramatic. Maybe a small part of me never fully got over it and it’s just woke up at the first sign of interest from her, and it’s made me feel pathetic for thinking it was ever otherwise. I don’t know what I feel now. 

And I don’t want to be unfair to her either. She’s vulnerable right now, she doesn’t know what to think and she’s on the verge of losing someone who’s been the biggest part of her life as long as I have known her. I get she might say things she doesn’t necessarily mean. So, to end this ramble I’ll ask: how should I deal with this? I feel like I just don’t know what to feel about this situation or the friendship now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s50ypx/i_was_in_love_with_my_best_friend_years_ago_now/
6,s513ip,1642299984,Weight while dating &amp; giving up,"So im a 27 yo female, im 5’5 and sit at about 255lbs currently. 3 years ago i was at my highest of 325 and then got to a low of 230 and I’ve crept back up to 255. I’m working on losing again and its just been such a slow annoying process.

So I say all this because im no idiot, i know my weight will pretty much cut the amount of men that would be interested in me in half if not 1/3 and those that do swipe right on me are just… lets just say not my type. 

Despite my weight I still pull interest because I’m pretty in the face, confident, dress well, feminine, etc. However, lately dating has gotten so difficult. It just feels like there’s nothing out there. Not to mention, working from home I get like no socialization. But now im wondering if all the positive attributes aren’t enough in comparison to my weight since I’m not having much luck anymore.

I guess the point of this post is.. is it just me? Like am i the only one that’s struggling to match or connect with anyone?? Also, advice? Losing weight is one thing im working on but its been a difficult and slow process. Im just at the point where i feel like throwing in the towel altogether. Even though, im at a point in my life where I’d love to settle down and craving companionship.

10,s518rk,1642300406,Ex fwb added me back,"7 months ago she said she wanted to stop seeing me and then went back to her ex after 2 weeks. I told her before she removed me that we should get back together and how I felt ( I didn’t tell her I liked her) she proceeded to tell me she’s back with her ex and sent me a photo of them in bed, that photo changed my life mainly for the better since I took gym more seriously, went to uni, got a job and I’m still improving aspects of me but I can’t help but think about her all the time. Everything reminds me of her. 

Last week I found out she ended things with me because I was awkward and quite which she’s wasn’t wrong, I was but that guy is gone I have more experience, I’m a changed man. 

I know she’s still seeing the other guy but she added me back on discord after I removed her 6 months ago (because she removed me off Snapchat). It’s been a week and she hasn’t said anything to me. I did text her but deleted it because I didn’t feel like I had the right to message her first.


If she did message me I would tell her I’m not the same guy I use to be and I’m sorry I was awkward and quite, that I was hurt by the photos she sent of her and her man. That I think about her everyday and no other women I’ve been with since could compare to her. I loved her work ethic, her grind and determination to do well in life, she was beautiful and smart and didn’t give a shit about what anyone thought of her. I miss her and I’m finding it hard to move on now more than ever.

Sometimes if I feel unmotivated I remind myself of that photo she sent and she’s probably out with someone else rather than with me but this is only short term motivation and I end up breaking down and crying eventually from exhaustion. 

I just wanted to share this, I also did bring up some of those points to my therapist :)

We’ve gone on 5 dates at this point. in one of the first few dates she brought up that she was in a long term relationship that lasted 2.5 years and now she’s looking long-term. she has an expectation of having kids in her mid-late twenties and she’s very career focused. she’s asked me a lot of questions about my love language, mbti, personality traits, basically wants to know everything about me to see if it matches with what she’s looking for in a long term partner. she worked as a waitress when she was 15 while i got my first job when i was around 20. i feel like shes so much more ahead of me in life.. long term relationship, working for many years before. ive never been in a relationship before but i like her. we’ve had sex a few times now, and after the 4th date i asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said she liked me but she wants to wait a bit and then just see where it goes.


when we have sex she’s extremely sexually open, she knows exactly what she wants already and knows how to get herself there. she knows all kinds of different positions and isn’t afraid to tell me what she likes. she likes it pretty rough and is very confident during. ive had sex less than 10 times in my whole life, so im not very confident and i end up getting off extremely quickly.


it just feels so routine for her at this point.. she’s so much more sexually experienced than i am and i feel like i never got to have that experience where we were just exploring each other and seeing what we like when we were younger. some other guy got to experience that. 

----
in our last date she mentioned how im a nerd. compared to her ex who she said drove drunk one day and she would always skip class with him and they would just go drive somewhere. i can’t help but picture them having sex in the car every time and how this guy was the one who got to see her shyer side when she was younger and eventually he brought out her wild side. she used to drink and smoke with him, 2 things she said she doesn’t like at all anymore. 


its like she’s lived her “fun” and experimental life when she was younger with another guy and now she just wants to settle with a nice nerd that has a decent job and career prospects. i can’t help but feel like she doesn’t have that same passion or desire for me like she had for this “bad boy” ex. i just feel so angry and bitter and jealous of this other guy, i dont want to be a nice guy nerd that she just decides to settle with while the most fun she had is behind her",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s51vrx/i_cant_help_but_feel_jealous_envious_bitter_of/

31,s531gx,1642305960,2nd date timing?,"So, on Thursday I went out on a first date with a girl for coffee and I felt that it went well. We had good conversation then I dropped her off at her dorm and kissed her goodbye. The kiss wasn’t the smoothest, but I’m not worried since I texted after and we agreed on a 2nd date this upcoming Thursday (she said wednesdays and thursdays work best).

However, we have a 3 day weekend and I’m wondering if it is better to leave it or see if she wants to do something during. It feels like a week with barely any contact kills the momentum a bit, but I don’t really have much to text about (except maybe ask how her weekend was/bring up date ideas for thursday). I also don’t want to send pointless texts given we didn’t really text before the date.

Does it seem better to leave it thursday and just text about date ideas soon to bridge the gap, or do you think they’d like me asking about sooner?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s531gx/2nd_date_timing/

I find it funny/frustrating nowadays that guys I match with include in their profile that they value communication…and when I try to initiate a conversation, they never respond. I don’t think my message is off-putting. In one particular instance on Bumble, I said hi and asked about his dog since it was in all of his photos. He seemed like the kind of guy I wanted to learn more about. Sadly, I didn’t hear back. Why match in the first place if you don’t even respond at all? Is it validation that people find you attractive? Mindless “swiping?” I’ll never understand it, I suppose. It’s sad when a potential connection just disappears. Where’s the communication??

Thing is, I genuinely value good communication. I learned its importance while growing up and through years of therapy as an adult, aaaaand I studied it in college. Yeah, I’m a comm nerd lol. So, if you’re going to include in a dating profile that “communication” is very important to you, then why must it be so difficult to follow through with it…?  *sigh* I guess I’ll eventually accept the fact that I’m not cut out for online dating.

51,s557m8,1642313206,How do you deal with the guilt of hurting someone you love?,"I'm a 16 year old female and I just broke up with my boyfriend of one year. One reason we broke things off was because we are both graduating and moving away in about 5 months. But the main reason is that I really hurt him. 

I cheated on him after we had to do long distance over over the summer (it was with a girl and it was platonic but that's no excuse). I told him and he was really heartbroken because he had always treated me so well. This was the start of the deterioration of our relationship. Eventually cheated on me too some months later. This led to our initial breakup and I went to his friend for advice. I told his friend that I didn't want my bf to be happy and I wanted to get him back for everything (I didn't mean this, I was just upset because of the break up).

Anyways, my bf and I got back together some days later and we promised to be completely honest with each other so that things could work better. I would often lie to him because I was scared that he'd be hurt if I were honest all the time. This completely broke his trust. This along with the fact that I talked to his friend when we first broke up made my bf uncomfortable. 

We ended on good terms because I think we both still love each other but we know we can't fix things especially with graduation coming. We agreed that we'll be friends after some months and still talk. Should I eventually apologize and tell him about how I said I didn't want him to be happy behind his back to his friend even if I didn't mean it? Or should I just leave that in the past? I'm just worried his friend will bring it up and it'll make me bf trust me even less as a person. 

I wanted to fix things and do long distance eventually but I know that I've hurt him too much for him to want that. He told me that he can't stay in a ""broken"" place. I never thought I could hurt someone like this and I didn't mean to, I think I was also feeling insecure and unstable at times. Im just scared that I'll continue hurting people even when I don't intend to. I have accepted that we aren't getting back together and that I really messed up. It's just hard to live with the guilt of knowing that things could've worked out if I were different to him. I tried my best and I still really love him. I don't know why I did all of those things because I was never trying to hurt him.

60,s55tba,1642315418,Is this girl leading me on?,"So I matched with this girl on tinder about 2 weeks ago and we actually hit it off pretty quickly. What started as playful flirting basically started turning into 1000+ word texts to each other on a daily basis talking about basically everything and anything. We actually have a decent amount in common and I actually deleted the tinder app about a week in because I felt that my efforts were better spent talking to this girl. 

So because I'm on vacation we decided to do a phone call last week and it went pretty well. We talked for 2 hours and we both agreed that it flew by pretty quickly and she texted me the next day that she enjoyed the conversation. She actually even texted me to apologize for texting later in the day than usual (this will be important later).

So we continue our correspondence and I suggest that we do another call while I'm at the resort and I could show her around on facetime (I'm just staying at this resort and I don't have much to do in the evenings after the sun goes down anyways besides chill by the pool in case anyone is wondering why I am facetiming while I'm on vacation) and we decide on Monday night. She basically doesn't get back to me and the next day she apologizes for falling asleep and we reschedule for Thursday. We continue with an equally lengthy and lively correspondence over the next couple of days and she says she will text me Thursday morning on a time to facetime.

Thursday morning rolls around and I hear nothing from her. Now at this point she has bailed on me once before so I just assume that she is probably not interested. Now this actually bummed me out more than it usually would because this is the first time I have gotten this involved for this long over tinder. I haven't been using tinder for very long, but most girls I match with on there either flake early on or they are basically incompatible with me, like they show some red flags and I bail. This girl however hasn't shown any red flags and has gotten decently involved from the get go. 

So it's the afternoon now and I haven't heard anything so I just figure it's probably over and try to move on with my day. But I figure if I'm considering it over anyways, why not just send a text to see if she is still interested in doing the call? I usually wouldn't do this out of principle, but what the hell. So she responds with more apologies and says that she can't because she is having a terrible day. So I tell her alright, text me when your feeling better basically.

So she texts me yesterday with yet more apologies and that she is just not doing well right now (I did not initiate the texting) and basically we resume our 1000+ word texts (again, that she initiated). And in her first big text she starts it by apologizing again and briefly describes the tough time she is going through with her family. I say I understand and not to worry about it and that we can just call some other time if she wanted. 

Now it is at this point that I am ultimately confused because in her next 1000+ word text, she engages with everything I said except rescheduling the call. Is she just leading me on? Did I try to reinitiate the call too soon? Do I just need to give it time? Am I being a pushover? 

I like talking to this girl (obviously) and think we have a lot in common, but I don't know yet if she is the kind of girl to lead me on or if she is actually interested? Like I said, I'm used to knowing by this point whether a girl is interested or not and while she gives me many indications that she is interested, I know that her not calling me twice could mean she is not really interested and might want to string me along over text. Or she could just be going through a tough time and I need to give it time if I want to see where it goes, but then at what point do I decide that she needs to go beyond just texting? I have not been more confused talking to a girl off of this app before and could really use some sage wisdom right now lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s55tba/is_this_girl_leading_me_on/

65,s568mx,1642317042,"Been single/dating for three years since my only official relationship (lasted five years and ended when she cheated), is it normal to go this long without another official relationship? I feel like I keep hitting bad luck, but I'm not sure if I'm the problem?","So for context, I've only ever had one official relationship and I was with her from when I was 21 to 26. It ended a week before our fifth anniversary when she cheated on me. She was the second person I ever had sex with and since then (2019), the number of women I've hooked up with has increased to 18. None of them ever turned into an actual relationship. Most of them were friends with benefits, casual, or one night stands that ghosted after. The reason I bring up the amount of people I've been with is to say that I've had no problems getting dates or being with women. I guess it just always tends to fall apart when more serious feelings come along?  


Last summer, I got really close to what I wanted, an exclusive relationship with someone I love. I dated a woman who told me she loved me but then wanted an open, polyamorous relationship and I just couldn't handle it. I was heartbroken because I was looking for someone to love and who would love me back and when I finally found her, it wasn't in the way I wanted/could make work.  


I tried a few different things with people lately. I've tried backing off a bit when they are unsure of their feelings, I've tried holding off on sex but then it ended up being months without sex and that is too long for me. And now I just hooked up with someone and am unsure if they're trying to slow fade or not.  


Meanwhile, I know my ex-girlfriend has been in two or three official relationships since me, some have lasted a year or two (a friend of mine is still friends with her and she tells me about her, much to my dismay) and I can't help but compare how I feel like I'm a sloppy mess, meanwhile she cheated and is able to find people who love her.

He types a lot and we had good convo on Tinder about our studies (we share the same major). He wanted to get on Snapchat quickly, so we continued there.

He asked me about my hobbies, how long I’ve been single. I was honest and told him I haven’t been in a relationship ever, he told me he just got out of one but is open minded. I told him the same.

I thought we clicked and he said he likes I’m so open and honest and said we should meet some day, walk around the city and maybe chill at his place in the city center. I was like alright why not, although this all happened in the span of 1 hr of chatting.

**Then suddenly he asks** “btw what about being close to the other person and intimate, how do you view it”

I said “what do you mean”

“Haha sorry I should’ve elaborated, but sex. To me it’s really important haha”

I didn’t reply. I don’t see a point talking about that before we’ve even met each other or got to know each other. Also, I’ve had _horrible_ experiences earlier with guys who start talking about sex in the beginning. 

He then keeps on saying “I promise I won’t say anything dumb anymore, my bad, maybe you got it wrong I’m not into hookups it just doesn’t make sense to me to do that with someone I don’t know”

**I replied**: “I get it but I’ll have to pass on this”

He replied something again justifying how he didn’t mean it like that, and said “we had nice long conversations would be a shame not to meet”

**I didn’t reply as I already told him I don’t wanna meet him anymore**

Next morning he texts “how are you?”

I responded “I’m fine, but as I said I’ll pass on this ☺️”

I need some advice. My ex hurt me in some ways. In short: when we began with dating, she suddenly ghosted me for two weeks. Ghosting is killing, cause you don’t know what’s wrong. After those two weeks she came back with a long apology for ghosting me. I understood her and after that everything went super good.. after a year she broke up without a real reason. After that I got very mixed signals: crying because I said I didn’t want contact for some time, because I needed to heal, sending messages asking how I was doing, after some time a passive aggressive message that I didn’t show interest in her (I never ignored her, I just never initiate the contact out of self protection). After some time we had a bit contact again. She invited me to look at her new apartment. Canceled because she was ill and after that she ignored me again. Her behaviour is one big mysterie for me. My self-esteem took a hit. 

I am on tinder again to experience dating life again. I get enough matches and girls that start the convo with me. So the interest is there. But I’m scared it will happen again. I have professional help and see a psychologist. But do you have any tips?

75,s5730s,1642320472,Do I stop pursuing her?,"Hi all, so bit of background I recently went for a catch-up dinner with an old friend of mine, we’ve known each other for around 6-7 years or so but have only ever sporadically spoken over social media every now and then until our dinner a few days ago.

When we first met all those years ago I think she may have liked me, but I was quite oblivious to it and young so didn’t really pay too much attention to her or girls in general at that moment in time. 

Anyways fast-forward to now I texted her again randomly out of the blue if she wanted to catch-up in person and have a dinner to which she accepted. 

We met up, and she hugged me and we went for dinner, laughed, joked and pretty much just caught up with how each other is doing, anyways during the dinner I sort of was like thinking “damn this girl is cool funny and cute” and I believe I have developed feelings for her. We spoke about a few things and she very briefly mentioned she has a male best friend (more on this later) that she met at university. 

Come towards the end of the dinner she was adamant to split the bill but I assured her I wanted to cover it, and thus did. As she lives quite far-away from where we had dinner and it was cold and dark, so thought it’d be a nice gesture for dragging her all the way out here. (I also asked prior to the dinner if she wanted to cancel or reschedule because of the weather, but she was definitely down to meet-up) 

Moving on, end of date we get to the train station and she hugs me again, and I tell her to text me when she gets home so I know she’s safe. I then tell her I had fun, and we should definitely go out again sometime soon to which she also agrees, but it has to be after she returns from holiday (which is in a few weeks but she’s not going out before then because she doesn’t want to contract Covid). We spoke for a bit over text for a few days after the dinner but now it’s been around 5 days and she hasn’t messaged me. 

Okay so the crux is I try to message her more frequently now and sometimes the conversation flows but then it just burns and she doesn’t really seem to carry it on, and she never texts me first I’m always the one initiating conversation. In addition to this, her male best friend mentioned earlier she seems to have an Instagram account that only she follows but the accounts name has her name and I’m assuming his name in it together (I didn’t pry into who he is on our dinner), and the display picture is two Polaroid pictures of both her and some guy (which I also assume is him) at some location. 

So I guess the question is do I continue messaging her? It’s been like 5 days and she hasn’t messaged me, and with this very close best friend of hers? I’m not sure if I’m over reading into it?

77,s577ru,1642321020,advice: how to let go of your soul mate?,"
Let's call him D.

We're both 26. D and I met when we were 15 and I fell in love with him. He was my best friend,  first valentines my soul mate. We never made it ""official"" during HS. But everyone knew we were together. We shared the same HS friends and I had grown up with his family. My family love D. 

 D helped me through my toughest time, dealing with severe depression and anxiety. He knew all my secrets. He is perfect. I cannot find a fault. So kind, respectful a true  gentleman.

D then broke my heart when he came out as gay when we were 20. I loved him so I let him go and I moved on. He was my first heartbreak. I met my current boyfriend  (K) a few months later in a different country (at 20). 

One year into my relationship with K, D says that he is no longer interested in men. I didn't want to pursue him again after having my heart broken. I just wanted to be friends.

Four years ago I moved away from our hometown to a big city. and lost contact of D (I deleted social media because of bullying). I would still meet up with his family when I went back for holidays. I asked our HS friends about him but they too had not seen him in years. They said he had declined invitations to dinner.

Fast forward to today. I recently got social media and reconnected with D. He made the first move to message me and I agreed to meet up with D when I visited our hometown (without K). I spent 3 weeks reconnecting with D and our close HS friends (It was like we never parted).

Our HS friends were surprised that D accepted the invitation to dinner and turned up. He told them (during dinner) that he had only come because of me. D looked upset when he heard that I was still with K. D asked if K was the reason I deleted social media (it was not). D asked me if I would move back to our hometown. I told D that I loved our hometown but there was no career opportunity for me. 

D and I were talking about a mutual friend cheating and  D said that it's okay (cheating) as long as you treat your SO well. (I don't share this view).

D told me that he has not dated for the past 4 years. I asked if he had any intentions of dating other people but he said no. He had dinner with my family the last night of my visit to our hometown. He won their hearts over. I cried when we said goodbye that night. 

I love the sky at sunrise and sunset but I could only see sunsets because i am not a morning person (we both are not).  The morning of my flight he sends me picture of the sunrise. I cried all day. I felt like I was leaving my heart behind. 

I still have feelings for D. I have being trying to repress it since he broke my heart. 

I don't know if I'm reading into these recent interactions from the 3 weeks with D.

we texted in between all seemed good we had another call I tend to have a monotone/flatline voice which she noted came across as disinterest. I just lead a boring life so I do not have much to say.

Being treated like a commodity gets really old.

I’m in my early 30s and not perhaps not deemed the most top ten attractive but certainly average. I’ve never had a hard time getting a date except from people I want dates with.

I was told maybe my standard was too high (my only standard is that I’m also attracted to the person). So I dated people that choose me and I adapted to them. They wanted me after all. As you may guess it never lasted because I did not like them.

The few ones I did like treated me like trash. And got rid of me when they found someone better.

So last night we were planning on meeting up after work. I called him and text him and he wasn’t responding. He finally responded and said his car had been broken into and was dealing with it. Didn’t hit me up or tell me what was going on at all. I was waiting around hoping to hear from him. 
I text him today saying hey hope you’re ok but i feel hurt that you blew me off. 
He told me he was really upset and I said i understand let me know if you need anything. He didn’t respond. 
I feel stupid and confused. Can’t tell if i’m overreacting. I just like him so I feel rejected.  
Advice please!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s590ar/given_the_cold_shoulder/
96,s590cp,1642328524,Interested in dating,"Hi I'm 26M looking for a serious relationship lately it has been a struggle to just date someone compatible and caring. Although I'm not looking to make this a dating profile but I believe I can offer myself as I'm genuine, kind, open-minded, trustworthy, loyal, and loving. Looking for someone who I can compliment and admire not perfect but who is just wanting to see what's out there",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s590cp/interested_in_dating/
97,s59551,1642329074,"Very Frustrated - Need Advice, Bad [20M]","I haven't had the best experience with relationships the past few years and since August of last year a sudden desire to get into a relationship with someone and/or have sex is driving me absolutely fucking insane and is genuinely causing me depression and anxiety in public at this point. I can't stop thinking about sex or looking at random women. Most days I become very agitated and depressed, when I feel mostly neutral about other aspects of my life.

People talking about sex while I am distracted also spirals me back into it. People in happy relationships are also upsetting me and talking about their great sex lives. Please shut the fuck up, etc. Sex is everywhere and its importance and relationships is constantly being drilled into us, and for whatever reason this sort of thing is causing me major distress at the moment.

I am making an effort to get out more and improve my anxiety and looks and confidence but I don't think that I am very attractive, though I do put some effort into making myself presentable. I also recently got friendzoned for the first time by someone that I really like and that has upset me a lot and made things worse.

I am suffering physical issues now aswell.

I have not recieved any helpful advice on this issue and am not sure what to turn toward. Ideally the best solution is that I find a sexual partner, but I don't know where to look or how to do that, and honestly perhaps some help mentally dealing with the issue is the best thing to do.

Advice very much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s59551/very_frustrated_need_advice_bad_20m/
