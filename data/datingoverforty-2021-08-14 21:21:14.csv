I can manage being alone and practice a lot of self care. Meditation, exercise, etc. When I am in a relationship I do put a lot of energy into it. Now that I have been single a few months after a very toxic, intense and hurtful relationship of only 4 months, I‚Äôve been active on OLD quite a bit. Frankly I am a bit exhausted.

I have no problem getting matches and setting up dates. But I find that in many cases I do not feel any physical attraction and pursuing further becomes pointless. A lot of women will post filtered pics, older pics or simply very flattering pics that do not reflect reality. 

The few women that I have felt attracted to in person are not attracted to me or I see red flags very soon (very sensitive to those now).

7,p4tg50,1629034264,Are men or women more possessive of their partners?,"I realize there are no definitive answers to this but I was wondering what people's opinions are.

Movies often portray men as being more possessive, but I have often found the girlfriends in the past often become insecure and want regular check ins about my where abouts. And often ask lots of questions, investigatively about my movements of the nights out with friends. It often gives me a ""being watched"" feeling.

I know often things like this can be in a persons head and it just could be me projecting some kind of insecurity but I feel like I have a reasonable amount of self awareness and that it's probably not the case. Although i would not be the best to judge.

8,p4tpg5,1629035263,How to proceed with separated man: Let him go or be patient?,"Despite warnings from friends and my own common sense, I've gotten involved with a separated man (47m). He has been separated for over a year, but continued to live in the same house as his wife to take care of their young children.

We started dating in late June and saw each other frequently for a few weeks, but then we were both traveling. We texted and talked on the phone, both excited to see each other again. When we returned in early August, we had an amazing weekend together. I began catching feelings. 

But the following week, he and his wife had to pack to move out of the house. She had to decided to move herself and the kids an hour away; he was planning to stay nearby. However, his living situation fell through (not due to finances) and he was undecided about the best path forward. For now, he has moved his things into storage and went to stay with friends near his kids' new house, to help them adjust. He's also been dealing with a lot of emotions - about leaving his long-time house, not living with his children, not having a place to live yet, etc. In essence, he is a mess and his life is a mess right now. 

I last saw him the evening before his move (into storage). We texted briefly once a few days ago. Otherwise, we haven't been in contact. I don't want to overwhelm him or add to his stress/emotional burden, but I also feel like I need more communication than this. I don't feel like a text every day or so is that difficult. But I also have never been in this situation.

I like him a lot and we connect so well physically and mentally, but I am torn because his life is so messy and complicated right now.

I hope to get some advice on whether I should be patient, wait a few weeks to see he can start sorting himself out, or just text/call him to say this isn't working for me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p4tpg5/how_to_proceed_with_separated_man_let_him_go_or/

10,p4x3bk,1629046332,Long Distance - How does it affect the relationship?,"So first an update for those who may care, Surfer Boy and I are back together and going to try to make it work. This time with better boundaries around topics of discussion and ranting, and trusting that the other person will say when they need to ‚Äútap out‚Äù of a convo. Honestly, so far it‚Äôs been even better than before.
Something that has come up in my head about us though, we‚Äôre technically long distance. It is only a 90 minute drive but that could still be significant to shape the relationship I think? There‚Äôs a few other factors as well. 

So what I‚Äôm wondering is:

How has the long distance affected relationships you‚Äôve had? Or if you haven‚Äôt had one, would you? A 90 minute drive away is significant enough that it disrupts normal life. I have to get someone to feed my cat. I can work remotely but I am still ‚Äúgoing out of town‚Äù when I go see him. 

Some back story: My ex fianc√© and I did long distance the first two years we were together. He also happened to be a 90 minute drive away. We were both about 25, both in school, and we‚Äôd switch off weekends to go see the other. Yes we were both way younger, but I‚Äôm still convinced that it allowed us to completely miss/ignore some key compatibility issues. Namely his level of introversion and my level of extroversion. I stopped having friends bc I was always with him or out of town with him. And you can‚Äôt very well do the living together ‚Äútest‚Äù by essentially staying at each others‚Äô houses often - but still getting to live your life. You‚Äôre basically in vacation mode every time you see them. I feel as though I haven‚Äôt dated anyone I‚Äôve been this into since him (besides surfer boy), who also lived relatively close to me. (The why of that is a whole other post entirely lol‚Ä¶)

So, can long distance give you a false sense of compatibility? Even at this age with this amount of wisdom and experience?

or 

""Afternoon!  So, you seem to be an interesting person who's on the go.  What's the most fun thing you've done in the past four weeks?""

My ex husband was the only man i knew, so getting into dating is such a struggle. I took some friends advice and used dating apps. However, my pool of people is very small because im looking for someone with the same cultural background &amp; values. I find one who seems ok. Im a kind of person who never cared about looks. His profile was pkay and he is 44, i thought great.
I liked his profile amd things got rolling. That started in April 2021.
Thing is , i never had a normal relationship in my life, i do not know what is the norm. The first time we met the chemistry was instant and mutual. He has 3 kids and lives 30 miles away, so meeting frequently isn‚Äôt easy.
Suddenly he started to pull away. I noticed that im the one initiating communication almost all the time, im the one who asks to meet. One day I didn‚Äôt text and thought I‚Äôd wait and see‚Ä¶‚Ä¶one week went by, he sent one text. Then another 2 weeks went by and nothing. I send a casual ‚Äúhi‚Äù, he replies telling me that he jad his kids the past couple of weeks and they were away‚Ä¶etc (although i never asked). Then things got rolling again, but only if i reach out.
He told me he is an extremely indecisive person.

It feels genuine when we meet or talk. So im kinda baffled. Is he interested or is he ghosting me?

17,p53rtd,1629068343,The Single Most Attractive Trait in a Person,"Picture young children dancing to music in a public place. The children often act spontaneously, freely, and without fear of judgement. The child's mind is fully in the present moment as he expresses his true honest feelings. Seeing such a child's performance most likely left you with a positive feeling inside.

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, many of us lose the ability to express ourselves as freely as we once did. However, deep down inside we all still yearn for the freedom that the child embodies and for his unbridled spirit.

In a world where most are bound by rules and restrictions, there is nothing more attractive than a person who retains the ability to act freely with unapologetic authenticity.

I‚Äôve known this man through a previous work connection, and in the periphery for the last 10 years or so. He was hired on at the firm I work for in January. 

We both have maintained as view of not dating people you work with for our entire professional careers. This is not something either of us will take lightly. 

While I think there has always been an attraction, we never acted upon it until a little over a week ago. We were hanging out after work and we just kissed. It just happened‚Ä¶kind of out of nowhere. And then the floodgates opened. We‚Äôve both been having feelings for each other for a while and just let it come out. 

I haven‚Äôt slept with him, and I‚Äôm not sure if I will anytime soon‚Ä¶even though it‚Äôs been a long dry spell for me and there is definite chemistry haha. 

The thing is‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been dating for about 3 years now since my divorce. I‚Äôve not found any guy I could see a real ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù material‚Ä¶someone who makes me feel smitten but also who is mature, and smart, and has their shit together. 

We‚Äôre so compatible on so many levels. We make equivalent income, are both very dedicated to work and family, play music, watch the same shows‚Ä¶the list goes on and on. So of course, with my shit luck, here is this amazing man on a silver platter that I‚Äôm terrified of. 

Let me assure you that I am not seeking anything with a man. In fact I had recently turned off all apps because I really just don‚Äôt seem to find quality guys, and honestly I‚Äôm super happy with who I am and where I am in life. I want for nothing. But he just makes me smile and I can see a real future with him‚Ä¶but we work together. Very closely, in the same department, at a small firm. 

For now we are just taking it slow and seeing how things go. However, I feel so split on just wanting to say fuck it and just let myself feel all the feels, and also just saying we should stop now before we get ahead of ourselves. Ughhhh. I feel so torn.

Nice guy, great conversation, great company, great sex, very affectionate towards me, he has his stuff together as far as his personal situation goes, we have some (not all) of the same interests. He lives 10 minutes away (not to close not too far)‚Ä¶ I mean basically, it‚Äôs pretty awesome. We see each other every weekend and usually are so engulfed in our careers during the week that we usually just say hello every day via text or sometimes we will talk in the phone for a few hours on a weeknight. But for the most part we wait til the weekend to see each other. 

He has done very nice things for me like gone shopping before I come over to cook meals that he knows I like, offered to help with my yard work multiple times, although I haven‚Äôt taken him up on it yet, but ya know ‚Äòpartnery‚Äô things.. He has also referred to himself as my SO (still conscious of not saying boyfriend)‚Ä¶. 

All the above is fine, my frustration is that he has never spent the night. 

We talked early on about not seeing other people but that we both wanted to take it slow and build a friendship first. But it‚Äôs been almost a half year now and I‚Äôm okay will still taking it slow but despite the nice things he sometimes does for me, I‚Äôm starting to feel like we have settled into the FWB zone because of this. We get together every weekend, have great company, sex and then we do it again the next weekend. 

I‚Äôve asked him in the past to stay, but he said he didn‚Äôt leave any lights on at home and his pets (cats) are there. Last night, he was at my place til 4am and we practically fell asleep on the couch together. I asked him just to stay over but he said he wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep, so he headed home.

I definitely know he is truthful and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs me. I think he is an introverted guy who‚Äôs home is where his heart is.

An important fact, is that he is a widower of 5 years. I believe he is in a healthy place with his grief. In fact he is a mental health counselor and we have talked in depth about grief as I have lost very close loved ones as well, although not a lover. The point there is that we have spoken about it and I am not threatened or anything about his situation nor has there been any reason for me to believe that he was not ready to move forward in his dating life.  

I want to address it with him but I have also had a hard time in previous relationships with communicating openly and fairly so I am trying to really process the while situation before i mention it.

Here's the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ne7abr/to\_reach\_out\_or\_to\_not\_reach\_outwhat\_would\_you\_do/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ne7abr/to_reach_out_or_to_not_reach_outwhat_would_you_do/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Well, I wrote him a letter a few weeks back, and he responded immediately. We reconnected and there was lots of good chemistry and feelings.  We had a nice long talk and a nice long kiss, which felt amazing. Being with him felt like 'home'.

We've been spending some time together over the past week, no overnights yet b/c of our kids. Our kids were friends (that's how we met at the park) and so we had a couple play dates together plus on evening of us visiting each other alone.

We talked about making plans for this coming weekend yesterday. He knows a few places I like to go to and things I like to do.

When I arrived at his place for dinner he shared with me that he got us a weekend away plus tix to a concert for Fri and we'd stay Fri-Sunday.  I'd made plans w/a friend on Friday night and told him.

He admitted he should have asked me first, but I was SO EXCITED that a guy would go to those lengths for me.  This has not happened in a while.  I decided to ask my friend if we could post pone (no plans set in stone).  She said she had concerns about him making such elaborate plans w/out asking me.  


Then I started freaking out that maybe he's a controlling guy.  I am working on codependency and setting boundaries and thought, hmm...maybe she is right.  

so I called him and shared that I'm so grateful for his thoughtfulness but that I'd like to be included in plan making, or at least the general idea of plan making moving forward. I shared that we are still really getting to know each other and that  we need to know what each other needs in a partner.  He said okay and that it just came from a place of being excited and knowing I liked all of these things. I reafirmmed that it was not the actual plans, but the idea of just not checking w/me first.

Now I'm conflicted about my approach. I prob should have waited until I saw him in person to say this, but I didn't want to chicken out.  I start to question myself. 

So, I open it up to the good people of Reddit- 

Is it a red flag for a guy to make a weekend plan (and pay for it BTW), or could it simply be a really kind and loving gesture?  We are 'new' to dating but have known each other a year as friends who learned a lot about each other the first 6 months then didn't speak for about 6 months.

Othewise he's been honest, open with his heart and home, and cooked dinner for my son and I and his kids tonight.

He told me he loved me and wanted to marry me within a few weeks of meeting and we spent night and day together when I didn‚Äôt have my children.  We got along very well and my children adore him.  About 6 weeks ago I became sad because the reality of dating a married man consumed me - I don‚Äôt know his children or his family.   I informed him of the concerns I was having (bad timing).  He assured me he loved me and told me things would change at end of year but he was self reflecting.

44,p5rq1v,1629156144,First time dating in years - Anxiety over how to act (45F),"Hello friends! As the title states, I'm a little green when it comes to modern dating. I'm nervous but also excited about this new era. I've met someone that I think I am getting really into so now I'm in the examine everything phase of dating him. How do people feel about age gap between the man (39) and the woman (45)? I don't see it as an issue and I'm told I look around 30-35 (never sure if those comments are sincere haha) so I do vibe younger, but would this be an issue with men generally? I could ask but I don't want to seem too confrontational too soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

1st date was like a job interview but with jokes and it went well. He checks all the boxes of a decent human being that seems trustworthy, respectful, and kind. 2nd date was amazing. We had so much fun together and made out a bit. Is that too soon? It felt right and we are both very attracted to each other.   


Which leads me to feeling some anxiety over the 3rd date, which is set for this weekend. Is he going to expect sex? I think I need to mentally prepare for some boundaries in advance, as opposed to winging it like the past 2 dates. We're going to spend time at a nearby park and I'm contemplating inviting him over for dinner, but I'm also scared that may seem like an invitation to sleeping together. I'm wondering, when do people generally have sex with their dates? I don't want to start off too soon as I am leaning toward hoping for a relationship with this person and I've heard sex too early on isn't helpful for that. 

If everything goes as I hope, we'd be considering something long term together. When do you normally start bringing subjects like past relationships, what they're looking for, if they'd want to be in a relationship, feelings on marriage..

49,p5vgft,1629169523,How do I navigate this situation?,"It's possible I'm being totally oblivious, and it's also possible I'm reading too much into this. I'm not sure which.

A woman I work with (who I admit I think is inteligent, witty, and beautiful) keeps putting herself in situations where our bodies touch in some way. I am always standing still, and she always intentionally walks up to me and stands very close in such a way that bodies come in contact -- usually our upper arms. In all of these cases, there were other places for her to stand. In all of these cases other people were present. On two of these occasions she lightly bumped into me from behind, and I never saw her coming.

I like to think I am a very respectful person, and I try not to get too close to people, and I especially try not to touch people accidentally.

The first one or two times, I thought it was just accidental, but this has happened six times now, and now I started thinking about this more.

Is she just a person who has more a more relaxed sense of personal space, or is there a reason she keeps doing this to me? (I haven't observed her bumping into or brushing against other people, but then again, I don't see her every minute of every day, so I can't be sure she doesn't do this with others.)

I'm afraid to say something because I don't want to offend her or make things awkward at work, and her coming in contact with me doesn't bother me. If I'm really being honest here, I like her being close to me.

If she might be indicating interest, though, I'd be interested in seeing where this goes.

Can anyone give me some advice in how to navigate this situation? Is this nothing or possibly something? I feel so clueless.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p5vgft/how_do_i_navigate_this_situation/
50,p5vkro,1629170007,So Much Love in the World - Platonic,"I would love to date again one day - maybe in 2022. Right now, platonic relationships are teaching me about what I need and want from the people in my life.

For all of 2020 till now, I sought love and support from friends, old and new. A person I became fast friends with over six months assaulted me and caused some loss of faith, but not too much. I'm very glad I chose to invest in friendships. Some investments are paying off more than I thought they would. Over the pandemic, I drifted from one friend because of differences in opinion/perspective on racial justice. Casual acquaintances became close friends. I heard that someone I don't even know thinks I'm incredibly annoying. After the assault, a couple of men I didn't know well or didn't expect to be particularly kind or thoughtful had my back. I learned that I am mostly well-liked, even given my goofy nature and social awkwardness. Here, I thought I was invisible the whole time.

The accelerated racial justice movement in 2020, the pandemic, and my assault taught me so much about what real friends are. Learning about how my behavior is perceived has made me express myself more clearly. This carries over to who I'll look out for romantically in the years to come - and how I'll make sure to convey exactly who I am and what I think.

I've found out that I need some emotional support and that some people are happy and capable of giving it. Sexual assault is a difficult topic to discuss. It terrifies people. Yet, there are people out there who aren't afraid to look you in the eye, acknowledge how difficult it is to contend with, and offer their support in words, time, and attention. Some men have been assaulted. Men who have never been assaulted can care quite deeply. I found out that clearly, verbally expressing my need for support helps others give me what I need and shows me who they are. In the past, I kept everything to myself and soldiered on. Having this support makes me feel loved and seen in a way I never have, and it makes me feel brave. I am not a brave person. I think what blows me away is that people (men and women) know this isn't the easiest thing to navigate, and some people are willing to go through the exercise of figuring it out with me. I may not follow their advice, which I seek, but it's the process of talking things through that helps me determine my own path. The examples of these wonderful people have taught me how to ask better questions and express my own support for others.

Having people in my corner changes everything for me. My ex-husband didn't give me that. I was always proud of how independent we were, but what I really need is to be part of a team, a community, a family. I also learned that I need people to verbally express their support. If you quietly support me, deep in your heart, how will I ever know? Sadly, people that have come and gone from my life will never know the love I felt for them, either. I hope to change that going forward.

Good luck to all of us. I hope we will all feel love in our lives one way or another.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p5vkro/so_much_love_in_the_world_platonic/

For perspective Im 44, a WOC and a fat woman. I only mention this to give perspective.

I live alone. My place is small ( a 1 bedroom) but decorated nice. I have mostly all new furniture with matching and coordinating rugs,  pillows, some nice figurines  and African American style art on the walls. 

My bedroom suite is also new,  with a coordinating comforter set and matching rugs. I do admit to having a love of very good expensive perfume. Two of my favorites are Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent Opium. Both are now pricing at over $100 a bottle. I only buy my most expensive scents twice a year cuz thats all I can afford. My dresser is covered with lots of make up and smell goods. I also use a very expensive ($180 a tube) prescription only skin cream for my face that insurance doesnt cover. I do have a dedicated skincare routine including at home facials several times a week. Im getting older and dont want to wrinkle prematurely. üòä
 
Every 2 weeks I get my nails done. I do have acryllic tips with a french manicure and I also get a pedicure and biweekly eyebrow wax. My hair color is retouched frequently and I go to the shop every 2 weeks to.maintain my short style. I also purchase and wear nice clothes with an eye to age appropriate fashion and have things tailored when needed so they fit me nice. This includes my scrubs for my one job.

I tried to explain that just because Im a fat woman that doesnt mean that Im dirty or have to just be sloppy and not care about myself or living environment at all. I also explained that if he wanted to see me again it would not be at my house because I can netflix and chill on my own couch. That we are adults and I dont need a date for that. I was expecting more. Not a 5 star dinner but more than a hang out date. 

He looked around my apartment and told me he could tell by meeting me I was high maintenance and not worth the headache. I tried to tell him the things I do for myself are just good grooming habits nothing too out of the way.  I enjoy having a nice place to come home to and have it fixed up nice so if I do have company I wont be embarassed. Is it me? Or him?

58,p64f9j,1629209014,He started dating his last girlfriend when she was 17 and he was 36.,"I am a 40F and met a 43M who seems perfect for me. I prefer to date people around my age or slightly older, and who love to travel and have lots of freedom to travel. My preferred lifestyle is to spend most of the year traveling (I work online), so it's hard to meet men who want the same kind of lifestyle on top of being compatible in other ways. Anyway so this guy seems perfect and he seems really into me, we have been on a couple of dates. On the last date I found out his last name so of course the next day I Googled him. I found his Facebook and there were still lots of photos of his last relationship, which ended a couple of years ago. Then I clicked on the (ex)girlfriend's page, and was confused cause there were photos of her that looked like she was playing on a high school basketball team. So turns out he started dating this girl in 2014, a few weeks before her 18th birthday. He was 36. When they met she was on summer holidays between Grade 11 and Grade 12 and she lived at home with her parents and 11-year-old brother. Anyway based on Facebook, the girl's family accepted the relationship and they were very active on social media; their relationship lasted 4 years and they even got engaged before ending the relationship a couple years ago. 

I am just feeling so ICK about this. I cannot imagine dating a teenager, especially someone who was not even 18 yet when they started hanging out! Clearly he is looking for women closer to his age now, since he is currently pursuing me. But I don't know if I can get over the fact that the last 'woman' he pursued was a teenager in high school! Her posts around that time are like, complaining about how math class is hard, she can't believe no one asked her to prom, and her parents are being so lame, typical teenage girl stuff. And he was 36 and thought he should be dating her?

What do you all think? He just made a weird choice, they went their separate ways and no harm no foul? Or is this too weird to ignore?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p64f9j/he_started_dating_his_last_girlfriend_when_she/

Do I text him and ask for a good time to talk on the phone? And nicely say, I was really interested in getting to know you more but it looks like we‚Äôre not on the same page, and this isn‚Äôt working for me.
Do I just wait and see?

I love love but it apparently doesn‚Äôt notice me at all. I‚Äôve felt invisible my whole life when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. Don‚Äôt know how many times guys would tell me how beautiful my sister was. Lord knows no one ever said that about me to her though. Growing up chunky didn‚Äôt help, but even after losing a bunch of weight, I‚Äôm still not noticed. Like WTF??? Then when I do manage to attract someone, it‚Äôs the worst of the worst. Just a bunch of liars who want a piece of ass on the side. I‚Äôve always been naive when it comes to love and unfortunately that leaves me vulnerable to a bunch of vultures. I fear that by the time love really does find me, I may be to bitter and broken to notice üò¢ 

And yes, I‚Äôve been married. Been separated for awhile now, finally divorcing legally lol and there are no hard feelings. My ex and I are the best of friends. We met at a time when both of us desired freedom from our overbearing mothers and so we quickly moved in together. I‚Äôll admit I rushed marriage because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find anyone else that would want to be with me. My ex wasn‚Äôt really my type, in fact I thought he was gay the first time I met him (i was sort of right, btw üòù) but he enjoyed my company and I his, so figured I‚Äôd better shackle him before someone else came along to steal his attention ü§™ Our marriage was good. We never argued or any of that dramatic shit. Always had a good time in each other‚Äôs company. The intimacy was severely lacking though and that‚Äôs just something that I truly needed to feel. We had sex but I never felt desired. The best compliment I‚Äôd get was, ‚Äúyou look decent‚Äù. I know we could‚Äôve easily stayed married, but it totally was turning into a platonic type friendship and I just wasn‚Äôt down with that. Plus there was some infidelity on his part (with men). Didn‚Äôt bother me really, because I knew he had only dated men before we got together, so figured he missed them. What bothered me was that I felt like I wasn‚Äôt enough. We had an open marriage at the end. He was much better at finding decent guys than I was lol. 

We have two kids together and there‚Äôs absolutely no drama where custody is concerned. He‚Äôs currently engaged and I even get along great with his fianc√©e. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard seeing them all lovey with each other when he was never like that with me, but I‚Äôm glad he learned how to show affection because it‚Äôs important. I always remind him to tell his fianc√©e how beautiful she is, because it‚Äôs important for a woman to know that her man desires her. 

So, here I am at 40, back in the dating world and it‚Äôs worse now than it was when I was younger. My cuddle buddy is a pillow. Don‚Äôt really even have friends to hang out with.

It was an absolutely wonderful day! Perfect weather and the dogs had a blast at a couple of dog parks along the coast. She was mesmerized by Portland Head light that she‚Äôd never visited. It‚Äôs kinda sad that many lighthouse lovers skip it on their Maine trips. It is far and away the best experience. Not as beautiful as Nubble, but the park lands, old fort, cliff walks and incredible rocks make for a perfect day of picnics and soul refreshing.

The down news. Zero rooms or cottages, pets allowed, since we‚Äôd had a stretch of weather that drew insane crowds to Maine. 

So we had fun. Talked endlessly about family and only once did I feel like a witness being grilled by the prosecutor.

We ate greasy food at Old Orchard Beach, where the scenery is bad/good for an old mans heart. Discovered that my 3 year old, eternal puppy, is indeed an incredible chick magnet. She got so many ear scritches she was overwhelmed. Little new walkers giggling at the puppy and quite a few adults thanking me for the therapy  my girl provides.

On the ride home, I nearly crapped as she began an in-depth discussion of sex. What she liked and hates about her former husband and boyfriends. I was literally drooling and after about 30 minutes I dug deep down and popped the question. ‚ÄúWould you like to go back to my home for a bottle of red and whatever?‚Äù

She kinda said yes, but then the day of sun and walking crept up on both of us. Beach tired is a thing. And the mood made a 180 when she drew out the long, ugly history of my loveless marriage. She asked when was the last time I had sex and I told her the truth, which is not always the best policy. It‚Äôs been too long to mention here, but the temperature in my car completely changed.

We parted at the park and ride with hugs and a drawn out goodnight that included a commitment to do it again with advanced reservations in two weeks and of course, plans to meet at the dog park this morning.
