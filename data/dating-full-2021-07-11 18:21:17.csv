When I confronted him, he blocked me on everything and then remade his dating apps to say 35.

Even lying by a year is a big deal. It is super weird, and also all the apps I am thinking of make you manually enter your birthday, so it’s not a Facebook issue.

Just wanted to really vent about this!

I'm a male in my early twenties and I've never ever had a girlfriend. I've tried all these things: online dating, apps, bars, clubs, parties, social groups, youth groups, university campus, other social venues such as bowling arena, parks (where I know ppl hang out), cafes............but no luck. Most girls use the ""I have a boyfriend"" card and tbh most girls are really rude and arrogant. 

It physically pains me to go out and see hot girls everywhere time and time again, it hits me in the chest and reminds me of something that I'm missing out on (a relationship) that is soooo hard to find! I just want a girlfriend who I can honestly share my life with, talk to, laugh with, go out with, start a family with one day etc. and I can't believe it's so hard to find just that ONE person! When I think about how there are 7 billion + people in the world it really shatters me inside that despite the huge population it's still this hard. 

I do make an effort to get on with life and do what I need to like hobbies, working-out etc. but it's not like magically working on yourself will make a girl appear. You know what, relationships are the one thing where there is no definitive way to find. If you're hungry, go eat something, if you want to be a doctor, go to college for it! if you want to find a romantic partner, there is nothing you can just instantly do if you get me. 

Honestly I have a comfortable life, a good house, car, money, job etc. but the absence of love/relationship is slowly killing me and driving me insane!!! I absolutely HAATE!!! the single life with every fibre of my being. I get being single has its benefits but humans are biologically made to crave for love/companionship and hence why 7 billion people + exist. The whole notion of ""a relationship won't make you happy"" is like telling a homeless person a job won't make you feel any better. 

Honestly loneliness is one of the worst sufferings. Even friends/family don't fulfil the overall needs a romantic partner can. I really really want to find someone (the right one of course) but I just can't see anything changing. I've been trying for about 4-5 years now. I never thought it would be this damn hard. I don't even want to be the next billionaire or have the most expensive car etc. I just want to love someone and be loved backed! 

Honestly I'm really fucking terrified of ending up all alone. I rarely get jealous of people but seeing girls and boys getting into relationships so damn easily like flipping a switch really makes me hate the unfairness of life and it murders me inside. No amount of money can erase the pain of loneliness. All I have right now is just a glimmer of hope that I may run into the love of my life soon and that keeps me going. 

At this point I'm really a dead man walking!

I primarily use Tinder and Hinge. I do have Bumble, but I get far fewer matches there. Facebook Dating, OkCupid, and POF aren't even worth mentioning - they're less active and seem filled with strange/alternative people that I am just not attracted to. 

I receive 5 to 10 matches a week with girls I would legitimately consider dating or at least create a FWB relationship with but about 70% of the time these girls either do not reply to my initial message, or will reply once and ghost me. For another 15%, we will send several messages back in forth, usually over the course of a few hours, maybe we will add Snapchat, and they will just mysteriously start ghosting me with no indication as to why. For the final 15%, we will talk about meeting or even make plans to meet but they will ghost the plans/date usually at the last minute, or worst of all just block me hours before we had planned to meet up. 

There just seems to be such a huge lack of human decency and I am starting to notice it becoming more and more common. 

 I usually just ignore it, maybe get mildly depressed and beat myself up for a few hours (or a few days sometimes... sadly), and move on. Eventually I'll match with another girl or two in the 30% mentioned above and the process will just repeat itself. 

To say the least, this has been an emotionally draining experience. It's started to make me nihilistic, impacting other parts of my life.

I'm curious if others are noticing this in dating or willing to admit that they are doing this personally. 

In both secular and religious circles, it appears that HVMs are now unwilling to entertain the idea of **marrying a nonvirgin**. The concept of female virginity has become so anathema in the current feminist milieu that these HVMs are having to come up with other reasons why it's ""just not working out"" after dating for a while and discovering this fact. A big problem here is that women are never hearing the actual reason why the men are unwilling to continue into something serious. To some degree this makes sense because it's not something the woman can change, but it is important to the dating landscape as a whole. We're also talking about actual HVM which would include emotionally intelligent individuals that wouldn't be interested in hurting a woman's feelings or gaining a reputation as an old-fashioned prude.

I'm beginning to question if most (if not all) men have gut-wrenching, visceral reactions to the idea of someone they **actually love** being in a sexual context with someone else. HVMs just have more options and don't have to suppress this reaction in order to be in a relationship.

First things first, there's the profile pictures. This alone sort of kills online dating and makes it extremely difficult for some people to get matches. When a profile picture is a person's first impression they see on an online dating service, it clearly favors the people who are physically attractive. This leads to people just sorting through possible candidates purely based on their profile pictures because that's the first thing they see. Most will not even bother actually clicking on the pfp and reading more about the person and learn a bit about who they are. This honestly sucks. Online dating services are conditioning people to judge dates by their physical appearance first and personality after.

Secondly, there are always those scammers/catfishers/people with bad intentions. There's always gonna be people who are not who they say they are. You might get along with them for a while and then they just make a move to get in bed with you. This is such a genuinely dick move and I sincerely hope that anyone who behaves like this goes to a special level of Hell when they die. There are people who seem like nice matches at first only to ask for some money a little while in. Don't.

I’d really appreciate if anyone could help me with this problem which has been bugging me. I’m a girl in my 20s, generally a quiet and introverted person but no way close to shy or having problem with social interaction. I have very limited experience with romantic relationship, and I don’t have any close male relatives or friends on a bestie level. Whilst I interact with male colleagues/classmates/ most strangers or dates fairly well, perhaps a bit awkward around those I’m interested in, I find myself having problem to feel at ease with rougher type of guys. Say, a construction or a soldier( sry if I’m a bit stereotyping). I don’t know if it’s shyness or feeling intimidated or I simply have problem with interacting naturally around guys who are different from those I know throughout my whole life from a conservative middle class background. I sometimes can’t even look at them in the eyes while we talk without forcing myself to, despite knowing they don’t have any ill intention. It’s a sense of feeling as if I’m staring, and invading one’s privacy by peeking into their life because I feel like I’m automatically observing, studying a person. I’m really ashamed of myself for this tendency as I don’t understand what this sudden change of behavior is all about. I hope I have managed to explain this clear enough and someone can kindly help me find an answer...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,891744,public,self,Shy(?) girl question,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oiatvr/shy_girl_question/,all_ads,6,,,

So there's this girl I dated a while back probably a year or two ago now, in a long distance relationship about 4 hours travel, we talked on the phone when we first matched on tinder from 7pm-6am that same night, that lead to many more phone calls. I finally ended up meeting her and it was great! 
I stayed over at her house when I was about 19 at his father house that weekend, then I left cause I had to go back to work at the start of the week as you do, we couldn't wait to see each other again, but we were still making phone calls. 

Then we weren't able to see each other for a very long time due to me being busy with work. So the relationship kind of died down after awhile. Then I had seen on Facebook her father died on the day I was scrolling through. So I messaged her and called her right away and talked to her, she said she wanted some time to herself for a while so I gave her the time. I'm not sure but I always wish I could have been with her in person when he died, I meet him and he said I was the greatest thing that happend to her. When I was over with her before he passed, but I stayed and let her figure thing out for herself.

So about around 8 months passed of us talking on and off and it suddenly stopped. About a year later, She messaged me to come stay with her at her new house, I was now 21 and I'm pretty much said I couldn't I had stuff going on and yes I feel very shitty about that.

About 4 months later I know I still have feelings for her, I'm not sure if she still does. 
I'm wondering if it's worth going with my gut and messaging her and what do I say? Is it still worth it?

I think both genders on average have their own struggles, but I do see common differences between dating men and women. 

Everytime a guy posts on a dating sub with, generally speaking, common struggles with dating/attracting women he's called ""entitled"" ... and there's a parade of people to stomp on him and let him know that ""he's not owed anything."" 

Sometimes these men actually do have some issues, you can tell there's a reason they're single, they don't actually like women, they're misogynists... Those definitely happen. But I also see relatively normal struggles from men, common complaints about dating, trying to get genuine advice/help and STILL, these men are called entitled.

Meanwhile, I'm reading their struggles and I'm like, YES, I relate to all of them as someone who dates women! 

Getting matches is hard. Getting dates with women is doubly hard. If someone told me my house was going to burn down if I didn't have a date with a guy by tomorrow, I could get one with relative ease (and it would likely be someone I'm at least somewhat into). If you said the same with a woman, it would be a 50-50 shot at most EVEN if i dropped relatively all my standards.

This is what many men mean when they talk about their struggles dating women. Yes, women often have trouble finding the *right* partner, filtering out men who just want sex, finding a happy, long-term committed relationship, or even just a quality person who clicks with them... but the cart comes before the horse. You can't get a relationship either if you don't get dates in the first place. 

This often leads to a situation where only the most extroverted, charismatic, confident, funny people who play the numbers (and constantly approach women) will have any chance at quantity before they can filter for quality. 

Because that level of confidence and bravery takes GUTS, and because that level of *persistence* is often required to maintain a woman's interest initially in the first place, a large part of the dating population is now invisible. 

I'm not saying it's anyone's fault, I'm just saying I think a lot of straight women have no sympathy for men in this arena. 

The irony is a lot of straight women who tell men they're ""entitled"" for wanting a LTR/love/physical affection and that ""having a job, being nice, working out, having a good friend group, being approachable doesn't mean you're owed a date""... 

are the same women in which dates have come to them by doing those exact things - being nice, having a job, working out, and putting yourself around compatible men! Sure, most of those won't turn into a relationship, but that's the same for everyone.

So this might be a strange question but have you ever had a rebound snap you out of it? Here's the situation, I've had a lot of partners but have only been in love maybe twice. The last one is still haunting me after nearly two years. It's terrible. 

In those two years I've had one date and it ended badly. She was attractive and all but demanded I fuck her without protection. This is a deal breaker so I got dressed and left. The whole thing made me miss her even more. 

So here I am unsure what to do with myself. A new relationship is definitely off the table until I'm over her (perhaps never) but some good sex to take my mind off of it would be nice. As a 40 year old it's pretty embarrassing to be this lost. 

Given my age it'll take some enormous effort to find said good sex and honestly, I don't have time to waste. Any success stories here of  screwing their way out of regret?

His response was: ""Honestly, I think you're pretty cute. There are a few things I'd change though. First, I'd grow your hair out to your boobs. I've always felt like women looked more feminine with longer hair than short hair. Your hair length is fine now, but I think longer hair will make you look even better. Second, I'd fix your brows. Personally think women look better with thin brows so I'd thin them and keep them consistent all the way through. Your current brows start thick and then get thin which looks off to me. You could try an eyebrow threading salon or do it yourself. Lastly, your body needs work. So you don't necessarily have to lose weight. You can go through a body recomposition to lose fat and gain muscle. I'd start by doing exercises to tone your legs, thighs, and butt. You should be squatting if you're not already. You can also throw in ab exercises along with cardio sessions. I honestly think you have a lot going for you. Your skin is nice, your teeth look pretty white, and your face is super cute to me. However, I don't really think you need a nose job, and I feel like pink lipstick looks better on you than red. You look like a Desi girl so I recommend a belly piercing once you're in shape. Ya got boobs based on your last pic, so once you tone your lower half, you're going to be killing it.""

Then I posted again about a month later, and he saw my post and commented again.

He said this time: ""You look like your typical hot/party Desi girl on IG. I think you clearly have a body dysmorphic disorder. Like I said in your previous post here, you really just need to grow your hair out to your boobs because that makes you look more feminine especially since you have straight hair. You're pretty hot tbh. You're blessed with good boobs and your bikini/black dress/last picture that you think you look like a troll show me you know how to dress to flaunt the girls. I'm actually confused, do you not get hit on in public/on dating apps? There's no way guys aren't trying to slide in your dms. I know me and the boys would definitely buy you ladies a round if we ever saw you at a club/bar. As I said before, you should focus on toning your body, but after seeing that pink bikini pic, you're killing it girl.”

Then I responded with: ""Thank you so much for the kind words. There isn’t anything wrong with looking like the typical hot/party desi girl on IG, but that isn’t the look I’m going for unfortunately. :o I don’t notice when I’m getting hit on, but sometimes my friends notice and point it out. I do get asked out irl, but I still don’t feel pretty enough and I think that’s something that comes from within. I don’t have social media like IG so I don’t have guys sliding in my DMs. I haven’t been to a club/bar in a while""

Then he said: ""So then you clearly either aren't ready to enter the dating scene or you have BDD. Again, literally everyone here is saying you're hot/cute so I really think you should seek therapy and what not. You're getting asked out which should show you that you're not some ugly troll. I personally think making an ig would be beneficial for you because the likes and dudes trying to slip into your dms will give you confidence. Not saying you should base your worth off of that, but ig will definitely boost your self-esteem. Good luck to you, if you need to talk or want advice, dms always open! Have some confidence girl! 💁""

Then I said: ""I was on IG for a while and I deleted it because I felt really insecure seeing all the gorgeous and perfect looking Instagram models :( plus a lot of people photoshop and facetune their pics on IG.

I eventually got cool with her and we added each other on snap, after a good whole of knowing her I decided to shoot my shot, didn't work, she was dating women at the time and as of right now she has a girlfriend. 

Moving on there is another girl at work that we both know, she was heavily interested in me because she would always make small talk with me and Ska me a lot of personal questions, she asked me why I don't have kids yet, when would I be ready to, why am I not married, when when I'll be ready, and why don't I have a girlfriend.

Thing is she's about 19 to 20 years old, I just turned 28 this past February, so even though she's definitely attractive, I don't really pay to much attention to her. My uncle told me he was the same age when he met my auntie and she was around 19 or 20 at the time from what she told me, and they're still together to this day, Married since 2016 (they met in 2005)

So I told myself, let's see what happens, of course being 28 I no longer have any expectations when dating, either it works or it doesn't and I no longer waste my time. I saw her Thursday last week, talked to her for a bit, asked for her snap she grabbed my phone and added herself. Mind you before we had our own conversation she just got off the phone with our bisexual friend and they talk all the time. After getting her snap I went about the rest of my day, Friday was busy for me so I didn't message her.

Saturday (yesterday) came and I scrolled through my snap friends and found her and began to send her a message when I didn't see her snap score anymore. I realized that she blocked me. At first I was extremely confused, but I also found it funny because nothing surprises me anymore. I then realized the reason why she might have blocked me was because the other girl told her to. Which instantly pissed me off because if you're not interested in me and I never had a chance dating you, why get in the way of me potentially dating someone else? Especially when you said you like women way more than men.

She also claims to be cool with me, yet never hits me up to check on me, never starts a conversation when texting cause I'm always the one to send a message first, and a majority of the time she doesn't respond to any of my messages for days, sometimes weeks. The last time she actually reached out to me was to help her move out of her apartment into another, and that was over a month ago, yet I see her at work everyday. At first I thought I was jumping to conclusions, but lo and behold, she randomly messages me this morning asking me what I'm up to after the other girl blocks me. I haven't responded to her message, and to be clear, she NEVER messages me without me messaging her first, and the last time she did take the initiative to, it was to help her move.

I tried the apps and they were mostly disappointing, except for this one guy who was nice and easy to talk to. We tried numerous times to meet up, but something always came up and it never happened. After a while, the conversation died down and I figured it was a lost cause, no biggie. 

He then out of the blue messaged me and said he really didn't want to miss the chance to hang out. So I was planning on spending the weekend at this very nice luxury hotel where I get perks, so I offered to have him meet me for drinks and dinner at the restaurant there or to chill by the pool. He sounded excited and agreed. Flash forward to yesterday when we planned to meet, he said he got off work at 4 and he would meet me around 6. So around 545, I message him just to let him know details of how to park and where to meet me, to which he tells me he actually started running around doing errands  and we will play it by ear. Okay... I was in a vacation mindset and enjoying myself so at that point I figured he wasn't coming and I was okay with it. 

45 mins later, he told me he was going to start getting ready to leave, so I let him know I had a reservation for dinner at 8 and he would be here just in time to eat. Long story short, he didn't get there until 9 pm when I was almost done with dinner. If being late wasn't frustrating enough, I told him ahead of time that the restaurant was semi-nice and he assured me he was in decent clothes, however he showed up in a wrinkled t shirt and sweat shorts. I'm not a snob, but it looked like he didn't even try. The conversation was okay, but he kept doing the Peter Griffin voice for some reason and it was annoying me so much.

We stayed on the phone for maybe four hours and just talked about a lot of shit and I changed my perception of her from just wanting to bang her to wanting to get to know her better. The next day she texted me on and off about little things but I scheduled a meet up for the next day. The day before we met up though I kept flirting with her about sex and she told me she wasn’t that comfortable with doing anything until she got to know me which I was OK with. When we went on he date she expressed so much to me that showed me she was into me at at the end of the date we made out for like 10 minutes. One important detail though that I learned when  we were on a date was that she just  got out of a long-term relationship two weeks ago which really didn’t strike me as a red flag until now given her actions.  she continue to text me a lot but didn’t express to me much that she wanted to get another date scheduled. So after a day or so I asked her after she texted me if she wanted to go out again. She told me she was busy with work and family and didn’t express another time when we could go out so I told her just let me know when you’re free. She continue to text me about other things but I kind of just ran off and told her I’ll talk to her later. She continue to text me the next couple of days and two days ago I told her we should get together to what she told me she had work. What’s important to understand is that she was actually busy but she just didn’t express another time when we could go out. So for the last three or four days I’ve barely spoken to her but she’s continue to reach out to me. I think that she is definitely not past her last relationship and she’s afraid I want to jump into one so when I ask her to go out she is reluctant because she doesn’t want me to push her into anything at the moment. Now the issue is that I don’t want to reach out to her again because I came off way too strong at the beginning budge I definitely think one way I can get with her is through sex. I don’t want to just ask her randomly if she just wants to bang but I also think that’s some thing I need to do to get her to ultimately even consider having a long-term relationship so number one should I ask her to hook up and number two if she continues to contact me but she doesn’t ask me to get together what do I do?,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,892157,public,self,How to get a women who just ended a long term relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oif968/how_to_get_a_women_who_just_ended_a_long_term/,all_ads,6,,,

ever since then, obviously all of my friends and everybody who was at the party has concerns about him because they witnessed the entire situation. with that, i expect people to be concerned and check up on me regarding this relationship. i always tell my boyfriend about the people who have issues/concerns with our relationship. this past weekend, i was hanging out with friends and they haven’t seen me since the situation so of course they asked how things were. they then proceed to tell me that ever since that night, they lost so much respect for my boyfriend and they just want to make sure i’m happy and that the relationship is healthy. i told my boyfriend about the concern of this friend and he immediately went off and said he was going to text them. he texted this friend and confronts them. he tells he is really upset about people “putting his name in their mouths” but i explained to him that people will always have concerns about the relationship because HE is the one who messed up in the past. i explained that they have a right to be upset because they witnessed how he treated me that night. i just wanted to let him know what was said and instead of understanding why people feel the way they do, he gets so upset and texts this friend. 

i just feel like that wasn’t the way to go about it? if i messed up in a relationship i would understand why people would feel a certain way about me and instead of causing more drama, i would just keep quiet and show everybody that i have changed and the relationship is good. i don’t like how my boyfriend dealt with the situation. he says he feels attacked and like they are talking shit about him but nobody is personally attacking him! they are just concerned for me.

A little backstory on him, before he settled down with me, he had been single and living up the man hoe life for a while. It’s fine, I tease him about it.
A few weekends ago, the girl who my ex cheated on me with popped up as a recommended friend on FB. I looked and she and T were friends, so I asked him how he knew her knowing they don’t have the same friend circle at all. He said she was someone his ex worked with, and knew she kind of had the reputation of a hoe from that. So I told him the cheating story, we had a full convo about it, and that was it. About a week later I paid him for something on venmo, and out of curiosity was just scrolling through his transactions, I do that on there sometimes funny stuff. I noticed he paid this girl for “snaps” a long time ago so I asked him if he had paid for her nudes and he said yes. Wasn’t so much upset about that, just a little frustrated that it never came up in our 45 minute conversation about her. So I told him to just be honest with me, that’s not something I would get upset over it was a long time ago.

2nd instance:
He always swore he had never been to a strip club and we’ve even talked about me taking him for the first time. Well last night a song played and he let it slip that he got a strip dance to this song. And I said, “I thought you’ve never been to a strip club?” And he said only once, and said it was X strip club, and it “doesn’t really count” cause “there’s no bar there” (huh?). Well I told him idgaf that he’s been, or even if he goes now just don’t lie to me. Then the story changed again and he said he didn’t really go to X strip club he was at a stripper’s house, he doesn’t remember the stripper just the song. The second detail that didn’t make sense too me was that the song is fairly new, it came out just 2 months before we started dating. Okay, there’s a chance it happened in that 2 month window, in which case fine. But he just said “it must have been a different song then.”
He was apologetic, saying he just didn’t want to hurt me and said he would be better about being honest.

 have a problem taking my clothes off. 

I even defended her from some creep who lives next door to her who bothered her, and he threatened to kill me (the police had to intervene).

I know she’s busy working and gets home late sometimes and she gets allergies semi frequently, and she always uses this as an excuse, even though I’m usually more exhausted and stressed than she is, but I still make an effort to perk up and spend time with her because she matters a lot to me. 

I must add she is an international student doing a research placement, and she will be going back Europe in a couple months to finish up her schooling. 

We initially thought that we would just remain friends when she goes back, but then she said she wants me to visit her as her “boyfriend” for Christmas. She also said she wants to live with me before she leaves, and that she is considering finishing her education in America and asked where I’d be when that time comes. 

Then today, she said I take her too seriously and that she’s only serious 30% of the time. She said she wants to finish her education in England where she is currently and said “I guess we can make space for you at the family dinner” regarding me visiting her for Christmas. 

She also tries to make me jealous by telling me about how one of her colleagues at work asked her out for drinks a couple times and even asked her to look at furniture with him for his new apartment. As I’ve been cheated on before, and she knows this, it naturally bothered me. But I generally trust her, and she said she only likes me. She felt bad for trying to make me jealous because of the trauma I have, but she brought the guy up once again today.

I know it’s not really a good long-term relationship, especially since she doesn’t want to have kids and said she would abort mine if I were to get her pregnant, and that really hurt my feelings. I’m not in a position to have kids right now (I do wish to be a father one day), but I would never abort my baby.

I’m afraid to lose this girl, as strange as that sounds. In general, she’s super pretty, smart, and generally a nice person. I guess I fear that I won’t find anyone else, especially since I’ve had little luck with dating apps/no one in school interests me. 

Is there something wrong with me? What do I do about my current relationship? How do I move on if it ends?

But it still made me feel a little weird. 

He left and then he told me that he had a really nice time, he really enjoyed hanging out with me and even made a little callback to a joke from when we saw eachother. i agreed but no further plans were made.

For reference, my love language is not physical touch, but hey, I think most people want physical intimacy with their dates/partners, right? His isn’t either, though. I have been on a small handful of dates with this one guy (20M, turning 21 soon) and it is going very well. Our energies balance out no nicely and we have the best conversations and creative date ideas. He definitely makes it known that he’s into what I’m talking about and that I have good conversation. He’s very engaging. He’s a great texter and he lets me know how much he appreciates my time, but there’s just one thing: he hasn’t made an effort to touch me not once. Now, I don’t want to introduce this as a problem because everyone has different boundaries and I’m not going to put him in the wrong for this. It’s just that when we see each other in person, he’s just a tad bit too... friendly...? There’s no flirtation (and I admit, I’m not good at this) or touch. If you’re wondering “well, why haven’t you tried yet? Don’t wait for him to make a move,” I would hate to appear needy. Not that I give a crap about standards, but Women making the first move in certain situations is still considered kind of unorthodox and I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. I’m not saying he has to kiss me yet, but just a little something, y’know? I tried to give subtle hints (please don’t yell at me) like  touching his arm for a couple seconds or lightly pushing our upper bodies together while we sat down on a bench for a few minutes. Still nothing. Great guy, but still nothing. Maybe I’m giving awkward/nervous vibes? I mean, I can seem that way at times and I can be kind of intense when I talk about things I’m passionate about, but it’s not to the point where it’s intimidating at all. What should I do? Is he just not into me? I don’t feel like he’s giving mixed signals but I also think he’s playing it too safe. I feel like some people get like that when they find out I’m asexual, which he knows.
