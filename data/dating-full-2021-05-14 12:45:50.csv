She got - 2.5 years of love and affection  
I got - Heartbreak and complete loss of attraction to other women + a beating (literally and from the universe)

Hi all, I'm (22M), just want to ask for genuine advice to whoever is a relationship expert or has good instinct in this field.  
I wouldn't call myself terrible at dating, nor great either, but I had to know if I fucked my life over this girl (21F). I'm stuck with her and I've might have potentially had my time and effort go to waste pursuing her. 

I met her at a college club meet-up. At first, I didn't notice her much, but as we kept coming to the meet-ups periodically, I started to become attracted by her behavior and humor. I've always been a long shot type of guy - because even though I like having fun, I ultimately think commitment is the way to go.

Over the past couple of years, I am a bit afraid to show attraction yet, and I intended to get her to like me first. Otherwise, I'd look like a fool. I had to make sure if she was even remotely interested and could reciprocate my feelings.

A little twist - I found out she had a boyfriend, which she soon split up with not long after. After I confirmed she was single again, I built the confidence to make moves. At first, it went nicely, as we started getting chummy and start to do couple-y things like making incredibly nonsensical inside jokes which we would tell in front of our friends. At this period, I was pretty confident that we both have mutual feelings. When the semester ended, I just left it as is and had a vacation, where I kept very little contact with her. 

When the year started again, one of my friends hinted that someone is trying to get her, and it made me even more pressured to finally confess. As time goes, I gathered every inch of courage in my body and went to confess to her, but alas, my friend abruptly broke my bubble by telling me she had went official with this guy. At this point, I had very little hope and just tried to move on. What's even worse is, that same night, I got jumped by 2 thugs. I took it as a sign from God that this is either a match in hell or a sign that she is my soul mate. Obviously, logic prevailed and I chose the first.

2020 arrived, I finally graduated and thought that the glimpse of her face in my head could never sway me again. What a great fool I was. I tried seeing other people but they fell off quicker than I liked.  
February arrived, COVID hits, and I completely lost contact with everyone, including our friend group. As months go by and Halloween approached, she reached out to me, and I texted her a birthday wish. She wanted to meet up. Long story short, the meet-up was a roller coaster of emotions involving her dropping almost a year's worth of tea. For me, it was very hard to take in, as it involved a very personal issue she had which really skewed my judgment of her.

At that point, I am still interested, but I'm not a fool. I brought up the confession I never got the chance to give to her. She dejected the sentiment and reminded me of that personal issue she just told me, and why it's gonna be bad for me. I know she's hurting, for whatever reason. Not a lot of people are gifted at hiding their true feelings, but she isn't one of them. The problem is, she has been and is still teasing me and made me feel as if I deserve to be with her, which led to the climax of this weird friendship/awkward relationship.

Eventually, I met her one last time, and she gave me extremely mixed signals. I finally just pulled her aside and told her how I felt. I have pretty much idolized and put her on this very high pedestal. Of course, she rejected me officially and insisted I should move on.

Now, I wake up almost every day with a wet face and complete loss of attraction to any other girl I met. I can't seem to be attracted to anyone new. Every girl I went on dates, met on dating apps, is just still incomparable to her. I told myself I have to move on but I'm really afraid that she might still be sitting on that high pedestal that I wanted to put her off from.

Any thoughts on how I can stop thinking about her?

I don't know what to feel but anxious but hopefully, she's sensitive about me.

We spoke about the future and she mentioned she wasn't sure if she was looking for anything at this moment in time which I was absolutely fine about - I respected the fact she was truthful and wasn't just going to ghost me, so we kept it civil and chatted as we normally did.

Anyway, a couple of weeks go by and we're still talking nearly everyday and have met up plenty of times for drinks or just chilling. Up until recently when she invited me over to her house to watch a movie - at first I thought it was just something as friends would do but I sort of realised a couple of days later that I might have missed something.

The evening was lovely I arrived, met her parents (is this a big thing?) spoke to them and had dinner. Me and the girl go off and watch a movie and throughout us talking and watching the movie she kept mentioning that she is freezing, so she got a jumper and under her bed covers. Did I miss the trick here that maybe she was looking for a cuddle?

So it was getting late and I had to leave because I was busy the next day, she showed me to the door and I felt like there was a moment where she was looking for a hug but I didn't pick up on it so said bye I left to my car.

There's been a bunch of other coupley things that have happened but I have never picked up on them at the time because she said she wasn't looking for anything. I don't want to assume things otherwise we could ruin our friendship and was wondering how I should go about it - is it too forward to ask again what she thinks about our friendship/relationship?

I want to ask her if she wants to hang out at a park or a cafe in a friendly way but don't want to make it awkward. Should I go like this or try another approach?

During one of our zoom calls he out of the blue once asked me if I was in a relationship (I am) and another time what my ideal type of guy is, I didn't think much of it because he's kind of just chatty/ friendly. 

After lockdown eased he invited me to catch-up with him and meet irl for the first time at a park and we met up and we talked about what we'd been up to and he randomly asked if I'd seen my boyfriend recently and I said yes and then we chatted some more then parted ways and he later messaged me saying it was good to know I wasn't a catfish 😍 (not sure if he meant in a you-look-good-online-and-irl way or like a, good-to-know- you -weren't secretly -a -robot way)

Then he messaged me a week later asking if I want to go on a day trip with him on that day but I was busy anyway and wasn't close enough to him to go on such a long trip.

And then after that I've met up with him twice with the group of interns for a catch-up and he always when we are alone randomly brings up my boyfriend. One time we were walking somewhere and I said sorry we have to walk so much to get to the place and he said he doesn't mind then asked if me and my boyfriend walk on our dates alot and then asked for his name. And then he asked if I go straight home after the dates with my bf or if we hang out for longer. That same night he  touched my back when he asked if I had ordered food. And once more he tapped my shoulder to ask me something. It's small things but I guess I notice them?


The last time I saw him he didn't bring my bf up when we were in a group and then when we were alone he randomly (unrelated to our convo) asked if a photo  my friend had tagged me in was my boyfriend.

I believe a girl and guy can be just friends and I do have some male friends that I am good friends with and would spend time with one on one without it being weird which is why I agreed to meet up with him in the first place and he did genuinely just seem friendly and during our interbship but now after these few small interactions  I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it but I can't help wondering why he always asks about my bf when we are alone? Is he just trying to make convo? And also we aren't super close friends (seen him 3 times in my life in person) and see him about once every 5 months

I'm soon-to-be 24 years old and I'm starting to feel like dating has never been a success for me. 
 
I know what it's like to truly love someone else, but at this point I don't think I've ever had someone reach that point with me, and it sucks. I've had one girlfriend. This started out as something casual, unrequited, and then turned into a very unhealthy rollercoaster of a relationship until eventually I was dumped--and very soon after, replaced. I was heartbroken for a little over a year. She was my first everything and I did truly love her but I am responsible for some of why it ended. As a foundation for what having a girlfriend feels like for me, it's quite a shitty example. Dysfunctional behaviors on both ends made us incompatible. It took too long to end because instead of truly listening to my ex, I chose to listen to how I felt rather than strongly considering how she felt.
 
Ever since my ex and I broke up, I've been on a journey to better myself (with various ups and downs). Some of the downs being of a variety. I picked up even more low self esteem than I already had, less confidence in some aspects of my life, drinking. A vast majority of my dates have come from online dating. Online dating is actually how I met my first girlfriend. With online dating now, I usually get ghosted. Not making it past a first date, or never even getting a first date are consistent with my track record. In a span of two years I went from a body count of 1, to 7. Closest experiences I had that nearly led to a relationship ultimately fall flat on their face. Last year, I had a fling but ultimately ended it because I wasn't interested in being a stepdad to two children (of two different fathers!). She claims she was really into me, but I find it hard to believe because she was exhausting other options while saying she wanted to be exclusive. Now she's been with someone else for almost a year. This year, I was long distance-dating another girl who never became exclusive with me and recently ended up with someone else after almost four months of her and I engaging in ""courtship."" That experience still really stings to think about. Now I have a friends with benefits I met at a local Sushi restaurant who initially really liked me (again, based on what she says) but I don't see myself dating seriously. As for my ex, I have not spoken with her in now two years (which I am very proud of) and she's still with the guy she ended up with after me.
 
It just seems every woman who I end up having actual interest in, either doesn't want me or treats me with indifference, every woman who appears interested in me (at least off of what she says) is either completely full of shit (based on her actions) or I'm just not interested in. I don't consider very myself picky in terms of physical attractiveness (however I'd prefer a generally petite woman) but personality is what truly hooks me into someone. Someone who's funny with a similar sense of humor to mine, who communicates, is loyal and honest is really all I ask for in terms of personality. As I read these qualities back to myself, I realize how low the bar seems set--as I think most people would seek these basic qualities I find attractive--and more.

I find most women I've talked to, even female friends say I am attractive--but I don't feel like that a lot of the time. It's kind of always just been word of mouth, nothing specific really told to me. I've been told I have a great sense of humor, I know I'm a goof. My own insecurity about my physical appearance and my tendency to think very low of myself are part of what made me less attractive to my ex. My past is deep-rooted in self hatred and loneliness. I can go on with the negative qualities about myself that I am trying very hard to work on. I did go through therapy for a bit. I've been going to the gym lately. I've been on a break from dating apps altogether for three weeks. I followed the work of Coach Corey Wayne, and I understand that some of my behaviors in the past are what drive women away. It just seems so hard to be ""perfect"" for someone else. It seems that every woman I encounter is just picking me apart bit by bit until they officially realize they don't want me. That's what dating feels like, especially more recently. Most of the chicks I have dated, ultimately seem much happier and flourishing with someone else---almost 100% of the time (at least from what I see and know). 

I want to believe it's going to get better, and I do think I've made progress in some areas...but taken two steps back or more in other areas. I need some genuine advice, because quite frankly--I'm tired of the game.
 
** TL; DR ** Most of my experiences with dating women result in nothing. The ones I am really interested in, eventually lose interest and find someone else, or flat out leave me. The ones I'm not interested in stay for a while. Most of the time, I never even get to know them. Need some words of encouragement, cause man this stings sometimes.

At the beginning of the year I met a great girl [24F] who was just out of a bad relationship, and we hung out and hooked up for a few months. She said she wanted me “long haul”, spent Valentine’s day together and exchanged gifts, we were chilling 3 or more times a week, went on dates, and just got very close to each other emotionally. She said she never felt so strongly about someone and no matter what there would always be a place for me in her heart. I felt her starting to pull back and lose interest in March, and then she cancelled a nice weekend we had planned together bc of “school work”. I ended things because my roommate found her on Tinder (we were supposed to be exclusive and even talked about it), and I told her that I wanted something more serious and felt like she needed some space to figure things out. She said she didn’t know what she wanted right now and was still feeling awful about her previous breakup. She wanted to stay friends, and maybe in a few months or so see if we would both be comfortable maybe being more. I took that as “I want to sleep around and have you on the back burner for when I get tired of that or maybe never”. I didn’t text her for weeks, until she started replying to my snap stories a few times a week. I texted her to catch up after a few weeks of that, and she stayed replying to my snap stories consistently. I asked her for coffee two weeks ago, and we got coffee to catch up and had a nice time. We made plans for dinner and drinks by my apartment for last Thursday, and I was starting to feel like things were moving along again. She was replying to my stories every single day at this point, and I didn’t even have to initiate conversation. The day before our drink date, she dm’d me about a picture I posted saying “you look so nice in that outfit”, which to me says there was some sort of interest there. The day of “dinner and drinks”, she asked me if she could bring along her best friend who was “having a rough day” because she wanted to cheer her up. I went along with it, and despite realizing that her friend was there as a buffer so nothing happened between us, we had a great time and I got the stamp of her friend’s approval (which is a rare thing for that friend, based on how she used to tell me about her exes). Her friend even hinted at her (the girl I like) maybe being interested in me, asking me about very recent details of my life and saying “____ talks about you”, and even assuming that my crush and I were going to be on our own check (ie - I pay for her like we were hooking up or dating). She then replied to my snap story on Saturday, and I now haven’t heard from her in almost a week.

In the meantime, I have been hanging out romantically with a former friend [21F] for the last two weeks. I’m not totally over my crush, but this new girl is head over heels for me and I don’t want to hurt her. I also feel that I clicked better with the first girl both personality wise and sexually. My therapist’s advice is to not commit to anyone and really “hook up with 7-8 different people at a time”. This is typically not in my nature, and I don’t know how I feel about it. I agree that commitment isn’t great for me right now, but I’m seeing a new girl that likes me a lot and don’t want to be a “player” that screws people over because I know how much that hurts. He thinks I should stay with this new girl but also seek out other options (she thinks we’re pretty much exclusive and would be crushed). Part of me also hopes my original crush will text me out of the blue when she’s bored or tired of hooking up if I just ghost her now for a few months, despite her leading me on pretty hard in the past. And secretly, I hope she changes her mind. I’m just so conflicted and don’t know what to do here.

I need an advice from you! :)

I've met with her a month ago. We're studying the same subject at the university and we've been talking with each other since then. Somehow ""probably"" because of her attitude and the way she talks, I liked her. After 2 weeks since we've met, she suggested a ""meeting"" (""Let's meet sometimes"" kinda like that), but I wasn't able to.

After that, I asked her for a ""meeting"" and we were fine about that, then she said suddenly, let's find an appropriate day for our ""date/meeting"" which was okay for me.

Guess what! We couldn't also on that day, because she had to leave the town and she said me, she owes me a date and after that day, I had to ask her **two** times for our date. Finally we did it last week. She said we should do that again sometime.

My question is: Do I insist a lot? She said to me, she wants to take it slow in dating because she just recently broke up with her boyfriend.

but on the other hand since the date, we talked barely with each other and that was for the assignment. I know that she's busy but it feels kinda wrong. 

Should I ask her for the second date for this weekend or just waiting a message from her?

She and her friends were right next to us and they were talking and I could listen to their conversation.  And one of her friends smiled at me and we started having conversation.And I slowly started pulling the girl into the conversation as well and that went well. They later wanted to go grab something to eat and the guys left and the girl said she would  stay.So we briefly talked. It occurred to me that she probably wanted me to ask her number which I didn’t  at that moment and later the guys came back . Before the guys would leave  to grab something to eat, the guy asked my Instagram if they could catch up next time as the guys were from a different city and the girl had just moved to the town and they were there to visit her. I said i didn’t have Instagram but we could share numbers . To which the girl replied that she would share his number with me and funnily said to the guy , don’t be jealous and asked them to just go away to grab something.Anyways the guy himself gave me his number. After all the conversation I came to know that the girl was studying at the same university as I did and I knew her dorm and finally I asked her number saying that if she is new in town we could catch up to which she happily gave me her number. She was struggling to remember her number and the guy showed me her number in his phone , but the girl herself managed to enter her number . 

A couple of days later I texted her and she asked what my plans for the week were. And we decided to meet for walk around the city and some icecream. 

But as the weather forecast wasn’t that good I suggested if she would want to walk in the rain or preferred to cook something. She said that we could do both and she suggested that she would cook for me.

I was kind of overjoyed actually, we met yesterday went for a walk and she cooked.it was nice we had some really good conversation. But we didn’t kiss each other . It occurred to me that she was a very lively open hearted girl and I should not misunderstand this for something else. 

But I am not sure if she is just looking for a new friend in the town or she is interested in me .  Before I was about to live she was putting on the lipstick she told me her lips were dry.

This might have been asked before but can’t find it anywhere. 
How do I deal with only ever being fucked zoned? I don’t do hook ups or casual sex, especially if I already like you. I’m not about to have sex with you, get attached and you ghost or that’s all you wanted was a fling. I don’t enjoy casual sex, I want it with someone I have a connection with. But whenever I’m talking to a guy or whatever, they’re super friendly, complementing me, and then it gets to “hey let’s have sex”. I’m like well I’ve only been on one date with you or only been talking to you, I’m not ready to have sex. And then that’s it, the complements stop, convo dies and they every stated that they don’t care or do hook ups either. 
Like that makes me think that the complement was only to get me to have sex with you, that you don’t actually think I’m pretty or hot, you just wanted to use your sweet words to coax me in. That it was all a lie to get into my pants so now I don’t believe anyone when they say something nice because I think they just want something.

Okay. I’m newly single(32f) out of a 13 year LTR. I have my shit together, am considered conventionally pretty and generally confident and happy. Ive been multi-dating for 5 months and have a few guys I’m genuinely interested in getting to know and could see myself in a relationship with. They check all the boxes: decent job, own place, own car, grown ass adults only (take me out, treat me nicely, respectful, good conversation, shared interests) 

There’s also this one guy who has countless red flags (7 kids with multiple women, a self styled “entrepreneur” to name a few), who I would’ve never seriously pursue a relationship with that I can’t help but like the most. Not only that, I find myself WANTING and OFFERING to do nice things for. Literally running into the fire. 

My internal alarm bells ring nonstop when we’re hanging out but here I am ignoring every one.

I think it’s important to note that I am not looking for a serious long term relationship atm. Which I’ve been upfront and clear about with all of them.

My question is why can’t I be as into the guys who I could see myself having more with at some point?! The guys who actually have things together. Why don’t I put the same energy into interactions with them as I do mr. red flags?! They’re all equally physically attractive to me.

We met OLD and just clicked, he seems great.  We have great flirty convos.  We txt each other everyday.   I am not looking to jump into a very serious relationship.... unless the situation presented itself.  

He checks all my boxes and we both like that we aren’t rushing into this as we are both a bit nervous.  Also, we both have kids.  (He has two, I have one).  He is VERY involved with his kids ... which is super attractive to me and I tell him so.  (Mainly because my ex isn’t very involved with our son).  

However, we have met up 3 times.  I will go to his place, we will eat or cuddle.  But it’s always after one of his kids sporting events so the meet up usually starts at 8:30 or later.  There has never been an actual date (not an issue with me) but I feel a bit like not a priority, at all.  If he suggests a free time, I can make it work (My mom or MIL will watch our son, or it’s when my X has our son).  He has his kids every weekend,.... and takes them to sporting activities, gets them off the bus, helps with homework during the week.  I feel like he never doesn’t have his kids.  

I would think that after 2.5 months of talking, that I would get one proper night dedicated to us.  For the record, I’m not needy.  I just want to feel like he made me a little more of a priority.  (Too early to be thinking that?)

Again, being involved with his kids is a super turn on but it kind of feels like a double edged sword.  I feel like I’ve been pulling away because I don’t think he can dedicate anytime to being in a relationship.  At this rate, we will never progress.  Am I wasting my time?

Basically - I (24M) dated this girl (25F) for around 5 months. Started off both wanting something casual, but things went extremely well and we were seeing each other 2-3 times a week. We made things official after about 2.5 months. I ended up falling for her, and it seemed like she had everything I wanted in a girl. Eventually she broke up with me (seemingly) out of the blue. I was really confused because it seemed things were going so well, and we were extremely compatible - which she even acknowledged was true. Her reasons seemed confusing and contradictory, and she said it had nothing to do with me and that I had done nothing wrong and was an amazing guy.

After one unsuccessful attempt at getting some closure by writing her a letter about one month after the breakup (to which she basically told me to find it on my own), after another month I decided to try calling her because I was still struggling to make sense of it and start healing. She acted indignant and angry at me for contacting her (confusing since there was virtually zero animosity between us when things ended), but agreed to let me express why I was confused. 

She rather condescendingly listened to what I had to say, and basically ended up telling me that I shouldn't have been surprised by the breakup since, in her words, ""I told you early on I wanted something casual"", and told me she never had any deeper feelings for me - that I was basically like a friend who was meaningful in her life for a time. 

This ran completely contrary to all my perceptions of our relationship and her feelings. 

I've dated a decent amount over the years - both casually and seriously - and this felt SO far from casual. She said yes without hesitation when I asked her to officially be my girlfriend, she told her friends and family about me, she introduced me to her friends, she wanted to see me several times a week and do things like a cute Valentine's day date, she'd plan things for us multiple weeks in advance, she'd go out of her way to make small gestures that showed care/affection, we'd hang out well into the morning of the next day after sleeping over, and she asked to join me on a solo vacation I was planning.

As for her feelings, while it wasn't really verbalized, it felt very evident she had deeper feelings through everything from the way she'd hold me and cuddle with me to the way she'd make small considerate gestures, playfully refuse to let go of me in the morning, visibly demonstrate emotions when I'd tell her about successes or frustrations I had with work or other things, text me regularly throughout the day, engage in deep conversations, show genuine interest in my life/interests/career, tell me about her past, and on and on.

Its leaving me incredibly confused and sad that it seemed like there was something so special there, and now either she's outright in denial or I was just dead wrong in thinking there was. She told me it sounded like I made a lot of assumptions about what was there...and yeah, I probably should have communicated about that more, but it felt so obvious that I didn't feel like there was any ambiguity to resolve. If I wasn't wrong in my perception of it, then I really don't get how she could so abruptly shift from being so affectionate and caring (and literally never demonstrating even the slightest sign of being anything but sweet, caring and empathetic) to being cold, patronizing, and hurtful, and denying any significant connection between us.

Just don’t reach out to them and don’t expect them to call you and such.

Reason for asking because I ask a woman if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said she had to think about it. So I took nothing of it and went about my day.

We got into an argument when ended the dating, and she said we are boyfriend and girlfriend. We never discuss exclusiveness to each other ever since I brought it that one time.

I get it where she was coming from, but she said those things. My mind went to that she had someone else if she discarded me like that. 

The argument was about me having female friends that called me babe. I told them hey I’m seeing someone, but I can’t control them. I gave  my phone to the person I am dating so they can look at it. I had nothing to hide, I let them scroll through  my messages and calls. 

But she always took her phone everywhere. Bathroom and slept with it under her pillow. And such. There was a time I ask her if she was dating anyone else besides me. She said no but switch it around on me saying anyone who ask that is seeing or dating other people. 

I’m in my mid 30’s and my jobs takes me to places and travels for work. I really don’t have time to try date other people because my jobs are hazardous. 

She said no, but her taking and sleeping with her phone says a lot. Never meet anyone that does that. 
There was a time I mentioned to her why did she like me and why she choose me. I told why I like her and chose her.

I (26M) am kind of new here and I would love to get your advice.

The other day I went on the third date with a girl (27M) I met on an a dating app. Turned out we had some common friends, and we went for drinks twice in the park. We seemed to be getting along quite well. Soon after the second second she invited me to have dinner at her place a few days later, and I said yes. 

The day before our date, she texted me with this blushing emoji that her housemate was not coming home the night of our dinner. I interpreted this as signal that she might be into more. I don’t know, what would it matter if her housemate was there or not if we were just having dinner?

She cooked me a really nice meal, and I cleaned the kitchen for her. After dinner, we sat on the couch and she starts kissing me for maybe half an hour. Together with the fact that she said her housemate was not coming home that night, I thought that she might be into more, but I didn’t explicitly ask her if she wanted to sleep with me beforehand. I think that would be a very weird thing to do. But as time passed, it was soon time for me to make decision, because the last train back home would leave soon. So I asked: “Would you like me to go upstairs and spend the night here with you?”. She said that she does not wants things to go so quickly, which I understood. I then said: “I understand if you want things to go slowly. Because of the way I interpreted your text message and the fact that we have been kissing for so long, I expected to spend the night here. But that means I have to go now, since my train will leave very soon.” Then I immediately left.

Today she texted me that she felt disgusted and harassed by the fact that I expected to spend the night there without telling her, and she wants to end things from here. Am I at fault her? Did I misinterpreted her signals? Should I have asked her beforehand? I makes me look in the mirror. Am I that type of guy that harasses woman, that so many woman seem to have faced in their life?

By chance I don’t mean serious dating but more like a kiss or a fling, just some experience because I am rather unexperienced (kissed only one guy and dated one non officially).

&amp;#x200B;

This year at the language school where I am studying/ doing a course there are s many Japanese students. I like japanese food and I am interested in the culture or learning Japanese etc

&amp;#x200B;

We had a welcome party for new students last friday at the residence and everyone was nice and friendly, we drank a lot (everyone is over 18-21 years old, I am the youngest actually).

&amp;#x200B;

We talked, ate some omelette and played games, everyone seemed to have fun etc

&amp;#x200B;

At some point we played never I ever as part of a drinking game and when it was my turn I said I never had a boyfriend. Some were surprised but one guy who eas being loud and drunk all night said ‘of course you have’ which sounded confusing? I didn’t think much of it then.

&amp;#x200B;

After the game I noticed he was staring at me in a strange way. Idk if it was alcohol but it seemed like an horny look? There were plenty of guys and I didn’t get that vibe from everyone obviously, his look was an intense stare.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he approached me and started asking me a lot of questions, we are here to improve out english so we all speak a lot and he asked what I want to do in the future. Also he started saying why I want to be a teacher, there would be better things for me etc

&amp;#x200B;

He asked about my culture and language (italian), he also said I looked nice and the whole thing was interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived to the party past 7 and I left at 2 am because me and the guy were talking a lot. He also laughed at everything I said for some reason and he seemed to have fun. He would say strange stuff like ‘you are going to be a mother one day’, ‘I think you would be a good teacher’ etc

&amp;#x200B;

He also said I am really nice, outgoing and confident because I told him I was shy back in my country etc

&amp;#x200B;

I left late but I was tired af but basically in the group chat it is dead, there is every student present in Malta but today I posted if somebody wants to hang out let me know etc, I was left on read.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is so friendly in person so idk

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen a number but i am not sure it is him tbh, he told me he is going back to Japan this june and he has been here for over a year. Basically the group chat is dead and I am in the group so I am sure he is in there but idk

&amp;#x200B;

Should I let it go or try to see him again? Was it friendly? I randomly got a tiny crush but idk if I am overthinking it

About two years later they broke up and in situations where there were a fe of our classmates together she asked my name, tried to talk to me and that was the time of my life. 

I always tried to interact with her the chances i had in hallways and her bday was on vacation time. I was gonna buy her a gift she for sure was gonna like but ended up having no bday party. 

Its a long story, so to sum up, she always said how much she wanted her ex boyfriend back. One day i offered her a ride but she didnt want. 

She kept giving me many mixed signals and we talked online. I saw her looking at me during class and stuff, liking my pictures even when she had a boyfriend, adding me on Facebook on a saturday night. 

So two weeks later i was gonna approach her in person so i dont look like a class freak and she showed up dating her recent nee best friend. 

She had me on instagram and unfollowed me, but even after the new boyfriend she is always looking at me and going everywhere i am for no reason.

Here goes: I have recently been questioning my romantic/sexual orientation and have begun thinking I might be aromantic allosexual. For those not in the know, this label refers to folks who do not feel romantic attraction, but do feel sexual attraction. The reason I've arrived at this (and I'll try to spare you too many details) is that I often feel sexually attracted to people, but very rarely (if ever) have the desire to pursue anything deeper than that. The one time in my life I've ever (possibly) felt romantic attraction was in college. She was the first female friend I'd ever had that I was sexually attracted to, so I think it's very possible I was conflating sexual desire for romantic feelings. I've never been in a relationship, and have never wanted one either. I enjoy being solo. I love having deep friendships, but that's enough for me. I always just sort of assumed that this was how everyone felt. Until recently, I took it for granted that relationships were essentially just friendships (the closest possible kind, of course) with the addition of sex. To put it in mathematical terms: feelings of closeness (i.e. very close friendship) + sexual attraction = romantic attraction. This was always my assumption. However, I've heard that romantic feelings are supposed to involve more than that. I often hear romance described as a strong desire to be with the person all the time, a desire to share your life with them. To never be apart. I've simply never felt that way about anyone before. If I enjoy being with someone, it's in the same way I enjoy being with a really good friend, but never anything deeper. If I have desire for closeness it's entirely sexual. Sorry, I know that's a lot of context. But, finally, here is my question: for those of you who have experienced what you know to be romantic attraction, what was/is it like? Is it essentially what I've always assumed (friendship + wanting to bump uglies) or is there more to it than that? Please be as honest and forthright as possible. I'm genuinely very curious about this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,774161,public,self,Help me understand the nature of romantic attraction please?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ncig7t/help_me_understand_the_nature_of_romantic/,all_ads,6,,,

We’ve been in everyday contact (during work and outside of work - calling &amp; texting) for the past 7 months. He initiates the calls/texts 95% of the time. We have a very bantery dynamic. From the few convos we’ve had on the matter, he gave the impression that he is interested but he’s cautious - he mentioned that he has heard horror stories about recordable media and coworkers. However, it is all very ambiguous and I have no idea what he’s thinking (ie whether he’s ACTUALLY interested) and I’d like to find out. However, the possibility of him turning around and saying that we’re “just coworkers” and that he’s “sorry for giving me the wrong impression” is stopping me because work would just be too awkward. 

Can anyone offer any advice on how to go about asking him what he’s thinking without it being awkward? Is it even worth asking? From your perspective, does it sounds like he could be romantically interested or it’s just platonic?

And I had also deleted my Instagram because he didn’t like pictures of me with the boys that were on it. So I installed it again and made a fresh profile. A guy from my past sent me a follow request, I didn’t accept. Then a few months later, he asked me what has happened, what is wrong with me. So I told him that my boyfriend didn’t appreciate the kind of situation we had so I am just trying to make this work. He said he understood. i said okay. Then he sent me a follow request again.

So today in the home of my father and his girlfriend has arrived a friend of them, she work in germany but she is from Poland as well the girlfriend of my father ( we are Italians ) .
So I was so happy about the fact she stay here for some days cause at least I have somebody to speak with , she can speak German and English but we speak only German so I can improve this language,  and I did it without problem,  cause we talked a lot about our interests our life and our projects , in facts we decided that tomorrow we will go together to work out .
Today evening we were planning to go shopping and just buying something to eat , we had a long walk to the market and did shopping , sometimes we laughed a bit or have joking , sometime we looked directly in our eyes and she was smiling , at the  i took the responsibility to bring the heavy begs till home , she was worrying if I can do it , when I said that there were no problem she took my arms as she would walk arm in arm , and feel it and then she took her arm away , literally in that times i got confusing cause I don't know her so much , she is a friend of my father and she is 37 , I didn't think she was attracted to me but , all what I was thinking is that she is only sweet and nice , and maybe she understood that take my arm was enough! 
Anyway we smoked cigarettes at the park and then we come back to home,  when she was tired and wanted to sleep she was sitting near me on the sofa ( that is so much large and have a lot of space) and put her head on my shoulder a lot of times , I didn't miss the occasions to talk her about her jobs she was so interested about , and I caressed her head when she was lying on me ! And literally I didn't believing that ! I didn't know what to do , and I'm the kind of guy who doesn't express so much emotions even though I would like , the last night I was just crying cause I was feeling alone and without a person to love , and that I rely all on study and work to not think about that, and now suddenly she appears and treat me so sweet , literally I had a thrill when she took my arm .
Now when the girlfriend of my father has come back to home she talked with her , about me too ! She ( the gf of mh father ) said me that she ( her friend ) thinks I m a nice and sweet guy , but then added that she is as well other Polish girl , sweet and loving , and that doesn't mean she want to have sex with me , literally I was calm and I reply that I did know it , but that has killed me , not for sex , but because for another time I end up feeling hurted again,  and literally I didn't want sex , I m one who wants to take time to have sex cause I need to feel a connection that is emotional and having trust of the other , I m not a teenager who think about sex each time a girl look at him , the only thing I wanted is to feel love , to love and being loved , to smile each other,  cause I think sex is something that comes next to the connection between two persons .
She was adding that she has to say me something else tomorrow,  and nothing else. 
Please stop thinking that we men/guy want to have only sex , that s ridiculous,  I'm feeling so shamed about this , I cannot show emotions to a girl I feel connection that suddenly she thinks I want to use her for sex ... 
I know that the term "" nice guy "" is so much offensive nowadays cause it is related to a kind of guy who seems to be nice but in reality he is egoistic and sometimes has a bit of misogyny,  well I m the contrary,  I m perceived as egoistic by a lot of person who knows me a bit , but when I give emotions isn't for sex , when I talk or know a girl I don't expect that she loves me or has sex with me , but I don't like being treated like an animal or being ghosted , that s cause me a lot of pain,  being rejected cause pain to all , but I know I have to deal with myself and I don't want to create problem to others , I know and I think someone can do what she/he wants , but nobody want to be used or being the second choice,  I was treated like that,  I m still dealing with that,  but I still want to express my self , my emotion , my love , without being related to a sexual pervert...
I think I will wait tomorrow and listen what she wants to say me .

Soo, it was pretty solid actually. We met and hugged (no biggie) and talked directly about some casual things. We had on multiple occasions eye contact on our way to the café. Idk we walked like 10mins or 15 to the café. I bought a coffee latte for her and a cappuccino for me. 

We wanted to drink the coffee on our way so we started directly from there. We still talked normal and had eye contact more and more... and then it happened. :D We didn’t even begin to drink and she dropped her cup... She was embarrassed af and that was actually really fucking sweet but from then on she more or less avoided eye contact for the most part of the date. I couldn’t care less so I told her about some of my embarrassing moments I had in my life to loosen up the situation which kinda helped lol but only kinda 

We walked to the next café and I offered to pay for another cup of coffee for her but she insisted to pay for herself which was okay.

We talked again about casual things and I just knew that it was dumb to confess that i actually like her more than a friend. She was still embarrassed about it because she brought up jokes about dogs licking up the coffee and stuff. So I simply just threw my plans over board haha. I tried to make more physical contact (like touching her arm) but I was actually too shy for that. That’s the only thing I regret but what ever :D

Our 2 hours where we walked around a lake and some parks were actually pretty quickly over. I still don’t know if she likes me more than a friend but we will see :D

She drove me home because she offered it and we hugged again.

And that was it.

I later learned from a mutual friend who kinda brought us closer together that she is embarrassed af because she dropped the cup. So I sent her a snap and mentioned that it was really really no problem that she dropped it to which she replied with a roundsnap. 

I guess she needs time now and I am sure that she doesn’t know what to feel atm and that’s fine for me. She is a really smart and good looking girl. I hope that we can date more in the future but I’m even fine with her being a good friend to me. 

We finished with school this year already and we were class mates for 2 years. We talked before but never us two and so personal.

What do you think? Any tips for future me?

During these 50 days a lot happened. We partied with a tiny group often (is allowed in my country) and apparently I layed my head in her lap on one occasion. I was really drunk that evening and hit my head while driving home with my bicycle on a lamp post so I lost every memory of that evening lol. We are good friends now and can talk normally.

Like this isn't a first date as we've dated briefly before but I'm curious what things you do to kinda I guess make it like a date and not aimlessly driving around somewhere. All the dates I've been (including our first) was going for a drink/seeing a movie etc. Its not exactly like a *serious* date date as we've been speaking for ages but this is the first time we've been able to meet and i wanna make it special.

I don't really know the area she's from so I don't exactly know anywhere cool to go, and with rona many shit is still closed.

If you've done this date before what stuff did you do? Did you just vibe and chill to music or find somewhere cool to go?

Like i've done some stuff like i made a custom playlist on Spotify that she found pretty cute",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,774390,public,self,"The girl i wanna date wants to go on a drive, how can i like not screw it up?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ncljjj/the_girl_i_wanna_date_wants_to_go_on_a_drive_how/,all_ads,6,,,

My sheltered, introverted lifestyle for the first 20+ years of my life is to blame for this. Literally never made any effort to get to know women.
