1,o5gaec,1624343312,Preference shaming?,"A little overview: I‚Äôm a 21 year old mixed male. Around 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and live in a pretty diverse state in the United States. 

I‚Äôm not getting into the dating scene‚Ä¶yet‚Ä¶I‚Äôm working on myself, working out, saving money and trying to make more money, etc. But with that being said, I do tend to get crushes here and there. I know that some people have preferences when it comes to the opposite sex. As for me, I tend to gravitate towards Asian women around my age. 

Now, I know what everyone is thinking: ‚ÄúYou like Asian women? You only have a fetish for them.‚Äù And everyone unfortunately does think that way. But why? Yes, I like Asian women, I like Asian culture, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have a fetish for them. I‚Äôve never really been around Asian women growing up. I even recall being friends with a Japanese girl back in middle school. She always liked talking to me and I always did too. But then she left and I never saw her again, realizing later on that she liked me. So now I have a thing for them. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean that I ONLY have a thing for Asian women. I like other races as well. I‚Äôve grown up with Caucasian, Black, Latin, Mixed, and many other races and have many crushes on them before. For me, Asian women are a higher caliber due to me not associating with them before. 

So I ask, is it wrong to have a preference in race? Even though I don‚Äôt mind other races? Or is it terrible thinking?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5gaec/preference_shaming/

I made a bumble account and only swiped people whom I found super attractive 

I matched with most of them and had decent conversations, some more friendly, some more flirty 

It's all good so far, I can match, I can talk and they usually compliment me how they enjoyed the conversation or just find things cute

Then someone asks me to meet, that's why I get so anxious, cause these people seem kind of out of my league?

I start to question, what if my picture was deceiving? (I mean everyone's is, but) or what if I lose interest, am I a bad peeson for just keeping it casual, just so many blocks that I  like deleting the app, I just joined to see the best I can get

And this guy is so attractive, I said something stupid cause he gave me butterflies lol, and I don't want to meet him until i get in better shape, like his face is motivating me to workout and what not

I have dating profiles. I hate taking pictures of myself right now, but I feel like the person in the dating profiles doesn't resembles what I look like now. To be honest, I don't feel like myself, and the men I'm typically attracted to likely wouldn't be attracted to me.

13,o5hoxe,1624348747,Why are there a million dating sites for BBW but no good ones for big dudes.,"I just wanna put this out there and see what's said. I'm a 41 year old 6'2"" 275 to 290 depending on the day guy. I have been looking on line trying to find someplace that is directed to guys like me. I know there are women out there that like us big dudes but there isn't really a place I have found. If I'm wrong pl ease let me know. I have spent weeks actually months looking. Signed up for a hundred sites that seem like maybe but it always turns out to really be for bbw. I have no problem with bbws having places for them to find a guy. I get it I'm in same boat but it's extremely one sided from what I have seen. Why can't a big dude have someplace to find love too shit. I know for a fact that there alot more ladies out there that like them some big men. They don't have to be bbw or any other crazy acronym. Just normal everyday every size every walk of life women. Listen us big guys already get enough bad looks and stuff said behind our back that hurts. We already have to find clothes in big and tall or something like it. We have to squeeze into tiny airplane seats or cars. We already get the calls from friends to help move heavy shit all the time. We deal with a lot of shit most ""normal guys"" don't. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see good women with piece of shit ""normal guys"" because thats what they think they want and it's socially acceptable. I'll tell you this right now. Most of us big guys are way better human beings with bigger hearts and would be able to protect way better then these gym rats"" I did 1000 crunches today"". Good for you I ate 20 tacos today and can still out lift you. Wait wait wait ok I'm sounding negative toward them. If they like to work out more power to them. The ones I don't like are the ones that think they are God's gift and that they deserve to play women for fool and treat them like trash. So please except my apology decent gym rats lol. I'm just saying while the bad ones are lifting weights to attract more women they will just ruin for the rest of us.  Shit half the time those guys are smaller then the burrito I just ate. Look I know I'm not perfect I know my shape isn't the ideal model build but I guarantee any lady I'm with will have a smile on her face all day everyday if she would legitimately give it a chance. Most of us are that way. I get we may not be chiseled out of stone and have always been frowned on as unhealthy dirty sweaty and smelly. That's just not true for most of us. I am aware that I sweat after a hard day at work so take another shower it's not rocket science. Fact is that the way we get looked at treated and shunned by people just shows that we are not the ugly ones those of you who look at us disgusted those of you who snicker behind our back (which we hear clearly). Those of you who think your to good to give us a chance. Especially those of you who think you are any kind of better then we are. You my friends you are the ugly disgusting ones. Your the ones that give people depression problems, self esteem issues, cause good loving caring human beings commit suicide, and destroy the happiness of countless people that are 1000000 times better humans then you ever will be. But hey what do I know I'm just a lonely fat dude trying to find a site to maybe find love like everyone else has. Yet again for some reason there isn't. That's my rant let's see what's happens.

14,o5hzmn,1624349953,Is it over?,"There are very little people that are going to read past the second sentence, so if you do, I thank you for taking the time to hear me out despite your initial reaction.
I am a pathological liar. Well, sort of. 
For as long as I can remember, I've always ran from the truth. My truth felt insignificant to that of everyone else and I wanted, too, to feel like my existence had value. So time and time again, I created facades. I wanted to be someone else. I created backgrounds for these characters I was portraying as if in a fictional world. I've lied about my birth place, my family, my history, my background. I became my lies and without them, I trembled and panicked, psychologically tormenting myself into believing that these lies were the only thing keeping me safe from rejection. At night, my bones screamed because they hated my skin so much. I became so disgusted with myself that I felt my heart bounce around my lungs, looking for someone else, someone more deserving to live through. I wanted to stop so badly. But then, I met her.
I met her on an online game- yeah, I know. We were talking for a while, getting along so well that it took us hours before we even told each other our names. She told me hers, but then she asked for mine. My name. What's my name? Who am I? We were getting along so well that the question felt like a punch to the face, seeing as I didn't have to be someone I wasn't before. I was just being me. And now? I was coming up with a name, a persona, a background. Immediately, I lied, alongside an attached picture I had downloaded from a follower of mine on social media. For days after that, I began to get interested in her. I beat myself up over these feelings. ""I know I shouldn't get involved,"" I told myself. I'm so used to being unwanted that even speaking to her felt like I was walking along a thin line with no railing. Then suddenly, the railing broke, flinging me several hundred feet from
in the sky. ""Can we talk on the phone?"" she asked. I couldn't. Because I'm a girl. And I certainly wasn't the guy in the photo. 

Every one has seen catfish. The ""I don't have a mic"" or ""My mic is broken"" doesn't work anymore. I said yes. I put on my deepest voice and tried to talk to her as little as possible. Something wasn't right. She knew. She accused me of being a catfish. I denied it. She accused me again. I told her to leave me alone. I told her to run as fast as she could and to leave me alone. I had been caught and now, embarrassed and ashamed, the only thing I could do was tell her to leave so that she wouldn't get anymore attached to a piece of shit. ""What's your name?"" She asked. ""My name is still _______""
I was so confused. Why was she being nice? Why was she willing to associate with someone that had for almost a week, lied to her? I told her my real name, along with the fact that I was NOT a boy, bur in fact a girl. She laughed. ""Okay. You don't have to lie to me anymore. Don't worry about it. You wanna get on the video chat?"" 
Baffled, I couldn't help but laugh. I accepted. She told me that someone as attractive as I should never catfish. All I could do was wonder who sent her. What good karma did I pile up to deserve someone as amazing as her? 
We have been together (in a long distance relationship) for almost a year now. Although our relationship is far from perfect, it is still perfect to me. I have not told any lies since that day, to anyone. I live my life honestly and I try my best to make my girlfriend feel as loved as possible. When she feels insecure, I reassure her. Yeah, she gets insecure a lot, but who doesn't? I don't mind reassuring her. Through time, she began to accuse me things like cheating or not being sexually attracted to her after not being in the mood for sex. All of this is something I decided to stick by and help her through. After all, I wasn't lying or cheating so what was the big deal with reassuring her I wasn't? 

However, up until a week ago, there were things I lied about in the beginning that I had been scared to death to come clean about. These were not big lies, not that it matters. They were little things, like whether or not I've ever lived somewhere or whether or not I've done random things. They were lies stemming from my self esteem problems and never have I lied to her about HER. But still, I feared that 1. She wouldn't like me anymore, and 2. She would be upset that I waited so long to tell her. With every day, it had become so hard to talk to her, to bring it up. Finally, I told her. She took a step back. She wasn't upset, which may sound amazing, but...
She wasn't upset because she didn't care. She didn't feel much of anything, actually. She said she felt empty and numb. She said that she didn't believed a fu**ing thing I said, that everything I said was bullshit. All I could do was sit there. I mean, was she wrong? No, not at all. She told me she would talk to me later. I sat there. Minutes turned into hours and when hours turned into days, I started to believe ""later"" was a synonym for ""never."" Who was to blame for this? Me? My parents? Their parents? History? Society? Culture? No matter how I looked at it, I was the only one to blame. 


After days of waiting, she finally talked to me. My lying makes her feel insecure. It makes her feel as though she cannot rely on me to be honest in situations where she needs reassurance. She told me I didn't love her, that I thought she was ugly. I don't. I don't think she's ugly. I do love her. I love her more than anything. Her words sounded like curse words but all I could do is accept it. She told me she can't be in this relationship anymore but all I could do was accept that, too. After all, I got myself here. I tried to tell her that I've changed, that since we met I haven't lied and that my mental health has improved so much that I became someone I could be proud of. She won't listen and honestly, she shouldn't. I don't want pity. All I want to know is whether or not I should fight for this or if I should accept that I deserve to be alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5hzmn/is_it_over/

16,o5i47x,1624350474,I (15M) Don't Know What to do With a girl I Really Like (15F),"About a month ago I met a girl almost completely by chance, I had asked her brother about a month before hand if she was single and a freshman, and while I was waiting for my ride, him and his sister came up to me and long story short, I ended up getting her number. we texted for a couple weeks and she really grew on me as a person, she's so sweet, cute, and doesn't know her worth. So one night were talking about our crushes and she's describing hers, and of course, she completely describes me and her, I was even on facetime with another female friend and she told me to go for it. so I did, and long story short, she had a crush on another guy, and I had guessed wrong.

But, she did also say ""At one point I really did think I liked you, but my feelings for my crush were stronger"" and the next day at school, she told another female friend ""I can genuinely see myself getting with -insert my real name- but he caught me at a bad time"" and felt really bad about the situation in general. so about four days later I decide to text her again after taking a little break because I kind of broke down after I got friend zoned, even though I cared about her so much. things go well, and were on good terms again. so we have been texting for a few weeks every day until she has to go to bed, the conversations aren't dry, she responds quickly, and we flirt occasionally (but to be fair she did flirt with me even though she liked another guy!)

but tonight things got... interesting. she asked me if I still liked her because she was ""still curious"" so I took what I thought was the best route and didn't tell her. she wouldn't take that for an answer and seemed *really* curious (I don't know why exactly) I'm just completely lost because I feel like ill get friend zoned again if I actually tell her my feelings, but she's pushing me so much to reveal them too her that I think it'll go well. I have *completely* mixed feelings about this. I really like her and would hate to lose a chance with her because she's never had a good relationship with a guy and they've all treated her like garbage, so I just wanna make it right.

TL;DR: I have completely mixed feelings about what I should do with a girl I really care about.

Both of my parents abandoned me and showing affection hasn't been easy... I had an ex and of course I was a wrong choice since he told me he was experimenting back then and wasn't anything serious. 

I kept trying to date people... I work a lot and I meet people at work who are also desperate or married. Last year I met this interesting guy who approached me himself and ended up assaulting me.

18,o5i6jw,1624350749,How much do girls actually care about looks?,"I know the general consensus is always: ""looks are temporary, personality is what matters, confidence and kindness trumps good looks any day.."", etc, and that's all great and all. I'm completely in agreeance with all that, and have honestly believed that for years. However I've come to believe that looks matter more than they are played out to matter. Let's be real here, **looks do matter**. Though the extent to which they do so vary drastically depending on the individual, they certainly do matter.

For example, many of my friends (mainly dudes) are great people. In my opinion they are all kind, considerate, have confidence, etc. Yet, not many of them have girlfriends. The ones that do have girlfriends, surprise, are actually quite attractive physically as well. I feel like your looks honestly determines a lot about a girl's initial interest in you, and sometimes you really need that interest for them to actually get to know you better. 

Now, I'm no Greek God when it comes to how I look but speaking from experience, there was this one girl who I really liked. We talked practically every day for half a year (mainly not in person due to COVID; this was last year), and honestly I felt we had a pretty strong connection/bond. When we met again in person, initially she seemed very interested, but that interest quickly faded. Now, this may just be me being insecure or whatever, but honestly, sometimes I believe that's just because I'm not extremely attractive or anything. I'd say I'm very slightly above average in terms of looks, at best. 

Now, here's the kicker. Turns out while we texted she actually was in a relationship(?) with someone else. It's kind of strange because the texts she was sending me would definitely not fly with her partner if she was dating someone at the time, so I'm led to believe that they started dating after I stopped texting her. Anyways, now this dude I'm really not sure, maybe she saw something in him that I missed but I feel his and her personalities do not conflate well at all. But, he is conventionally pretty attractive - 6ft, lean/physically fit, good face, curly hair - , and as superficial as this may sound, I believe she was into him for his looks. But alas, since she was happy(?) with her relationship I supported it. Honestly the entire relationship reeked of superficiality, as this dude she was with practically had other close friends who were girls who were fawning over him, and whenever we'd see him he'd be with like 2 other chicks at all times. Yet, she still put up with and tolerated all that and I'm honestly quite clueless as to what she bases her attraction to him off of aside from looks, because, as I've said before their personalities really did not appear to match on the outside. But who knows maybe there was more development between them that I am unaware of.

Anyways, fast forward to now and it turns out they broke up apparently.

Basically, I have a pretty strong hunch that she was mainly more so in a relationship with him based off of his physical looks. and, while I know the topic is usually downplayed in society like ""looks don't matter, personality over looks, etc, etc"", I feel as though having good looks honestly can increase a person's interest in you regardless. Which then, naturally, makes it easier for them to get to know you better afterwards.

So yeah, how much do girls actually care about looks, honestly?

So my question is: cos MeetMe has a lot of features, would i have to do a bit of everything (i.e. messaging people out of the blue, swiping, chat rooms etc.) to make the most of it, or could I just swipe as if it were Tinder and still get the same results? Im asking cos i dont want to overly invest myself in OLD, and I'll be using Tinder and FB Dating alongside it anyway which just use the casual swipe model.

23,o5j1r4,1624354606,i think i got assaulted? what do i do?,"i (18,m) recently (may 2021) hooked up with a girl (21) i met at the gym after she approached me and told me she had been watching me for a while. i was still a senior in high-school and she was a 3rd year film student. we went to grab a coffee and because it started raining, she invited me over to her apartment as she lived very close by. i obviously accepted and thought nothing of it (it‚Äôs very common here to invite people to your place, even absolute strangers because the weather is absolutely terrible), especially due to the thunderstorm that was going on. once we arrived, she offered me some beer and i refused because i highly dislike alcohol, and she told me to take a seat in the living room and turn on the TV while she poured herself a drink. 

it was all very cozy and normal, i turned on the TV and opened netflix, chose a random action movie with statham and waited for her. when she came back, which took like 7 mins, she was completely naked and after setting her drink down on the table she started kissing me and took off my shirt. we made out while she sat on my lap, and i enjoyed it, but when i felt her reach for my pants, i panicked and pushed her away gently (she was still on my lap, i just wanted to signal that i didn‚Äôt want to do anything more than kiss), but she didn‚Äôt even notice and in a matter of 1-2 minutes i was in my underwear while we were still making out.

the movie was still playing, so i suggested that we watched it, because i was so scared of what she was about to do, but she totally ignored me and started stroking my dick and told me to take off my underwear, which i refused to do. i told her i‚Äôd rather watch the movie or have something to eat, i even offered to cook for her while we waited for the thunderstorm to stop, but she blatantly pretended to not hear me, and took off my underwear herself. i got hard and she started laughing and when i told her i‚Äôd rather leave, because i was so uncomfortable with what she was doing, but she started giving me a blow job, and once again i tried pushing her away but she seemed to be having fun. 

after like 2 minutes of me insisting that i left that very moment, she forced herself on me even more and put my hand on her boob and forced me to squeeze it, then she began telling me to put it in. i got incredibly scared and panicked, and i told her i don‚Äôt want to do that, but she forced me to squeeze her boobs more and said she has a reward for me if i fucked her. i don‚Äôt lose my temper easily but it all got so scary‚Äî i had just turned 18 not even a month prior and never engaged in sexual intercourse before, so i didn‚Äôt even know how to do it, not to mention i didn‚Äôt want to, and specifically told her that multiple times‚Äî and i shoved her away (we were on the sofa, she fell against the table), and got up, grabbed my clothes and got dressed.

she was still naked and obviously upset. it didn‚Äôt help that i urged her to unlock the door and give me my jacket and umbrella (she had put them away in the bathroom for them to dry), so i could leave, so she slapped me across the face and hit me with my own umbrella. i didn‚Äôt say anything and just took my chance to leave as soon as possible. am i exaggerating or is it really that now that i think about it, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ assault?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5j1r4/i_think_i_got_assaulted_what_do_i_do/

27,o5jk76,1624356607,Was I reading it wrong?,"Earlier this year, I got out of a 9yr abusive relationship I am now 25 (F), a single mom, financially stable, and definitely emotionally available. The last 2 years of staying with baby daddy were solely for the purpose of ""trying"". All shitty things are done to me: cheating, using me financially and frankly, I do not see anything would change so I GTFO of that. My kid is with me.

I never thought I'd be lonely, so me trying dating apps was kind of a shock to me too. I met this guy approaching his late twenties. Very mature, introvert, financially doing OK, and the right amount of hotness I can date.  After a few chats, we figured we did click. He knows my history and anxieties, and have been very emotionally available. He's the extreme opposite of my ex and I feel like finally, a guy I can definitely consider dating.

Our setup was just exclusive FWB - mainly because I am not sure where things will lead to, I just got out of an extremely toxic relationship. But it is clear to both me and him that I have no more feelings or plans of getting back with my ex. 

We met more than a couple of times and even went on a holiday. We've been seeing each other for a month.  Over chat, he says he likes and eventually loved me but finds it really hard to tell me when we are together. His actions are definitely lovey-dovey so I don't mind not hearing how much he likes me. He keeps sending mixed signals. Subtly getting upset with my kid's dad, wanting to meet my parents and my kid.

It got to a point where I confronted him, ""these signals are confusing me, so what are we?"" he answers ""FWB but we are more likely dating"". So of course, I asked why not make it official then? Says he can't. He's afraid of commitment. So I ended it. I see no point in staying in that situation.

I really like him, enough to entertain the idea of dating and labeling us. It did pain me ending things like that, as all was going well. Thinking I overreacted, I reached out after an hour or so, asking for us to try again the FWB thing.

Found out he blocked me all over socmed and my phone number. So there I moved on. No point wasting my time even if he likes - loves me.

Talked to my friends about this situation, and they said either: he's with someone else or he's afraid anytime I'll get back with my ex. At that point, I really don't care.

Just a few days ago I found out he's checking my social media again and unblocked me. This gives me hope and I hate it. Sometimes I think of reaching out to him...but I don't want to look super desperate. I'd rather wait for him to contact me... kinda mean that he's really into me.

Should I reach out to him? I feel like I am running out of time and energy in dating... I am really into settling down. I know some would think I am way too young to think of that, but I'm the type who dates with intention of settling down. But this guy,  I really love his company, the connection, the sex - everything... makes me consider just having fun.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5jk76/was_i_reading_it_wrong/

The day after the date, I gave my honest impression of what it was like (awkward first date and I wanted to go for a 2nd round). The girl went ""oh you went on a date?"". I was dumbstruck by it to be honest, she had no idea that it was a date. I made it clear that she was the one who said it was a date and she understood and gave her impressions.

Still, I got a second date with her, but the fact that she forgot it was a date kinda blew me off tbh. Or maybe she was just trying to make sure I was talking about *our* date and not with someone elses? I honestly dont know what to think? That said, she's definitely put up effort in planning the date, its not like she was just joking around being unserious like it was just a hangout. Is it worth going? What should I do?

What?,"So there is this smoke shop near my house that I frequent and there is this cute little blonde girl with a nice butt that works there as a manager. I took a liking to this girl and would talk to her more and more each time I went in to buy something. After a few times of shopping there and having small talk, she was showing me a torch lighter one Saturday, and during a brief pause in the conversation, I asked her if she‚Äôd like to hang out sometime, and her reply was ‚Äúyeah, we can hang out sometime‚Äù, which she said with a smile, like she was waiting for me to ask her something like that, given all the prior occasions I had come into the store and what not. After she said that, I got her number from her, and payed for the torch lighter she was showing me, told her I‚Äôd text her and left. One week later, on Saturday, I texted her for the first time and asked her if she was working that day, and she said she was. I needed to buy some lighter fuel so I went up there and bought a can and chatted with her briefly, as it was kind of busy in the store. The following Wednesday, I think it was, I texted her asking what she was doing later after work. No response. The following week, gave it another try, only I asked if she was working because I legitimately needed something, and again, nothing. I still have her number, and haven‚Äôt texted her since, because if they don‚Äôt show me any effort to converse, then they obviously aren‚Äôt worth my time, which disappoints me still, because she seemed like the type I would get along well with, and I am currently trying to snuff a long dry spell, and thought that for sure, I had that one in the bag. I just don‚Äôt know why she would have given me her number and through body language, make it seem clear that she was into me. Normally this shit wouldn‚Äôt cause me to post about it here on Reddit, but for some reason, I just want others real, honest opinions on the matter. Another factor is age, she is 21 and I don‚Äôt normally go that young, but I made an exception for her and now think maybe I should have known this is how it would go. I am 32.

I like the guy. I‚Äôm attracted to him, seems like we have things in common but the way he texting me is turning me off real quick.


I ran into him in the morning and throughout the day he kept getting me to try to get me to step out and see him again that day.

At one point my parents came up in convo and he referred to him as his future in laws. My birthday is coming up and he even suggested he would get me a gift. 

I ended up falling asleep last night before he texted this but he asked me last night to video call.

All of this seems so quick. I‚Äôm literally writing this post 24 hours after I‚Äôve met this man.

They would go from zero confidence to all of a sudden thinking they were a 10 (um, yah they gained confidence, but sucks for me because they became an asshole). Honestly, these guys never had anything going for them either, on top of not being great looking. One guy though, most recently, did make six figures. He just offered up this information, very awkwardly, of course, like ‚Äúis that good?‚Äù I‚Äôm not a gold-digger, but I did get a little excited about that just because I‚Äôm so used to losers who make less than me or have no ambition or unemployed gamers, so I‚Äôm thinking, oh good, I won‚Äôt have to pay for everything and maybe I could be spoiled for once. \*Sigh\* My god he couldn‚Äôt even make that work for himself to be more desirable. He was incredibly cheap and everything in his home looked about 30 years old. I‚Äôm not super materialistic, but I like nice things (not expensive). I like nice furniture, nice d√©cor in my home, nice cars, nice clothes, and I like to look nice overall. These nerdy guys never care about anything and it frustrates the hell out of me. They always try to argue that this type of stuff doesn‚Äôt matter. Sorry, but it matters. Looks matter in this world. The way you‚Äôre presenting yourself MATTERS. The way you have your home MATTERS, especially if you‚Äôre trying to bring girls home with you! I never wanted to step foot in that guy‚Äôs home ever again (on top of everything being very old, the place was disgusting).

I‚Äôm now tired of these types of guys complaining about not getting girlfriends because I‚Äôve learned from too much experience with them, there is always a very obvious reason why they are forever alone. With some of them, all it would take is some fucking effort. There was one particularly unfortunate looking guy I had a date with who I thought still could have had so much potential if he made the effort and just learned to present himself much better (meaning, they way he dressed and how presented his personality on OLD). After we parted, I wanted to give him some advice to help him out, but screw him because of something he said to me during our date ‚Äì this is also a reason guys like this stay single: Before we met up, he begged me (BEGGED!!) to go out with him despite his looks and went on a very long rant to me about how looks shouldn‚Äôt matter at all and all that matters is his personality and please just give him a chance. Ooookaaay‚Ä¶. He also mentioned several times how my looks wouldn‚Äôt matter to him at all either and how he‚Äôs looking for a companion, so only personality matters. Ooookaaay. On our date, he out of nowhere decides to bring up my weight and has the fucking audacity to ask if I‚Äôve been big my entire life. I actually laughed at first because obviously he‚Äôs joking, right? Right?! Nope, very serious. I have never in my entire life been called fat and know I have not gained that much weight this past year to be in fat territory, so wtf dude?!?? He was an extremely tiny guy (which I could have been an asshole about right back at him), so yes, compared to him, I was ‚Äúbigger‚Äù, but I‚Äôm definitely not ‚Äúbig‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt stop there; he continued by giving me advice on how to control my weight as I age. When I realized he was serious, I kept telling him to just stop talking, but he wouldn‚Äôt shut up. They never listen and this is a great example of what my interactions with these guys are usually like and they are usually the shallow ones, it turns out. 

Basically, after putting up with all these awkward guys, I‚Äôve reached the point where I‚Äôm thinking, if I‚Äôm going to be getting put down by guys, it might as well be by some hot ones who are more worth my time and can actually show me a good time, so I‚Äôm done. And I don‚Äôt believe this is shallow. All my dating life, I‚Äôve tried to only go for personality and ignored looks and that‚Äôs gotten me nowhere. So, screw it, I want to be part of a hot couple now and I want to DESIRE someone.

She breakdowns and sometimes it gets messy. She tells me she wants me to leave, that she doesnt deserve me, that she is just lonely and Im just filling the void, that I deserve someone else and something better.

60,o5o1i4,1624371010,I lowered my standards a bit and it turned out well! Let's be willing to let people make a few mistakes early on,"I want to start off by saying that I think there are certain standards everyone should uphold.
Obviously if you ever feel unsafe or you've been completely disrespected, that's a true red flag that you should watch out for.


I'm just of the opinion that sometimes we can judge others too harshly on first dates and even second dates. It's important to realize that the other person you're on a date with is also nervous. They can make mistakes or say things that sound dumb. For example, my current boyfriend was definitely a little weird the first couple of dates, and he did things that made me question whether I should drop him and look for someone else to start dating. 


On my first date with him (our first time meeting) we went out to lunch together. When we went up to pay, he *conveniently* had forgotten his wallet and I had to pay for the both of us. I don't even care that much about traditional roles, but I thought the first date we would at least split lol. This was a true accident on his part as he later found his wallet in the car. He's tried to pay for almost every single one of my meals since that first date, but I manage to convince him to at least split the bill with me sometimes lol. I'm not gonna lie though, it felt a bit awkward on that first date that I was having to pay for the both of us. 

Another blunder he made was the way he tried to kiss me. After our lunch on the first date, we walked around at a park. At some point we went to sit on a bench in really secluded area with no one around. He ended up going in for a kiss. Instead of it being just like a light kiss though, he went full on slobbery make out which took me really off guard at the time. It was really intense for a first meet with somebody. He was running his hands all over my body as we were kissing and his hands started to go under my shirt. I ended up having to stop him and letting him know that it was a bit much for right then. He was a bit embarassed, but he was also understanding and immediately stopped when I asked him to.

Anddd, here's another blunder... I decided to go on a second date with him since it felt like we did have really good chemistry when we talked to each other. So on our second date, he actually showed up 45 minutes late. Tbh I was kinda pissed at the time, but I decided to be cool about it and let it slide. It was raining pretty heavily that day and we lived about 2 hours apart at the time. I figured there was probably some bad weather and traffic. When he finally showed up to the date he was completely soaked because he forgot to bring a rain jacket with him and he was profusely apologizing when he arrived. The rest of the date went really really well though and we ended up having to share an umbrella whenever we walked anywhere which was adorable. It went so well that I almost forgot about the fact that he showed up almost an hour late.


Well, we kept meeting up after that, and now he's my boyfriend. I feel like some people might take from this story that I'm settling or something, but I honestly love my boyfriend now and I think it's easy to get caught up in the mistakes people make early on. He definitely made some mistakes on those early dates, but looking back on it they were all understandable mistakes and they weren't a true reflection of him. Anyone could forget their wallet in the car. Some people have different expectations on kisses. I know some people think that there must be a kiss on a first date for there to be a second date, while others would rather wait until the second or third date to kiss. It's also entirely understandable to run late sometimes (especially if it's bad weather or you live far apart!). I think it's important to recognize that mistakes happen, and a lot of times these types of mistakes happen more often early on in dating due to people being nervous. If it becomes a chronic issue that occurs regularly with someone, then it becomes disrespectful, but I think a one time mistake, especially early on, should be given a pass.

64,o5opi6,1624372880,Need some advice/opinions,"Im a 21 year old male thats been dating a girl for around 4 years now. We broke-up around the 3 year mark because we felt like we should in order to date more people and discover ourselves. We had no reason to break-up other than that, the relationship was great. 

During our little break we were both miserable but I ended up going out on dates and had a one night stand. Turns out casual sex/one night stands are not my thing at all. 

We ended up getting back together after our break because we realized that it was a mistake and we still wanted to be together. 
This may sound crazy to some but we didn‚Äôt start saying we loved each other until we got back together. 

All in all our relationship is great. We never argue, we have different interests and try to involve each-other, always laughing having a good time, we are extremely sexually compatible. There is no real downside except I wish she had more hobbies.

That being said, my question is: 
What is everybody‚Äôs opinion on the long term prospects of my relationship based on your experience?
I feel like I‚Äôm doing the right thing but at the same time I might regret sticking with the same girl for so long later on in life. My mom ended up being in essentially in the same boat when she was my age but her relationship was toxic and maybe thats why I have these thought.

So I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs wrong with my current dating ability.  Granted the past year I‚Äôve definitely changed for the better, but I also haven‚Äôt had many chances to put these changes in motion because of covid and restrictions, along with people being harder to meet.

Anyways I consider myself pretty confident, I recently had a first kiss and no longer feel slightly worried about kissing people on dates, so I feel much more confident in this realm.  Furthermore, I am very confident in conversing, over this summer I‚Äôve been on a study abroad trip and many people here have told me I come across as very confident and in a way where I feel good about myself; of course this is primarily because I‚Äôm always confident when I talk and can talk plenty.

I also generally feel I have decent hobbies and definitely have things I‚Äôm interested in.  I love to play tennis, I‚Äôm super passionate about edm, I love anime, I enjoy to ski, drinking with people is fun, I occasionally make video montage edits, among other things.  So I feel I‚Äôm at least a fairly interesting person.

I generally believe I‚Äôm a humorous person as well, at least some what.  Sometimes I have a bit of a smart ass type humor but most people seem to enjoy it and know it‚Äôs just me screwing with them.  This is not to say I‚Äôm some comedian just decently funny.

Lastly I‚Äôm a decent looking person.  Not great but not bad either.

However, I do feel I have a couple things maybe holding me back.  First, I‚Äôm not in amazing shape; I‚Äôm not fat just not skinny either, so that may be a bit of a turn off.  In addition, I can have a bit of a short temper with some specific things like school, or on certain days of tennis.  Not to say I have anger management, just that I get frustrated with a select few things and it may definitely come across as unattractive.

77,o5qdnv,1624377357,What do I do?,"So I‚Äôve (M/18) been talking to this girl (F/17) for 5-6 months, it started off as friends only but as time went on our conversations included things like if we were to date, how it‚Äôd be if we were to get married etc. In these months she talked to a guy but that fell through as she didn‚Äôt see anything with him.

My situation at the moment is a bit confusing, she eludes to things possibly happening in the sense of when we meet up and her and myself in general. An example being ‚Äúif something happens it happens ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù. But she never explicitly says anything that‚Äôs ‚Äòconcrete‚Äô for me to believe she may have something for me or want something more it‚Äôs all up in the clouds still for me. She openly has told me she has quite a few guy friends which prompted me to ask her once when I was with her if she‚Äôs like this with them, she said no and that the way she‚Äôs acting with me is how she is with someone when she feels there can be something more and she‚Äôs making it evident, she said sumin after which didn‚Äôt make sense to me, she has also given me the password of her my eyes only and phone so I can trust her fully as she feels i don‚Äôt trust her yet. 

One time I happened to send her something relationship related but I deleted it as she saw it (deliberately) and she got mad saying stuff like ‚Äúwhich girl was that for, how many other girls are there‚Äù etc. She isn‚Äôt afraid to send tiktoks that relate to being together and they all follow that similar kind of theme, one time I asked her why she‚Äôs so cryptic about stuff and what she actually wants she told me ‚Äújust relax, enjoy life and go along with it‚Äù. As of recent she texted saying how I make her happy and smile and all that kind of stuff.

I‚Äôve really been struggling with finding a partner, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy who‚Äôs incredibly fit for my age (competitive athlete to high level). I don‚Äôt have many people around me and I have BPD which I‚Äôve felt has always held me back. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that I don‚Äôt struggle on the dating scene. Why all this?

Pretty much whenever I start talking to someone I‚Äôll gain interest quickly and lose interest just as fast over the course of weeks, it will undulate until conversation just collapses. I know I want a partner, I‚Äôm in the right space and mind to have one it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm aiming too high or not. I‚Äôve been in one 6 month relationship prior which ended rough and I‚Äôve kept clean since. I‚Äôve put off dating during late school (sixth form) and going out with classmates etc because I‚Äôve told myself my sport and academics are more important. Now I struggle to hold relationships and I feel clueless and hopeless. Maybe turning to Reddit isn‚Äôt the best idea but just looking for someone to offer advice.

FYI I‚Äôm straight and I am on tinder, I have matched with lots of people but just can‚Äôt maintain interest. I‚Äôm a chatty guy and prefer chatty people (personality is what I prefer) but even if I meet someone who I get on really well I still struggle to maintain interest. Thanks

89,o5ry9w,1624381550,Owen Cook's Speaking Method Demistified,"Hi everyone. I been gone from the dating community for quite some time but I wanted to share you this information that I stumbled upon from singing. Owen Cook uses the same method to talk to women as famous people use to sing with. The method is called ""mixed voice"". He try to teach people Bel canto. It takes years to learn Bel canto or months depending on how coordinated you are with your voice. I started using it to talk to women and you get very great reactions and plus everyone starts looking at you. Owen Cook was taught by Rodger Love.  I just found this real interesting because I always wondered what he was doing and how he was doing it.  You can fill up a whole damn club with your voice and cut through the base.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Buy a singing straw and sing like you normally would into the straw. The air should be coming out at the end. I recommend getting a 3mm. They also sell them in sets. Some are expensive but it beats using plastic straws which hurts the environment.
2. You can also do lip trills. Whatever you do not be lazy and pinch the sides of your lips with your fingers. This teaches you how much air you should be using. You got to keep the right amount of air flow to keep the burble going. This is the same thing as singing. No air you go flat.
3. Take the straw away and use the same back pressure that the straw is creating.
4. If you can't do that then lay down and sing while laying on your back. This forces you to use your diaphragm which is the secret to hitting those money notes. To locate your diaphragm breath through your nose and put your fingers underneath your rib cage. You are trying to isolate that muscle while you sing. It takes practice. You won't get it over night and that's why so many people say they can't sing.
5. Glottal compression. It's the L'ah' like your getting your tonsils checked. Yes its true this is how you sing. If you can control your glottis you can control your diaphragm and also do vibrato. There is no magic or gift or talent. I hate to say it. We are all born to sing. There is only one voice and not three like you think.  

   1. Practice the bratty Nay, nay sound for high notes when you get this tone down.
   2. After you practiced for about 3 months test yourself to make sure you got Bel canto. Get a candle and sing in front of the candle with different volumes. If you don't blow out the candle you have a balanced voice and your singing in mix.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o5ry9w/owen_cooks_speaking_method_demistified/

92,o5s9ti,1624382397,Wanted to share an unfortunate first date story,"I met a guy last weekend outside a bar and turns out he‚Äôs from Australia and this is his first time in the US. Spent some time with him and his friends at other clubs, he was very nice and paid for drinks, covers, ubers etc. Didn‚Äôt let him come home with me when the night was over tho.

He texted me the following day wanting to take me out to dinner, but I usually never meet up with guys I meet when out. I wasn‚Äôt sure about going but decided why not have a good time and show a foreigner around, and we met last night. 

The date was going fine, we had a nice conversation but for me there was no spark. Plus, he‚Äôs leaving in a couple of weeks since he travels for work so I knew it wasn‚Äôt anything serious. He was telling me that in Australia they don‚Äôt have physical IDs since it‚Äôs all on their phones, kind of like Apple wallet but your ID. So he was concerned about getting carded at dinner since America doesn‚Äôt take the virtual ID (for bars and clubs he showed his passport).

Fast forward to when we get the check, the bill is hefty since we went to a fancy Italian restaurant and split a bottle, an app, and two entrees. I offer to put my card down to split the bill but he declined. But turns out he only had Apple Pay because in Australia they apparently don‚Äôt use physical cards and just have it on their phone. I told him the place probably won‚Äôt take Apple Pay (I was right they didn‚Äôt) and I ended up having to pay for it (rip me). 

He tried to send me money through some random app I‚Äôve never heard of but I didn‚Äôt know my banking account number at the top of my head. I asked him to download venmo but for some reason couldn‚Äôt download it, and he didn‚Äôt have his account connected to PayPal. 

He kept apologizing and saying this must‚Äôve been the worst date I‚Äôve been on and I think he truly did feel bad, it was super embarrassing and awkward. I kept saying it was okay and that it happens (just unfortunate I had to pay $$$) I was also trying to joke with him to try and make light of the moment, and he even said maybe this is a way to get a second date and see me again to make it up to me. 

I end up taking the subway home right after saying bye awkwardly, and he texted me immediately apologizing again and promising me he‚Äôs not a dickhead. 

I was texting all my friends what was happening and they all were suspicious that he was trying to ‚Äúscam‚Äù a free dinner. I didn‚Äôt think he was but thought it was a bit sus how unprepared he was.

Late in the night he actually did end up sending me money via PayPal which was nice of him, just unfortunate since the night ended so awkwardly.

1. There are plenty of men out there (including me) who doesn‚Äôt want to be a creep while approaching women. The modern society has made it so hard that approaching a women who is by herself is now a ‚Äúcrime‚Äù

3. When women shows interest and initiate a conversation, the chances are that we are just straight cutting all the BS and going straight into business. No pickup lines, no smooth moves required. A simple smile and hello will do wonders.

My point is, a relationship is a concept of physical/emotional connection of two people. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to have one person (usually men) to put in a lot of effort to find the partner.
