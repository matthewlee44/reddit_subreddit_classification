Alot of friends tell me to just be myself and eventually it will come. I've kinda been doing that for a couple years now and while I have dated some, nothing much has really come from it? I suppose it's a lot of effort on my part to always start communication and really like it when the other party also reaches out cause I'm just not that naturally social. 

My life is somewhat monotonous, essentially I get up, get ready for work, do my job, come home, usually raid with my team on ffxiv and then do it all again the next day until it's off days for raiding so I dont really do much except handle some adult stuff like vehicle registration or bills. Uhm I suppose I'm not really looking for a fling? I would more enjoy to get to know someone naturally or they take interest i suppose and then go from there cause im rather clueless on what to say or do. Most of my relationships have all been online, only 2 where irl and honestly I'm just not outgoing to start a conversation with anyone out of the blue unless we directly work together. 

Now that's not to say I never talk, I enjoy talking to someone who is enjoyable to be around, ive got a couple friends I talk to regularly, but not really any irl per se. Maybe I'm a bit picky when it comes to personalities that I find fun to be around? 

Most of the relationships I've been in I've ended myself, there was one where that wasn't the case and boy did I make some mistakes, so since I've worked on those issues and come out better for it. But alot of the time the other is uhm...well their entire personality revolves around depression, and that's fine and all, but it's hard to talk to someone or get them to want to do anything because they're always focused on themselves. 

Video games have been a large part of my upbringing(whoa that's new i know), but finding someone who is also kind of into that or understanding of it at least is a big plus, also well put together or have their life on track or goals is nice. I am a tad shallow I will admit, their voice in particular for some reason is a thing I look for. Idk if it's cause of the adhd or something, but paying attention to someone with a voice that is nice to hear is easier to do. I've tried dating some where they're from other countries and sometimes I just can't seem to feel anything because of how they sound. Maybe I'm weird for that, but it's how it seems to be.

I've never tried a dating app, I dont think that's something I'd enjoy? I've been a virgin this long so sex really isn't a priority. More like a friend, and we hang out and do stuff, maybe it becomes a bit more intimate down the road, but it's pretty difficult to meet someone like that. So uh, here I am!

Right now I’m really obsessive about getting into a relationship and I turned 19 just last month.

I also graduated from high school just last year and now I’m taking a program that teaches me life skills.

You know, like cooking, keeping a job, budgeting, paying bills, etc.

And the program is for people on the spectrum.

I mean I am definitely autistic but I have overcome most of it throughout my life, and now I’m just taking this program to get better at my financial skills and also my job skills and I think I’m doing good so far.

I’m even working at Pizza Hut as a part of the program but I’m just folding boxes and doing all of the simple stuff.

I’m not making or delivering pizzas.

I’m also not getting paid either.

Anyways with all of that aside, like I stated, I’m really obsessive about getting a girlfriend and I don’t think it’s doing any good for me because I think I’m overthinking way too much.

A couple of weeks ago I tried online dating and it just sucked.

I mean I did have good pics of myself as well as a decent bio and I did get some matches and likes, however none of my matches replied to my messages and I could never match with the rest of the people who liked me.

So then I tried for a little longer and I just started to get no likes or matches at all.

So then I did some research and found out that 90% of women on these apps are just there for ego boosts(which is definitely obvious because I saw some really attractive girls with just their insta links in their bio) and not only that, but if your not very active you will get ranked low in the algorithm.

So then I just went “okay f\*ck this then” and I quit.

If that’s the way it’s going to be I’m not willing to put my time and effort into this online stuff.

And I’m not going to lie either, I’m actually a really attractive guy, I mean I’m definitely most certainly not packed with a good shave or anything, but I do have a nice jawline, blue eyes, brown wavy hair, 6,4 in height, a cute smile, pretty lean and some others.

I do have some acne but it’s not very excessive and I have mostly pretty healthy skin.

But what pisses me off about dating apps is that they are so competitive and so I’m just not going to do it.

So yeah with that out of the way, I then decided just yesterday that I’m going to go to the mall and do some cold approaches and I approached absolutely no one lol.

I really should have thought more about what I was going to do because when I got to the mall and saw some cute girls walking.

I had absolutely no courage to approach them, especially since most looked like they were under age, plus I couldn’t think of anything to say to them.

I was also really worried about creating an awkward moment when approaching them.

So then I just figured ok maybe malls aren’t the right places for me to approach women.

So now I’m really trying to figure out where I’m going to meet someone and it’s just making me frustrated.

Some of the things that come to my mind are comic con(because I’m definitely into super heroes, video games, and other geeky stuff too) and then some others were drawing clubs, acting clubs, and some others.

But now I’m starting to think I’m becoming overly obsessive and alongside that, I’m also thinking that signing up for these things just for the sake of finding a girlfriend isn’t really going to help.

I mean sure I am definitely into drawing and such but at the same time, I don’t think I want to just join random clubs to find myself a girlfriend.

So yeah basically what I’m trying to say is I can’t necessarily figure out a plan that I’m satisfied with that will help me find a date.

I also think I’m really overthinking and it’s really starting to frustrate me.

And here is the thing, I have heard people say this multiple times and that is “The one will come when you least expect it”.

But how does that work? Because I’ve come across very successful people online who went with life knowing someone told them that, but yet they still struggle finding their one.

Also here is something else that I should state, and it’s the fact that the program I am taking is located at a high school which means that most of the girls that I see are minors, plus I usually don’t have time to talk to any of them.

And the ones that go to the program with me are ones that I’m not attracted to, plus there are only 2 girls in that program.

So yeah with everything aside, I honestly think I’m being really over obsessive plus I can’t figure out where to meet my ideal woman which is frustrating to me.

So can someone please help me out.

My interests are video games, movies, art(digital art and drawing specifically), and music.

My dream job is to even be a game developer and game entrepreneur.

I’m saying all of that stuff so that some of you can give me good suggestions for where I can meet my kind of women.

Anyways, overall please help me out because I would really like to have a good plan in place that I am satisfied with.

Because at the moment I do not and I think that is the thing that’s making me frustrated and causing me to overthink.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154629,public,self,I’m being really obsessive about getting into a serious relationship at 19 and really need some help.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbylsr/im_being_really_obsessive_about_getting_into_a/,no_ads,0.0,

I met a guy who I was instantly attracted to and for some strange reason, he had that same instant attraction to me. 
However, as my luck would have it, he was taking over as a boss at my job.

We got along really well, with no funny business, and I found myself being drawn more into him.

Anyway he drove me home one day and I lent in and kissed him. He reciprocated the kiss and it was one of the most amazing kisses I have ever had. Okay, it was the absolutebest kiss I've ever had. Never felt like I did about a kiss before. It went pretty close to going further at that point. But he pushed away and told me it can't happen for obvious reasons.

Anyway a few weeks after that we where alone and we ended up in a pretty intense make up session. Half way through he said no so I pulled away. I felt so guilty about the situation as I knew it couldn't go anywhere.

I understand his stance and I respect him for it. He has told me recently that he has switched off those feelings because he knows it can't happen, where I am just sitting with mine and letting them take the natural cause. Although I think that makes the rejection sting a little more because he could so easily switch off. In a way I wish it was that easy for me.

So not only can't men resist sex from women they are attracted too, they can reject them too.

I just needed to vent, I guess. I knew that him being my boss would be an issue but yeah doesn't take the sting away.

Hi guys. 

Just going to let you know a bit about the back story,

Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year. I know he loves me deeply and I do too.

Recently we have had a very big fight (it started as a disagreement but he ignored me constantly, had my anxiety take over and I kept saying why am I getting ignored when you know I don’t like this) and then him stonewalling me and saying he is done.


This has happened twice before, when he sees me in person he comes to me and works with me but over text I don’t know what the hell is going on. He completely shuts down. 

I let him know I know he has last trauma which causes him to shut down and I love him and respect him. 

The problem is, it was my birthday last week and we have a trip planned this Thursday. (Something he planned) my friends are going to be joining us two nights later. It’s about a 4.5 hr drive and I didn’t want to bring this up in the last message to him cause I don’t want him to feel overwhelmed…but at the same time this fight isn’t that serious. He knows I haven’t done anything for my birthday in years and how much this meant to me. 

I can’t even get my deposit back and I payed 1350 dollars. 

Honestly he’s shut down and I know he’ll come around with space, but I don’t know what to do. I hope to hear back!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154633,public,self,Stonewalling,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbzbzl/stonewalling/,no_ads,0.0,

I (24m) recently got rejected by this great girl (23f) :(.

We met through mutual friends in september and maybe a month after that started talking. We have been talking alot these past months, and went out on two different occasions and I enjoyed spending time with her and she atleast told me she had a great time both dates. The problem is that during this past half a year I've been really busy with work and have been away from home alot. 

Now I'm having a month time off and we talked about what we are looking for in this ''thing'' we have going on. I told her I like her alot and she is a great person in my eyes. Then she hits me with the: I do really like you, but I am currently not looking for anything really with anyone and do not want to try to progress this ''thing'' further at the moment atleast. Then she said that nothing is impossible in the future when she gets her own head cleared out and knows what she wants.

I have quite alot of experience in dating, and I have had some good relationships that ended due to us growing apart or maybe just losing interest over time. I have experienced a fair share of rejections earlier and I know myself really well, these things normally don't affect me like this one did. I have the best friends I could ask for, I'm overall really content with my life. How is it possible for this one specific girl to make me feel so empty inside, over just one normal conversation one day :(

I respect what she said ofcourse, we haven't talked since as I need to back off atleast for a while if we are going to be friends in the future or I will just end up hurting more.

Sometimes we’ll walk home together after the club but I don’t really see her outside of that, so I haven’t been able to get a good reparte going. Occasionally she’ll text me about something, but I’m never successful at turning it into a real conversation. I’ll reach out to her every now and then, and though she isn’t super cagey or not responding, again it never turns into a good long form convo. Now i’m a very bad texter (slow and sometimes i even forget to ever respond) so maybe she’s just matching my energy, but maybe it’s also a sign that she’s not interested at all. My first girlfriend we texted constantly before I asked her out, so i’m used to having that and i’m not sure if she’s not enthusiastically engaging is a sure sign i shouldn’t make a move or not. My thought is that if she had any interest she would be more responding quicker and with more substance. Is that right?

I've talked to this girl for a while, but we've never met in person. We're from different countries. We had a "" thing "" going on, at least if you believe long distance relationships are real in any way. It felt very much real to me, and definitely to her as well. 

I broke up with her a few months ago, for a bunch of reasons, but i thought i still had feelings for her. I'm sure she felt the same way, she kept telling me how she loved me and i was actually hoping we could meet and get together at some point. We fell out a few times. Fought about this whole thing, blocked each other on all social media, but somehow we always ended up back in touch. 

Now it all feels weird. I've dated other people, and i've been quite open about it. She has too, but definitely hasn't been as open, and never clearly lets me know what's going on ( i only knew she got with someone after we broke up a few weeks after their relationship ended, and we were talking and even discussing getting back together while she was with this guy ).

If this all sounds pretty toxic to you, it's because it is. So let's get to the title of the post. 

I just can't seem to let go. I'm talking to other girls, i have a date this weekend. But when i catch hints of her seeing someone else i can't help but feeling like shit, and this anger and jealousy rushes over me. The problem is, i don't want her anymore. I don't wanna be with her, i don't feel the same way i used to ( although i still care about her very much ). And yet, i don't want her to be with anyone else. I hate knowing that she has a new boyfriend, or that she's been sleeping with someone, but i don't want to get back together either, and after all i'm doing the same. She gets upset when she knows i've been seeing other people too. 

So now you're thinking "" dude, just cut this off you complete moron "". I tried. I don't know why, i just can't fully let her go. I know she feels the same. I'd like to delete her contacts and just get her completely out of my life, but i can't seem to do it. 

I don't know what the point of this post really is, i guess i'm looking for advice, or comfort, or just a space to vent.

Hi there!

For a bit of Context: 17 year old male, rising senior on summer break, hs friend group but not ""popular""

So, in october, we just formed this random ass friendgroup made by people who aren´t really popular in highschool. we are the kind that don´t party and stuff. We are approximately 10 in the friend group, guys and girls equally distributed. There is this one girl who I think is beautiful and has a great personality. I really have only one close friend in the group, and he tells me that although she has a nice personality she isn´t so good looking, but I find her gorgeous.

The puzzle is that she is nice to everyone and will sure carry on conversations as friends with many people. And I am pretty shy, I don´t talk to any of the girls in the friend group at all. Just to her every few days. We have some pretty long conversations and she actually initiated twice or three times out of like 10 times total.

BUT, I really don´t know if she just appreciates me as a friend, because the whole group doesn´t have many friends. I think I made it pretty obvious I like her. But I´m not really getting any signal from her. Rather than texting back. So last time we texted, she initiatied and after some texts left me on delivered. Since then I´m waiting on her to text but it´s been 10 days. We are going to see each other soon because of group gatherings.

Any advice? From possible signals I can think off the top of my head is that she told me that she wants a bf but we were talking at a gathering, not alone. Should I text her? Should I wait?

Also, the obvious thing to do, tell her! Won´t work, she is in my friend group and I don´t want to screw it up.

I´m obsessed with her, I can´t stop thinking about her. HELP!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154642,public,self,Advice dating someone in your friend group,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc0ute/advice_dating_someone_in_your_friend_group/,no_ads,0.0,

I was seeing this guy in October of last year. Things were great. He gave me real twin flame vibes. We have the same interests in common, like the same music, we have fantastic chemistry both sexually and in general. We never argued. Only problem that surfaced is his ex. He was with her for 2 years prior. He said they had mega problems. When push came to shove he left me to go back to her not because of anything wrong with us but because we had only been together for 3 weeks and he said his heart was still partially with her and he has to give it another try with her. I blocked him and moved on with my life. During this period my moms best friends son started to show interest in me. His mom has been dropping mad hints about us getting together. I was open to the idea but impartial because he is only 21 ( I'm 26) and we live very different lifestyles ( he is a single man who likes to travel and stuff) ( I am a single mom of 2 who really just likes the simple things). Not to mention our families are close to the point we are like family and I have known him for 19 years. Reluctant I still started hanging out more. Spending weekends I don't have my kids at my moms friends place. I havent done anything to lead him on other than saying that I am open to the idea. He also hasn't flat out talked to me about it himself just threw his mom and liking my stuff on my socials. Now present day. The guy I was seeing reached out to me over the phone. He called me last night to apologize and said he wanted to prove to me that this was a mistake and that he never should've been dumb and left to begin with. Now I am conflicted because I still get twin flame vibes from this guy and my heart is screaming to give him another chance but I really don't want to hurt or upset my moms friend and her son.

This is my story and how I was in your shoes

This story is going to be long, so there will be a TL;DR at the end for those that don’t want to read through

I (21M) started dating at 15 like most people. I dated a few girls but I wasn’t sure what I wanted. I only dated 2 girls then and nothing got serious since we were young and wasn’t sure what we wanted at all. One did cheat on me but I’m not gonna be mad or blame her. I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted and while I didn’t cheat (ever. Let’s keep that as a note), I felt like I wasted her time so I had it coming. 

It wasn’t until I had my girlfriend at age 16 that I knew then what I was looking for in a relationship. Ex #1 (let’s call her Margret) was my first serious relationship. She showed me what love was, she was my first time I ever did anything, and she was the first to break me out of my shell. But I wasn’t always easy to be with. A car accident that broke my collar bone and back left me not being able to do much and my dad passing away in the next month after that accident (me and him had a very bad relationship but like all, I still loved my father, even if things were rough), it left me with a lot of demons. And it showed in my relationship. Everything seemed to trigger it and it would break me out in anxiety attacks. Whether it felt like she was trying to leave me, I broke down because I felt I wasn’t doing enough even when I was doing a lot, and not being very understanding and over protective. Eventually, Margret cheated on me with her ex while I was on a trip with some friends as they were trying to help me with some of my problems. It broke me. I didn’t date for 2 years after her. 

In between, I did what I felt was necessary to help myself. I went to therapy, I got on anxiety and depression medication, the whole 9 yards. I focused on trying to better myself

It was when I started dating ex #2 (we shall call her Julie) when I was 19. We had met at work, I thought she was cute and I asked her out. Julie hid me from her family for 3 months before she told them because of how over protective they were and she “wasn’t allowed to date” (she was 18 but under her moms’ house. They play a roll in this part). We fought a lot about it until she did. And while it relieved some of the strain and stress, during the time I was under hiding from her family, I could feel those demons come back. Even with the medicine, I could feel that they had returned. And they played a big part in this relationship as well. When her parents found out about me, of course they weren’t as mad about it as she set out to be. And that broke some of my trust. Until later in the relationship. They kept telling me how terrible I was to her (I never did anything nor started any fights. It was always her that was physically abusive to me, hitting me to the point of bleeding and bruising, and started fights over the tiniest of things whether it was I chose to not come over one night or I said the wrong thing to her at the wrong time). I felt that they were right about it all. I stayed in that relationship for a year until she cheated on me with one of my best friends. It broke me. And by the time she broke up with me, the pandemic began. 

Soon as it started, I had lost my job and my girlfriend, my usually activities outside of work were cancelled, and I was forced to move home with my mom. No where would hire me for the longest time and I wasn’t able to leave the house due to COVID. I spent most of my days for the first few months of the pandemic in my room alone and playing games by myself. That’s when I was at my worst. Eventually, my uncle who played the same games as me and a few friends from my old job reached out to me. They helped me through some rough times in quarantine and in the pandemic. They helped me get back on my feet with a fantastic new job that I am still with and going up in the company latter, help rebuild my confidence, and helped me rediscover a me that I am happy with

Fast forward to today, I met a girl last year. She’s done nothing but be happy and accepting of me. She and I never fight and we’re always happy around each other. She is beautiful, smart, talented, and has such a big heart for everyone she meets. She’s been nothing but a blessing and I am excited to spend every day with her. So much so, we’re both moving in together and unexpectedly but exciting, we found out we are pregnant with our first baby boy and he will join us in July. 

So here’s my advice: don’t rush. Don’t be in a hurry. Some people just suck, but you don’t. You are awesome, you are beautiful, and you deserve nothing but the best. If you are struggling, have some friends help you. The ones that care about the most want to see you the happiest. I wouldn’t have been ready for this relationship without my friends being at my side when I needed them most. I always found from an old movie called “Snow Day” a quote that is also helpful, “love is if you can stand to be around them for more than 5 minutes”. Find that person, you will find love within them

TL;DR: I went through a lot of lousy relationships and had some personal demons going on that made dating rough. During the pandemic, friends help me through a bunch and it helped me build up the confidence at strength to ask out my current Gf.

Most of our relationship has been great, but I noticed that he recently liked a series of selfies of a woman who lives in the city he just moved from. I mentioned this to him and asked him how he knows her, and he replied that she is a friend of a friend. I dug deeper and asked, “are you sure this isn’t someone you used to date?” He said they never dated but that he often meets people “around”. What I gathered from this comment is that they are not just friends. 

I told him that I’m uncomfortable with him showing interest in other women on IG while we’re in a relationship. To me, a “like” on a picture feels like he’s giving her an OK to reach out and say hello (assuming they’re not speaking already). In my opinion, it’s unnecessary flirtation and a great way to keep a woman on the back burner.

After a day or so, he apologized, told me that he regretted liking the photos and that the interaction meant nothing to him. He also told me that he wouldn’t do any of this “liking” in the future. I appreciate that he can see my perspective, but I can’t shake the thought that he approached a woman while in a seemingly happy relationship. Should I end things because I feel I can’t trust him now, or is that too extreme?

Me (guy in his 30s) and this girl have been chatting on a dating app for several weeks and were finally able to meet up for a fancy dinner. We ended up having sex on our first date and we spent a ton of time together in the following days. I've been in long-term and short-term relationships before, and the chemistry I have with this girl is unmatched to my previous experiences.

Our conversations range from very trivial to very deep topics, and we are consistently having a blast, flirting, etc. Our backgrounds (upbringing, ethnicity, and even our professions) are very, very similar, so we relate on many levels. Perhaps best of all, we communicate very clearly with one another.

I know it's still very early on, but so far, so (very) good. Before we even met in-person, I was fairly confident that we'd be compatible (based on our very similar backgrounds). I don't really think I'm ""infatuated"" but rather I think I could see myself really caring (and one day loving) this girl. At this point, I have no expectations but would be very happy to pursue something more with this girl.

So, I'm curious what others' experiences have been like.

I am a little old fashioned as well, if I ask a woman out I'll always say ""may I, take you to dinner or on a date"" I just always remember the saying ""mother may I"" and asking can refers to are you capable.  I prefer to pick up a woman then always walk them to the door, always pay, and I make sure to put my phone on silent. I don't kiss on the 1st date, most of the time not on the 2nd either, first couple of dates is testing the chemistry between us. Never been into hook ups or causal sex, it's not me. But some dates I've been on its feels like I'm doing something wrong because I haven't made a move, or one fling I has the conversation of sex came up in the second week of talking since we had plans to meet each other for the first time the coming weekend. Guess my thing is what is some advice for someone who likes to take things slow and actually build a relationship based on chemistry and personality? Today's society causal sex, one night stands, and moving quickly seems like the norm.

There were some mixed responses so I thought I’d share an update/story on how it’s worked out for me. 

I met a guy on hinge in May 2021. We both early on established we’ve previously been in long term relationships (7-8yrs) that ended very poorly. We both have relationship trauma to some degree. 

We quickly (1.5months in after seeing each other a few times a week consistently and spending 2 days away together) agreed that we wanted to be exclusive but we weren’t ready to ‘label’ it. We agreed we would delete our apps and only date/sleep with each other. 

3 months in, we traveled for 5 days out of state and after that trip a lot of my trauma kind of came bubbling to the surface. I decided to seek out a new therapist (after firing my previous one in April 2021). It was a shock to me to date someone whose actions matched their words and I felt like he didn’t deserve to be with someone who questioned him all the time. 

Then I came here and made that post about how to navigate dating when both parties have trauma. 

Through my own therapy and open communication with him, I’ve grown a lot and I’ve grown very comfortable in our little relationship. We’re still dating (about 8months now) and recently had a conversation about what this is. We’ve agreed we’re together, and like each other (not at the point where we love each other anything) and can label it if we want. I don’t necessarily need a ‘boyfriend’ title but I do refer to him as my partner (that’s just my own preference). 

He’s met some of my friends and family. I’ve met some of his friends. We have really got into a comfortable groove of dating and being together and just communicating very well. 

I had been feeling a lot of outside pressure from friends/family saying it’s be 3/5/7 months how haven’t you defined the relationship? Or why haven’t you met X and Y in his life. It started to become overwhelming for me and worked with my therapist on how best to navigate. 

So I guess just coming back here to say, do not hold yourself and your relationship to other peoples relationship timelines! Navigating dating when one or both parties have trauma is difficult and not everyone wants to jump into a defined relationship within 3 months of dating. We’re still learning each other and that’s OK!

For as long as I can remember I’ve been so insecure that I thought people just didn’t want me in my life. Friends always feel at arm’s length, with my family I always feel like the odd one out, in work I always feel like I’m on the outside looking in, and my romantic life has been non-existent; at 23 I’m a virgin who’s made a grand total of one real friend since high school. Even in college I talked to nobody. All I’ve had is my old friends from school and nobody else really.

I thought that other people were the issue until recently when it smacked me in the face that I’m the problem. Specifically, I started a new job a few months back and I’ve been kind of into a girl I work with. If I had to write what my ‘type’ is on a piece of paper it would probably be her. She’s stunning, insanely kind but calls me out on my bullshit, she’s smart, she’s fun, we have similar interests and ways of viewing things, and for a while I could feel something kind of building up between us. We’d relentlessly tease each other all day in work and be dying laughing at things, while she’d occasionally open up about deeper stuff going on. At the very least it felt like a real friendship growing. I was definitely crushing on her, but I just thought it must be all in my head. She’s so my type that it genuinely just didn’t seem like she’d be into me in return.

A few weeks ago though the kind of flirty vibe between us was kind of getting more and more obvious. She messaged me outside of work and we were texting back and forward pretty intensely. We both had time off and she kept dropping repeated suggestions that we should grab a drink while we’re off, one day I said I had a shitty sleep the night before and she offered to drop coffees off at my place for me, stuff like that. I’ve never really had someone be so obvious with wanting to spend time with me like that.

How did I respond to it? I shut off. I would pass over her comments about us doing things together like it was a joke and kind of started replying really slowly, sometimes a day or more at a time. I realised I was terrified. And it made me have an epiphany. This exact scenario, some girl I’m really into feeling the same and having a romance build up like that, is something I’ve thought about over and over and over. I’ve felt lonely quite a lot and I’ve always craved that. But when it actually happens, when someone wants to get to really know me and spend time with me and actually be around me? I shut the fuck down, I refuse to accept it, I treat it like a joke and in all honesty probably really hurt her feelings even though I’m definitely into her too.

I feel like a fucking clown. I’ve been going to therapy finally for anxiety and stuff and my therapist said it sounds like I’ve just spent my whole life terrified of being vulnerable with anyone in even the slightest way and that’s where the issues come with my relationships with other people. All along it was me. I don’t let anyone in. Nobody breaks behind my emotional barrier and while some part of me wants them to, I shut anyone who tries off and hide behind jokes and humour and refuse to engage with it.

I’m so lonely but so fucking scared of anyone truly knowing me. And it’s fucked up everything. My family, my friends, they barely know anything about me. I can barely even hold a conversation with friends I’ve had for years without alcohol being involved. I wasted my college years making zero friends. I’ve spent years getting down because no girls are into me when the reality is people probably have liked me and like with this girl, I’ve shut them down without realising. This time it was too obvious for me to hide from it thought and I’ve had to face facts, and the fact is I’m a coward. I couldn’t even do the most basic human thing and openly reciprocate someone’s feelings who cares about me and who I genuinely want to get to know too, for no other reason than it scares me.

It’s just so fucking dumb and irrational and yet I can’t stop myself, and I’m scared I’ll be like this forever. I’m such an anxious, overthinking, emotionally closed off mess. I just want to let people know I care, I want to be a positive impact on the people in my life, and instead I’m like a background character in my own fucking life because I’m too scared to let anyone know me, and if I keep this up I’ll grow old and alone knowing I was never anything to anyone. What hurts the most is recently seeing that girl from work stop replying to me as much in return and backing away from me, knowing I probably hurt her quite a bit when she’s herself quite an emotionally vulnerable person, and knowing I done it for no other reason than fear.

I left it at that. I was worried something had happened to her, or perhaps she has having doubts about the relationship and this was her cruel way of running away.

I get the accounts being hacked, all the apps I was blocked on were facebook owned apps - so if someone got into that, and blocked me and her friends, that would make sense. But then, my number was blocked on her phone - is it possible for a hacker to get into her phone and block me on socials, phone number, but not snapchat?

I don’t really know what to do. If anyone with more dating &amp; life experience offer some advise please :)

I (26F) have been seeing this guy (25M) I met whilst doing some voluntary work. Initially we started hanging out to celebrate work milestones/completed projects. We then started hanging one on one, I didn’t think much of it because we were doing things we both liked and were just having fun.

Over a few months, I could sense he really liked me. We both got new jobs at different companies and I moved 1hr away. Previously I shut guys down out of my own insecurities, had never been with a guy before this and thought I would give this situation a chance. I wasn’t initially attracted to him physically and 3 months &amp; 10 dates+ later I still feel absolutely nothing. 
He’s not ugly or anything, he just doesn’t appeal to me. Not to sound shallow but bad teeth is one thing that dislike about him. 
In the past we’ve talked about how we want to improve ourselves and he is happy with them - fair play to him I guess.

I like him as a person, we talk 24/7 but the lack of physical attraction is starting to bug me. I feel like a b!tch because he’s vocal about his attraction towards me. 
He is everything I want in a man, I just wish I could return the attraction. At the same time I don’t want to lose him because he genuinely makes me a better person and vice versa, always tells me how much I’ve bettered his life. Physically, we’ve only held hands, cuddled and kissed a number of times. I felt nothing when we kissed. I’ve dodged the last few kisses and the thought of it kind of repulses me. On the other hand I love our cuddles and hugs.

It is nice to have family who cares for you. However, they are judging even the smallest things that do not matter.

I have been dating someone for about four or five months now and I absolutely love this person and think they are the one for me. He even tells me the same and I just feel good about it unlike other relationships. I told my parents about him. My mom even met him and really liked him. My dad hasn’t had the chance to meet him yet just based on busy schedules.

So my bf asked me, “Do you want to change your Facebook relationship status? I don’t mind if we do or not but I know a lot of people like having it.” I thought it was cute he even asked, so I change it. I don’t make a big deal, he doesn’t make a big deal out of it. 

A day later, I notice my dad commenting it, “???” As if he didn’t know I had a boyfriend even though I have told him about him already. I also thought that was just an immature and rude comment when he could have privately messaged me. 
Then my mom texts me, “Do you think you’re a celebrity announcing your relationship like anyone actually cares? Give it a week then take it down, it is cheesy and embarrassing. I feel second hand embarrassment from this.”

It really hurts my feelings and I don’t understand why my parents act like this. They try to control me and I’m 26 years old and they know they will never control me. All my other friends were supportive and it’s social media where it’s just for fun… they’re making me feel so embarrassed to share anything with them and making me feel judged.

Asking her out was not a big deal. I understand that putting yourself out there is HARD. It can be so hard. I've done it a bunch of times and literally every time, I need to muster up the drive.

You were single yesterday, you're still single now. **Nothing has changed!** If you get rejected, and you feel bad about it, just know that it's normal. But that rejection does not change you, your situation. So don't let rejection, or the fear of rejection define your self-worth and stop you from trying to get what you want. You have nothing to lose by asking him or her out. **You're not a bigger loser or more ugly or whatever if they say no.**

But if they say yes? Congrats. Something HAS changed. You have a date. Everyone says that going for it is a Win-Win situation. This is absolutely true.
