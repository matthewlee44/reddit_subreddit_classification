I’m not sure if it’s bc she’s busy or she’s losing interest; she has been out of town a lot recently and has a lot of activities, but I’m not sure if she doesn’t want to spend any time with me or just doesn’t have the time that frequently.

Also, since she got back from her trip this week, she asked if instead of me calling her, we could switch to texting instead. 

Other signs point to her liking me or at least that she used to like me. At least before her trip, she would smile and laugh constantly while I was talking to her, frequently try to prompt conversations with me, and even introduced me to her older sisters. 

But she still never initiates texting and I always have to bring up going on a date and she’s usually busy.

I guess I just am not sure if she likes me (but is horrible at initiating and is constantly busy) or doesn’t like me (and feels uncomfortable telling me she’s not interested anymore). 

I’m seeing her tomorrow, so I want to know how to handle this. Should I ignore her not in a mean way, just not initiate conversation and wait for her to say something (fyi that one could backfire bc she’s a little shy)? Should I be warm and friendly and see if she reciprocates? Should I say hi, but in a way where she knows I’m a little angry (so she can ask if everything is fine if she still cares)? Should I bring up that I wish she would initiate more and make an effort to spend time with me (problem with this one is I don’t want to come off clingy or needy, but I really don’t think one date a week is too much to ask)?

If I know she doesn’t like me, I would definitely break up, but I’m not sure either way. I would like to maintain my dignity as well, especially since we work together.

Is there some test I could do to gauge interest? I’m seeing her tomorrow. Pls dm me if you think you could help if you had more info. Thanks.

TDLR: Gf hasn’t been as friendly over text since her trip, and she is always busy. I would like to gauge her interest or patch things up if necessary.

I guess culture played a role. I did try to use dating apps specifically for South Asian, but didn't find anyone close - people I matched with were very very far away, I am talking about countries far away -.
So obviously even if I matched with someone the conversation would fizzle.

I probably will end up in an arranged marriage. I kept reading about dating, relationship and I thought that it would be important before learning about relationships. That's what pushed me to try to use dating apps. I thought maybe I could find someone and that could have led something long term. 

I don't know what to think about the matter or if I am doing everything wrong. 

The majority of times I think, I have always been on my own. My first and main goal is to find a good job.

We had been out for a good couple of hours and while we were dancing we bumped into some people we knew from high school.

With them was this guy, he seemed to be pretty drunk (I was tipsy myself), he kept asking me questions and after a short while he kissed me. I didn't think anything of it and kissed him back because what was some harmless making out with a stranger that I'd never see again?

He then asked me for my number, which I gave him (side note I have a problem with being a people pleaser and I struggle to say no to people especially in person when I'm put on the spot) and I regretted right away.

Fast forward to the next morning and I'm woken up to a message from him saying he'd like to see me again (in hindsight I probably should've just ignored it) and I got this bad anxious feeling in my stomach  - I have bad social anxiety more so when I'm alone than when I'm with groups of my friends so I thought that maybe the idea of seeing him alone just triggered my anxiety and not being able to say no I just agreed with him.

He was very persistent in his messages the week that followed wanting to go out to dinner the next weekend but I already had plans so that didn't happened.

He had asked about going out for dinner again the following Friday but I got sick and told him I would keep him updated on what the doctor said as that would determine if I still went out to dinner, he then said that he could come to my house and watch movies with me if I felt sick (and I don't know if its just me but I don't really want a stranger I met once at my house, it doesn't seem safe for me as a young woman). I told him no and we'd see what the doctor said.

Everything was fine I had a sinus infection and was given meds that made me very drowsy but I gave it two days to see if it was just my bodies initial reaction to the new medication. Friday morning rolls around and he messaged me saying he was also feeling sick and would prefer if we maybe did a movie night at someone's house (again I was not comfortable being alone with him anywhere that wasn't public) but I asked if we could postpone because I still felt drowsy. He said Ok but he wanted me to send a picture of my smile first - that creeped me out so I told him I wasn't comfortable and he left it after asking twice.

The next day I had decided that this wasn't going anywhere and so I told him that I wasn't interested in a relationship (romantic or physical) and he was fine with that and I didn't hear from him again.

I thought I was done with him until last week I got a message from him asking if we can meet for coffee after work on Friday as friends - I still couldn't get rid of this unsettled feeling in my stomach at the thought of going out with him so I told him I was busy.

The feeling wouldn't go away so I decided to talk with my mom about it (she has had some issues with her ex stalking us and threatening us so I figured if there were any red flags she'd pick up on them or at least give me an outsiders point of view). She told me that if I had a bad feeling about this guy I must tell him I'm not interested and stop talking to him because generally our instincts are right. She carried on by saying that her therapist explained to her that our bodies let us know when something isn't right and she said it took her a while to realize this was true because with her ex she had a bad feeling and ignored it because he was persistent and look what happened there.

So taking her advice I sent him a message telling him I was sorry for wasting his time and that I wasn't interested in being his friend. But here's where I think I'm the asshole because I blocked him right after, not giving him time to respond, because I was scared his response would make me feel bad and I'd take back what I said because I'd feel bad for hurting him or upsetting him and I'd be forced into an uncomfortable situation because I couldn't say no.

I began seeing this guy (27m) last October. We had spent a few weeks together 2 years ago, too, hanging out, also having sex, but he lived far so after that short encounter we never saw each other till October - when he moved to my city. When we see each other for the second time there is that same weird spark, pure bliss, very good chemistry and an overall intense experience for both of us.  Its been an unwritten friends with benefits relationship since, but a very emotionally charged one. I now begin to feel jealous and basically find myself catching feelings for him. On my end, it is definitely more than just friends, which I don't particularly find alarming as it really is a good match, something I think I only experienced once before, but big words like love seem out of place so I will just describe it as being enamoured. 

I would not mind making it an official relationship, it would actually make me extremely happy to be his, and for him to be mine. But given the amount of time that we have passed being in this limbo, and how he has commitment issues - i think, I need the balls to actually be the one asking him. He's the type of person to not like emotional things, but I believe he cant help but feel it too, from how tightly we hold each other and how fossilized we are with being in each others company, and how we both want to sleep together even if there's no sex involved, just for the cuddles and comfort. He's also deleted tinder recently and made sure to let me know, which I didn't comment on. I was never on it to begin with. We are already acting like a couple with most things, all that differentiates us from a relationship is the label, which I know is a very superficial thing to be looking for, but I think the label adds some security to it, and it may be why I so much yearn for it. I think he may want it too but is too scared to be hurt.

In the past couple of weeks I had the opportunity to have two first dates. One at a bar and another one at a restaurant, for lunch, followed by a stroll.

During both of these dates I was doing 90% of the talking. No joke. When there was a blank moment I tried to fill it with a question in order to re-start the conversation but it didn't go far, meaning both of them answered the question without putting an effort to transform it into a conversation. I was answering my own questions after their answer to show that I wanted to share since they didn't ask about myself.

At the end I stopped trying to ask questions or find a way to fill the silence because I consider it should work both ways and I was not there to do an interview. No surprise that sometimes they tried to ask a very not interesting question or just not saying anything

What baffled me is that both told me they would be happy to do a second date. Wtf ? Like you showed 0 interest and you tell me that? It was not really pleasant tbh

For information I'm from Europe and I recently settled in the US, so maybe things are done differently when it comes to dating. But from my experience in Europe the goal of the first date (at least it's how I was doing it and it worked) is to share and see if our personalities click, meaning we have to share things that are not superficial (like do you have brothers or do you prefer cold/warm weather lol)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164129,public,self,What should be a first date and lack of conversation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tiwcgm/what_should_be_a_first_date_and_lack_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Anyways, here's the story:

I met this girl last year at a party. I was with a date at the time, but I was smitten so I talked her up and got her socials. We didn't speak for another couple of months when she hit me up. We talked briefly, she dropped the conversation, and then hit me up again a month later. This happened a few times before the end of the semester. By then, I was really into her and wanted to take things further. 

Come January, I decide that I should be the one to hit her up. We talk, conversation goes, sputters, dies. A week later, she hits me up, and I ask her out. She's down, we make plans. I change them last minute for a family function. We still hang out, things are good, but because of the last minute change she has to leave earlier. She takes me back to hers, introduces me to her friends. We part after a 3 hour date.

We don't hang out for another two weeks. She decides to hang with me last minute. I take her to a bar with some of my friends, and we stick together for the most part. We hug when we part. We see each other the next weekend at a party (she forgets about our dinner plans beforehand on account of having midterms). She brings her friends but she sticks with me throughout. We get drunk and pretend to be husband and wife, jokingly introducing ourselves as such to people we meet. Before she leaves she tells me that she wants something serious and that she isn't looking for hookups. I reciprocate that feeling, but I think I was too drunk to appear serious when I said it.

We hang out the next Monday. She dresses up. We talk the entire time. We both open up a little bit to each other. During the date I offer to take her back to mine to listen to this album I thought she'd like. She has work so she denies this, but we make plans for later in the week to do this. I test her and a little later on when she's talking about her work, I tell her to listen to it while she does. She says that we're supposed to listen to it together. We part that night with warm feelings. I feel like I'm on the fucking moon.

On the surface, this seems like things are cranking along perfectly. Interest is slowly building, things are great. But this only accounts for the instances where we're together in person. Over text, things are a different ball-game. As mentioned prior, our conversations were brief. They go, they sputter, they die. In between certain interactions are several day voids of time where she leaves me on delivered. Nevertheless, I'm on her private story and I see her posting, going out, partying and so on. On our last date she mentioned how we ""text a lot"", but (and this might be selfish of me to say) I've talked to plenty of other girls interested in me who I can really say I've ""texted a lot"", and the frequency there is astronomically better than our texting patterns. 

It has been two weeks since that last date, and Spring Break has passed. Last I spoke to her, I asked her out this week. She responded instantly saying she was down. I give her a couple days to choose from, and now it's been 1 day+ delivery. This is what I'm working with.

I would say I ought to hang out with her more. If it were up to me we would be; I hate texting. But, plans are never set in stone. She seems to be a busy girl. I tried getting her the week after we first hung out. She said she was free all weekend, before leaving me on delivered while she went back to her hometown (valid reason ofc). Next time we make plans is the dinner which she forgets about (granted I failed to follow up earlier in the day). And our plans to listen to that album the week after fell through because she had a string of parties and outings the rest of the week. When she told me this, I followed up with brief lunch plans which she glossed over. Even now my most recent proposal is still up in the air.

This whole thing has been confusing and exhausting, but she's a drug. I've been in a few situations before where I could pick up on enough signs that the girl wasn't into me, and in those cases, despite being interested in them, I would have enough clarity to drop out. I can see it in the dry texting, dismissive snaps, long delivery times, and constant excuses not to go out. But this situation is one where there is more than enough there not to drop it.

Although most men I come across aren't small, my BF was one of the ones I found and I like his height tbh, its cute and I love hugging him and kissing him. The problem is that he's been told a lot of times that short men aren't sexually attractive, he'd be more of a man if he was a lot taller, short men have small dicks (my BF has a big dick so this is not always true and I've been with tall guys that had small dicks), and other generalizations.  


 This has led him to think that he's not good enough for me, but I keep telling him that hes perfect the way he is and I wouldn't change a thing about him.

(I may have screwed up here but, well) I ask if she would like to exchange snap/ig ect. since I'm easier to get a hold of that way and to make plans for coffee. She declines, she had a bad experience in the past (fair enough) I tell her it's no big deal, leaving it at that, say good night and all that.

I had not intended of message her again before Saturday to make clear plans but she keept messaging me in the morning and I would reply in the evenings and chat a bit, this goes on during the week.

Fryday I tell her I'm going to a party and she should shoot me a message when she wants to make plans.

Saturday morning she messages back  asking about the party and all that, but dosen't make any plans.

Sunday morning I message her saying I'm excited to meet her and offer up a cafe and time. However she, says she is too embarrassed to tell her parents (she is 25). Alright sure I make light of it and over on, we agree to reschedule later next week (we are both busy)

The date went very well with both and at some point I chose to spent my energy on R because she was more enthusiastic and I find it hard to focus on multiple girls. One month later we decided to not see each other again.

So basically I'm afraid I chose the wrong girl. Is it possible to still connect with M? I think it is perhaps a little selfish, but also don't want to spoil my chances. We haven't had contact since the first date. I told her that I was gone for a 2-3 weeks because I had to focus on work (which is true and I said the same to R). That still means I had to text het about three weeks ago. I didn't because I was focused on r.
What are your thoughts? Would contacting her be selfish or not?

I'm 16 years old and have been out with a few girls in the past, I've found it really easy to talk with them and everytime we went out together, we always had a great time. Recently, I've began a newfound interest in another girl, let's call her Katie, and I feel way different with her than any other girl before, she's obviously genuine, really kind and she's probably the prettiest girl I've ever seen in my life (my standards are quite high as well). We started of talking when I messaged her on Instagram, expressing how I thought she was really cool, how I loved her style and we hit it off over that, even making eachother playlists (she has amazing music taste). A few weeks in with us messaging, she said that she really enjoyed talking to me and wondered if I liked her. I said that I liked the idea of that but thought we should get to know eachother better. We've hung out 4 times, 2 at the movies, 2 and town and nothing really comes of them. We've never hugged or even held hands and it's odd because I find it harder to talk to her than anyone before. She's never had a boyfriend and I'm aware she's quite independent but it's clear she's trying to experiment and I'm quite sure she has a thing for me. I also told her that she's welcome to come to mine to watch a film or hang there when she wants and she really liked that idea. I just really want something to happen, maybe some intimacy or just a long and easy conversation, she's an interesting person. Has anyone got advice to help me through this? Despite my relationships in the past, I'm still quite a shy person.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple other notes that may or may not be important:

\- We don't text that frequently

\- I've noticed she mimics some of the things I say. e.g. I've said how I've really wanted to hug her or hold her hand typically after we've spent the day together. The next time after we've hung out, she says she really wanted to give me a hug; if I post on instagram, she'll post, etc. What I take from this is that I have to be the one to initiate everything.

I've said certain films made me think of her, or certain songs. In reply, she'll message me later with the same thing, and linking me a song to listen to.

I’ve been on a string of dates lately that are probably objectively good, but I end up getting the ick anyway, and I know it’s my fault. Don’t leave yet, let me explain. 

I am a little bit of a people pleaser and fairly empathetic. In a group setting, I’m the one who steps in to smooth conflict so dinner doesn’t go down in flames. You know, the person who changes the conversation when she knows we’re entering the territory where there’s going to be a fight.  Or I’m the one in most of my friend groups to make the new boyfriend/girlfriend feel welcome. In short, something in me feels the strong need to make other people feel comfortable.

So in a dating setting, I do the same. I’m present and ask questions try to put the other person at ease, and sometimes it ends up feeling performative. Maybe I laugh a little harder at something than I otherwise would. Or the forever-awkward check situation: if a waitress or bartender asks, I always immediately ask for two checks before he can say anything and try to firtily say I don’t want a guy to buy me a drink until he knows what to order, but for the record, now he knows 😉

However, one of my major icks is men who do not do their own emotional labor, and I kick off seeing a new person by taking it upon myself to handle the emotional labor of a first date. I strive to make him feel comfortable, and then I leave wishing he would have tried to be more assertive and put me at ease or make me laugh or whatever. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with these guys - and I feel bad because it probably comes off as leading them on. A few guys have told me they were confused that I wasn’t interested because they felt like we had a great time.

It’s such a random question and maybe it’s just me. It’s a nerve thing and I don’t know how to stop because that’s the thing - I want to make someone feel comfortable because that’s what decent people do, but I’m also not attracted to guys who let me take the emotional reigns.

I'm sorry for the long post. I try to make it as short as possible while giving all information I want to ask about. 

So i've (f27) been meeting a guy (31) for a while now (since August). Things went great from the first date on and even before that in the two weeks we were texting. 

And apart from one incident (my fault plus lack of communication on his side but we talked about it) back in december it is still going good. It is my first time ""dating"" and I want to take it slow and not push anything. We both wanted to be intimate from the start and there was and I guess still is a lot of sexual energy between us. 

He was always supporting and even got used to the fact that I am there for him too (he told me he needs to get used to that). We have a lot of fun and also can just hang out without anything sexual being a must. We both show interest in each other's hobbies and passions. Usually we would meet once a week or every two werks but stay in regular contact via text.

I know I am not easy right now as I started struggling with mental health for the first time back in november. But i got help and just talk to him about it when it immediately affects him or when he asks about something. He also said he knows I usually am not like that and that it is ok.

Last time we saw each other was three weeks ago. That evening I told him that at the moment the physical contact (even just cuddling) is not just a pleasure, but also really good for my mental health as in combination with his positive attitude it really makes.me relax. He took it as a compliment (said that that same evening).

Contact was a bit reduced then because we both had a bad week. Then i went on holiday and the guy i am meeting contacted me about it and we got talking a lot for 2 days with him proposing to go there with me for a short holiday, too (big surprise for me, it never seemed like he actually wanted to spend ao much time together).
We stayed more or less in contact like usual. I asked him several times if he wants to meet again and his answer was always ""i have to see, ask again in a few days"". I did, and he ignored it once and said he doesn't have time twice. We had a bit more contact on tuesday as he contacted.me and I asked if he spontaneously wanted to come over for coffee as my boss forbade me to work. He asked why, we got talking a little bit as I explained to him that i got a concussion during hockey practice. I already felt that my mental health was breaking down so I did not contact him until today in order to not be a burden (did that with two uni-friends too).
His answers were just one worded, but I was brave and asked if he wants to hang out this week. I got ignored again. Before you ask, I am the one with the more flexible work schedule and even though most of the time I ask to meet, he always enjoys meeting and told me that almost every time. Sometimes he also kind of craves meeting to relax together.

His seasonal second job just started this weekend. I know he is working almost every weekend from march to october as i got to know him during that time and i am ok with it. That's why we usually meet during the week.

So long story short: did i do something wrong or is it just my mental health telling me i did something wrong?  I am really confused about the mixed signals he sends, and unsure if he is ignoring me on purpose or if it is just because the beginning if the season is busier than the end? I am not am not sure what to do. Do I contact him as usual or might it be wise to let some more time pass? He usually is really direct and always tells me to be straightforward too, but I am anxious that if I ask if I said something wrong or whatever he will get annoyed by me asking.

Why is it that the tall, handsome guys who treat women like objects get girls so easily , yet unattractive guys like me can't even get a girl to reply?

Finally, I have the answers which I will share with you.

1. Females are incredibly visual creatures, even more so than men.

2. Females chase the bad boys in their late teens and early 20s, and finally choose a nice guy to settle down with in their 30s or 40s.

3. Females use unattractive men for their attention and resources. An unattractive man will have to wait 10 dates to get a smooch on the cheek. And attractive man will have sex the first night. 

4. Females are very opportunistic. If a new guy comes along that is a better version of you, than she will likely jump ship to him.


 These 4 facts seem to go without saying. However, my mom seems to think that my views about females is ""misogynistic"".

I am using a throwaway account for some critiquing because I am not having any luck whatsoever with OKC and never had any luck with online dating in general.

*New to the area. A full time student, ready to graduate with my bachelors. Can be pretty awkward at times and a little reserved, until I can get to know someone well enough.*

*Hobbies include: Gaming, currently learning guitar, I am on book 2 of 8 in The Witcher novels, love to travel and explore, trying new foods, watching baseball, love going to metal concerts, the beach, loves to fish and go camping.*

*My bachelors in Liberal Arts with a focus on public health.*

*A dream of mine is to learn guitar well enough to write and make my own music. Also want to play one live show at least once.*

The rest are just some other Q&amp;A’s as well. Also answered a bunch of the OkCupid question things they use to calculate compatibility, and answered them very honestly. But yet, only 1 match.

From the first day we hit it off and she said she couldn’t believe I was real and she liked everything so far about me. I felt the same way about her. We kissed and she spent a night but nothing happen though it could’ve. I was being cautious not to move too fast. I made her breakfast in the morning and we just chilled for a bit. 

The next day I asked her what she was looking for and how she felt about me because her response to my prior text seemed a bit iffy. She told me she was in a weird and chaotic place and didn’t know what she was looking and still figuring out a lot for herself but that she enjoyed my company and definitely wanted to hangout again. I said ok cool thanks for being and honest and let’s just keep hanging out.

So the second date we continued to make out and at some point she said I was going to fuck her up and I told her I’m afraid she’s going to hurt me too and that I would move at whatever pace she wanted. We get back to my place. We had been drinking but not like hammered out of our senses. She climbs on top of me and says I want you to fuck me. I told her no because I actually liked her and didn’t want to ruin things by moving to quickly because I had been in similar situations before. She started crying a little and couldn’t understand because that never happened to her and since she 12 people wanted to sleep with her. 

The morning comes and I don’t know what came over me. I started touching her and we slept together, and found we had good physical chemistry. I asked her things won’t get weird. She said they wouldn’t. We went to brunch.

From that point it felt as if we were dating like the attention I was giving her and she seemed to like me. But then I started feeling anxious remembering what she said about not knowing what she wanted. I was like maybe she’s still there and the page didn’t change. 

Long story short I eventually get hit with a text saying that she shouldn’t be dating anyone right now and has old trauma and healing for herself she just needs to focus on right now. But she said that I was wonderful and truly sorry and this isn’t easy for her either.

I told her that I’m sorry because I felt she would say that. Like my feelings for her and maybe hers for me to some degree sort of naturally started pushing the relationship to a place she wasn’t ready for but I am or at least very open too. I said sorry because I felt her telling me where she was and the fact that she just got out an 8 year relationship that she been in since she was 18 this past summer (shes 26) and suffers from bpd was something my feelings made me ignore, inadvertently putting effort toward more. 

I told her to take all the time she need and if she’s ever in a different place to reach out. I told her I’ll be chilling and taking a break too because I’m emotionally drained. I also said I thought it was cool she was working on herself and that was one of the things I really liked about her. 

Did I do the right thing here? 

Do you think there’s a chance in the future if time passes although I’m not waiting on her?

How do I not feel bad and like I fucked things up like only if I would have stuck to my guns and not have had sex with her we could’ve continued to hangout and when she was ready things could have moved forward?

They broke up in December 2021, and they have an 2-day road trip to see a show next week and tickets for a show in town in late April. He and his ex are still friends, which I want to support, but it's been kind of a sore topic because she's still left a bunch of things at the apartment (they lived together for a bit and she moved out). She also was texting him one of the first nights we spent together about random shows she thinks he would enjoy and then asking about how his date with me was going. He showed me these texts when he could tell that her stuff being there bothered me a little to show me that (based on his curt replies) I had nothing to worry about. He also asked her on his own to take her things because it meant a lot to him, to which she apparently asked if he had told me how he dumped her in the middle of the lease and that if I knew that and still wanted her to take her things that I was an asshole. 

Anyways he asked if I wanted to buy her ticket because he'd rather go with me. I feel like I'm in a less than ideal spot because I don't really want to be telling him what he can and can't do, especially relatively early in the relationship, but it bothers me. Honestly I don't really feel like paying to take her spot because it's not a type of show I'm interested in. I trust him and that he is with me because there's nothing there but I guess I don't really trust her. He told me I could be honest.

Nobody should face any discrimination based on sex - I wholeheartedly believe that. Are there differences between men and women? Sure, otherwise we wouldn't even have created the categories men and women. But naturalistic explanations in my opinion don't suffice when talking about what society should be created (just because something is natural doesn't make it moral). But enough intellectualizing.

Growing up I was in love with 2 girls in High School, but too shy to do anything about it. However, what was deeply ingrained in me back then was the idea, that the only way to date was to be in love with your partner already (because why else would you want to date that person??). That reasoning was obviously flawed, and I realized that when I started to use Tinder at University, when I was twenty. It was a short stint and not successful at all. But I had overcome my fear of rejection by just constantly being rejected. I was a really good lesson to be learned and I learned a lot about who I was romantically (as that part had previously not existed - the furthest I had gotten was to hold hands with a dear girl friend at a party right after High School had ended) and also about how to talk to women. Then Covid hit and I stepped away from the whole ordeal until a year later, when I created a new account, made new photos + was one year older. I had a lot more success than previously and I began to seriously use Tinder over the next 7 months.
During that time I had around one match a day, to which I always sent a well thought out message (not to toot my own horn, but sometimes she even messaged first).

Because I don't want to bore you with the details:
Of these around 200 Matches I ended up seriously talking with 9 of them (all of the others by process of elimination stopped responding to me at some point early on, or they just were an insufferable bore i.e. not participating in the conversation). With 5 of them I went on dates. They were all fantastic outings. 3 of them ghosted me after 1-3 Dates (but never immediately after the date, more like a slow fade (but also not because I didn't show enough interest about continuing the date). One lived to far away and the connection wasn't strong enough to make it work. And one rejected me but wanted to stay friends because she really liked my personality. With the other 4: 
One overslept on the day of the date (we were supposed to meet at 4pm, so I don't know how she managed to do that). She felt embarrassed, but didn't apologize or asked if she could make it up to me by planning the date for another time (I had planned that date). So I stopped messaging her and cut my losses. 
One sent me nudes (without me asking) but at the same time ""friendzoned"" me because I was too young for her (she was 23 and I 21). It was one of the weirdest experiences and also fucked me up a bit, because our conversations were super sexual, but at the same time she didn't really feel a lot of attraction to me outside of sex, as she admitted (me being a student without a car, while she normally dated people 5-10 years older than her, who just are a lot more established). My explanation: She wanted to have sexual closeness with someone at the time, even though she didn't want anything casual. But the only place were she found that was in me. Yeah, I'm still wrapping my head around it a few months later. Because I wasn't used to this and saw sexual closeness to be = to romantic closeness it fucked me up and I told her that we couldn't continue texting.
One was a woman that I think was someone akeen to being my soulmate. We got along super well, I have never felt a stronger connection with anyone in my life and she might have been the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen. But she lived too far away. (She was real, it was just that her hometown was the city that I lived in and we matched when she visited her parents (which is once in a blue moon)).
These two both kinda submerged at the same time and fucked up the possibility of a relationship with another girl. I was completely mentally destroyed after the two other girls and I needed to take a break from dating and I told her that. She was completely understanding, but two weeks later when I felt a bit better again and reached out to her, she was already in a relationship.

Now about me: I'm a relatively tall (5'11), skinny/fit white guy (in a western european country). And what I would consider to be kind of feminine. I love art (pursuing a degree in it), films, politics and have a natural talent when it comes to having a conversation and making other people feel comfortable while at it. I look very young for my age (22) and often get mistaken to be 18 or 19.
My voice is quite high, which I don't mind at all (although it has already gotten me ghosted once or twice). Therefore I mostly attract bisexual women: Out of the 9 women that seriously contemplated me, 6 were bisexual (percentage being much higher as in average population, although small sample size to be fair). I think that is awesome, as I don't really give a shit about gender roles and I am of the expression that bisexual women are in general less heteronormativ and more feminist. But even with this cohort I have run into quite a bit of situations that made me question my feminism.
What I have experienced:
The necessity of having confidence and being able to lead a conversation: Especially on Tinder I always felt like I was a bird of paradise dancing for the approval of its potential female mate. Not a good way to start an equal partnership.
The necessity of having experience: The first girl I dated was super into me and touched me a lot on our first three dates. This was all super new to me and I told her at the end of the first date that this was my first date ever, so she understood that I wanted to take the physical slow. I reciprocated the touches, but not as much as she did. At the end of the third date, where I had laid my arm around her for like thirty minutes I asked her if I could kiss her. She told me no, as she didn't feel like I had seduced her enough, which is, according to her, what a boy is supposed to do, and that it was too big of a jump for her. I was a bit confused because the touching made me think that she waited for me to ask her all along. It was a big lesson learned, that I should make more effort to create romantic attraction and escalation (for lack of a better word). Sadly I wasn't able to try that new found knowledge on another date with her, as that moment had killed all of the previous attraction she had for me. She cancelled the next date and at some point stopped responding. I called her out on it, she profusely apologized and told me she did some thinking and currently wants to only look for friends, and asked me if we could be just that. Thing is, I had just swiped left on her new Tinder profile so I didn't believe a word she said. Needless to say I rejected that offer and never spoke to her again.
What it comes down to, however, is this Catch 22: How am I able to gain experience when experience is a prerequisite?
The necessity of being older than your partner and being at least as established as them. Here I'm gonna turn into a few other macro aspects when it comes to dating, that I found shocking.
Number 1: The Single Rates of young women and men. PewResearch did a study on Singledom in general and found out that age 18-29, 51% of men are single versus merely 32% of women. That is an absolutely insane discrepancy in my opinion, because only 1-2% can be explained by the fact that there are 1-2% more men in that age group because more men are being born than women. The only way this can be explained is that many women in their 20s date men in their 30s because of polishedness, maturity and stability. As a young man you are basically worth shit in the dating department. It is also a good explanation as to why it feels as if there are so much more young single men than women (on Tinder) - because there are. 

Number 2: Another study that showcased that there is actually no gender pay gap between men and women. Just a gender pay gap between married me and everyone else. Married men, who make around 80k vs single men, married women and single women, who all make around 45k. The implication being that in order to be marriage material as a man, you need to make a lot more money than the average.

To answer how this has made me question my feminism:
Don't get me wrong - I'm still a feminist in that I believe in all the things it ascribes to do, but I just see a lot of women acting on the micro and macro level in unfeminist ways and it has made me look at the assumption differently, that things like the gender pay gap are this oppressive thing forced upon women that they aren't at all partaking in. Of course I understand the nature of systemic issues (socialization and stuff that are at least part of the cause of this), but it is I guess very difficult for me to reconcile all these feminist women in my life, that suddenly when it comes to dating just talk the talk and don't walk the walk. Just a bunch of confusing messages. And these are the ones that are the most ""woke"", which should presumably give you at least a bit of control over your destiny.

And because I've realized how big the impact of dating is on the rest of the aspects of our society, I cannot really take people seriously anymore when they complain about the gender pay gap (as it seems to be the case, that men just have a much larger incentive in being financially successful because otherwise they are not seen as an attractive mate), or the fact that older men tend to want to date younger women. For the last part: I don't know, it seems like it takes 2 to tangle. I of course am aware of power dynamics but it seems like, more often than not, these differences in power (such as maturity, wealth, but also beauty) are precisely what makes that other person so attractive.
Even I can see that with my Tinder matches. I'm 22 and most of the girls that I match with are 19-21. The amount of women that are 22 oder older are miniscule, even though I have my age range set up to 25. The common narrative I always got is that it is creepy for a guy to date younger women. I definitely think that it can be, if the reason is specifically the age and therefore her inexperience. But what I think is just as fucked up is the fact that (on average) women don't want to date guys that are slightly less or as unpolished or inexperienced as they are. A girl friend once told me that all the women will throw themselves at me once I am thirty, because I will presumably age better than most other men (my dad is 65 (yes he got me very late), but still looks like he is 50 and, again, I also look very young for my age). What she didn't voice here was what is undeniably a part of it, and that is the fact that I will also be more established when I will be 30, in comparison as to where I am now. And so even if that were to be the case, it would seem to me just to be such a slap in the face, to only then finally be seen worthy of consideration by the same women, who are right now rejecting or ghosting me over my inexperience. Fuck you. It actually makes me want to date younger women once I'm 30 and have the ability to do so (like 24, not exceedingly young). Because why should I value your maturity if you can't even value my unpolishedness and youth.

I met up to get lunch with this guy that I matched with on Tinder months ago and exchanged phone numbers with. He seemed really into me despite never meeting.

It only lasted about 45ish minutes, the food came out pretty fast. I can’t remember much about what he said after the date ended but he said something about it being fun and it being nice to meet me, and gave me an awkward hug, but he didn’t say anything about meeting again. I did turn around and say like “Hey if you ever want to meet again just text me” and he said something quick like “Yeah I’ll be in like May” (we’re in college). I balled my eyes out on the way home biking. When I got home, I texted him asking if he got the money I Venmo’d him since he paid with his card. He replied with “yes I did thank you!!” And then replied again with “That was fun!! You’re super cute and I def wanna hang again if you’re down.” It felt like a pity text to me :( I replied saying the same thing basically, saying that he’s super cute and I’d be down to hangout again and that I felt like I was awkward the whole date.

I got into a relationship with my ex after the death of my dad which meant I was an adult orphan at 29(and I wasn't a life developmentally mature 29 year old, was studying, this was my first relationship, living at home(before moving away to study a Masters abroad)) I never wanted to put pressure on my ex and not even sure if I ever articulated this to her or not but in a sense she was my anchor between the past and the future. She was the person that I looked at and I believed in spite of the depths of sadness I was experiencing that life could still be okay and good things could happen. In my lowest point this girl who was just a random girl in my program suddenly became my girlfriend. My first ever girlfriend! But in this scenario the projection did not coalesce with whatever my girlfriend needed. She had her story and maybe at the time she was at in her life she needed somebody strong, bold and confident. I just wasn't that person, I was philosophical and ponderous. Maybe in a different time she would have seen how much I needed her(I don't need anybody really but I did need her to be that link between past and present) and been okay with it. I'm rambling a little but I just think projection is necessary, I think we all want to be saved it's just who we are willing to let our guard down to be saved by?

He was the most confident, cocky, sassy, funny handsome guy I'd ever met.

He had a GF but I had a couple of opportunities to cuddle with him/sleep with him as he invited me into his room a few times. However, I turned him down every time due to my ""morals"", just hoping that he would break up with her.

Well guess what? Because I kept turning him down, he started eventually having his GF come over more and more, to the point where she was coming over 3,4,5, times a week, and then every night. He took her to weddings, parties, and even on an out of state tropical vacation.

They got closer and closer and this guy just ended up completely leaving me out and forgetting me. I am confident that he \*somewhat\* liked me when I first moved in, and I can't help but wonder if I cuddled with him/slept with him could we have created an emotional spark and he would have chosen me instead of his GF. I was basically unfriendly and uptight and have since moved out.

I now live on my own and I can't get over the feeling of ""missing out"". I still have dreams about this guy every night, and sometimes his GF even appears in my dream and it's really painful to just see them so happy whereas I'm just...in the room next door listening to them having sex.

They sleep together and he fades away. 

The reason why? Post nut clarity. 

It’s a crude way to describe the concoction of chemicals the brain releases after a man ejaculates. 

Leading up to that point, a lot of men truly do believe they like the woman and want to see where things go. But once they orgasm, they see the woman in one of two ways: 1) holy shit I really really do like her and want to be with her all the time and just cuddle and all the emotional good stuff OR 2) I want NOTHING to do with her right now I just want to get out of here and sleep and do my own thing. 

The second path can sometimes even result in the man feeling disgust for the woman. I know it sounds horrible, but I’m sure some women here can corroborate sleeping with a man who immediately becomes distant and cold after orgasming. 

This is why so many men fade away after sleeping with a woman for the first time. It’s not because they’re malicious and intended to do so. 

Are there men who do target women solely for sex and nothing else? ABSOLUTELY. 

But if a guy you thought was a decent human starts to fade away after sex, it means his brain hasn’t formed an emotional bond with you. I don’t know what the solution to this is because I’ve dated women whom I was smitten with before sex and then once we have sex, I realize I’m not into her at all. 

I know this happens for women too, sometimes, but the reason why it’s not mentioned as often is because a lot of men suck at pleasing their partners and most women don’t experience an orgasm as a result.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164130,public,self,Controversial: post-nut clarity is why men will lose interest in a woman after sleeping with them,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tizv25/controversial_postnut_clarity_is_why_men_will/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I went on a date with someone my age that I matched with on Tinder months ago. We exchanged phone numbers, but never texted unless we were planning to meet up. We exchanged messages over winter break and realized we couldn’t meet up, so we waited until spring break. He texted me out of the blue months later saying “Heyy #### it’s ######” “You home from spring break?” Long story short, we got lunch and I thought it went horrible. He was SO social, SO nice, and SO cute. However, I am SO introverted. He asked about the social life at my university and I made myself seem super boring. Ya know, like I’ve never drank, never smoked, and I have barely any friends. We made eye contact and talked constantly however and there was never really a moment where we weren’t talking. Also, he seemed to enjoy talking to me, there was nothing that seemed like he absolutely did not want to talk to me. When the waiter put our check on the table, we talked for a good 5 minutes before he said something along the lines of “Oh are we supposed to bring this up to the register?” My heart sank because I felt like he didn’t want to talk to me anymore. The date was pretty quick, it was probably about 45 minutes long. When we left the restaurant he said something along the lines of like “That was fun and it was nice to meet you” and gave me a hug. He never said anything about wanting to meet me again when we left. I balled my eyes out on the way home. I texted him when I got home asking if he got the money I Venmo’d him since he paid for the food.

I have Asperger's, (diagnosis pending, but regardless it sets the some background easily), I have 4 friends, total, altogether not including my dog or family members, I find most social interactions insanely stressful where I am just so busy masking and not doing awkward stuff, or trying to make eye contact, trying to not speak to much, be too honest, get fixated, that after a social interaction I feel like exhausted and stressed. But I started dating this awesome woman last year. And like all my dates there was no butterflies or super excitement to see them but there was something new and that is I just felt at home, truly so comfortable in someone's presence, it's like she was family. I don't really mask, or at least didn't, and now I guess it's more I just respect her boundaries I don't hug or kiss her despite really craving that physical intimacy still... And instead of feeling stressed it feels like a holiday when I've seen her I actually come away so much happier, and it's totally unique for me, no-one has made me actually happy like this, and we have pretty similar interests, and a are on similar wavelengths politically, have shared views of the world I guess that's why it's so easy.
Anyway not that I fully understand it but I respect it, she doesn't want a romantic relationship with me, but wants to be friends, so the last 6 months we have been friends. However the other day she mentioned if I got a girlfriend she'd like to meet them, and I said I don't think my girlfriend would like that, mainly because I think they'd be jealous, and probably rightly so. And it kinda made me think too that if she got a partner I'd wouldn't like it., and while I know that nothings going to happen between us, I don't like the idea that if I saw her and she was with someone else I wouldn't have my safe space, my sensation of a holiday, there would be another person there and I'd bring up all my masking behaviours and it'd be a stressor again.
I really don't want to let go of the only good adult friendship I've ever formed, and lose my best friend, but I don't see a happy ending. I was thinking I'd cross that bridge when we got to it, but I now don't know if that's just going to make it harder.

As I grew older, I realized it was harder being comfortable with myself when due traumatic experiences  that caused me to feel insecure about myself. 

I feel there is so much societal pressure on what you should be doing by your late twenties (good career, credit score, own place). Sometimes, when I am on a date I feel like I am interviewing for a damn job lol. 

Like I know I should be myself, but what if myself is like not doing much right now. I feel like if that's the case then I probably shouldn't be dating. I have a pretty good job but it isn't interesting and basically im just chillin', Kinda tryna to get my life together as well at the moment.

I was dating a nice guy for about four months and we didn’t get to see each other often because he lives about an hour away from me, but then he decided that he doesn’t know what he’s doing with his life and couldn’t be in a relationship so it never went any further than the beginning.

This all ended about two months ago and before that, I had another four month-long relationship. When it ended, I waited about two months and got into the relationship with the last guy. Neither of these guys introduced me to their family members but did introduce me to their friends. I was always scared to have “the conversation” with them for fear would make them run away. But they did anyway. I’m actually kind of glad it didn’t work out with the first guy, but the second guy still bothers me a lot.

Anyway I’ve been starting to get out there again and go on dates and I’m just not finding anyone who I really click with. I am very personable and enjoy people so the conversations are usually good if I’ve gotten as far as agreeing to going out on a date.

It’s just that I don’t feel an extra spark with a lot of these guys I guess. I feel like I don’t even know what I’m looking for and I would definitely prefer to meet someone in real life, become friends with them and then have it grow into something else.

That’s just how I am - dating apps kind of freak me out because there’s so much pressure from the get-go. Just wondering if anyone else ever feels like this and if you think I’m being too picky and that’s why I’m not feeling a spark or does it just take a long time? My real backstory is that I was in a 10 year abusive relationship with a narc who really brought my self-esteem down. 

That relationship has been over for four years now - thank goodness and I’ve been to therapy and done a lot of healing and growing.

I am a woman. I am lonely. I am empty. I am genuinely confused.

I got with the father of my son when I was 15 years old. He was 18. We had our ups and downs as do typical teen relationships. I moved in with him and his mother and sister when I was 16. I graduated high school in 2015 and two short, happy years later, we moved into our new apartment, and Matt and I welcomed our baby boy just like we always talked about.

Time fell short, thereafter. 

The dishonesty, the disloyalty. Arguments. The nitpicking.

I made a really horrible choice and that was to cheat.

I frown upon my decision to this very day. 

He knew what I was up to. But why did I do it?

The only reason I can give was that I was simply just bored. I never had the chance to be independent- I was always in a relationship with him. I didn't meet new people, I didn't have the chance to live the life most people live after graduating. I do NOT regret having my son, and I never will.

I was SO stuck in my head. I tend to worry about everybody elses feelings around me apart from my own.

Irresponsible and pathetic, I know.

I am here in search for advice. Today, I am in a relationship with the man I cheated on the love of my life with, and have been for almost 2 years. 

Troy is materialistic. He cares about his looks, his reputation, he has to have top of the top everything.

Me? I'm okay with being at the bottom.

The thing about it is, we constantly argue. It's always over stupid, petty things. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

It's ""Where are you going? Who are you with? Who is there? What time are you coming back?"" It's ""You were done working at 3, and its 3:07, WYA.""

He hates my family. He hates half of my lifestyle.

But yet, he wants to marry. Have babies.

I, infact, do not. I am stuck.

Memories replay in my head every single day. Why did I do this to the family that was supposed to last a lifetime? 

Troy, again, is materialistic. I know that if i carry on with my life now, I will someday have a house to share with him and call our own. We have so much potential but then I remember how unhappy I am and how UNFAIR it is for HIM, that I do not want to put forth the effort to build a future with him, simply because I am so lost in my life.

Sometimes I think I should change my name, tell nobody, and just disappear.

But really, what would that change?

Am I dwelling on what used to be to much?

Or is my heart actually aching for what Matt and I had, and always will have?

I'm torn.

To make a decision, somebody will always be hurt in the end, and I truly do not know what to do at this point in my life.

I feel like I have forgotten how to be myself.

I have forgotten how to act myself.

What kind of things do I like?

What are my dreams?

Today I went on a third date with someone who I met on Tinder, ""Rob."" 

I am 24 and have been single for a few years now. I have a demanding job and live alone. I am interested in getting to know Rob better, but am not feeling a lot of romantic chemistry yet. 

We agreed to go for a walk around town, (we live very close.) We had an interesting walk and I was enjoying his company. When we got back to my apartment we both went inside, and sat on the couch. Eventually he moved closer to me to cuddle, but it was very awkward. He told me that he doesn't have a lot of experience, and I told him that it's okay. 

I was feeling overwhelmed and tired at this point, and brought up that I had work to get done before tomorrow. When he left he didn't give me a hug and rushed out. 

I texted him Goodnight with a heart and he didn't send a heart back (he was sending them before).

In the beginning I told myself I would never get into any kind of relationship or date with the purpose of forming any kind of connection beyond sex. My split from my wife was gut wrenching and emotionally painful to an extent I was not ready for.  It made me question everything about myself and I felt ruined. My ex wife’s uncertainty and constant back and forth about the status of our relationship left me in this insanely painful limbo and when she finally wanted to end things, I was relieved. I tried everything I could to save our marriage, did everything she asked of me and in the end I was exhausted and emotionally depleted. It was emotional pain that I felt physically. 

I got Bumble not long ago and was feeling a bit discouraged at the conversations and matches I was getting on there. I also downloaded it in a moment of loneliness and almost deleted it the day after. Then one day I matched with this woman who seemed to have a lot of similar interests and we began to talk. Even just over text and messenger, it was easy to talk to her and we never ran out of things to discuss. Our first video chat went for over an hour and only ended because I had dinner plans with friends. We made plans to meet up in person and today was the day. She actually was buying a used car and I have some knowledge and asked her if she needed any help that I’d be more than happy to assist. 

Before seeing the car she wanted to meet for coffee. There was never any awkward moments of silence and I instantly relaxed and felt more comfortable. I was extremely nervous, I haven’t dated in almost a decade. I helped her with the car and I figured after that we’d say goodbye and kind of feel out if she wanted to meet up again. Just as I was driving her back to her car she said “did you want to hang out a bit more? Maybe go for a drive somewhere and go for a walk?” I agreed. Another two hours of talking and getting to know each other, lots of laughing and easy conversation. I figured after the walk she’d want to go home but then she asked if I wanted to grab something to eat because she was hungry after walking for that long. Again, I agreed. This led to us spending the whole day together, she needed to run some errands and I just went with her and hung out. It was just easy. 

I want to take things slowly and she expressed similar feelings to me. When I got home I felt anxiety about how it went and if she’d want to hang out again, I have social anxiety usually after meeting people regardless of how it went. She text me later and asked if I wanted to see her again this week and I agreed happily. I honestly haven’t felt so light and calm around another person in a very long time. I had little faith or hope in dating or meeting anyone after my split from my wife. This woman really changed that for me, it was just a really nice day, one of the best in a long time. I’ve been working on moving on after my divorce. I went to therapy, worked on myself, started working out, eating better, putting myself first and overall just trying to make the best of a bad situation. I’ve learned a lot about myself and been able to do a lot of healing but I still didn’t feel like I’d ever feel a connection to someone again so today just knocked me on my ass a little. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thank you for sharing in my happiness for today. I am excited but also nervous. I don’t want to rush things and I am actually not sure how to proceed, how do I date this woman? I’m not sure if that makes sense? I don’t want to do anything too quick but I also want to enjoy getting to know her and see where things go. I definitely feel like we could have a future together but we’ll see.

\~1 mo ago, I went to a bar with a stranger, and it was *so* good—conversation comes so easily; 3 hours felt like 75 min. There's a glimmer in their eyes when they're listening to me talk about my passions. We leave and share an umbrella while walking to their car; they put their arm around me b/c I'm freezing in the rain. They drive me home, we kiss for a short bit and talk about a second date. Cute follow-up texts ensue about how much we enjoyed sharing the umbrella and how they're excited to ""learn more about me.""

&amp;#x200B;

4 days later, they take me to a concert where many of their friends are attending. They buy me a drink and introduce me to the friends; we get along. My date and I get so caught up in talking to each other that we miss some of the acts in the concert hall! It was really fun. Afterward, they walk me to my ride home, we kiss, and they look right into my eyes and very earnestly tell me I'm ""beautiful."" It was *really* tender and striking. Cute follow-up texts ensue; they tell me one of their friends thought I was ""really cool""—it's a nice plus when their friends like you! Bliss...I'm over the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

Date 3 is 2 weeks later since we're both OOT. Most days we text a little, but I'm texting a bit more than I would like. I don't fret and don't over-text. They seem overwhelmed with tasks coming back in town, so I plan date 3 and it's great. I caught a yellow flag when they say they're an ""insecure, anxious, and closed-off person""...but nbd. I walk them home and they let me into their place where we make out, give massages, cuddle, joke a little bit, and touch each other in all the right places (no sex)...it was *so* nice/tender. Eventually I sit up to go, but they pull me back into the bed for a little longer. They send me home with a sweater to wear in the cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later they suddenly send me a text saying that, after some rumination and talking to a friend, they need to withdraw from the dating scene bc they had a ""bad experience"" (not with me) in Feb that they need to process and can't fairly reciprocate time &amp; emotion. Assuming it's honest, I just wish they had told me this before leading me on. This was \~1 week ago and I've been depressed and terribly unproductive. I can't be kidding myself—the dates were utter magic, straight from the movies type shit. To have that build up so quickly and be so good, yet yanked away in a sudden 180 has drove a knife through my chest. I've never beed sad like this, or sad over something of this nature. Why???
