I (21m) used to essentially be a helpless romantic in high school. When I realized I had a connection with a girl, I fell hard. Sometimes it worked well for me, sometimes it didn’t. I dated around in high school and always had a crush on some girl when I was there, but after I left for college I couldn’t find myself really attracted to any girl. It’s nothing against the girls in my school, frankly I just think it was just my anxiety among other things that allowed me to not get close to another woman again. I ghosted girls after I realized things were moving at a pace I wasn’t ready for because I didn’t feel the same way. I was basically wandering through this myopic asexual mess in college and honestly thought I’d be alone. But I finally met her.

I went to an internship across the country and met the prettiest girl of my life. She is single and we’ve had our moments together. We recently got very drunk and just held each other in my bathroom and it’s the deepest connection I’ve had with a girl since 17, including random hookups. I haven’t felt happier with an other girl since high school. I sadly know/think she doesn’t feel the same way since she talks very passionately about an old friend of hers and how she feels about him but I honestly don’t care. She reaffirmed that there are great people out there and these deep feelings towards her will eventually pass. she unknowingly showed me that there are great girls out there and people in general. Still kinda drunk after writing this but it just feels so good to have a crush on someone again. Who’s know, maybe there’s a future for us? I don’t think there will be sadly but I’m simply enjoying my time with her 🥰. She gave me confidence that I can finally make a deep emotional connection with a woman again. It feels great!

You are texting with a girl you aren't yet dating but there is mutual interest. You ask her to hang out and she gives you a free day about a week away. Not the end of the world but you gotta open your eyes and listen. If she is itemizing her plans and their all with friends/family/drinking buddies, MOVE ON! IF a woman or man says she is interested in you but not canceling on people she can and does see regularly and generally aren't new to their life, she really don't like you all that much, she just may like the idea of having you.

Men and women are guilty of this. When someone shows you that you aren't important, believe them and move on. Very rarely does a lasting relationship start without a honeymoon phase. That phase begins when you see eachother/match. If they are putting off hanging without to hang with friends, it's a sign.

NOT NICE GUY. Good guy. There's a difference. 
It means I'm genuinely nice, responsible, I make super calculated decisions, think carefully about consequences, delay gratification, etc.

I define the bad boy type as the care free, live in the moment, never gives a shit about the consequences, does stuff without thinking much kinda guy and not necessarily an asshole.

I have a cousin like this! I've been hanging out with him a lot lately. It's really interesting to see the difference. 

I GET IT!

Hanging out with him is way more fun than me. He has more stories to tell because he's having fun all the time. Meanwhile me working my ass off is all I can remember. 
He doesn't think about consequences which puts us in really fun(and sometimes bad) situations.
I have to stick to my plans. He doesn't have plans to stick to. 
List goes on ...

On the other hand, you can see that he's throwing away a better future by doing this. I'm not. 

It's like everybody has a basic amount of fun that can have and he's trying to burn through it and create the biggest fire and enjoy it right now. While I'm trying to invest it and create a long lasting fire that keeps getting bigger with time and with a peak later in life. 

Not to sound arrogant or shallow but I'm a handsome dude. I get laid without trying. He's still getting way more.

A girl(or a guy! He's a better companion regardless of gender) wants fun right now. Who better to hang out with than the guy that's burning through a lot of fun compared to me who's being stingy with it. And an LTR with that type is not a good idea.

We made it official in June '20, but we had moved in together at the end of may '20, after the fire happened. We had been dating since February '20, and made it exclusive in April '20.

I found out because I was helping him delete old Facebook messages, by his request; long story, but it's a grief thing.

We were exclusive in April, and this incident happened in May. We were still discussing whether we would become serious or not. He wanted to, but I needed more time; I had lots of trauma and was physically abused in my last relationship. But we had agreed to be exclusive. Ironically, we had a conversation about how we wouldnt be talking to anyone else. 

So the thing is, he has mentioned it to me before, but not the way that it looked like in the messages. His apartments he lived at last year burned from the top floor, unfortunately while he was in there. He made it out safe, went back to collect some stuff on another day and ran into one of his neighbors. She started talking to him about his niece and how she really wanted them to meet because he's a good guy, and they'd be a good couple. It was a discussion about setting up a date. From what he told me, he exited the conversation as fast and politely as he could. 

Except he didnt mention to me that the way he did that was by agreeing to meet her. So in the messages, the girl messages him showing concern over the fire and asking to meet him when he's situated. He says ""yes, I should be back on my feet soon. When I do, I'll let you know."". The girl offers to help if he needs anything, and then talks about how many good things she's heard about him, how she's excited to meet him, and leaves a few hearts at the end. He never replies again, even when she messages him a week later. The same day, the aunt messages him asking if he's met the niece, he says no, that she was at the apartments (picking up some of the aunts stuff) but he wasnt there at the time. The aunt messages a few more times about the same thing, but he never replies. 

At the time, he was staying half of the time with me, and the other half with a friend. We were getting really serious, and I was helping him through this painful process of rebuilding his life (money wise he was ok, and I only bought him a couch). He applied for an apartment, and we moved in the next month.

The thing that bothers me the most is that I'm not particularly bothered by this. In the past, I have been way too forgiving in a relationship and I got taken advantage of terribly for it. And yes, I am in therapy rn and it is helping, but I'm still working on stuff. I'm going to bring it up to my therapist, just so she can help me find if I'm being dismissive or something else. Idk :/

I was friends with him for a while before we dated, and I do know that sometimes his way of getting out of situations is to go along with them until he's out of sight. He's promised to find direct ways of saying no or mentioning he has a gf. He's very remorseful, which makes me sad for him because he's a very kind, loving partner. That also sort of concerns me, because I had a lot of empathy for my ex when he'd feel bad for beating me. This relationship is healthy and loving, and he has never so much as raised his voice at me, but I am nervous I'm repeating old patterns. I have genuine confusion as to whether this is something I should be angry about or if I'm right to not think it's a huge deal, and just talk it out as a learning lesson for him to be more direct. He says he is understanding either way, and is giving me space to process it.

Had some good conversation the night we met (We met organically) and then the next night went out again with her and her friends. Was also a great night. Drinking, dancing, flirting, good stuff. We went back to her place, had quite an intimate night, no sex, but other things happened. 

Texting each other for the next week, she seemed very enthusiastic about us getting together again. When I asked her on an actual date, she said something along the lines of ""Id love to go on a date with you"". She is a night shift nurse, and in school, so her free time is limited, however she said ""We'll make it work"" referring to finding time for us. 

She ended up cancelling our date 2 hours beforehand to go have dinner and drinks with her girlfriends that she wouldnt be able to see for a long time, because they are also nurses and are moving out of state to go do travel nursing. Understandable, I get it. It was a last minute thing they realized, cool. Well, she was again enthusiastic about the situation. Apologetic she cancelled, said she would love if I came out for drinks with her and her friends after their dinner. Which btw, I was more nervous for this date than Id ever been, because of how genuine and real she seemed. She really hoped I wanted to reschedule our date, which absolutely I did. 

Well, fast forward a few days and all is pretty quiet when it came to texting. I mean, it had be for the past week ish, because she works nights and I bartend and serve later in the evening. I would get maybe a couple texts from her in a day or two. 

After not hearing anything from her for a couple days, I casually mention, like ""Hey, I know youre busy with your friends, but I just want to make it known Id love to reschedule"" Something along those lines, I dont remember exactly. 

Well, that didnt happen. She decided she didnt have the time and her reasoning was essentially, ""You deserve more but I cant give that to you. I like to go out with friends and have fun, but at the end of the day, I have my stuff I need to focus on."" A major flip from we'll make it work to nevermind, I dont have time. 

Well, being the softy I am, I say Id like to stay friends. To me, she seemed very different from anyone Ive ever met, which made me want to keep her in my life somehow. I told her I didnt see her as just a dating option, but as a person. I respect and understand that she has goals to focus on and such. She said she loves that I dont just see her as a dating option, and that people can have chemistry and it not turn into dating right away, and still have a solid friendship. 

Im doing my best to keep this Woman in my life, but Ive never tried this before and managing my expectations and emotions towards her is proving to be difficult. I havent seen in a several weeks, since I met her and her friends after their dinner, and I miss the shit out of her. 

One last thing I havent mentioned, when we went back to her place the 2nd night, it was the first time I walked into home and felt 'At Home' in a very, very, very long time. Not in a creepy, Im gonna come here when shes not here way, but in a, ""I could get used to this type of way"". She made me a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon, we watched Kevin hart standup, and I laughed so much my asthma acted up. 

I miss her, but cant tell her because I dont want to be selfish and sabotage our new found friendship. And Im doing my best to not let my past dictate my future.

Let's start by saying that I did spend a few years without dating or doing anything related to that because my last relationship did not have a good ending. Anyways, I acquired an interest in BDSM like two years ago and I started visiting parties and dungeons. Since I'm pretty shy to talk with strangers and I'm the one who is expected to have the initiative most of them were just me looking around and probably talking with one or two people. Then covid happened and I kept my distance from all that and a chaotic year went by.

A few weeks ago I remembered the website that most kinky people use to keep in touch with others and I decided to send a message to those who I used to talk to. Thankfully one of them responded to me. We had a nice conversation and they told me that there was a party coming and asked me if I was interested in participating because they knew the people who were in charge and they were good people. To which I responded: of course since I had nothing to do that day.

I wanted to try once again but I had no expectations for things to go any different this time around. I was gonna go look around and probably talk to another lonely person. I will try to keep most of the information out since I do not wish to reveal anyone's identity but the place was very cool, the people were nice and I got into the mood to participate in a scene. After that, I had an easier time initiating a conversation with others and had a great time.

Later that night I saw this gorgeous girl alone, I had seen her earlier that night but she was with someone else. I made my way to her and somehow we started to talk and it was fun and interesting. We decide to stick around for the rest of the night looking at other scenes and keeping the conversation going. It felt natural, nothing forced, it seemed like we had plenty of stuff in common, it was always fresh and fascinating. At some point, she tells me that she saw me participating in my scene. That my body looked pretty sexy, that she was glad I decided to talk with her, and that she was attracted to me. To which I responded in a flirty manner since I thought the same of her. 

As the night progressed so did the scenes around us, they became more intimate. She was enjoying herself looking around. It seems like she enjoyed looking at others and our flirting became more intense. Until we reached a point in which we began to be playful and touching each other more. We ended up having sex in front of some people but most people were doing the same so it didn't feel out of place, plus all that was in my head was he, me, and enjoying the moment.

The party reached its ending, we left the place together, traded phone numbers and she offered to take me to my place since our places weren't that far away from each other. On our way there we calmed down and had a deeper conversation about relationships and our interest in each other. Once we got there we couldn't find a way to say goodbye to each other, instead, we got more intimate, especially her and her mouth.  

None of us had the intention of going separate ways, so I decided to invite her into my place. She barely tried to resist my offer, so we went inside and had a wonderful night. Our kinks were pretty much the same, the chemistry we had while talking was even stronger in bed. It was intense, private, and special. We did talk after we were both satisfied and she explained to me that there was this girl, she still likes and it's her best friend and ex. She told me that she didn't know if she could tell her everything that happened that night, I responded just be honest if you care about her. The morning was already gone, so she decided to leave since her family was worried.

I made sure to tell her to let me know once she got home, so I can relax. The next day I contacted her to make sure she was feeling good and how she felt about what happened between us. She responds that she was good and she somehow managed to get together with the girl she mentioned to me and that she didn't have any regret about what happened between us. On the contrary, she was feeling great about what happened that night.

We flirted the whole day by text and everything was good but the next morning she sent me a message saying that she talked with her girlfriend and told me that their relationship was fragile and needed time. She called me later that day and told me that she has to ""step back"" from me, that she was overwhelmed with everything that happened in the last few days.  So we couldn't talk for some time, I asked how long this time would be and she told me she had no idea. Since she had to wait for a year for her girlfriend to accept to go back with her. Then I understood what she was trying to say, she wanted to cut all ties with me for at least a year but it was obvious that it would probably be an unlimited period. I respectfully and carefully told her that It was good meeting her and that I respected her decision so I would never text or call her again. We said goodbye and as the call ended so did any kind of contact we had.

Now I don't know how to feel. Happy for them? Glad for the experience? Or just sad about being alone. I'm not even surprised, I'm never the one they decide to date. I'm always the one-night thing.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

Recently I (24m) went on a date with someone (27f) I met through work. This being the first time I had met anyone romantically through work, I was quite nervous about it and sought a lot of advice on Reddit dating forums like this one. This is what I have to say about the experience:

**The Outcome &amp; Takeaway**

I didn't use any of the advice. I was just the best version of myself. The date went perfectly (it lasted 6+ hours instead of 2). It didn't work out. 

Was I crushed at first that it didn't work out? Absolutely. If I had followed the advice, would it have worked out? Maybe. But it wouldn't have been what my idea of a perfect first date was. I would have been what someone else wanted me to be, not myself. I think I put my best foot forward and if that wasn't enough - this wasn't the person for me. I have come to totally accept this outcome. I think people really need to ask themselves - is changing who you are and how you would behave worth it for the sake of getting with someone? Is it not better in the long term to find someone who loves you for you? I just think this is the type of question that's not asked enough in these types of forums.

**The Backstory**

Me and person X are hired at the same time through the same hiring program to completely different areas of our organization. X and I are on some email chains for onboarding materials together - she reaches out to me to set up a Zoom call because she looked me up on LinkedIn and is interested in my previous work. We really hit it off on the Zoom call and exchange numbers. We have a few short text exchanges. Radio silence for a week. She texts me that she ""accidentally deleted"" some of the onboarding materials (I took this as a heavy hint she was looking to talk more). So we got to talking and I mentioned that I had perfected a cheesecake recipe to which she replied that she loves sweets. I joked that I would have to make her one sometime and she replied with her availability over the next two weeks (this felt like an even heavier hint at this point).

We make plans to cook dinner and try some of my cheesecake at my place. About a week before we are supposed to, I get a message from her asking to change the plans so they are outdoors because of COVID. Fair enough, COVID is getting worse in our area and we hadn't met yet so maybe coming over to my place was intimidating. We make plans to go to a patio and I told her I would give her the cake to take home afterwards.

We meet at this patio and instantly hit it off in person. Nothing but laughs, free-flowing natural conversation and lots of direct eye contact. We were both opening up about more personal topics (while staying upbeat of course) and it all just felt 100% right. It got to the point where the waitress just stopped coming to the table at a certain point because we were just in our own world - the amount of times she asked if we were ready to order and we hadn't even looked at the menu or the number of times she came to check on the food and we hadn't touched it was ridiculous.

The two hour limit on the patio kicks in and we aren't ready to call it an evening so we both get on google maps on our phones and find a local park. We hop in my car and drive there. Me being the planner I am, I came fully prepared with take out containers for the cheesecake and a picnic blanket in case something like this happened. This is her neighbourhood so she starts by giving me a tour of the park, she indicates she's cold so I give her my jacket and its drizzling so I grab an old golf umbrella out of my car to keep her out of the rain as we walk around. Still such natural conversation and nothing but good times through the whole tour.

It finally stops raining and we get to the top of a big hill in the park where there's a view out over part of the city. I set up the picnic blanket and we have cake. Looking out over the city, we sit in the park until it's pitch dark at 11PM at night, eating cake and having the most deep and meaningful conversations about life. Again, nothing but good vibes and amazing times. Finally she says she needs to take some of medication so we got back to my car so she has light to find them in her purse. I ask if I can kiss her to which she says ""not yet."" I took this as a good sign - she was interested but we are technically coworkers so maybe she just wanted to take things slow. I drop her off at home and give her the rest of the cake which she takes after a very half-hearted attempt to say no and that she wanted to watch her sugar intake. We hug goodnight and I drive home.

Having had the time of my life, I texted her when I got home indicating that I had a great time and would like to see her again. She texts back the next morning saying she just wants to be friends as we're coworkers.

**The Analysis**

Now this is pretty much the most successful attempt at a romantic evening I've ever undertaken (even during my previous long-term relationships!). I'm convinced that none of its success flowed from tips or tricks I received from others. I'm also convinced that none of its failure would have been solved by the comments I heard from others either before or after. For example, some people really went after me for not being flirty enough or assertive enough in making a move. But come on, I did meet this person through work and it is COVID, I'm not getting overly physical unless they give the green light. 

Ultimately, I put myself out there in the most real, genuine way I can think of. This was a perfect date in my books and I really felt that the chemistry was there. The lesson I'm taking away from it: there was some reason she wasn't looking for something right now and there is nothing I can do to myself or who I am to change that. And with that being said - a friendly reminder to love yourself and neve change.

One thing led to another, before we know it we were talking regularly and flirting with each other. A lot.

We dated for a while, things turned hot, ended up having sex, multiple times, before she says out of the blue that she wanted to save sex for marriage and feels guilty for breaking the cardinal rule.

She says she doesn't want to have sex anymore but she still loves me deeply. I said let's take a break from each other and keep things on pause. She asked if I still loved her....and I said I was not comfortable with continuing the commitment and wanted to be friends first before I can say anything.

She blew up and said I only wanted sex and didn't love her ""truly"" and stuff. I attempted to make it to her by apologizing and saying let's try to mend things, broken hearts, slowly and steadily. But she constantly brought up how she expected me to say ""I love you"" everytime but I just couldn't do it because I didn't feel it. She started being rude and cold with everything, not wanting to see me anymore, deliberately avoiding my messages etc.

After a week of this behaviour I decided to call it quits because I was fed up with her being this unforgiving. I tried my best to make it up to her, being friends first before we can start dating again, but things went south.

We planned a second date for the following weekend(this most recent weekend). 

In the middle of last week, she sends me a text(on Instagram) saying she does stupid things a lot and thinks I need someone wiser. And that she’d be a bad influence on me. I say we all do stupid things so why not see where it goes before jumping to that conclusion. She agrees to see where things go.

I text her the day before our second date confirming it’s still on. She tell me her friends  made plans to go out of town for the day instead. I said we’ll just cancel then. She says when she gets her work schedule for the following week, she’ll let me know.

So, on Sunday(assuming it being the start of the next week, she’d have her schedule), I text her how’s she doing and when she’s free this week. No response. 2 or 3 days later, i notice it was left on read, so I send a follow up text saying something similar and seeing if she’s alright. No response. So, 2 days after that, i give her a call, no answer, so i message her what I was going to call her about, something like “getting no responses for nearly a week(6 days at that point) typically means you’re not interested, so that’s what I’ll assume.”

She then sends 3 rapid texts saying this is ridiculous, that she was going to explain after she felt better from her being sick but now I don’t deserve it. I respond saying most guys give it 2 attempts and blocks you but I’m not going to ghost someone so I sent that. What else do you want me to assume after you cancel our date last minute to go out with friends, not apologize or reschedule, and then ghost me for a week, all while being active on Instagram the entire time, oh and I noticed you unmatched on bumble a few days ago too.

How am I supposed to know you’re not feeling well if you don’t say anything nor send a simple “not feeling well, will explain later” text.

So, am I in the wrong? I made 2 attempts to contact over the course of a week, sent another assuming she isn’t interested and to end it because I don’t ghost people. She gets upset.

We've known each other since we were kids, and there were times my younger sister who is now 29F had a crush on him, but he never knew because he didn't talk to her as much, etc. 

My friend is not bad looking. Generally very sweet, according to the women he's dated. He was in a long term relationship with a girl from college, but he ended his relationship with her because he couldn't accept that she didn't want to have kids.

He met another woman during a work trip about a year later, and they tried long distance, but they ended it. He then took a job in her city and they reconnected, but she passed away a few weeks after that happened, so he stayed single for a few years. He still lives there today.

My sister moved to his city about six months after him, a few weeks after his girlfriend passed away. They hung out because he was familiar and they have been good friends since that time. 

My sister eventually asked me for my opinion on dating him, and I remember saying that she wouldn't be able to find anyone better than him, but he may not be ready to date someone after losing someone he loved. I suggested that she try being there for him and getting to know him more.

 But, she dates someone who she thought was better looking... they dated, but he turned out to be physically abusive and he hit her after a fight over cell phones at a Best Buy store. Things ended this year and the guy is awaiting trial.

My childhood friend is now dating a woman who he has known for a few years and they seem to care for each other deeply. He tells me he's still not quite over the passing of his girlfriend, but he was ready to love again. He says his girlfriend being around makes him feel at peace with the world and that nothing bad could happen.

I took 4 months off after the break up and have started online dating as well as getting into some other groups to meet people.    If you do read this rant, cause I know it is one, thanks.  

So far the experience of dating has been very disappointing and is making me remember why I didn't want to date anymore before.  

There seems to be so little effort put in by the women I am speaking to online to move things forward.  We will talk and have a great conversation, then I will say we should do X or Y to talk over that instead.   The most recent woman says ""I cant today but how about tomorrow night?""  I say sure 7pm tomorrow at X location?   Then SILENCE.   AT LEAST respond and say no, at this point I feel like even though we haven't met, I invited someone who kind of agreed to do something so I cant make other plans and just bail.   Has online dating completely killed the basic level of respect for others, I am not gonna freak out if someone says they are busy or not interested.  Ill move on and make some other plans. 

The only women I am getting a good response and effort from are the ones where I am on the fence about.  I am starting to feel like women crave distance and some undertone of disinterest in the early stages of relationship.  But that's just not me, if I like you I make an effort to move things forward. I dont want to pretend I am more distant by not texting back for a while or any of that crap.   I want to experience the attraction and live in the moment/excitement.  Anyone I see that I would think is similar in interests and age and looks (sorry but it does matter) seem to just not really try (and I've dated multiple women in that ballpark before).  Its like they think ""I'll say yes tentatively unless something better comes along"".  

I have had a fair number of attractive good girlfriends too.  Im a pretty good catch, 6'1"", lean and muscular, educated, have hobbies have had women who want to settle down with me (which unfortunately didn't work out).  When I do meet someone naturally I have good success, but post covid it seems like a LOT LESS stuff going on to meet someone naturally as lots of my friends took covid to have kids. 

Seems like this time around everyone is sort of on the fence non committal and don't put their side of the effort in.

My other recent experience is meeting a woman at a wedding.  We spent a lot of time together at the wedding and actually slept together.  I left for vacation the next day and we have texted off and on for 3 weeks.  Before I got back she texted ""so we should hang out this weekend when you are back"".  Ok I invite her to comedy Saturday.  she cant make it cause her friends going away party is that night.  Ok I ask ""when are you free, lets pick a day that works"".  she says a week from now.   Like maybe put in a bit more effort to just meet and see if it works, no need to drag things out.  There is rally no night in between??  I thought give it one more go so said yes. 

Anyone else feel like dating post covid is brutal, is it even covid, is it just OLD or me?  I see the other side from my female friend who seems to have endless guys messaging her willing to cook for her or take her to do other stuff.  she seems to really enjoy having the options but honestly I think it is ruining dating for her as she doesn't end up taking any of them seriously or giving them a real chance.      
 Why would she when at the slightest awkward text or guy seeming needy she can just replace him from the line.  But she does say she really wants to get to know someone and is in a rush to have kids.

At this point I feel myself becoming a jaded old man, I signed up for a therapist and am thinking wtf is the point if this process is so tedious?  Everything up to the point of getting a woman past a 3rd date where they start to put in effort seems so contrived and like I am a jester for them.
