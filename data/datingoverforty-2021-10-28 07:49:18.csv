2,qhqf4o,1635437443,Emotionally unavailable,"A little about me. Got divorced over a year ago. Wasn't really looking to date. Started talking to this guy who presented himself as sensitive. He went to school with my ex-husband is friends with him. Both of our spouses cheated on us so we bonded over that. Started talking everyday. I knew where this was headed, but I was a little iffy because I'm NC with my ex and I don't want to take a friend away from him. Mr. Sensitive assures me their friendship won't be affected. So we talked for almost four months. Grew closer. We decided to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas together. On Christmas, he is going on a roap trip with him family. I was excited to be invited because to me, this was an indication that this guy really liked me.

The first date was a little lackluster. He seemed a little distant. But I thought he was just being shy. I held his hand a lot, touched him flirtatiously. He didn't recoil, but he wasn't voluntarily trying to be close. My flight back was canceled. He asked me to come back to his house. I refused because I didn't want to be a burden. But there was another cancelation, we were almost at the airport when I decided I was better off spending the night at a hotel. He came to my room. I tried to hug him. He hugged me back. I tried to get him to touch and kiss me. He did touch and kiss me but he was literally only doing what I was asking. So, I stopped and said. I don't want us to do anything you aren't consenting to. So, he says, why do you have to make it awkward! I ended up going down on him. He very voluntarily stripped. I wasn't expecting anything back. He had go back home because his wife was going to drop the kids off early in the morning. I ended up postponing my flight next day. Would have been nice if he had offered to drop me off the airport. But he didn't and I did not ask. I was closer to the airport.

I asked him the next day if everything we did was consensual and he said it was. I said I am still not sure if you like me. Got no straight answer.

A week later, he asked me to come down to watch a movie. Obviously, I got excited. He was still his distant self. Didn't want to kiss. Didn't even hold my hand at the movies. I was scared and holding myself to self sooth. But he didn't hold my hand or put his arm around me.

We ended up having sex after I went down on him.
The whole weekend was pretty the same vibe. Distant.

Later that week I confronted him and said he was giving me mixed signals. I said you don't hold my hand or kiss me. Are we dating? If not, don't waste my time. He pretty much implied I was taking things too seriously. Idk, man, when someone tells me I make them want to be a better person and call me every day, I get the impression we are more than just friends.

I told him later that night I didn't want to go on the road trip with his family. And we should try to be just friends because it seems that what he wants to do.

Called him again after a couple of days. Told him I was struggling but it seemed he felt nothing. He was indifferent. Said I should have gotten attached to an emotionally unavailable guy.

I am kicking myself for being so naive and getting my hopes up. It's like at 40, I am making the same mistakes I made at 20.
This is so discouraging. Makes me not want to even try and date.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qhqf4o/emotionally_unavailable/

11,qi079c,1635466360,Refreshing opposite sex interactions,"So I have this coworker who is a young man (early 20’s) and I find him so incredibly impressive. Yeah he’s immature about some things as would be expected in someone of his age but he’s so dang refreshing. I’m a strong willed, blunt and have a big personality. Many men find this off putting or are attracted to these traits yet find it off putting after a while. Instead of being offended by my personality he accepts it for what it is. He vocally praises my hard work and takes my blunt nature in stride. He celebrates the things I’m better at him with and never seems like he has his masculinity threatened by any of the strong women personalities he encounters daily at our work.

I also work with another man who is around my age and also celebrates my direct nature and defaults to me on areas I have more expertise in. Today he snapped at me because he was frustrated and when things resolved he came to me and profusely apologized and without excuse making made amends.

Sometimes I think Having gone through tough divorces and relationships we lose sight of the people who exhibit the kind of personality traits that exist in our lives that can give us hope that we’d meet people we admire who are also compatible with us relationship wise.

14,qi2d77,1635473633,"How do you make dating less of a pain? Questions on boundaries, flags, &amp; communication for hook-ups, friends, maybe more, or less...🤔","I'd appreciate hearing different communication approaches that help in getting to know new people and establishing intimacy boundaries. 

Will people often assume spending the night entitles them to sex or do we have to spell everything out?

Continue on to read the following long story and musings, or NOT 😂!!

Recently I had an impromptu 1st weekend w/ a similarly aged man I'd been chatting with a lot.  Although I didn't lay any hard and fast rules down,  there were assumptions made by him regarding intimacy etiquette, sounding a bit contrary to previous chats. I ended up feeling like clear communication and permissions were lacking. It definitely gave me pause to reconsider how I approach this with the next person. Although it's not something I want to repeat,  I realized that if someone isn't savvy or considerate enough to establish mutually acceptable boundaries before making a physical advance, then it's not my job to teach... no harm no foul. C'est la vie, eh? 

My take away  from this unique (or not so unique?) interaction is that this particular person's choice to be poly seems like a way to avoid dealing in strong, clear, healthy boundaries. The personal boundaries he spoke of sounded very one-sided and reactionary, carrying a tone of monogamy aversion and avoidance. He was convinced people in the poly community were super clean regarding STD's; he sounded clueless about actual risks for pregnancy and disease transmission.  He did not seem to explain what he desired in relationship dynamics from an emotionally mature or empathic perspective.

Would you think any expectation exists for me to communicate anything more about how I feel, above average, occasional chatting? 
( Pardon, let's not act intimate again despite my hesitations regarding your over sharing, micro penis, constant assumptions, poor boundaries, and status as a prior sexual abusee.)

He said he spent almost no time alone (outside of a relationship) since a teen. I feel like this is a big red flag. Anyone else agree?

I'm not what I'd consider seriously experienced with dating and I occasionally succumb to bad relationship choices, pre mature, superficial or unstable intimacy. 

IMHO, differing levels of emotional availability and connection exist, so there isn't one gold standard for all interpersonal dynamics. I am working to improve, clarify, and strengthen my boundaries. I feel like I did not get a passing grade... again😂🙄. On the same token I feel like it would make it so much easier to interact with someone that's on a similar level.

Here's what happened during my week:

1.  I was doing a return at Kohls and there's a beautiful woman who I've seen over the years.  I ended up making small talk, she told me her name but I didn't get her number.

2.  The girl at drive thru Wendy's and I were flirting back and forth.  She told me I was to old for her when I asked for her number.  I'll admit I am and was but hey, you never know lol.

3.  I was at Walmart earlier today and I went straight up to this girl and we had small talk.  Got her name and what she's doing tomorrow.  She was shopping for a Halloween outfit for a party tomorrow.  The vibe and connection was going well, then I asked for her number but I was so damn nervous I was holding grocery items in one hand and trying to type her number in the other hand.  I texted her but I must have typed the number in wrong, then again maybe she gave me the wrong number.

I've definitely considered just giving up on even trying to find someone at this point, but I haven't. I just keep trying hoping to eventually find that ""someone"".

64,qjhckm,1635651747,It came crashing down fast,"I've (he 43yo) been seeing a physiotherapist (she 30yo) for the last 7 months on a weekly basis as I need physiotherapy for my traumatic brain injury. Injury just affects my physical movement not mental. The physio program with her was meant to last another year.

Since that time we've got pretty close in the clinic behind closed doors, flirting, hugs, holding hands, kissing. Since we're in strict covid lockdown I've emailed her several times suggesting dates we will go on when lockdown lifts. She doesn't email back (as she doesn't want to leave digital footprint) but seemed interested when I seen her in clinic. At this point she was hinting she prefers I call her than email but I'm a writer so I kept on with emailing.

Lately I went to see another physiotherapist who specializes in brain injury. He said he could liase with my current physio (her) on some additional exercises. I asked her if she was ok with that and she was, but he baited and switched on me, telling her I should be seeing him instead of her. Him being a professor she obliged but told me later it was a kick in the stomach. 

I got pretty upset and told him that was not our agreement and that I would not proceed with it unless  he did what we originally agreed to which was he helps her out with brain injury exercises.

A week later I got an email from her (with her manager in cc) saying it was more appropriate if I go ahead with the professors program as she is not experienced in the field. She said she was happy to see me every 6 weeks just to check-in. It sounded like she took offense that I was trying to control her career by steering her away from what she does into brain injury.

I asked her what about our future plans, to which she replied ""can't because of doctor-patient relationship"". I didn't make a fuss and said showed gratitude for all she has done for me and said goodbye. She still comes up in my thoughts all the time. In a matter of 2 weeks she was gone.

I still have her number and contemplating to call her or delete the number. We no longer have a patient-patient relationship.

 He told me some “truth” about his living situation - not married to but temporarily living with an ex; working 2 jobs to save money to move because he had had a terrible car wreck last year and was recovering. I took that all at face value and for consideration.
He expressed interest in me and wanting to spend time. He knows I like sports; so it pained me when he posted a pic on social media of him in  a bar on game day. No invite? Should I have expected one?

We’ve been getting to know one another for alittle over 2 month now and it’s been going well. I’ve been dating for 2-3 years and it’s been a shit show. Mainly online but some in person yet all of it has just been chaotic and exhausting. Some narcissistic types, emotionally unavailable, ghosting. I know many of you can relate. On top of all of that I was coming out of long term narcissistic abusive relationship so I’m def dealing with some trauma. 

Ok, so in comes Joe oh wait I said his name was John lol.

Anyway, we met online. I invited him out after chatting for a week or so and we’ve been seeing eachother ever since. 

The problem, he’s very open about his feelings while I tend to freeze when it’s my turn to share. I’ve never experienced this before (freezing
up). I’ve also never dated a guy that I actually liked who displayed and expressed emotions so early on. It has happened with guys I’m not really into or attracted to and I have no problem being expressive. 

I want to open up more but I almost always freeze. Ex: he asked me what I wanted from him from dating or just in general and I couldn’t answer him. This is after he told me what he wanted. Or he’ll just randomly tell me how much he likes doing whatever is we’re doing or the feeling he has in the moment bc of what we’re doing (sitting on the couch watching tv, driving w me shotgun). I think he knows that I like him but I don’t share as much as he does and I’m afraid he’ll lose interest or interpret it as me not being interested or too damaged. 
The problem for me is fear (I think). Im just afraid that he’s not who he says he is (all talk). Im afraid he won’t be around in a month or two. Im afraid he’ll abuse my vulnerability. I’m trying to remain conscious of my anxious attachment and realizing he’s not any of the guys from my past but as many of you know it’s tough. Like, I’m deathly afraid of being hurt or played and I can’t get out of my head. I do tell him nice things and express my feelings sometimes but it’s soo unnatural most of the times.

82,qjxek4,1635710294,Keeping my winnings after hitting the jackpot?,"I don't know how it happened, but I met this fantastic guy  a while back and we have REALLY hit it off. He's so different than any man I've met or even imagined I would meet! He's fairly straightforward and emotionally available, HE checks in pretty much every day, and life is so busy for him right now that we can't see each other as much as we both want, so we crave each other all the time. Also - neither of us want to get married again, but we agree that the type of relationship we are building is lovely, really only lacking in time available together in person. 

My question is likely directed towards men. Having been off the market for 20 years and being a very open, heart on sleeve person... This ""keeping a man interested"" thing is something I don't know how to address. Thousands of articles out there tell women to let him chase you, don't text back right away, make yourself elusive and mysterious to drive him madly in love with you - and if you are too available, too open, ""too much""... He loses interest.

Is this actually true? It seems like a silly game that I just don't know if I can play. If I like this guy, of COURSE I want him to know!  I DO jump at the opportunity to see him, to talk to him when he texts or calls, to offer help if he needs it (and space when he's busy), and just let him know how much I care! That seems more natural to me than anything, and I know he wouldn't bullshit me by being unnatural either. 

Are we anomalies then? Or is this actually a game I have to play to ""keep him engaged""?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qjxek4/keeping_my_winnings_after_hitting_the_jackpot/
83,qjy9mv,1635712902,Should I text or is it over? Modern dating is confusing!,"3rd date with a great guy ended very abruptly on Friday night when he got an email from his recent ex that sent him for a loop. We were at his house about to... be intimate... and then all of a sudden he was upset and in his head. I'm trying to be better about taking care of myself so I said I was going to go but the whole thing was pretty awkward and I was definitely a LOT more emotional than I wanted to be on a 3rd date (b/c we were... ""intimate"") EDIT: he checked his phone while I was in the bathroom

Anyway, we had a brief text exchange yesterday that was the product of 2 upset people who don't know each other very well trying to make sense of the situation in 159 characters at a time. Needless to say, it didn't solve our problem and it kind of ended with me saying I was going to get coffee. A day later I'm feeling a lot of sadness but I can't tell if it's disappointment b/c he's not available to date (still hung up on his ex) or because i got left hanging at a really unfortunate time :lol: (note: I myself have a ton of real life issues im dealing with too and was not as grounded as I could have been that night)

I'm really torn about contacting him again- it's such a bad sign that we had such steep conflict on the 3rd date -- right? Should I just let it be? I also can't stop thinking about him and I'm sure I got so upset because I like him a lot more than I want to. Acgggg!

Well maybe here’s your chance?  Looking for a date to accompany me at a wedding.  It’s in the near future, so trying to get a head start on finding a date.  Also it’s in Atlanta so if you’re not close (which I am not either) then it gives plenty of time to plan travel.  

I’m 39, rather not talk about why I’m now Single, 5’4.  I love desserts and anything fruity so that’s where I lean towards food.   I am talkative once I know someone well enough.  

I would like to find someone that’s 45 or up.   It’s sad I have to say this but please be single.  Prefer someone mature, can go with the flow.  Open to learning about different cultures and won’t make ignorant comments. More than likely the food will be spicy so there’s a fair warning on that.

Share your worst personal dating rejection story that happened to you as an adult. Teenagers are still learning how to human, so those don't count.

It’s nice- but was really just “hey, looks like the weather will be great today.  Have a good day.”  Always sort of superficial.  He has also sent entire albums of things he did/went to.

I KNOW in my heart that I want to shower this guy with my affection, love and enthusiasm, because I believe he deserves it - and it gives ME joy too! 

And giving things more thought after our nightly chat (he calls me every night that he's away for work, so sweet!) I think the thing that stuck out in my mind was that, I TRUST HIM to be honest with me, because he's already proven he CAN be. He's an introvert, and if he needs space or time away from me, he can ask me! I'll happily give it to him because - even at this early stage, I know this is a need of his. (Mine too - but because of life at the moment, we don't see each other enough for me to want a break from him yet!)

 But he's not ASKING for me to ""give him space"" by waiting on his texts or being busy... HE reaches out to ME most times, and I just enthusiastically respond and give him ALL of me because he's so delightful!

I trust him, and I will trust my intuition by just continuing to give all I can. And thank you again for all the support and reassurance that I AM doing the right thing!

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds extreme, but I feel like I have exhausted every single man in my dating pool. Same guys on every sight. Occasionally someone new. I had high hopes for someone I was involved with recently. Then I told myself if this does not work out, then I am moving. So here I am. I live in an area where most men are married and stay that way. Moving to a tech hub where there will be more men all around. I feel I have watched my friends on FB be married to spouse 1, get divorced, get married to spouse 2 and I cannot even get to the relationship stage. I don't have family here anymore, I can work anywhere, live in a 4 bedroom / 3 bath house with only the dog, so why not?
