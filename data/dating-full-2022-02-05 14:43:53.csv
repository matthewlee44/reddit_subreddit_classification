I've tried meeting women IRL when I was in community college, online dating, etc. At this point, I lean on online dating because it seems like every woman I try to talk to IRL is either taken or not interested. Plus, I also had a girl in college accuse me of harassing her for trying to talk to her and got me sent to the dean's office (another reason I only do online dating). Predictably, online dating isn't working either no matter what advice I follow or how much money I invest in subscriptions or extra features. The little self-esteem I had has been beaten out of me by constant rejection.

Since I am on the spectrum, I don't do bars or clubs because I get sensory overload. I live in a very red town in Florida and I'm a minority, atheist, and politically left-wing (demographically speaking, the cards are stacked against me...). The only meeting place for people my age in my town is the community college and I just graduated. Moving is also not an option for practical reasons. I feel like I'm just not meant to have what I want (an intimate connection with a woman). 

I have hobbies apart from trying to pursue women. I like to read books, play video games, learn different languages, watch documentaries, distance running, things like that. The people of r/amiugly apparently think I'm not ugly, but evidently there is still something wrong with me that's causing me to not be attractive to women. Everyone around me is partnering up and losing their virginity and I still haven't come close to doing any of that.

This seemed pretty abrupt and no explanation given as to what the family emergency was. I replied saying I was sorry to hear that, and to let me know if he wanted to reschedule. He replied saying ‘thanks for the understanding’. 

This all felt pretty cold and vague and I had no idea whether it was an excuse or not. I replied saying ‘I would really appreciate if you were honest with me here. Being cancelled on 45 minutes before is a new one for me and feels a little hurtful.’ He follows up by letting me know that his grandma has had a stroke , and then refuses to answer any of my subsequent messages. 

Today, a week later, I reached out again and said I’d felt hurt by his lack of contact. He replied saying he had felt angry that I had ‘accused’ him of lying and that he didn’t want to see me again. 

Though my intention was never to accuse him of lying, am I an asshole for questioning things?

My (18F) boyfriend (18M) said to me yesterday that he was invited by an older girl to go to Milan for Valentine's.
I've been fucking him since the end of September and we started actually dating just three weeks ago. Turns out he liked me for a while but was too afraid I'd say no if he asked me out (I made it clear at the start I only wanted a FWB... But hey, things happen). 

Yesterday I was at his, I said something about travelling, and he went ""Speaking of trips, don't get mad at me, but..."" And explained the invite. Apparently she messaged on Thursday night, which further irks me because we had such a lovely date Thursday evening. He said no to her, though I'm not sure if he blocked her (will be asking when I see him Monday). I kind of gaped for a few minutes, then asked how he knew her; he said it was through college societies, but didn't elaborate on the details (me wishing I asked for more specifics instead of being stunned...) The absurdity is that this girl is 24, which is why it was so shocking. She's in third year of university; he and I are both university first years. 

But it turns out she also asked him out before to some ""salt caves"" (he thinks she means a spa; you know the type) on the other side of the country. Which raises the questions why he was still in contact with her if she already asked him out, but now he's dating me? 

I don't know why he hadn't mentioned her before. I didn't see him over Christmas, he fucked some other girl and when we both came back we confessed feelings a few days later. He blocked the girl he fucked and I assumed that was the end of any ongoing major romantic interests. I know that he'll probably get offers for dates, especially coming up to Valentine's, as he's a pretty popular guy plus lives in the city, but this level of weirdness I had not anticipated - he's 18 and the Milan girl is 24. It creeps me the fuck out (why does she not date people her own age??) not to mention I'm wondering now if there's anybody else he hasn't deigned to mention, or is still in contact with. I appreciate him telling me right away, but I still can't shake a niggling feeling of wondering why the fuck he was still in contact with her if she clearly was interested in him, yet he's dating me.

I know it's early days for us, but we've known each other a few months now, so somehow I don't understand why he might feel a need to keep ""backups"" for me, if that's what this was.

(Im conservative btw and dont usually engage in sex) It was more like a ""oh we've only done this but Im def gonna score her next time"". he would also constantly mention how he's still part of the ""hood boys"" which I assume based on context of the convo was a reference to like ""a single boy who fucks around or at the top of his game who could score alot of girls"". His friends would also send bikini pics of other girls and he would still comment on her body and mention things like ""Ill get her when im single again"" (but in a WAYY worse way of saying it, I just worded it better). Its def in contrast with  how he presents himself to me. Im honestly so offended and idk what to think of this. Honestly seems like hes presenting a certain version of himself to me just to get me to like him. theres so much more but too much to mention.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157382,public,nsfw,I saw the way the guy I've been seeing talks about me (its bad/offensive) to his friends,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/slau51/i_saw_the_way_the_guy_ive_been_seeing_talks_about/,no_ads,0,,,,,

He's not my boyfriend and we live a bit far away, so we can't meet all the time but we talk everyday on the phone. We know we are into each other and have a strong bond. 

A month and a half ago he went on vacations to a big city. He would text me in the day to show me what he was doing and talk in the night until we both fall asleep. He told me a few times how much he wanted me to be there with him and a lot of nice things. 
We had this silly joke where I would pretend to be toxic and jealous over him (it started when he made a joke about how would he feel loved if I wasn't toxic). 
It was funny and everything. One day he told me an European girl approached him in the pool and kinda flirted with him. He felt good about himself and the way he looks (he's kinda insecure). All good with that. 

The next day I say good morning to him and he answers with a selfie of him and this European girl, saying ""this doesn't means I'm cheating on you"". He pretended it to be a joke, and I think he wanted to make me jealous for real. Well, I was jealous, and a little angry. I didn't say anything but he realized how I was feeling, he apologized, explained he maybe took our joke too far, said he was unrespectful to me and said it won't happen again. 

I still was a little angry, but I understood. In the afternoon he posted an Instagram story of this girl taking a drink with him and I felt so bad about it.

In the night he was taking his flight to come back home and he was so sad. He's in crisis with his life and job, so coming back to everyday life was hard for him. We started talking about it, and he told me something like he thinks he has a crush on this girl (not his exact words, it was something impossible to translate into English, but it has a very similar meaning), and that they kissed. 
He said sorry before saying all this things. And in the end he said he was being so disrespectful to me. 
Told me this girl cried when he left (they met at least 36 hours before that...) and saying it felt like a kick in the head. And that he hopes this doesn't last forever. 
I don't know why, but I saw he was suffering and I was supportive to him. 

I can't explain how brokenhearted I felt. The next days I felt so sad, I even lost my appetite and I cried a lot.
 
A few days later he texted me saying he loves me (Te quiero in Spanish, wich is less romantic than Te amo). I didn't answer. 
He explained he knew he hurt me and even feeling so bad about what he did I was supporting him, so he feels that he loves me. 
We had a long conversation and I explained exactly how he made me feel. 
He accepted everything, and told me he doesn't know what happened to him that night. And things like he was so sorry, that he doesn't wanna lose me, that he has feelings for me and want so hard to make it up to me. 

So, now some time has goes by and he has been so nice to me. We click and connect even more than before. But this stills hurts so much... 
I don't know what to do. I wanna be with him, but when I remember about this situation I become so angry and sad. 

The other day he had a toxic behavior towards me out of jealously (for no reason). I got upset, set up my boundaries and I couldn't help to bring up the situation with the European girl... I told him I still feel hurt about it. He accepted everything. 
But I'm not sure how healthy can be to bring up this thing now and then everytime I get angry.

\--

Ok, this is a weird one, I never thought i will be in this kind of situation.

I ( 32M ), I am dating a 35 F. I am moving slowly, not confortable with moving fast. Conversation is great, she is proactive, sends me ocasional text, sets dates yadda yadda. We both stated from the beginning that we do not look for love necessary, but we would like to find a compatible person.

3rd date: She did not initiate the kiss goodbye on the cheek.

4th date: I told her she can hold me by the arm. She did, no problems. **She told me that she is sometimes oblivious to romantic cues from guys**. Again, she did not initiate goodbye, i kissed her on the cheek and hugged her because the date went great and I was happy. She told me she still wants to date me and see where and if this will go somewhere.

5th date: I shifted my arms toward her, she took me by the arm, and i told her "" unless you want to hold hands"". She told me "" I grabbed your arm now, so it's okay"". After a while I took her by the hand, we hold hands while walking. But after disengaging she did not engage in holding hands by herself. I did it multiple times and she happily accepted. Later while eating i asked her if she is ok with that and why no initiating the hand holding. **She told me this is uncommon for her and she's not used to it.** ( In Eastern Europe hand holding is seen as exclusive or if 2 people had some romantic engagement of some sort. She holding my hand tells me she likes me. She initiate the goodbye kiss on the cheek after I stared at her as in making it obvious I am waiting for her.

While texting her later to thank her for the date,

M: I hope we are moving in the right direction. F : I don't know which is the right direction, we will see;

M: I am not rushing, but I hope you feel an improvement over the last few dates. F : I like talking with you and hanging out, but I haven't thought that far into the future.

M: Is this blocking us, or more intimate gestures in the futures? ( I was refering to kisses, cuddles etc., no sex or anything). F: Not blocking, but thinking for too long will not help either. No idea about how to approach me next.

M: Ok, just wanted to make sure that I am not confortable to initiate things further without a bit of help from your side . ( And I mean that, kissing is out of the question if she doesn't help me with a hint or something, i would feel like a fool. Sex out of the question).

**Conclusion** : She told me once that a good romantic ltr is based on friendship and getting to know your partner first. So I think she is just taking her time, and I am VERY fine with that. I suspect she would not keep dating me or hold my hand etc, if she was not into me at all. I am very curious how this dating will pan out. I just wanted to make it absolutely clear that if she is waiting for something more from my side, she will not receive anything because I am not confortable to do that without her reciprocating or helping me with it.

I said I would atleast like to sleep after the last night shift. 

No she said, that would mean we would lose our first day. Sure I said, If I could just sleep 2-3 houers at her place it wouldn't be any problem.

Work ends, I drive to the airport. Plane lands, I call her up (while trying to get my bearings on the new airport) Sorry she says, she couldn't make it. But if I take the Train to the city centeral. She would pick me up there, no sweat I thought. Just a train ride.

City central. 07:00 I call her up, she can't pick me up here neither. She wants me to take a bus to city south (its a giant market) 

Plane, train and bus ride. Ofc as I guessed, city south is a intersectional bus zone. Meaning the bus zones overlap here and they go off to the suburbs. 

Im all alone, I have bad flashbacks from my days of being a fotball player. Overlapping bus stops, it allways starts like this!

I call her up, she says she can't pick me up here either. As I've allready have guessed. She wants me to do the full two houer buss ride into the suburbs. 

Going against ALL of my basic instincts, I said fine. Sure np. In for a penny in for a dime?  Steeping on the second bus my consciousness screams no! 'You can just take the other bus back' And a taxi to the airport. Bada boom bada bing back homie!

2 houers later - 

'Yeah il pick u up!' A small fiat enters visual range. (Oh gawd she isn't fat? I thought) 

She is obviously overweight, and in her early 40's her pictures must have been from the late 90's

A two door fiat hatchback, the type my friends bought when they where 17. Pulling the seat back, get in she says get in!

In the back of her Fiat is her two daughters, Platnium blonds. I try and introduce myself, but the situation doesn't lend much grace to itself. ""We are going to the stadium"" she says, ofc we are I answered in a ironically tone.

Because we where supposed to be all by ourselves. No kids no nothing. 

My date is a handball trainer, arriving at the stadium. The two daughters disappeared into their wardrobe. Allready as we are passing into the stadium, parent's are saying hi. And old geezer steps out to shake my hand. Visable confused I shake his hand back.

Much t0 my surprise the stadium is FULLY packed, my date starts talking to the team. And the parent's gathering around her. They randomly introduce themselves to me and shakes my hand. 

I plant my ass in the second row, as if this was the most natural thing in the world. The game starts... I'm cheering! It's not a problem, but this isn't exactly what I would plan to do after being awake for 24 houers.

Game ends, packing the kids into the shoe size fiat. Driving to her estate. It's perhaps one of the bigger houses/villas I've seen in my lifetime. It even has its it's own road to the front door. 

Stepping out of the fiat shoe box, I look at the car and it's mismatched home. 'Huh?' 


Their dad are picking up his kids, so im literally in their bed room packing their stuff. A horn is heard, the girls rushes into the driveway, happy as can be. 

BMW X6 ive seen it but never up close. Like a tourist i start examining it. ""This is my freind"" she is introducing me to her ex husband. (I'm still in the clothes I wore before going to work yesterday!) 

He's wearing a designer suit, with a t-shirt under. Visibly confused I shake his hand. Hands are shaken... ""Man I love your car!"" I say. Trying to spark an conversation. But he just straight out ignores me. 'Oh I get it, this must be painful' I think?

Dad, kids and bmw x6 are gone within a few minutes. She puts her hand around my waste. Lets make dinner she whispered into my ear. Seemingly very very happy. 

I could write a book about the villa. Turns out her ex husband was a architect, he had pretty much incorporated all of his knowledge into designing this home. It's what I would have done, only way better.

She makes sausages and fries, I'm so tired at this point. I'm trying to let her carry the conversation.. And im trying to get alittle bit of information on wth is going on?

After dinner I sit down in the living room. And then it happens... Like a wolf crying at the moon, she bursts into a remorseless crying fever. 

Confused, I try and comfort her. Atleast get her on the sofa I thought. ""DON'T YOU TOUCHE ME! DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCHE ME!"" she screams from the top of her lungs!. I hold my hands into the air, walking backwards saying OKEI OKEI OKEI!

Wraaaaaa! She screams Wraaaa! I want my mummy! She calls up her mom. Within 5 minutes her mom is in the driveway. With another two door hatchback fiat, she steps inside. And a few moments later im all by myself inside this giant mansion. 

Not knowing what to do I call my best freind. Who I had never told about the date. Everything I say is meet with unceremoniously laughter, until I come to the part with her ex husband. My freind cracks up in laughter, he tries to make words but it all comes out as laughter. 

I hang up, he calls me back, I answere ""You -? Wahaaaaaha ha!"" Uncontrollable laughter, I hang up. Phone rings again. I turn it off. 

I don't do much, I used the bathroom and fell asleep on the couch. 

""You are still here?"" I look up, she's standing over me. ""Get lost, now!"" 

Sure! Sure! I say. If you could show me that bus station? 

""I'm not going outside with you!?"" She says. Because she doesn't want to be seen with me. 

At this point I lose my shit. ""Seen?!? With me?!?! Let me tell you! Every fing human being in this town thinks im here fing you! INCLUDING YOUR OWN CHILDREN INCLUDING YOUR EX HUSBAND!"" 

""SO WHAT THE F IS YOUR FING PROBLEM?!?!?""

But for most of my life, and especially right now, I struggle to foster romantic connections. Ultimately I get a lot of ""but I would really love to be friends"". it seems like most attempts at dating (online or in person) fail to progress past just friendship. This is the good part of the problem - I don't have much trouble making friends. But due to the way my brain works I hyper focus on the negative side, and therefore is a problem that's very real to me and very painful. An example - I went on what I thought was a date with someone I had been running into at parties lately, to see live music. At the end of the night I tried to kiss her and she said that she didn't think it was a date and was sorry I had thought otherwise. This sort of thing seems to happen to me more than it should. What made me feel shitty was that she made it sound like going on a date with me was an abhorrent idea, that the only thing I was good for was being friends. Again, there are worse problems to have, but to experience something like this continuously without reprieve is very draining. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's that I'm unattractive/weird? I don't think so. I'm a 25M, living in a large city in the U.S. I have a good social life, I'm about average height, an excellent career,  I take care of myself physically and mentally (marathons, lifting, having a therapist, yoga/meditation/books), I play music and have well-developed hobbies. I've had a handful of successful relationships in the past. Romantically, I've been with enough people that myself/others find very attractive to know with confidence that I'm at least attractive enough to get by. And socially I have enough friends to know that I'm not bad with people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know dating isn't easy. But ultimately I feel like there's a disconnect, a gap between who I am and the outcomes of dating. I \*know\* (and my friends agree) I'm not nearly as unappealing as my dating outcomes would suggestion.  In the last 6 months I've been on at about 15 first dates and every single one has devolved into ""I don't feel a romantic connection but I really would like to be friends, I wish I had more guy friends like you"". I'm doing all the things like eye contact, physical touch, general chivalry/manners, making a move at the end of the date.   I think that the gap comes down to an inability to foster romantic relationships.  Frankly, I don't understand most of it. And it bothers me (something that I'm working on in therapy but not yet done with). 

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 years ago I had a long distance relationship with someone I had grown up with. Once we eventually made it back to the same city, we dated. We got along great and I fell for him HARD. Unfortunately, this guy had quite the reputation for being a player and I let my friends influence me too much and eventually we called things off. 

Fast forward I moved to another city, and he is still in our hometown. We talk off and on every once in a while, but I still have MAJOR feelings for him after all of these years and I want to start a relationship with him again. 

I don’t know how to go about this.. we don’t talk consistently but he’s always on my mind. We are talking a bit more now, just friendly stuff and keeping it casual. 

I don’t know why but I feel like this man is my soulmate. He makes me so calm when I’m with him and I really want a future with him. How can I go about this without coming off too strong? I don’t want to scare him as I’m not sure how he feels anymore?

She always said to me that we are mates but this changed after I convinced her to give me a shot around November/December time. We went on a few dates, Spoke with her on the phone everyday and it was good but honestly it had its difficulties.

Since uni she has had depression but she hid it well and was a bit all over the place, like she now works in a hospital but around the time I was seeing her more than a mate she was going through it the worst and skipped work, did not know what she was doing etc.

It all came to a head when she told her dad that she felt suicidal one day and went to the hospital, she got some counciling afterwards and went on anti-deppresents which has helped her a lot but at this time she said that she did not want a relationship.

Now I saw her two days ago after not seeing since we dated and I noticed that she had changed a bit. She is more responsible now, she works all the time and has aspirations etc hell she even just had coke because she was working the next day in the hospital which took me a back. As well, she picks up the phone less then she used to but we still message each other regularly. I feel in a way I have lost her, she no longer chats my head off like she used to but I know this is the tablets and what they do because I am on them as well. She will always be in my life but after that night we chatted to each other for an hour about why it would not happen again and said to me that she just wants to enjoy herself and advised me to not wait for her and move on.

Honestly I love this girl for who she is and don't want to lose a friendship but I do have feelings for her and would be upset if she got with another man.

I chose people who were “too busy” with their jobs, and could only see me once a week or once every two weeks - months into seeing them! I was the friend who claimed these “types” were just into me, and that somehow their casual disregard for my presence in their life was somehow acceptable. When reality was, my own dating preferences were a reflection of my own lack of availability. 
I feel like I’ve had a major break through these past few months, and have saved alot of time and energy by cutting these types once I became aware of the warning signs. 

In conclusion, I will no longer accept crumbs of attention and affection and turn them into loaves of bread.

  I'm 22 now and have never really dated anyone. I'm an old school guy so never was one for the dating apps and always thought that il meet someone and just ask them out the 'old-fashioned' way. These last couple of years have been busy, crazy and just a danm roller coaster and although I'm still super busy working on my business and building myself ive always had on the back of my mind that maybe I should give dating a shot. 

However I don't know whether I should date for these below reasons;

1)I'm currently doing 3 jobs (2 businesses and a job) to raise as much money and help my family so I'm super busy.

2) I've had a pretty tough life (not going to write a sob story as its not my style) so my mental state isn't the best and something that definitely needs working on. 

3)I would only want to date if I'm presenting the best version of myself. I don't want to be a burden on anyone and have them help me.


4) Linked to 2, I'm worried that I would never love since I'm at the point in my life where I've taught myself everything and anything is pointless and meaningless and so I shouldn't be affected by it. I've done this to make sure I don't feel any negative emotions but I'm concerned that il never be able to fully love someone and will just turn into that guy who just travels around having short encounters with women and just moves on, forever being alone.

Now I've been told I'm pretty handsome and do get a fair bit of attention. I'm also intellectual and charming which is why is why I'm entrepreneurial and good at what I do. On the outside I seem like I'm this perfect guy who's got everything sorted but inside its far from the that. If I were to see someone I wouldn't cheat and I'm always a gentleman but I'm worried that she'd end up catching feelings and maybe I might but will soon just remind myself that this doesn't really mean anything and end things. 

Basically I've got alot to work out so what I'm asking is should I still actively get into dating knowing that I've got all these problems; girls would you date someone like me; at the moment I feel like I can only go through this alone so best thing is not to date anyone and just forever be alone- is that a healthy way of thinking?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157405,public,self,Shall I date if I can't love?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sletgt/shall_i_date_if_i_cant_love/,no_ads,0,,,,,

I met his family about 2M into dating and have since stayed over at his place pretty much every week (note: he still lives with his parents too).

Now that it’s coming to about half a year of dating, I want to introduce him to my parents and take him to their place.

However, he doesn’t know much about how I live as I’m ashamed/ embarrassed to tell him. He’s from a very wealthy old money family, and my parents are divorced and I live in a 1 bed flat where I share a room with my sister.

Compared to his penthouse, my home is much smaller, cosier… and well, I share a small room with my sister (so it’s not like he’d be able to sleep round) and my mum sleeps in the living room.

As I’ve mentioned, I’ve not told him how I live but if I want this relationship to continue where I think it will, he’ll have to come round at some point but I’m worried about how to tell him about how I live when I next see him as this matter has been worrying me slightly.

I’m not sure how to even begin to tell him about my living situation as I’m fearful he shall judge me over this &amp; may break up with me because I am ‘poorer’ than he is. I don't want him to judge me for what I have/ don't have or my affluence of my parents. I want to judge him for me as while my background is my parents, I am not a reflection of their affluence.  
I’m just worried he may turn on me and become superficial &amp; judge me for my pocket rather than who I am as a person, and the person that has loved him for the past few months.

I should mention however, that I have my own career and I am saving to purchase a place of my own within this next year. Must I also mention as an insight to our relationship is that I am more than comfortable to pay my way for many things we do, we share the bills when we eat out etc &amp; we treat one another equally to things. I have also never asked him for money to travel to his place &amp; we’ve also gone on two holidays together where we’ve both shared the bill equally… so as you can see I am self sufficient.

Also it’s not that my parents don’t work or have low income jobs, we live in a very expensive city in an expensive area so this is all my mother could afford. However, we still have cars and all the luxuries, food on our table every day, go on holidays together etc. it’s simply just that our home is small &amp; I share a room with my sister/ my mum sleeps in the living room that I’m embarrassed about

So, I’m worried how to start this conversation with my boyfriend in regards to my parents not being as wealthy as he thinks I am. We're also due to go on our third holiday in a few months and have paid for everything, and I'm worried that when I have this conversation he may break up with me and we won't go abroad together.

And (THE BIG ONE) how do I tell him that I still share a room with my sister?

And I’m also scared he may break up with me over the fact that my parents aren’t as rich as his, even though I cannot control who I was born into/ the circumstances of my life. I’m really worried as I like him a lot…

TLDR; I (F25) still live at home with my parents and so does my boyfriend (23M). I’ve met his parents &amp; stayed lots at theirs, but he’s yet to meet mine. However, I am embarrassed because I am poor and share a room with my sister and my mum sleeps in the living room yet his family is old money &amp; rich.

When we started our ""dating"" she told me she didn't really want to be in a relationship, she had been through recent trauma (her previous boyfriend passed away suddenly), and I was still overcoming a heartbreak from my previous girlfriend (we'll call her Mary) - so Jodie and I agreed we weren't boyfriend and girlfriend...

So a few months go by, and I started feeling very confused because it absolutely felt like a real relationship with Jodie: sex, going out to dinner, sleeping over, meeting family, etc. And so as time went on, I just felt like it wasn't ""right"" for me to continue seeing her because I had so much going on in my life at the time (transitions, family deaths, life-crises sort of thing) and she never changed her stance on our not being in a relationship... so one day, I drove Jodie back home, and I told her that I didn't really miss her the way I thought I would (she was on a family vacation) and that I just had so much going on in my life that I need to end this ""relationship"" here. She cried, we texted a few times afterwards and she forgave me for breaking up with her and I wished her well. It's been 5 years and I still think about her and quite frankly I feel like such an idiot for how I ended things with her.

SO, the reason I want to send Jodie a letter is because Mary actually sent me an apology after years telling me she was sorry for how she ended things and hoped I was doing well, and it was something I really needed to hear and it made me feel good. Now, I want to send Jodie a letter to tell her that I'm sorry for how I ended things with us and that I hope she has found peace and love in her life. Should I send her this letter? Is it worth it to try and reach out to her after 5 years of no contact whatsoever? She's off all social media and I don't even have her cell phone number anymore, only her home address - hence the letter. In a perfect world I admit I'd love to see Jodie again, but even just sending a letter like this, I'm hoping it will help me (and maybe her) close the door on those old feelings.

1. The amounts were suspicious. $35 to 40 when usually it takes no more than $20 to get all the way across town when fares are low. 
2. Wouldn't let me know which side of town or which area they were living in.  Kept hiding their address because of their ""job"". Also wouldn't let me pick them up at all, not even somewhere nearby. 
3. They kept saying you needed $100 balance on Paypal to order an Uber. Should have known that was a lie. 
4. They would promise to refund me money but the refund activity never showed up. 
5. They would never call me, send me photo snaps or videos. When I tried calling yesterday over snap they refused to pick up. 
6. Whenever I started to imply they were scamming me, they got defensive, emotionally manipulated me, and started gaslighting me about what happened to the money. 

I kept getting charged fees whenever I sent money and I didn't end up asking Paypal about it today. Sending with Friends and Family should be free right? Turns out the account was based in the Phillipines.

1) Going over everything I’ve said to them and trying to understand what was the dealbreaker for them (“how did I fuck this up?”)

2) Finding something arbitrary and beating myself over for saying/doing it (“I knew that was a bad idea, so obvious in hindsight, I never learn”)

     Months ago I almost lost my virginity in a foursome with three girls.  I told my friends about it weeks before it happened and a different one of my friends girlfriends found out about it.  The next time she saw me, she sat me down and started drilling me with questions like, “do you really want to do this with them?”  And saying stuff like, “it’s going to be your first time, you’re going to nervous, which is natural”.

     Why is this?  Is it just a women’s natural motherly instincts that cause all of my friends girlfriends and the girlfriends friends, that make them want to help me and give me advice?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157430,public,self,"Has anyone else notice that when a girl isn’t interested in you, she does try to help you get with other girls?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/slhva2/has_anyone_else_notice_that_when_a_girl_isnt/,no_ads,0,,,,,

Not sure if I updated anyone but I had a super bad streak that broke my confidence. Like I would approach a guy and it was like he was absolutely horrified that I had the audacity to talk to him. Even over simple things like asking for homework help and shit.

Well even though they still sucked, I had a few wins that were great. A guy in my Computer Science class asked me out to get Pho! We talked for hours but it was mostly because he seemed to actually be a big talker. I enjoyed not being lonely but he’s not someone I’m interested in due to the fact that he didn’t ask me anything about myself at all lol. Nonetheless it seems that he’s way more open to me because we had to do a group project in class and he practically bee-lined towards me so we could work together.

Two days later, I had two random guys approach me in school! I was sitting in the STEM building’s lobby and this guy with long hair just sat right next to me and started talking to me/complimenting me. Woah! I don’t think I did anything particularly different but talk about a 180! Literally a few hours later, a similar situation happened to me at the library. I complimented his pierced ears (they were like those cross earrings that are popular right now) and he said he appreciated it and that he liked my hair. 

None of these went anywhere honestly but it’s actually kind of crazy how big of a turn around occurred just from me doing nothing and changing nothing.
