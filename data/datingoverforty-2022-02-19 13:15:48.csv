0,swi0e7,1645299431,Is it fair to expect a bf/gf to participate in activities they don't enjoy?,"Just curious,  I can see both sides of it.  On the one hand I've often accompanied a guy I was seeing too a movie or concert I didn't really want to go to because they did and I'm the type that I'm more about the company I'm keeping than the activity. I can also understand some people aren't going to want to sit through a movie,  show,  etc they don't actually want to see and appreciate the honesty if going with me wouldn't be enjoyable for them.  Part of me feels compromise is part of any healthy relationship, but so is doing things with others and being up front and honest.  My bf will just say,  no I'm not interested in that,  so I will ask my sisters or a friend instead. A friend asked me if I felt that was unfair and I hadn't really thought about it.  When I was married my ex would go with me and the complain the entire time.  Of course,  he also complain if I went without him (there's many good reasons he's my ex).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/swi0e7/is_it_fair_to_expect_a_bfgf_to_participate_in/

15,sx53t5,1645374765,Staying Friends with Exes,"Hey DoF- I‚Äôve been dating a guy since July, and we are now bf/gf since November. This is my first committed relationship since I started OLD in 2020. I was with my ex husband for 16 years and have 3 kids together. He was with his for 10 years and share custody of a dog. My marriage ended bitterly, but his did not.

For me, when my romantic relationships end, they truly end. A wall goes up for me and I move on. I will remain friendly if I happen to see them, but there is no contact. My ex sees the kids twice a year so we text only when exchanging kids.

My bf is completely different and I‚Äôm just now realizing this. When we started dating I was aware he exchanged the dog every two weeks, so there would be contact. It came to light later that, in addition to the switch days, he will text her 1-2x a week and see her 1-2 times a month for lunch/dinner/whatever. 

WHAT. This is the woman that cheated on him.  OK, maybe the fact that they had a relationship for a decade means they can remain friends. I still don‚Äôt like it. 

My bf and I work in the same industry that is female dominant so he has many female friends. I have no problem with him having female friends because I have male friends. Here‚Äôs the issue for me, this week I find out that some of his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are women he‚Äôs dated in the past.

WHAT. Those aren‚Äôt friends, those are past lovers. So now it gets me thinking when he‚Äôs going to go meet a friend, it‚Äôs really past lovers he is meeting.

I know he is not a cheater. We‚Äôve had conversations about cheating since that ended his marriage. But my concern is why does he feel the need to still keep ties with all these exes? 

Last night he told me he‚Äôd have to push back our outing with my kids because he‚Äôs having brunch with a friend who‚Äôs having a hard time. I asked which friend, and he tells me it‚Äôs M, who I recognize as the girl he dated right before me. She is the one who was in love with him and wanted a serious relationship, but he did not. He said her business is tanking and she‚Äôs having suicidal thoughts. I didn‚Äôt know they were still in touch. But apparently they‚Äôve been texting every couple of weeks or so.

WHAT. Why is she contacting him with suicidal thoughts? He told me he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthrow away relationships‚Äù and if he can help someone he will.

I‚Äôm trying to be understanding but having a HARD time. I have kids who keep me busy 24/7, while he does not. Maybe he‚Äôs able to keep all these relationships because he has more time? Or does he enjoy the attention from multiple sources? I know men/women will use the guise of friendship to keep hope alive so that they can rekindle later on. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt trust him- I don‚Äôt trust their motives.

The kicker in all this is that, at the end of this argument last night, he told me he knows it‚Äôs a double standard, but he would not be okay with me being friends with any past lovers. I went home upset and woke up upset.

Do I just deal with this? Is he more emotionally mature and empathetic than me and I am just a massive asshole?

Pros: this seems low risk, the kids are not going to become attached after one meeting, and there should be plenty of fun/distractions so it will be a low pressure situation for everyone.

Cons: I could use some advice on this. My guts says it‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm lacking experience: what are the drawbacks? If we are not together in a few months I am unsure there is any real impact on the kids from one meeting.

21,sx9dul,1645385897,Help! (F/42) working thru issues of dating a (M/38) dad of 2.,"**I posted this to a single parenting board too, any suggestions welcomed if I'm listing this incorrectly...thanks!

I'm (f/42)  dating a nice guy (m/38). I've never been married nor do I have kids. I do not want to have any either.....(I don't mean this to sound awful either)

Side note: I was open to dating a guy with kids because almost every guy in my age range has children and I thought I was being closed minded.

So, we've been dating for 8 months now. 
He's coparenting 2 kids with his ex girlfriend. He has a girl, 11 and a boy,, 9 and they spend 3 days a week or so with him.

So here's the guts of this post:
In December I purchased 2 tickets to a concert for my boyfriend &amp; I. It was a gift and I was equally excited to share an experience &amp; grow our connection.

On top of that, the tickets cost $250 which is a little costly especially since my hours just got cut.

He had no issue with the concert tickets as it's his favorite band.

The show is in 2weeks and he said that he received an email that the annual 'daddy daughter dance' falls on the same day &amp; starts at the same time.

Without technically canceling he asked if I can change the ticket date which he knows I can't. The show is a 90minute drive from where the dance is

I do not have any experience with this.
Usually anyone blowing off plans is a red flag, but this is his daughter.

I've never gone to a father daughter dance either might I add nor would I have wanted to at that age 

I also feel like I'm going to be set up for lots of these types of situations and that's not a good feeling.

So my question is:
Am I being unfair in my frustration/ extreme disappointment over this concert?
Should I politely bow out of this relationship if I'm feeling this way?
How do I even discuss these feelings/ issues with him without coming off insensitive ?

22,sx9oxq,1645386695,I envy those dating without responsibilities...,"Being a 40 something father of two I figured that at this point in my life I‚Äôd be going out on dates with my wife and taking trips around to shows and so on. 

Late in my 30s my now ex decided she wanted to have one more child. Because it would most likely be her last chance to do so. I pushed back but finally agreed. My pushback was based on issues in our relationship that I felt needed talking about, but was assured by my wife that they were her issues that she knew she had them and was working on them with a therapist. We had heartache trying, but after almost 2 years, we finally got our second baby. 5 years later, my ex asked for a divorce saying that she had been struggling for a while in our marriage and thought having another child would ‚Äúfix it.‚Äù  I had been very vocal, tried to communicate before and it just turned out the way it did. 

My issues with dating now, is the lack of time people have for one another. We all have kids and jobs and so on. Not to mention whatever their previous partner did to them being projected on you. I met one person who after a short time of dating felt the need to psycho analyze me when I just accepted her how she was. And tried to make sure to lift her up because she seemed to need it.  When I had a problem and I wanted to share that with her, THAT was the time she decided to psychoanalyze me. Not that what she was saying had anything to do with the issue I attempted to share, so it kinda came from left field. 

But what sucks the most, is finding someone that you click with on many levels, almost every level. They ask you to be exclusive. Then after Valentine‚Äôs Day, you get the axe. And the reasons given are things where the person shouldn‚Äôt have been dating to begin with much less asking for exclusivity. 

I don‚Äôt like dating, I don‚Äôt like dating around and I am not here to increase my body count. I just want to find someone who wants to be with me and takes things at face value rather than immediately tries to find an agenda. To learn more about me before formulating an opinion.  

We all have our scars and I‚Äôm not looking to find someone who wants to compare them or to try to heal mine. I don‚Äôt want someone who wants to create new ones. Just wants to find peace and a person with whom I feel safe again with my emotions. But I guess in this day in age it‚Äôs too much to ask for‚Ä¶

28,sxfm49,1645402726,Encountering a lot of men with ‚Äúgame‚Äù or who lie a lot,"I have tried online dating and regular dating and ive known that a lot of guys have been doing this since I was 13 years old lol. Like it‚Äôs no surprise . But I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of guys will lie to get a relationship or sex. I read a study that showed a lot of men will do this and think it‚Äôs ok. I think it‚Äôs obviously the equivalent of catfishing. Trying to land a relationship or sex under false pretenses is so bad. Here‚Äôs some examples of experiences I‚Äôve had with men. 

One guy I was dating had this fantastic lifestyle where he traveled to Italy in the summer and most of his clothing was Italian designers like Gucci Prada etc . I could tell he loved Italy and he was thrilled when he met me, a woman who is Italian. He told me he was Italian and would love to take me to Italy someday if we hit it off since I‚Äôve never been. A month or two into dating he tells me casually during dinner that he‚Äôs not Italian and that he told me that to impress me and laughed like isn‚Äôt that so funny? My jaw dropped . I knew he was a bad person then . I further confirmed this by asking him a test question. He had told me previously he was raised catholic. Most Catholics don‚Äôt believe in abortion unless for some if it‚Äôs really necessary. He had mentioned he wanted a son. I just casually said to him ‚Äú so what if we were together and I got pregnant but it was with a girl. Would you mind if I just got an abortion and we try again until we had a boy?‚Äù And he said oh yea totally fine. I dumped him.

Another guy I was dating was a conservative type guy. He said he hated how modern feminism was going where women were now sleeping around all the time. I didn‚Äôt really care because I don‚Äôt want to sleep around myself but I wondered if he had a double standard about it . He was sort of questioning about my sexual history one day and asking me how I felt about the whole thing and I said I don‚Äôt really enjoy casual sex and asked how about you? He said ‚Äúoh no me neither ‚Äú. I said so what‚Äôs the craziest thing you‚Äôve done , was it a threesome ? He then says ‚Äúno but me and my friend both got jerked off in a car by this girl‚Äù. I was like hmm that‚Äôs weird. It was weird to me and he definitely was seeming to be a double standard guy. I asked him another time the same question and he had forgotten I asked him the question and he said yes he had two threesomes before. I dumped him.

Both of these guys and mostly every guy I‚Äôve met has tried to have sex with me right away. I have never met a guy who prefers to take things slow like me and have even felt pressured to have sex with guys who gave me the attitude of ‚Äú I don‚Äôt understand , if you like me why aren‚Äôt we having sex?‚Äù. Well it is exactly things like this , men lying and manipulating me to have sex which makes me want to take things slow. Otherwise I feel like an idiot after. And it usually takes a few months to see if a person is who they say they are. Maybe these guys didn‚Äôt want just sex and I‚Äôm just interpreting the lying as a behavior that usually goes along with men using ‚Äúgame"" to get sex. I mean why is that word ‚Äúgame‚Äù with men even so popularly understood ? Because I am guessing so many men think of it as acceptable to lie to obtain sex . 

Why would a woman want to be a guys girlfriend if he lied ? They should not and this shouldn‚Äôt be shocking to the men who do this . My only thoughts are that I should wait a few months before proceeding to sex with a guy. What do you think should be the strategy to avoid these types of men?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sxfm49/encountering_a_lot_of_men_with_game_or_who_lie_a/

I'm seeking a g/f, possible wife eventually, who wants female led relationship where she is the boss.  I love to be given orders as long as it is in a loving respectful way.

Just joined Hinge a few weeks ago to see if I'd like that platform better then Bumble.  Matched with a 38F, very cute, conversation flowed nicely, and since I'm not one to beat around the bush we made lunch plans at this place I've always wanted to checkout.  

Sat afternoon comes around and we happen to arrive at the restaurant at the same time.  We walk in together and get to our table.  She takes off her jacket and I totally got caught checking her out (don't judge me - Lol).  She was absolutely stunning and I probably looked like a deer in the headlights as I'm thinking to myself good lord I'm in trouble.  We order drinks and start chatting and she's very articulate, funny, and feisty!.  Everything seems effortless and the hours just pass by.  We got there at 1PM and it wasn't until she asked did you even notice it's dark out that I briefly looked at my phone as it was after 5PM already.  There's a break in the conversation and she's like, ""what are you thinking?"".  I go, ""I'm thinking about where I want to take you next"".  She smiles and tells me to lead the way so I pick a good restaurant I know that's about 20 mins away and the marathon continues.  

We have dinner and more drinks and after previous one and done dates with other matches it's nice feeling that attraction and intensity with a new person.  We end up at another bar / lounge after that to listen to some music and didn't finally leave until after midnight.  She's like I usually don't kiss on the first date but at this point we are on date 3 so that's the logic I'm going with.  I say I'm not arguing with your logic and we makeout like teenagers before I jump in my car and drive home.  I didn't get home until well after 1AM twelve hours later.  

We also ended up getting together the next day and once again it lasted late until the evening.  Over the 2 days we spent 22 hours together so I'd say yes it was a successful weekend!

I let my son (8) know that I was dating someone and that I wanted to introduce them at a later time.

48,sy4dbs,1645477380,Back in the friend zone?,"Hi folks, I am a 50 YO female who dates men. I was married from 24-to 30 and have been in committed, monogamous relationships since then. I like dating and mostly date online (Hinge, Bumble, OkCupid). I am emotionally intelligent, have done a ton of therapy, and consider myself to have strong boundaries, be outspoken, and generally able to hold my own in relationships.

I've been chatting for about three weeks with a guy that I met on OkCupid (52/m) who, despite our distance apart (about 600 miles), I've hit it off with. Early on, I suggested meeting halfway or meeting me in my hometown. He has been open to either, but neither he nor I have pressed the issue as we both have some tendencies to rush into things and I'm trying to do things differently after being single for a couple of years.

Over the weekend, we chatted for a couple of hours which was great. And, while I was walking my dog, I had this thought: have I been friend-zoned?

I spoke to him last night and just asked him the question. He acknowledged that while I hadn't precisely been friend-zoned, he did admit that he did think of me as a friend he was open to pursuing something more. Following that, he asked if that had happened to me before. It has. 

Looking back on it, I have probably been friend-zoned by most of my exes. My relationships tend to start well and are emotionally, very deeply connected. At some point, even if we have gotten engaged (which has happened to me twice; I decided not to pull the trigger), we become good friends/roommates. This has happened to me regardless of what age I date (younger, older, same age).

I'm curious to hear from both men and women who get friend-zoned, why they get friend-zoned, how to get out of the friend zone, etc.

**TL; DR:** 50 YO female dating men is consistently put in the friend-zone and is curious about other people's experience and how they get out of this cycle.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sy4dbs/back_in_the_friend_zone/

50,sy4kix,1645477866,Online Dating: Observations,"(49M)

I have tried online dating for a bit over 2yrs now and overall have been on about 40 dates. I met some interesting women and and dated about 3 of them on average 3-5 months. Overall though, of the approximate 40 dates I have been on there a couple of things I noticed.

1. I rarely match with someone less than 5 miles away
   1. In Chicago (where I am from) 10 miles is far considering what part of the city/suburbs you live in
      1. Sometimes I wonder if this is by design via the app makers
2. I have never matched with someone who *I* was excited about meeting (meaning I liked them first)
   1. not talking about ""10s"" per se' (those who are clearly out of reach) but I have a creative background and prefer women with a little edge 
      1. I have matched people who weren't exactly my type and I like them first. I try stay open minded because most people are just bad at making profiles (including me)
3. Most of the people I have met felt ""off""
   1. One woman lied about her height and said she was 5'8"" when she was 5' 11"" (I'm 5'9')
   2. at least 15 women used misleading photos
   3. One was a life long lesbian who decided to ""switch sides""
      1. It goes on
4. Piggy back off of #2 I have seen the same women on the same apps doing the same thing for at least as long as I have (2yrs)
   1. Is this a sign that dating apps may just not work for most people?
   2. I did meet my ex-wife on online dating but that was 2008, this whole swipe left/right culture I feel just doesn't work. Collecting and throwing away people seems like odd behavior

I have also hired a fulltime nanny to look after the kids. Around couple of months back I met someone who is also of my age. She is never been married and stays nearby with her 2 cats.

We like each other and are comfortable with each other's company and are exploring on how to take this relationship forward. When it comes to physical intimacy part so far we only do this at her place. However she is not very comfortable doing it at her place. The reason is mainly the society I live in is usually very unkind to single, never married women. People around do talk behind the back and as her mother also sometimes visits her, she is afraid that they might say something nasty to her mother, which she will have tough time explaining. 

She has met my daughters once and was affectionate towards them, but I am still not comfortable of her spending the night at my place as I don't know how it will reflect upon my daughter. We both understand each other's concerns.

So when it comes to taking the relationship forward how do we deal with this intimacy situation. Looks like it is still too early in the relationship to be spending time at each other's place due to some or other reason. One option is to go out of the city over the weekend but given we are both busy with our lives it is tough to find that common weekend. Also we cannot do this that very often.

How you folks deal with relationship when its beyond few dates and you start trusting each other and want to be with that person and would also like the relationship to move forward.

Nevermind that I set up dinner with my parents and they were looking forward to seeing her. Did we move too fast? Did having dinner with my parents scare her off or she's not that into me.

64,syn9fc,1645535448,How long does the honeymoon period last?,"A couple years out of a 20 year marriage, I (52f) have met someone and fallen totally, madly in love. (Yes, it does happen!). It‚Äôs been about 7 months. 

I am usually a bit cynical about these kind of things, and keep my heart a little protected for a long time. But this has been so great, and he has been so wonderful - consistently loving, excited about building a future together, funny, smart, easy to be with, open to talking about feelings and challenges - that I have given up trying to slow things down to feel safe, and have thrown myself into this relationship with abandon, possibly for the first time in my life. I want to marry this guy and be with him forever. Not tomorrow, but not too long either. 

Here‚Äôs the issue. I know things get hard. I know they get real. I know this giddy, being our absolute best selves, brain flooded with OxyContin phase doesn‚Äôt last. Not only do I know that, I feel like I still can‚Äôt totally relax and believe that I have found the love of my life until things get real and difficult and we still want to be together. I think it‚Äôs a little bit of PTSD from my marriage. We loved each other and it was great in the beginning but when things got difficult, and our deeper differences surfaced, we got miserable and ultimately it weakened our marriage until it ended. All the marriage counseling and date nights and best intentions in the world couldn‚Äôt save it.

So my very unscientific question is this. When will I know this is real? When can I trust these feelings of excitement, and gratitude, and potential? When can I relax instead of being ever vigilant for as-yet-unseen red flags?

When did your relationship go from honeymoon to real? Thanks for any thoughts.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/syn9fc/how_long_does_the_honeymoon_period_last/

I posted this the other day and a few responders asked for an update. 

I told her I‚Äôd like to chat outside the DMs and suggested coffee or a virtual link if that was more comfortable for her. She said maybe in a few weeks. 
The conversations continued upbeat‚Ä¶quick response time..revolving mostly around music. I think I‚Äôve learned a bit about her through her sharing some of her favorite songs and lyrics. 
But‚Ä¶.

I can‚Äôt call it. I‚Äôm the one initiating the conversations. However, she did say that she doesn‚Äôt initiate conversations but is friendly if one is initiated. I‚Äôve found that to be true. She would send walls of text about stuff we‚Äôre talking about that I enjoy reading. 

Also‚Ä¶.she isn‚Äôt who I thought she was. The person I found on Instagram isn‚Äôt her based on things she‚Äôd shared. So I‚Äôm clueless about what she looks like. 

The more we chat the more curious I get. I‚Äôve given her my name and I‚Äôm on google so she likely knows why I look like and some basic stuff about me. 

Part of me thinks she‚Äôs just being friendly and isn‚Äôt interested in getting to know me outside the dms but that could be some insecurity speaking. 

One of the things I‚Äôve learned over the years is that you can only be totally sure if they feel like they‚Äôre 100% into you. I don‚Äôt get that feeling. 

I‚Äôll just continue chatting‚Ä¶.who knows‚Ä¶I might end up with a very cool online friend and nothing more. I think anything more is off the table.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/syni75/update_on_the_dm_slide/
66,syotxe,1645539887,She Left Me to Go Out With Her Ex,"I'm heartbroken right now. The girl I've been seeing for a year went out to dinner with her ex husband and left me home. I planned to cook us dinner. Had everything out ready to cook for us. Yet she still left.

Her Ex husband comes into town one weekend a month to visit their kids. When he does, she would always tag along to go eat dinner. After we started dating, I told her I didn't like that she does that. I told her that if he's in town for the kids, then let him be with the kids. You be with me. You have a place to stay with me and will be child free for those few days. This weekend, he's in town. It was her idea to stay with me the entire weekend. She changes plans the day before saying she's still going to eat dinner with her ex and kids. She goes on Saturday but comes back to my place that night. Sunday we spend all morning together. I get steaks and baked Mac and cheese ready to cook for us. She tells me she's leaving. I'm shocked. I don't know what to say. I'm visibly upset yet she still leaves. Hours after she leaves, I'm hoping she comes back through my door. But she never does. She continued to eat dinner and hang out. Even if she came back and we had awkward silence for the rest of the day, at least i know that you choose to be with me over the guy that hurt you and you're now forced to deal with because you have kids together. We text and she's unapologetic and doesn't see any of it from my side. Just that I'm too jealous and that there's nothing to worry about.

Maybe I am jealous. I don't know. I think a healthy amicable relationship with the father of your kids is definitely needed for everyone's mental well being. But does that mean she still needs to spend time with him? We barely have time to be together when he's not in town. Now that he is, this gives us a whole weekend just to be alone. Not only that, it gives us a chance to see how things would be if we were to move in together.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/syotxe/she_left_me_to_go_out_with_her_ex/
67,syp6ei,1645540826,The desire to get an explanation that will never come or never fully answer your questions. I need a reminder to move on.," 

technically  we ended our relationship last May.  She broke up with me (47M) and although  we did not go full no contact, I did move to another continent.   At the  end of last year's summer, we were texting again but I found out she  lied to me.  Basically she was sleeping with the guy she cheated with on  me and although she could do whatever she wanted as a single woman, I  had asked her to no longer contact me in case she started hooking up  with him.  but she kept saying how much she missed me and loved me,  while being with him.... We went no contact for a couple of months.  I  was hurt and angry.   Early November she started contacted me again....    Some excuse about she wanting to cook a recipe I once made for her.   I  had calmed down and been on a couple of dates myself so I answered.    Long story short, it didn't take long for both of us to confess how much  we missed each other, still loved each other and wanted to see each  other.  So after Christmas, I flew back to where she lived and was  planning to spend NYE with her and the rest of that week.   However, on  the 30th of December, we were just together for a couple of days, she  hurts her knee pretty bad and can no longer walk.   I decide to stay a  few days longer and cook, clean and wash for her.  I go shopping and  make sur ethat when I leave her freezer is stocked with fresh meals and  her frigde with enough ingredients to keep her going for  a while.   I  return to my home and every day we text, almost every day we talk and  leave voice messages to each toher telling how much we miss and love  each other still...  She tell me everyday how crazy she is getting from  not being able to move around.   This lasts through most of January that  we decide we want to see each other again around Valentine.   She  really needed my help.  I fly back for another week together.   And then  I start noticing things....  She was not going to drink for a month and  I supported her through January and I though she achieved this.  But  then I saw for example that the bottle of Whiskey I bought to flamb√© our  steaks was almost empty.   She came up with a lame excuse but I let it  pass because I was so happy to be back.   But then I started noticing  more....   Bed sheets clean when I left, dirty - sex dirty - and thrown  in a corner...  hair under the toilet seat, a used towel with hair and  stains....  And everything started adding up.  I waited until the last  morning to talk to her about it.   I had asked her in December to let me  know if she would be sleeping with other people.   We were having  unprotected sex and I did not want to risk my heath if I wasn't the only  one.  I did not need to know who or when or why,  I just wanted openess  in case we were also seeing other people. She agreed with me.   The guy  she was sleeping with again while texting me how much she loved me is  non-monogamous and sleeps around a lot.   They have unprotected sex as  well.  She's been putting my health at risk as well, while I was  cleaning and cooking for her.   I feel so manipulated.  I feel so angry.    I was hoping that after all these fights we could start with an  honest base and built further, make new memories.  We had made pplans fo  rher to come over to my place in June and then travel around italy....    I know she woud have really loved to do that.... But unfortunatly, I  do not deserve the truth....  And I cannot live any longer with that.   What's even the point of tryiing to be friends when I can only see her  lying to my face over and over again....   I broke off all means of  contact as soon as I landed back in Europe.   I never got an  explanantion or an excuse and I feel angry but as the title says.....",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/syp6ei/the_desire_to_get_an_explanation_that_will_never/
68,syu0t1,1645553135,Ghosted on my birthday. We'd been dating 3 months and I'd literally met his family the day before.,"So yesterday was my 41st birthday and I'd made tentative plans to go to a movie after me and my fella got off work. He texts and calls (I was too busy at work to talk) in the afternoon and says he's driving from a city 3 hours away he'd had to go to for work (he doesn't travel for work often). This was the first I'd heard of him taking a trip that day for work. He wishes me happy birthday. A few hours later I get off work and try calling him back, no answer, he texts and says he just got home. I take a few calls from family members and try calling him back 30 min later. And that's the last I heard from him.

It makes no sense as we'd been exclusive for the last month and a half, and his family (including his mom) had been in town from out of state last week and he wanted me to meet them. So I did, Sat night, the night before last. It went well, from what I could gather. 

I sent a text saying I was disappointed and it was disrespectful of my time to reserve me on my b-day night and then bail. And that if he's intentionally ignoring me, that's super hurtful. Why do people do this? I haven't texted him since that last text saying how hurtful this is, and have no plans to. 3 solid months down the drain (again).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/syu0t1/ghosted_on_my_birthday_wed_been_dating_3_months/

70,syv2fu,1645555718,Doubts for the future,"I have been in two emotionally abusive LTR (10+ years each), one w a child. Both times I was unaware how controlled I was and isolated I was until after each chose to leave - one for another person and one for a desire to live a different lifestyle. I also realized how unhealthy I was emotionally because of trauma in my childhood with my father and a sexually abusive family friend. 

I‚Äôve spent the last 5 years in therapy and have made significant process. The traumas are no longer a forefront but there are still lingering emotional doubts about trust and since both of these men seemed so good-too good to be true I have very little faith there are any actual solid men left who aren‚Äôt already partnered or are willing to partner with someone who has been divorced twice. 

I have a stable career, home, etc., and see good marriages (honestly and real-not perfect) in my friends. I‚Äôve never come across a person like that in the wild or in my brief time of online dating. One wanted to go back to his ex and the other ghosted before we met.  

My season of life now is a little too busy to make dating a priority and I‚Äôm fine with that. I love being single. I look to the future though and I do wonder if there is someone who would actually love me in a real relationship that is mutually respectful and with a desire to grow together and someone who would love my son the way he needs a dad and not a bank.

We had our second date yesterday (it was almost 2 weeks after the first one because of bad weather and other stuff, but during that time we remained in daily contact by phone/message). We're very attracted to each other and we get on well, which is great. He's funny, compassionate and kind, and I really like him. He also has severe anxiety and a few other MH-related issues (which is OK as so do I!) and I'm just not sure how to move things forward, or if I should even bother. 

There were one or two things during our date that sent up 'amber' flags for me, but I struggle to know whether they are byproducts of his anxiety and can be accepted. Nothing awful, just things which sort of trigger my wounds. For instance, he was late meeting me because he was getting so anxious about it. He definitely likes me and said he wanted a third date - in fact, he kind of set me a 'test', which was that I should send a text at a certain time the next day, and if I remember to do it then he knows I genuinely want to see him again. He also asks me a lot of questions about my relationship with my ex.

I get the impression he is massively cautious, and that's no bad thing in itself, particularly with his anxiety issues, and he is right to self-protect. And because I also struggle with my own issues, I understand that a certain level of patience and accommodation is necessary. But is this all just going to be too energy-sapping and complicated?

94,szlq1f,1645634343,Men don't respond when women reach out first in OLD,"In 2021, I began dating on OLD for the first time (I am F50), and had a lot of success, even fell in love.  After that ended, in the last few weeks I have re-engaged the tried and trusted OLD websites, refreshed my bio, and uploaded fun, new, cute pictures.  Yet, I'm getting no attention.  Then, when I reach out to men on the websites, none of them ever respond.  Do men not like it when a lady reaches out first?  Do they automatically assume if she does initiate, she must be crazy?  I think I look youthful for my age, so I'm attracted to men of similar looks (not younger than me, but similar appearance).  Maybe they have so many women chasing them, no time to respond.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/szlq1f/men_dont_respond_when_women_reach_out_first_in_old/

I‚Äôm (36M) / her 42 , have been dating my gf for about 8 months. Not one nude nor sexy (ie in a bra or victoria secret )pic from her. 

I‚Äôve asked in the past to send me a sexy pic and I get a pic of her legs or something. A couple times in bed I‚Äôve asked if I can take a pic‚Ä¶ no. I‚Äôm not asking even for a face pic. In my past relationships sexy or nudes haven‚Äôt been an issue with them sending. They feel sexy and hot when they do; trust that I won‚Äôt share them. 

My ‚Äúargument‚Äù is she trusts that I have no stds to sleep with me, trusts to invite me into her house,  etc but no trust for a sexy breast pic, for example. 

As most men, we like oogling over our gf‚Äôs pic when not together.
