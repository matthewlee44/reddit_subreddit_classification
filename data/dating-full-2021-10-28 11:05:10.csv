If you want all of this stop promoting yourself on these or if you're going to at least put that you're looking for a hookup or something.

I think I'm going to throw up. 

I park, and give Bestie an update before walking towards the right fucking hotel this time. I enter the lobby and see the table we sat at a few days ago, and I smile.

This is not a scenario I planned for. 

The plan was to leave the package at his door, take a selfie with the door and the package in the background and send it to him. He was to open the door and find a nude photo of me wrapped in a silk ribbon with a note attached ""Don't forget me XO Sarah"" . The note has a kiss from me and a spritz of my perfume.

I leave the package with the front desk person and send him a message. 

""I tried to sneak to your room and leave something at your door, but I can't get upstairs without a key, so I had to leave it at the front desk"" 

What??? He replies 
It's a surprise, you better go to the front desk and find out. 

He's shocked to know that I drove all the way and he's not there. I wanted it to be a surprise. He wished he has known so he could plan for it and try to make time to see me. 

I tell him to keep the ribbon for the next time he's in town and he's mind blown. He tells me he will be back in about 3 weeks and had no plans to lose contact with me. 

I'm fucking beaming with happiness! I'm fairly certain I skipped as I left the hotel to go to my car.

Yes, it was really starting to weigh on me and so I told him how I felt. I told him I don't want to cancel the date but I asked him if we could postpone it so I could have more time to get comfortable with him because as it stands right now, I know I won't be able to enjoy his company because I'll be too anxious and stuck within my own head.

I expected him to be upset but the WAY he reacted put me off completely. I explained how bad my anxiety was, and for how long it had been affecting me. I've never outwardly admitted that to anyone before but I felt he was owed the truth. 

He ended up calling me ridiculous. He kept talking about how much planning he was doing, and how I had nothing to be anxious about, and how HE wasn't anxious because he had nothing to be nervous about. I sent him a link about how social anxiety works and he only repeated the same thing.

He asked if i wanted to chill or do something. I said just chill ( im a virgin and dont want any sexual thing with him) he said ok but then started to make a move on me later. I paused several times but he would try it over and over.  I know i should have said no but it was my first date/ first time ever being alone with a guy. I know im dumb. But at least i still didnt lose my virginity. I later took a cab home. The thing is i feel lonely and just want to cuddle and be intimate in an innocent way but he at his age wants otherwise. He has many sexual partners which im also not ok with. Im really not a casual type of person but i failed myself for letting him touch me although i stopped him several times, i should have just leave

The thing is i lost an earring there and couldnt find it. But he found it the next morning, i kind of want it back but not sure if i should still meet him given the circumstance (lying about age, not respecting my choice etc) any advice please?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1104080,public,self,Tinder date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhojr2/tinder_date/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Those options fall through for one reason or another, and then the new matches you do start getting start be a little ""off"". 

For me, it started a few weeks back when I found myself coming across matches who were getting too attached too quickly (days) and the cadence of the conversation was becoming too frequent and overwhelming. Other matches were too aggressive and/or talked so much that I couldn't get a word in. Choosing not to meet these matches ultimately was the right thing to do. 

However, the new matches since then have only become even less ideal. One match I'd been interesting after talking to for a week revealed she has an STI. Another match I'd had phone calls and video dates with who I was planning on meeting just revealed she still lives with her ex, and plans to continue since they're still close friends just living separate lives at this stage. Of course, the one remaining good match I had a great video call last week and stated she wanted to keep talking and plan to see me IRL has left me on read. 

At this point, I can't help but feel like the not so great matches are getting increasingly worse and more frequent, while the good options are nowhere to be found.

Three weekends ago I went to my friend’s house warming party at their new lake house with him and his GF along with some close friends family. I get talking to this girl who turns out is his girlfriend’s younger sister. One drunken thing leads to another and we sleep together that night. No one at the party seems to notice and we go to a diner for breakfast the next day when it comes out that she is 19. I did not know she was that young the evening before, she must have known I was 26/27 (not criticizing her) as I went to school with her sister’s BF. We hung out as a group for the rest of the weekend having fun but nothing happened between me and this girl on the following day/night as I got the feeling that neither of us wanted to ‘rock the boat’. 

Fast forward a few days and she messages me saying it was ‘cool meeting you we should hang out again etc etc’ I respond back by being pleasant but not too forward/committal.

I am unsure how to purse this as there is an age gap of 8 years. I have looked online and opinion seems completely divided on this. I would be up for something casual to see where it goes but I would be worried she would not be mature enough for it. Although we had a fun time together before I am undecided. Or on the flip side am I discounting her agency as she is an adult able to make her own decision.

Then I ask for an Instagram or a Snapchat. I swear Instagram doesn't feel as childish, that's a better move. Then we start talking on there.

I send a cat picture and luckily my cat is all white, I guess that's rare. We got a +5 in the points score!

I juggle around conversations until I start to realize who I have more interesting conversation with, then after a day or two I schedule a date, then we meet and maybe we have intense chemistry or none at all.

It's been so difficult, but overall much more fulfilling than swiping endlessly on dating apps with such a low ROI. I've had more genuine conversations in person in weeks than I've had online in years, and I've came to this conclusion: 

I think more women should actively put themselves in the driver's seat of their own love lives, instead of the passive recipients, and here is why: 

* Only choosing from the men who approach you generally preselects a certain personality type. 

There are exceptions to this, of course, but generally speaking men who are confident approaching a random woman have likely done it before. This isn't automatically a bad thing, but it does mean you're narrowing your IRL dating options to either your social circle, or the small % of random guys willing to approach you. 

There's a much larger % of guys who are likely shy, don't want to bother you, don't want to be labeled creepy, etc, but would be flattered to be approached by a woman. 

* Online dating apps are a bad gauge of someone, especially men. 

I met this guy at karaoke bar last night and thought he was so attractive. I find him on Facebook today and realize his photos did not do him justice at all. I would've swiped him left on a dating app, and that has been likely the case many times. 

Men are notoriously bad at taking photos, so on dating apps the small % of men who get the majority of attention aren't just the attractive guys... They're the attractive guys who are photogenic and know how to market themselves. This just isn't the vast majority of guys. 

Women who only rely on apps for dates are shooting themselves in the foot because of this reason.

* Women don't have the implied danger of being threatening. 

Many men now are scared to strike up conversations out of fear of being seen as creepy. As a woman, there's little to no threat of it. On top of that, people are generally nicer to women, more social, less on guard, it's just easier to start conversations: even ones that aren't romantic in nature.

The pushback I've often seen from women on approaching guys first is A) they don't want to be perceived as easy/desperate B) they don't want men to just go along with their interest for easy attention/sex, despite not actually being that interested, and C) they're terrified of rejection. 

These are all thoughts I had in my head when I started putting myself out there, but I realized a few things: 

* 1) That the majority of guys don't perceive starting a conversation as easy or desperate at all. The issue is, because women often have no experience approaching, their approaches often suck. 

Immediately telling a guy he's hot is a bad approach. Asking a guy out before you've even had a conversation is a bad approach. Only approaching once you've drank way too much is a bad approach. A good approach is casually approaching, giving a compliment and/or asking a question that makes sense. Talk to him the same way you'd talk to anyone else you just met. 

* 2) Some men will take this bait, but it's easy to tell after some time if a guy is just going along with a situation because it's easy. The other point I want to make, is just because a guy shows initial interest first doesn't mean he's any more likely to be serious. Approaching first just gives you more quantity of options, which eventually statistically will give you more quality eventually. 

* 3) Here's my last point I really want to drive home: Rejection is a part of life. And in my honest opinion, I think it builds character. People always talk about ""the good ol days"" without dating apps but the thing is... People are still out and about. You can still take the in-person route.

TLDR; If you're tired of your attractive qualities not getting extended interaction, then put yourself in places where they can. If you're tired of being treated like you're disposable, then try another method that isn't solely looks focused. 

The point isn't to do what is emotionally safe and always makes you feel good; the point is to do the thing that is best for you in the long run. Most men don't only want sex and most women don't only want followers; the issue is many of us are scared to be vulnerable and we're simply bad judges of people when you put a screen in-between us.

That last point could've also applied to men too, but women, I strongly suggest you consider what I'm saying if you've had trouble attracting the same types of men over and over and over. 

I know it seems daunting and hard at first, but I do think more women especially would be happier with their dating lives if they were more proactive about what, and who, they wanted. :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1104218,public,self,"I've been making the first move as a woman, and I 100% recommend it to other women struggling wth dating!

I (20M) met this girl (20F) about three years ago through mutual friends. We then met a lot of times at parties, but we didn't actually bond much.

We started to hang out more frequently last Summer, we were going out almost every night with the same group of friends. We found out that we have a lot of common interests and we started to talk a lot. Often all our friends left the place and I remained lonely with her to talk until 3 am. I started to like her a lot and also my friends were saying that she seemed into me. However, I wasn't able to create much physical contact because she moved away when I tried to sit closer to her and she never looked at me in the eyes. Note that she is a very shy girl.

Finally, we kissed last year at a party after Summer. After the party she acted very weirdly to me, I was holding her hand while we were with the big group of friends and she didn't avoid that, but she was looking very thoughtful and she suddenly went away to sleep lonely. Her friend told me that maybe it was because it was her first kiss and she probably didn't think that she would have done it with me. It also seemed like also her best friend liked me and maybe she felt guilty idk.

However, a few days after the party, I invited her on a date, it went well and we kissed again. Everything felt great. It wasn't. About a week later, we met with other people, at the end we were sitting lonely, I tried to kiss her and she rejected me. After this, she started to ignore me and I did the same. We met about a month later to talk about this and she said ""Sorry I acted like a jerk, it was a bullshit to kiss you"". I never understood the meaning of this. After this talk, we never met again for almost one year.

Recently we started again to meet often with other friends to hang out or at parties. In the beginning, it was a little awkward, but then we gradually started to talk a lot and we became ""friends"" again. We met last week and everyone said she was clearly into me, she was also creating physical contacts, taking my hand, or coming very close to me. However, we met again yesterday and she was treating me like a normal friend, a little coldly.

Now, I hope this wasn't too boring, what would you do if you were in my shoes? I like her A LOT, but all of this story hurt a lot and I don't wanna start again to always be together without understanding her feelings. She is very shy, we never talked about what happened and she would feel extremely uncomfortable if I asked. Maybe I should continue to rebuild a bond when we meet with others and then invite her on a date lonely, but I don't wanna risk to getting friend-zoned.

Last month, my last post, I shared that I had a crush on this 27 year old woman. I (21M) talked to her, but overall she was not interested. I was cool with that, why pursue someone uninterested, right? 

Anyway, fast forward a couple weeks later, and I got put in a research team with 3 girls. As I started bonding with the group, I grew a crush to one of the girls (23F) from the group. 

Essentially, there were many green flags: 
- She would reach out to me individually to ask me questions, such as “where do u work?”, “what music you listen to?” Etc. 
- In person, she would play around with me and make jokes, physically touching me.
- One time, after class, she and I stayed talking next to her car for a good time while everybody had left. 
- She would look at my lips whenever I would pull down my mask to talk clearer.
- She would ask me if I got home safe, cuz she knows I drive 40ish minutes to get to campus. 

These green flags made me come to the conclusion that I had a shot with her. So one night after class, I invited her out to grab coffee after class. She accepted. 
The next day however, she invites the other group members for the coffee. 

At that point I tell her I was hoping it would just be the two of us. Then we start conversing.
Turns out she was oblivious to me asking her to coffee lol, she says she is interested in me, just that her parents get in her way. 
This was a message from her when I asked if she would’ve considered dating me if her parents allowed her to date:  

“Yes absolutely — literally the first thing I thought when I saw in the beginning of the semester was that your eyes are literally so pretty omg 😂😂”

Now, I’m not really looking for advice, nor do I have any serious questions. 
It’s just that my coworker told me to keep being her friend, and it might work out, BUT to also keep your options open. 

I agree with that, as she is not the only girl I’m currently talking to, she just happened to be my favorite one from the girls I’m talking to lol. 

So, is it wise to remain friends with her? We have great conversations and we’re never dry with each other. 
It’s just, is the advice my friend told me good advice? Should I remain friends with her, and see if it leads to anything? 

Also, it’s FINE if it doesn’t, I will remain stoic and virtuous at all time, I’m just wondering what Reddit thinks. 

Lastly, she is dropping out of the program, since she told me the program is not interested to her as she thought beforehand.

Our ""relationship"" lasted few months because of age difference ( which wasn't that much but still we were teens) and we agreed to end things with peace and since then till present days, I can easily say that we are both the closest person to each other.

Currently, she is in relationship - not really stable, few serious break ups but still she goes back to him. Won't comment details but pretty much a friend of her told me that she (my friend) had thoughts of talking with me and eventually try dating again \[since she loves me a lot as a person and loves a lot of things about me\] when she is fully healed from that relationship - that never happend since he always managed to stop her healing process and to twist her mind.

Few months ago I've asked her if that was true - about the ""second try"" - and she confirmed that she had it on her mind but eventually her boyfriend contacts her and yeah... she goes back to him for another break up episode.

Currently, we're texting each other daily A LOT \[ by A LOT I mean from morning till night and we always have something to talk about\], we play video games from time to time and talk, we go out few times monthly and we have amazing time. It's just that we are not into relationship and by knowing that she had thoughts - TWICE - for something like that makes me feel ... I dont know - sad?

To give you a context, this is her first real relationship. First kiss, pretty much first everything. I've been in serious as well as casual relationships. I consciously understand the lack of maturity which might come both from the age, and lack of experience, but we've handled it pretty well till now.

Usually I'm not the clingy type. I express better so have no real qualms in things like ""I miss you, Can't wait to meet you"" etc. She's not good at expressing. So 2 days back, something got to me and I told her ""I sometimes feel a little lack of attention. I don't want you to talk to me all the time or be sweet, but simple unexpected stuff which you know makes me happy will put away the small moments of anxiety since I have an anxious attachment style"".

One major fault of mine was I said this while I was drunk. I went to drink with a few friends (both male and female). I sent her pictures (not to make her jealous but because I enjoy sharing my part of life)
She stopped talking. The next day, I called her and in her mind ""Since I doubted her feelings and sent pictures with a girl, she assumed I have started liking someone else"". While she didn't break up with me, she deleted many pictures of ours, she changed my contact name from ""Babe"" to my real name etc.

We did meet yesterday, and after talking, things are back to normal and she's super lovey again.

However, it came as a shocker to me. I personally didn't find the incident ""so big"" to even consider breakup. Specially since we haven't had any other fights except for small insignificant arguments.

Further, I know it's not a lack of feelings because she literally cried her eyes out for last 2 days when she had these thoughts.

But it was a shocker to me and somewhere I'm losing the fear of ""losing her"" when I realized that even issues could lead to breakup without even so much as a discussion.

Is it due to the lack of maturity or fundamental difference? I'll personally never breakup without atleast a proper discussion (since we're in a serious relationship). Another small but unrelated fact is she always talks about our future. I figured it's also maybe due to her attachment with me being her first boyfriend. She constantly plans our future and got upset when I was trying to be sweet by saying ""I wanna be your boyfriend forever"" whereas she interpreted it as ""only boyfriend"" (she thought of marriage in future).

But yeah, even thinking of ending things at one issue was something I'll probably not be fully able to get over.

Sorry for the long post! Can I have your opinion on my (25f) situation with a guy (25M):

So we are both two busy professional, when we first started talking on Bumble we would have a very asynchronous conversation, but since we had multiple conversations all at once and would respond to each other under 3h, we got to learn about each other quite quickly.

We went on two dates, both were like 9h long, filled with lot of conversation and laughter. First one at a restaurant: we stayed until it's closure, he drove me to my place we talked until 5 am and kissed quite passionately at the end. I invited him inside for coffee but he refused. We both had a great time and agreed to see each other another time. Couldn't meet for two weeks due to schedule conflict, frequency of texting slowed a bit (now maybe 1-3 texts a day) since we prefer to get to know the other person in person vs text.

We met at my place for the second date, he brought some sushi and we talked until midnight. We then started a movie and watched it for about 5 min. before getting physical and having sex. It was really nice and passionate, we talked until 4 am afterwards. He made a few comments that lead me to believe we would see each other another time, like I will bring you x &amp; y next time...

We both agreed that we had a great time. He sent me a texto when he got home saying thanking me to having him over and that he had fun, I responded the same but neither really wrote textually that we should do it again. I reached out Monday (date was Friday) asking him about his weekend and we have texted since then, but he is only texting me once per day, although it is pretty detailed (maybe 4 messages) and with some jokes. He still hasn't asked me on a third date. I'm wondering if he want to just keep his options open, is not that interested or is waiting for me to invite him over again (he is still living at his parents house while I live by myself). 

What do you guys think of his comportment? I'm really wondering what he want. Or I might just be overthinking. I'm gonna ask him, I just would like some external opinions from other first. Sometimes they only tell you what you want to hear :/

I met this girl in a facebook language exchange group for students. Long story short, I knew she was cute, but in the date I also felt great chemistry.

After a lot of flirting on my part, and a game of Never Have I Ever in which got physically closer, I tried to kiss her but she pulled away - saying in an almost offended voice: ""No, I don't know you. Come on, lets keep playing"". I didnt react and we kept on a fun conversation.

I thought I had completely minterpreted her signs, but still, 4 days after I texted her with a clever joke and followed up with ""I'd like to see you again"" and she accepted, we are meeting for a drink tomorrow.

Does this feel like she may be romantically interested? Or just expecting another ""language exchange date"" (with a guy that went for a kiss)?
