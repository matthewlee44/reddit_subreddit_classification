My overly analytical mind says. She‚Äôs Not interested. You make time for the people you want to make time for. So last week (after making a second attempt to hang out and finding out she was going to be out of town) I very clearly said. When you get back from your trip hit me up and I‚Äôll plan the hangout. 

My intentions where 
1. Put the ball in her court so she knows it‚Äôs on her to say that she wants to get together
2. Gauge interest off this because I had asked her to hang out twice (3 times, but the first time was under far less intentional circumstances). 

Just so I don‚Äôt go crazy I‚Äôve shown some of my friends (more female than male because their opinions matter in this scenario)
some of the texts we had exchanged. They were all certain that this girl was into me. Or at least conveyed mutual interest and attraction. Then the first cancellation and the second hang being postponed. So I was a bit lost but my friends were confused too because it all seemed positive up to this last week. But then She went radio silent. 

Either way, it‚Äôs been a few days since I asked her to hit me up. Haven‚Äôt heard from her after her trip. Rational me wants to give up because it sucks to much life out of me to cling to hope.

12,q5nr91,1633924970,Observation of why modern dating is sooo frustrating for men and women...,"Do you feel like modern dating is a frustrating game that is rigged to lose no matter what you do? The answer is glaringly obvious and right under our noses but nobody wants to admit it. We have ignored our evolutionary drives. 

Women, do you wonder why men your own age are perpetually attracted to young, feminine 20-somethings? You may have a career, a good education, social standing and you want a man who is on that same level. Until you find him and realize he more attracted to the young, hot Starbucks barista than a woman like yourself. 

Men, do you wonder why being a nice guy or getting in touch with your feminine side might get you approval from women but not much attraction or sexual fulfillment? Do you wonder why assholes and jerks seem to do much better by doing everything wrong?

In a nutshell...

Men are attracted to youth, beauty and femininity, they are attracted to a woman who can give them healthy babies whether they want children or not. It's hardwired subconsciously. 

Women are attracted to strength, high status and masculinity. They are attracted to men who can protect them and their offspring whether they want children or not. It's hardwired subconsciously. 

The problem is that we have convinced ourselves that we are beyond this. We have convinced ourselves that a few decades of ""wokeness"" can erase millions of years of hardwired evolutionary drives.

I'm not here to pass judgement either way although I do believe masculinity and femininity complement each other wonderfully and are immediate and powerful means of attraction. That does not mean that there cannot be masculine women or feminine men and they deserve every bit of happiness and respect as anyone else. What I am saying is, in our drive to be ""enlightened"" we somehow have decided that men acting masculine and women acting feminine is bad or regressive but the reverse should always be celebrated!

As a result of this, the vast majority of people feel that something is wrong or ""off"" but they can't put their finger on what! Society tries to tell them who they should be attracted to and shames them for who society feels they shouldn't be attracted to... they follow this, never question it and become frustrated and confused why dating and relationships are sooo difficult! 

They never look at the obvious reason why, so they blame the other gender! ""Men are afraid to commit"" or ""too shallow"". ""Women are only after money"" or ""nice guys become friendzoned""

Again.. this is an observation. There is no agenda here. I personally believe that our evolutionary, instinctual drives have much more of an influence on our behavior than we'd like to admit. 

I see post after post of people who seen frustrated so all I ask is that you at least consider that this may be why because it plays out the same ways time and time again in so many different ways if you care to only look. 

...or you can keep being frustrated and confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5nr91/observation_of_why_modern_dating_is_sooo/

30,q5pdos,1633931704,"We went on vacation on our 2nd Week of Dating, Are We Moving too Fast? Did you ever have an experience like this? Any Red Flags to lookout for?","We just recently went on a trip to a major city and we're on our 2nd week dating. We both met in the same university class through a formed study group. So we see each other in class as well. Mostly, the trip was supposed to be going to the city with the whole group, but most of the people in the group cancelled last minute. We still were able to meet up with some friends but mostly it was to ourselves.

We definitely had our great moments, we both loved going out exploring the city and stuffing ourselves with food. We also had a great time shopping together and making the occasionally joke with each other. We did have rough patches though. While we were walking in the city (its pretty fucking loud), She would speak softly and I would reiterate what she said and she would get annoyed questioning me if I was listening to her. It happened a few times, and I was starting to get a little flustered as well. I apologized and told her it was loud. She said I was making excuses. I guess I'm deaf lmao. Luckily we sorted that out. Then later on, We were discussing why songs used the n-word, and I accidently used the word as in example and she flipped out. I knew I messed up, she got pretty heated over it. But we were able to sort that out as well after we sat down and talked it out. Held hands, walked it off. 

I also haven't been saying ""I love you,"" since the last time I said it, she said I think I loved you and later came clean that she was still confused and she said she didn't want to hurt me later down the road because she wasn't sure if she loved me. I've been holding that back ever since then. She also told me that she wasn't used to be the receiving end of the relationship, as I had took care of her when she was sick (Which is normal in relationships, no?).  She told me that in her last relationship, she did most of the work... said that I was too nice. I wasn't too happy about that. But I said that I'm willing to change and to not worry because you can get my back when I'm not feeling well.

We still are able to talk a lot, and get really intimate. But I still have this unsteady feeling of whether or not she loves me. I just recently made a post of the trip, but I suspected she wouldn't post or comment about it, which is what exactly happened. I don't really care about this though, since she did post us on her story. I don't want to force the issue and seem needy at all.  I get doubts in my head a lot about whether it'll work out, even then, I'm willing to stick it out since I want to gain more experience with relationships. Part of me hurts in the inside sometimes. It's like an emotional rollercoaster. I feel good with her, then at times I'm left with feeling of hurt in my insides, like right now. Is it just me overthinking things?

36,q5pvzy,1633933918,What in the world is going on...,"So this girl I'm seeing isn't displaying any physical flirtatious behavior. Such as, playing with her hair or getting close to me and smiling with googly eyes.  

It's our third date and she still has this slight distant, but friendly vibe.  She does let me hold her, touch her shoulder.  However, she doesn't seem to reciprocate.  I tend to remember things she said in our past convo during our past dates to imply in our new date to let her know I'm listening and care.  However, she doesn't say stuff like ""Aww, you remember my favorite ____"" or something to show some kind of affection... When I try to talk about something personal, she gives very short answers or feels like she doesn't want to give that much detail.  What's weird is that when we first met online and chatted for a month or two, she would seem to talk a good bit.  When we met, it's like I'm pushing to make a convo start and she responds with short replies.  I'm not great or good at banter, sexual innuendos, teasing, so those things hardly show up.  I might be able to do one per date.  The rest of the time I'm just being a gentleman and showing her I'm doing my best to have a fun time and not after sex/creep.  (I really am not after sex, more for a relationship) 

She does smile and we do have fun playing our activities, but I'm finding she's ending the night early when in her text she would say she's free all night with even a kissy emoji.  She's an introvert-type personality and I don't think she really dates a lot.  She's always busy with work and idk.  I like her a lot, but now after the third date, I just don't know where she stands.  Our date ended with her going for a quick hug and leaving without the time for me to attempt to kiss or talk.  It's weird that on our first date, she turned and gave me the cheek when I tried to kiss.  However, later on that night she messaged that she had a great time and wants to see me again.  The second date, she didn't message back until I wrote the next day.  So I'm not sure what's going on. 

Again, I really do like her and want to make things work... but wow, I'm not seeing any girly flirty behavior from her.  It's like I'm with a coworker.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5pvzy/what_in_the_world_is_going_on/
37,q5pwfp,1633933978,Is it abnormal to not have a SO at 25?,"(M, 25) I'm at a fairly big university in a decently sized city, and I'm flabbergasted at how many people I see walking together, holding hands, eating together, etc. I look good and I'm in shape. Hell I ran a half marathon a few weeks ago. I just haven't had any big opportunities like parties to go to where you meet people and get to talk to them. It's mainly been a daily rush to class with limited club activities (f u covid). There have been a few instances where I've talked to a girl about a common interest but that's just not enough to amount to anything. I don't get how so many people are dating, I guess I just have a weird set of interests? It's disheartening and makes me feel subhuman. It's fall break and I'm thinking about this. Before you say it, Tinder is a joke unless you live in a city of at least 800,000 (mine is 160,000). That app makes my brain want to off itself, I don't want it again. Is being noticed/having opportunities to meet women a matter of timing and being at a good place to talk? I've gotten some likrs and super likes on Tinder before, just nowhere near where I lived. I just don't get the whole game, it's like everyone knew each other before the semester started and there's no way for anyone not from this area to get their foot in the door. I just feel like an awkward 3rd wheel. I think you just have to be friends with a lot of people to meet othrr people. It sucks, and every form of media reminds me of the dating world. The biggest posts on social media are about relationships and sex. That's the definition of being someone with worth. It's so widespread of a hot topic that it's in academia like anthropology.

i (19f) grew up in SE Asia, so i‚Äôve always leaned more towards the conventional way of dating. i‚Äôve been in a few relationships, but i never became physically intimate with them, even with my last ex who i really loved. i just always thought that building an emotional connection first is so so important, that i didn‚Äôt really look into the physical aspect of relationships. i hate the idea of hookups and i date to marry (but i‚Äôm not waiting for marriage).

i moved to the states last month and i guess the culture shock just got to me. i haven‚Äôt dated since my last ex (over a year ago), but in my first month here, i went on dates with two guys. i had my first kiss on the first date with one guy, and i had sex for the first time on the second date when i don‚Äôt even have feelings for him. i went home feeling so disgusted and confused.

But anyway, on to my point - oftentimes when I find myself wishing for a partner I realise that all I want is a best friend that I can be 100% myself with. But then I see other girls around my age on tiktok complaining about petty stuff like their boyfriends replying late because they were busy, or their boyfriends not calling them pretty bla bla bla. Idk why but I‚Äôve never really understood all of this and sometimes even when I try to put myself in the shoes of a taken person, or I imagine I‚Äôm dating my crush, I still don‚Äôt get it.

I feel that in my generation many couples break up because they‚Äôre too burdened by the whole concept of a relationship. The pressure of having to meet the expectations of one another, of really being like a lovey dovey couple. I think many people rush into relationships with too many expectations and in turn they get let down because not everybody bears the same ideals of a partner.

45,q5qifd,1633936761,Am i just overthinking? Insecure?or what??,"for context: I have been seeing this guy for like 4 months-ish and we have been talking regularly. due to the lockdown, we just had our first date last week and it was lovely. we are going for the 2nd date next week. he has never been into a rs before (as far as i know and he told me) and i kinda the same like never in a serious serious one hmm)

so, before we become close, there was one girl that he was talking to. they never meet tho cuz there was lockdown and she was overseas (we are all international students) back then. Their talking phase has ended loonggg time ago but like the girl is my classmate and when it happened, she told me about what happened between them that he cut off the talking phase with her. she was upset and she told me because she knows I fancy him too and we all were in the same classes back then.

I was too shy to approach him as I'm an introvert and she is an extrovert anddddd he is an introvert too. so like I believe she was the one who approached him too back then. I kinda can sense why he cut her off. cuz she's very talkative and kinda clingy? and i believe he wasn't comfortable with it? IDK I can't really say why i don't want to assume okay.

anyway yea, like he cut off the talking stage with her before we really get closed. and idk like everything that she said he told her is nothing like what he told me (cuz i bait him with questions that relate to the things he said to this girl before and back then we were just friends so I don't think there is any reason for him to lie or anything idk).

the problem here is he does not know that I know about them and I don't want to tell cuz I don't want to ruin the things between us u know and IDK maybe i worry if he back to her just because they are following each other on Instagram while it is clear he is not the Instagram person, I mean he doesn't even have Facebook. maybe I'm just insecure? or what? trust issue? hahaha omg ? so am I just overthinking? or what how?

edit: we share similar values in life and so far we can relate to each other which is a good thing yea but idk i just scared or worry that he will betray me idk sigh halppppp",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5qifd/am_i_just_overthinking_insecureor_what/

49,q5qzjj,1633939091,Who are the guys that are successful on dating apps?,"When looking at most subreddits it seems that most men are only struggling with online dating, as in getting no matches or very few matches, and thus not being able to get dates. Women on the other hand seem to complain more about men only wanting sex on dating apps, or that it is hard to find men that actually want relationships.

So i am just curious, who the fuck are matching with women? 

I understand this is a sort of confirmation bias since those that want to complain make their voices heard, and those that succeed have no need to talk about it.

Is it wrong to assume that most men that want to find a relationship, and are good looking and thus can get matches on OLD, already have a relationship or get one fast. And those guys that can get matches and only want to hook up are the ones women here complain about?

Considering the difference in amount of women and men on dating apps it is obvious there got to be a large group of men that have no success on dating apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5qzjj/who_are_the_guys_that_are_successful_on_dating/

I had to decline because I had other stuff planned but promised to get back to him later.

A couple of weeks later I asked him to play golf with me and he was like sure. We played golf for an hour and so and then he invited me to his friends place to meet his friends. They were friendly.

I had fun etc and time went by when a week later I asked him to go on a walk with me in the evening, it was like 7 pm. And he was yeah, answered very fast and all. We went on a walk for an hour and just talked, it was flowing so good and never felt stale or awkward.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks and pool. Before I arrived he sent a snap, a selfie of himself with tons of heart emojis. I just thought it was a joke so I didn't think much about it. 

And then two weeks ago he sent me a text telling me to come to a student bar that he works at. I went there and saw him in the bar and we talked a lot and I held him company for a while before I went to a table and talked to some students rest of the night. He texted me and was like ""where did you go?"" And I answered I was at a table with some students.

When the bar was closing and I was going out, Kind of drunk, I saw him, he approached me and put his arm around me and was like go home you're drunk which was funny.

And then the day after, kind of late, it was 11 PM, he texts me again telling me to come to the bar again. I was sleeping so didn't see the text until the morning after so I couldn't come.

58,q5sae9,1633945434,Struggles with dating,"Just as a background, I'm 19 and a gay guy. 

I am just completely lost, annoyed and sad at this point. I had gotten off dating apps last year after a pretty bad experience with a guy and felt like I was ready to get back on the apps a few weeks ago. I downloaded all the apps and for a bit it was the usual crap, with dry convos, people not responding, harassment by people you aren't interested in etc. This one guy did catch my eye though and his name let's say is Andrew. We began talking back and forth and it became apparent that we both had very similar personalities and senses of humour. I am a very sarcastic guy and I joke around a ton so for him to have a similar sense of humour and get my jokes was a big plus. Anyway, things go well for a bit and he asks for my phone number and I excitingly give it to him. We decide to talk a lot more and we go from there.

 Just to mention, we are both quite busy with our jobs, but we still managed to find time throughout the days to either check in with each other by message or even call. Anyway for the next two weeks it was going great. We talked quite frequently whenever we could and we even called from time to time. Through talking with him, not only did we have similar humour and personalities but we had very similar morals and we talked about ghosting, being a good person etc and we had very similar views about that. So we both initiate and talk back throughout the weeks, each checking in on each other and asking each other how we are. We even had a bit of a sexual moment(which he mainly initiated and I was fine with). We set up a date for the Sunday on the 2nd week of us matching on the app. The time comes around and I'm super excited. Andrew seems pretty excited too and I even mentioned if I could sleep over and he seemed cool with it so I was just over the moon. I really trusted him and for once I thought this could go somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the date comes up and I'm super nervous meeting him like most people would be meeting someone for the first time. I'm a bit awkward initially but I soon warm up to him and we're just enjoying our time. He did mention that he didn't really let guys come over to his place on the first date. I was a bit embarrassed about it and wondered why he didn't just let me know but hey I understood it. Anyway, since we went to the shops for our date, after we were done we go to his car and we have a very passionate and great make out session. I had forgotten how good it was to kiss a guy haha. Afterwards, I kinda just lay in his lap and we just stare into each other while talking about how the date went well and how good of a connection we both had. I went home afterwards very happy with the outcome and excited for the future date we had planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after the date he started not to reply back to my messages. I was like that's okay, its only been a day or two I'll wait a bit. I started to just double text him a bit if he didn't reply just cause I assumed he might've been busy. He still replied back willingly but the convos started being a bit dry and they'd end pretty quickly. This started being the entire theme of the week and I started getting a bit worried. I was mainly initiating the conversation and was double texting him to keep the convo alive. I offered to call him one night and he seemed really excited and was down. I was super happy but he ended up not following through with it. He apologised the next morning say he fell asleep but I still was a bit sad. I double check with him if we are still down for our date next weekend and he says ""yea sure"" and that's it. I asked if he wanted to call if he wasn't busy and I got no response. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's sorta where I'm at atm. I'm honestly done with initiating the convos cause I hate double texting people cause it makes me feel so insecure and needy. I'm just really annoyed at this point because we had such a great connection and now it's just sorta fizzled out. It went from him being super interested to me having to string out a conversation only for him to just not respond. I am sad if he doesn't like me anymore but I'm just more mad that he's not being straight up and honest with me after he went on about how he wanted us to be honest with each other about how we are feeling at the current moment instead of ghosting the person. Even if he's busy with work, a simple ""sorry I won't be able to respond much today I'm busy"" would be more than efficient instead of just not responding.

I always say to myself I'm gonna leave her but never find the courage to actually break up with her..dont matter how much I try.  I guess Because I'm scared of  being alone like how I been all my life.  It really holding me from progressing in my life. And I truly hate it.

It came to a conclusion I'm valuing so much of my time into a girl that dont really value mines. And it very much hurt my feeling. Constantly being left on delivery by her upon hours, upon hours even though I she's is on. Sometime up to a full day. Lack of communication  and such,  view all my snapchat stories while ignore my my messages, her snapchat increases while I'm  being ignored.    Basically a toxic one sided relationship  lol. You might ask me why I'm still with someone that don't care about the relationship well.

Its Because I don't wanna feel alone, even the little affection I do get from her brightness up my day. Trust me, not once, but 3 times I tried to have a talk with her about the lacking,  always being distance situation and her last reply was ""Her anxiety and depression"" but in my opinion even that shouldn't stop you for taking 10 seconds out of your day to response to a message if you been active all day on snapchat. 

But I honestly don't understand her? Claims thats she's loves me very much, calls me baby and such, just for her to ghost me like that for hours. And like I idiot I fall for it always. Dont know if she's serious or actually mean it's. 

I apologize for posting this again. But I lack confidence,  self esteemed and insecure. And I come her to vent alot.

64,q5t26s,1633948684,"What did you realise about someone you thought was a good match for you, but left because you ""needed to work on yourself""?","Wasn't able to post this on r/askwomen so just posting here. I‚Äôm a guy (24M) that has been dumped by 2 girls for a very similar reason. They both had been emotionally abused by their past partners and was initially very infatuated with me due to my kinder, gentle personality, looks and common interests,  telling me how lucky they are to have me in their life, before later going cold and telling me... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still overcoming my past/right person wrong time/you‚Äôre the loveliest sweetest person ever‚Äù etc.

I know this generally just means they‚Äôre just not interested, and I feel that‚Äôs likely the case with the first girl I dated. The second one was kinda weird though, they told me ‚ÄúI know how cliche this sounds but it‚Äôs genuinely not you, it‚Äôs me, some bad stuff happened to me a few weeks ago, someone meant to be my friend made me do things I didn‚Äôt wanna do‚Äù (someone may have raped her?) Either way both girls ended up on Tinder pretty much a week after telling me that.

Now I know there's a multitude of possible reasons this may happen and I'm not attempting to look for a specific answer. But I feel that emotional unavailability has been very poorly explained to me. I‚Äôm just genuinely curious: if you were seeing a guy, and you felt you were a good match but went cold and left him because you needed to work on yourself/get over past relationships, did you eventually realise you left him because you just weren‚Äôt attracted to him enough? Do you think reasons like ‚Äúright person wrong time‚Äù, as honest as it may seem to the girl, is more of an unconscious way of saying I‚Äôm not attracted enough? Or are there genuine, non-attraction related reasons things like this can happen? 

After my first gf left, I fell into a trap of seeing all this dumb alpha male dating advice that ‚Äúshe left you cause you‚Äôre low status, boring and effeminate, she wouldn't have left you if you were confident‚Äù and all that crap, and I believed for a while if I was some more bad-boy, popular, high status guy (as opposed to my shy, sensitive, INFP type personality) then they would have stuck around. Though I think that advice is pretty stupid now I guess it is rooted in some general truths about attraction. I just wanna get a variety of perspectives on this whole thing with attraction and timing and stuff so I don't go down any more rabbit holes with dating. Also I don‚Äôt wanna end up spreading the wrong messages to other guys that might be going through the same thing. 

All I know is that I need to work on having a satisfying personal life, having better inner confidence and going for girls that are available but take it slower to actually gauge long term chemistry.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5t26s/what_did_you_realise_about_someone_you_thought/

I am usually pretty outgoing, and all my friends would probably describe me as a social butterfly, energetic, and an extrovert. Internally though I feel like I am a bit introverted, shy, and a little insecure.

So this weekend I was at a coffee shop, Comicon, and an open bar invite-only party. All great places to meet people. In all three instances I found myself starting a conversation and giggling with a lady, however after a few moments it kinda sizzled out. I feel myself a bit embarrassed to continue the conversation. It's not so much a loss of topics, but more about being embarrassed or shy to ask something cliche like ""what do you do"" or ""do you come here often"". I think I just feel embarrassed to ask those questions as it kinda ""shows"" my interest in the other person. I think I'm a little afraid as coming off as stupid, giving someone unwanted attention, or giving the other person an awkward moment to talk about later with their friends. I know it's a super toxic way and defeatist of thinking, and I'm not really sure how it happened.

70,q5twz2,1633952114,How to proceed when she thinks we should be friends?,"TLDR: have hung out with this girl a few times during lockdown. She has consistently showed signs of interest in me. We kissed once but never had sex. We got on really well so I asked her a drink at the end of lockdown but she declined and said she assumed that we are just friends. I‚Äôm surprised/confused with her decision and still attracted to her and would like to salvage something. How should I proceed?

From the get-go, this girl (22F) and I (22M) got on really well. I sensed strong interest from her. She followed me on Instagram. We had some good chats on Instagram. We saw each other out a couple times. She expressed signals she was sexually interested. I stupidly didn‚Äôt make a move. Unfortunately, we went into a 3month covid lockdown. Throughout lockdown, we flirtatiously messaged each other. Towards end of lockdown, I asked her for a walk and it went really well. 

The following night we were both drinking so she came over for a bit of a party and we kissed. After we kissed, she strangely said she really likes hanging out with me but was worried kissing would ruin everything. I asked if she was friendzoning me and she said no. We went back to her place but were both very drunk so we went to sleep. The next morning, she was indicating she wanted to have sex. Unfortunately, I felt too hungover/anxious to have sex. Even though I told her, I sensed she was a bit confused/disappointed.

That night she asked me to come back to her house as she was anxious from hangover. I was feeling better but unfortunately she was feeling the same as I was in the morning and wasn‚Äôt displaying the same sexual signals as she was before. We just hung out and I didn‚Äôt stay over. I was frustrated I hadn‚Äôt slept with her but happy with how well we were getting on. Over the next week, we went to the park for a drink and to the beach another day. 

I messaged if she wanted to ‚Äògo out for a drink when lockdown lifts next week?‚Äô To my surprise, she said ‚ÄòI think it'd be inappropriate to go on a date as we've discussed haha‚Äô, 'unless it's as friends'. We never discussed this - she only previously told me a story about kissing a close friend which ruined their friendship. But, as we agreed at the time, our situation was different as we weren't close friends. When asked why she didn't want to go on a date she thought by telling me that story she indicated that we should be friends and thought I was on same page. I‚Äôm not sure if she is being dishonest. She was surprised I was confused so we spoke on the phone at length. 

I played it cool and said I hadn‚Äôt categorised us yet and was just going with the flow. She explained she didn't want to ruin our friendship and was actively not looking for a boyfriend as she‚Äôs had 2 bad breakups and wants to focus on herself. She really wants to continue hanging out. To her surprise, I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to. I didn‚Äôt want her to think I have feelings and was disappointed so I kept the convo relaxed. However, she could tell I was a bit annoyed which made her anxious. 

She showed signs of sexual interest almost every time I saw her. Maybe it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt take my opportunities and she assumed I was uninterested. When she was drunk (few nights after we kissed) she said I seemed uninterested in her and she couldn‚Äôt get a read on me. From my perspective, even though I may not've capitalised on opportunities to be more intimate, by kissing, hanging out and just from how I spoke I thought I was expressing interest. 

It‚Äôs been a week, I‚Äôve seen her once in a group and we just had small talk. She messaged me a couple times about random stuff ‚Äì I felt like she was trying to find an excuse to message me. I still have feelings/attracted to her and would like to salvage something. I also will continue to see her socially which I‚Äôm worried about. 

I have a constant urge to contact her and hang out. But I‚Äôm thinking this is not a good idea.

74,q5ub77,1633953632,Dating troubles and handling rejection.,"I am a 21 year old male studying at a state university.

I've always been a bit shy and introverted. I have a few good friends, but honestly it's been a while since I've really tried to talk to anyone new. I've never been in a relationship despite a efforts at doing so in the past. It's something that has started to bother me more as time as went on.

Since we're back in person this semester, I decided I'd try my hand at dating again. People are eager to talk to each other face-to-face again so I thought it might be easier than before. 

I met a girl who was in most of my classes who I thought was pretty cute. I started trying to talk to her a bit between classes here and there. Normally, I find it hard to just start conversations with people, but I honestly found her very approachable/easy to talk to. We mostly just talked about school stuff (engineering is hard ok), but I at least got the impression that she didn't mind talking to me. 

After a couple of weeks, I worked up the courage to ask for her number. And I got it. Still, I tried to temper my expectations. She was a nice enough person that there was probably no way she would have said no to my face. But she at least didn't seem hesitant or reluctant in anyway.

On the coming weekend, I decided to text her (it had been a couple of days). 

I asked her how her weekend was going over text and we had a brief conversation before I invited her to study with me at the library for an upcoming exam. Maybe this was stupid in hindsight, but I thought it was a reasonable and not particularly committal request. After all, worst that could happens is I go alone and just study like I intended to anyway.

She says that she would see how she felt and would let me know the next day. I kind of suspected that she was just too nice to straight up say ""no"", but somehow I was still surprised to hear a maybe. 

The next day I spend a few hours studying alone in the library and leave feeling a little disappointed. In a lot of ways, that's what I should have expected, but it still didn't feel great. 

For all I know, she was genuinely really busy or just preferred to study alone (it's a pretty serious exam coming up). But deep down, I think I might just be deluding myself. She would have texted \*something\* if that were the case. Maybe she didn't initially realize I was interested in her when she gave me her number and I texted her. She was just being polite to a classmate. 

Now it's early Monday morning and I slept terribly. I think it's set in overnight that she's almost certainly not interested in me. I woke up feeling nothing but a dull ache. You know that feeling after you bomb a test and you wake up the next morning still feeling bad about it? It reminds me of that.

It's going to be a little weird this morning since I'll be seeing her again in class (we sit next to each other), but I really don't think I should bring it up again. If I'm right that she's not interested, there's no point in bringing it up. If she had some other reason, she'll probably tell me herself. So at this point, there's nothing for me to do except get over it. 

Honestly I would have preferred it if she just said ""hey, I don't like you"" or something more direct. I feel like then it would be more obvious to me that I should just leave this person alone. But instead I got my hopes up despite my best efforts to prevent it. 

It just hurts a lot more than I expected. I haven't even known this girl that long, why does it feel this way? I don't understand how I can know that I'm being ridiculous about this, but it still feels so viscerally awful.

It's getting to a point where I'm just asking myself ""Is there something wrong with me?"" I don't think I'm a particularly bad-looking guy. I don't think I'm a terrible person to have a conversation with either.  It's not so hard to brush off one or two rejections as just flukes.

83,q5v278,1633956406,"When someone says ""I'm not ready for a relationship"", do the mean it usually?","So I'm just curious, this isn't for me (22f) but for my friend (21m). 

My friend has had two relationships end with the girl telling him something along the lines of ""I'm just not ready for a relationship at this time.""

Recently, he had a girl he was talking to for about a year and they started dating. Mind you I'm not insanely close to this friend so I don't know the whole timeline. But it doesn't seem like they were dating for long for what I'm aware of? But were friends for a while supposedly.

For me the ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" is a confusing statement to leave on. As when I've broken up with someone, I've tried to make it clear what the reason was.

But the fact he has had multiple girls tell him this, is this a thing that girls do to let someone down easy?

86,q5v3qe,1633956562,What should I do about my ex?,"I m(23) just got cheated on. Everything was going great with our relationship until I found out she had been sexting her ex for the past three weeks behind my back. Since the break up we talked about the whole situation and haven‚Äôt talked since.

She said she did it because after she broke up with her toxic ex she needed a year to get her head on straight. But we ended up dating three months after the breakup instead. Not because of me, but because she fell in love to hard too fast. The relationship was amazing. We told eachother things we had never told anyone, we did everything together, and she was honestly my best friend.

She said she did it cause she was afraid I‚Äôd lose interest in her because I had my life together and she didn‚Äôt. But not for lack of trying. So she wanted me to hate her so the breakup would be easier for me and she could take her year to figure herself out. She wants to be friends later down the road but understands if I never talk to her again. I don‚Äôt know what to believe but it felt like she was trying to get her life together and her cheating still feels like something she would never do.

I blocked her on everything except text in case I make a decision to keep her in my life. But I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I already was a one year older than the rest of my schoolmates because my parents liked to baby me and thought I was too young for kindergarden and let me do first year of kindergarden twice. Even though my teacher said I am smart and not needed. Last year I graduated college but thanks to corona was not able to find a job for like 8 months. Finally got a job but it is at a government service desk so I don't really feel like I have much status. Also I am now 23, almost 24 and feel like an idiot. I have a master in law and a job like that. I don't know what I want anymore. 

Describing my job: government job in urban planning (because I like environmental law I thought) and I answer questions from civilians and I also do research. So I also work in the back office. 

I have been told I am pretty, so it is not about the way I look I am insecure about. It is about my job. The fact that I have a master degree in law makes it double ouch because people have higher expectations then. If I just had a degree in art or something it would have been better. I just keep feeling like I should wait till I have my career together until I can date. Because guys keep asking for it and I feel insecure about it.

90,q5vv4u,1633958946,He stopped texting after asking me out for the second time,"Last week I finally went out on a date with man I met on Tinder. We texted for 2 months before our date and got quite close. I think we were both nervous during our date and he even tried to kiss me at the end. But... It just didn't feel right at that moment. I liked him in general, but kissing just wasn't the right thing to do then.

He texted me every day after our date. He told he fell a ill, had a fever and didn't feel very well, but nevertheless he was ready to ask me out again. And said he would put on a mask just in case. I said no. But only because I don't want a person I like to go somewhere with me if they feel sick. I can wait.

He said ok and... Disappeared. I feel like I really disappointed him during our first date but he was too polite to tell me about it. But why he wanted to kiss me then... I don't even know what to think. And whether I should reach out to him or not. What if he just found someone better than me and lost his interest.

92,q5vxs6,1633959164,She led me further and further into her dark basement at the end of our date. Don't do this if you don't want to weird your date out lol,"I matched with a woman off Tinder on Friday night, and we had a phone call on Saturday evening. After spending a bit of time talking, we both realized we each had no plans, so maybe we should hang out (no sex expectation whatsoever -- just conversation and hanging out.) I get to her house, and when I walk in, the first thing I immediately observe is how her place smells densely of smoke covered up with air freshener. She never smoked while I was there, but I guess I never thought to even ask prior to meeting. For me, that was the dealbreaker, but I still went through with enjoying the company.

The turning point of this story comes at the end, though. I said it was late and I should get going, and she said she should use the bathroom before I did so, and when she came back, she said she wanted to show me the rest of her house. She tours all the basics, but then she said she wanted to show me her basement, at which point, I got a little hesitant because you can't help but think about all the stories about dates gone wrong where people are lured into basements and then down there, they're jumped or something. I didn't feel like this woman -- who works as a program director for special needs people -- would be wanting to do harm, but you just never know.

I hesitantly go down, and she shows me one room, but then at that point, it was like there was room after room around each corner growing darker and darker that she wanted me to walk with her through. In reality, she just wanted to show me how she had thousands of books down there, but I was honestly feeling skittish at that point, and I guess it must have shown in the way I left, because she called me when I got home to ask if she had scared me, and I half-joked about how I grew anxious about when she led me down to the basement. She was kind of offended that I'd think she'd murder me, but can you really blame anyone this day in age? We both agreed the meetup didn't really result in romantic chemistry, but she offered to continue being friends and hang out again (not that I'm expecting to.)

Moral of the story: If you're going to ask someone to come over, maybe don't put them in situations where they might think the worst is about to happen. From my end, the only reason I felt comfortable going over is because our phone call seemed normal, she was older than me, her info and career checked out on Google, and I didn't have reason to believe I was meeting anyone shady.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5vxs6/she_led_me_further_and_further_into_her_dark/

96,q5w7rg,1633960007,I'm not sure if she's still interested,"I had my first date with a girl (28) from Hinge almost 2 weeks ago, on a Wednesday night. It went well and we had a great conversation (for a little over 2 hours). At the end, after she walked with me to the subway station, she asked for a hug. 40 minutes later, around the time when I came back home, she sent me a message on the app thanking me for coming to her neighborhood and saying she had a good time. It looked good for a second date, so I told her I had a good time too and that I'd like to do it again soon. She said that she would like to.

She was out of town the following weekend (Oct 2-3), so I wanted to plan something for last week (Oct 4-8). On Monday, she told me she probably could do it Wednesday or Thursday, but that she would confirm Tuesday. Tuesday comes and she tells me that Wednesday/Thursday wouldn't be ideal (I think it's because she had to leave work late), but that she could either Friday night if her dinner does not take place, or Sunday end-of-afternoon. I tell her I can't on Sunday (she knows I have my hockey league), but Friday after work would be doable. On Friday at around noon, she tells me that her dinner won't take place, but that she is very tired and that we should find another time.

At this point, I start to think something doesn't smell good. She started working 6 days/week recently, but at the same time, I know that when a girl wants to see you, she will try her best. Now, it looks to me like she either does not want the 2nd date to take place or that I am a backup plan, at best. Or maybe I am just making scenarios in my head? I told her that I had other plans anyway for the evening and I wished her a good rest. She thanked me, I gave her message a like and didn't plan to write back.

But Saturday, she wrote me back, asking me if I had fun plans for the weekend, so the conversation resumed, but I tried to keep my messages shorter and not asking as many questions back if any. She wished me a good game yesterday and this morning, she asked me if we had won. I still feel like there is a level of interest on her part, but she hasn't brought the second date topic back on the table yet. Her messages throughout the week were not short and seemed engaged and she gave a like to most of my messages. She has asked for a rain check before our first date (and we still had our first date), so I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Should I try one last time to plan a second date this week or is the ball in her court? I want this date to take place, but I don't want to lose my time and I don't want to be the guy that keeps asking for a date if she's not interested. If I should be the one to ask her for a second date, should I keep the conversation going and in a ""cool"" way, like ""Hey, I'm going to do X on this day, come if you want"" or should I do it in a more ""serious"" manner, like ""Hey, is this conversation leading to a second date at some point? I get the vibe that you're not that interested and I didn't create a Hinge account to have a texting buddy""?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5w7rg/im_not_sure_if_shes_still_interested/

98,q5wchk,1633960405,I need advice,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting and I need some advice/help. I'm not sure how to explain this so that way anyone who reads this would understand and without giving out too much info but I'll give it a shot. I'll try to keep this short but there's a person I'm curious about and she works at a restaurant I go to every week (I say I'm curious because I literally know nothing about her and she's always wearing a mask for obvious reasons).

Back story.
She used to work at a different restaurant I used to go frequently as well but she left and the restaurant is no longer opened on the day I usually go. Fast forward a few weeks later, the current restaurant she works at also turns out to be a place I go to every week as well even before she started working there (yes, I order takeout almost everyday because my hours at work are long and I get too lazy to cook most days). I was curious about her before but thought I'd never see her again after she left her previous job but now I'm even more curious after seeing her at this place too. She's given me signs before and I absolutely regret not doing anything when she was at the old restaurant because it would usually just be her at the front counter and the kitchen staff in the back but I'm an over thinker and suffer from anxiety so I didn't do anything. She's given me signs even now but the situation got worse at this place she works at now because this place is much bigger and  has about 6 to 8 people working up-front (2 to 3 of them working at the front counter and 4 to 5 people waiting tables and this doesn't include people working in the back kitchen). She seems really close to them all as well so it really doesn't help my situation at all. She definitely wanted my attention when she first started working there and I engaged the conversation with her first but once I did that, everyone who works there stopped and basically huddled around us at that moment and for obvious reasons, I felt really uncomfortable. As I was leaving I can hear her explain to them how we kinda know each other and let me tell you, that walk to the front door felt very long even though it takes about 15 seconds to get too. Now everyone's pretty much watching every time I walk in. 
I should also mention that the name they know me by isn't my name, it's my brother's name and here's why that is. They record the name and number in their system and my brother used to do all the calling before so that's the name and number that's saved. So they greet me with his name and not my own and didn't bother me until now lol. Yes, I know. It's complicated (to me anyways). 

So finally the questions. How do I approach someone (while suffering from anxiety) who is always surrounded by people who are always listening and while being really close? I do make the order over the phone and she occasionally picks up so if there's an opportunity there, please share but again, if they stare now when I haven't done anything, how awkward would it be if I did say something over the phone? And how do I give her my actual name and number? Lol

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and if you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! If there's any questions feel free to ask I'll try to answer as soon as possible. Thanks again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5wchk/i_need_advice/
