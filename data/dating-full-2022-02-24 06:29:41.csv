_______________________________________________________________________

For context, I (25M) dating a girl (24F), (let's call her S )for 2 months. It's has been a little more than 3 years since I last dated anyone. I met S 2 months ago and at that time I was not looking for anyone to date or start any kind of relationship with.

But on the day we met, we met via a mutual friend and a group of us went to a night club. To be honest, I didn't notice her until she asked me to order drinks for her like ""Let's order this drink for the 2 of us"". I really liked how confidently she told me that.

After that, I actually didn't ask her number or anything, eventhough she told me that she had a great time with me. I actually was confused about what just happened, at that time. 

But a few days later, I saw her being tagged on our mutual friend's Instagram and I followed her on insta and asked her number. Then, in a week I asked her out and we eventually started seeing each other.

After our first date, she got corona and had to leave town, as she lives here with her friends, who all works. So, went home to take rest. 

She eventually got better, came back and we met that same weekend when she returned. That date was god damn magical, things in ways I didn't even imagine that it would go like that.

We had out first kiss, I became a good friend with her roommate and I basically stayed in their place over the night and it was very fun. 

Lately, I have come to realise I just happen to feel soo happy to see her and meet just. Both of us just try to extend our dates by randomly pointing at places we see on our way back and just visit there to extend our dates. After a bad break-up 3 years ago, I never actually liked any other girl like the way, I like S. I guess I never really knew for myself that I moved on until I met S and we started hitting it off. 

Yesterday, I was confused on what is going on with my dating phase and asked reddit on how to say that I have developed feelings for S, which I obviously have developed. 

She just makes me happy and special. I am happy that I am experiencing something like this when I thought about 3 years ago that I wouldn't have this again. I want to tell S all this. But obviously I am not going to overwhelm her with everything and especially right now.

I have decided to date her for some more time, learn more about her and tell her how I feel in about 2 dates or so.

We’ve seen each-other probably about 6 or 7 times since we’ve started talking and I’ve spent the night at his place all but the first date. First two dates we went out and did stuff, after that we got we got into the groove of me coming over after either of us is off work and just binge watching Netflix.

For context, the first two dates where we didn’t just watch tv at his place I felt were very natural and comfortable for both of us. I felt like we were learning a lot about one another and not only that it just felt enriching, like good company that is enjoyed regardless of what you’re doing or where you are because it’s some good quality time. I thought I could possibly see things progressing with him and was excited to see him. In those two dates we both opened up a lot, both contributing to the convo and were honest about ourselves and the things that affect us. We both asked a lot of questions and showed genuine interest in each-other lives; past, present, and future.

So he lives alone and we both don't have very similar days off from work and I understand if you want to be with someone you'll appreciate any time together but when I go over he immediately turns the TV on. We typically hang out in the living room (only other room is the bedroom)

I just feel like we could still either go somewhere in the evening and then come back and watch a show or if its late we could hang out and spend quality time together just talking and doing an activity or cuddling with the tv off and enjoying a conversation. 

I feel like I'm sounding unreasonable and like I'm majorly overthinking this but the past few times I've gone over I've had moments where I'm sitting there questioning why I'm even there…were both just staring at the screen, barely even cuddling, when one movie ends we immediately turn the next one on, then we get sleepy, head to his bed, fall asleep asap.

I feel like I'm so used to going out and seeing new places or trying new things or doing things at home that bring me and my loved ones together…i just don't know if we share the same interests or have the same needs in a relationship anymore.

For even more context, I already don't watch tv at home so when I get back home I feel so unfulfilled knowing I could have just avoided the entire hang out and spent time on my own because we didn't even have the chance to connect or talk to one another.

I also want to add that he has made some sweet gestures and shown he is interested in us but I’m afraid our chemistry has lost its momentum. Maybe he’s lonely and enjoys some company? Maybe he doesn’t enjoy going unfamiliar places? Or maybe he’s just habituated to those ways and doesn’t realize it’s not the foundation of a relationship…? 

Side-note: we have not had sex, nor do we do other stuff (too long to explain)

So I'm a guy (21) with an anxious attachment style. At the beginning of the dating, talking stage and dates 1 and 2, girls see me as a masculine guy. I've learned a lot about female nature and I act accordingly. I act interested, but not too much. And that works amazing. I get girls interested in me and going on first dates easily.

Then what happens, after 2 dates let's say, I get somewhat attached and I subconsciously show needy behavior to girls and reject them with that. I start acting completely opposite than in the beginning. In the talking stage, I could care less if they reject me or flake on me. But after a few dates, I become super invested in them, more than I should be. I wouldn't say I start simping, but I lose my masculine frame after 2 dates and become more invested and interested in girls than they are into me. That kills the attraction every time. With some girls I get to 5-6 dates max, with some they lose attraction at dates 2-3 usually.

I completely understand what is the problem, it's caused by my anxious attachment style which leads to losing my masculine frame when I get attached.

Evolutionary speaking, a mans role is to spread his Genes right? Of course, that probably ain't gonna happen for me so I'm pretty much a failure of a man. It's extremely depressing. Why does forming relationships with the opposite sex have to be such a pivotal part of life? Life is just trolling us at this point.

Past few days i've been throwing my two cents around here and there across various dating subs and thought it's time for a post of my own which flies off the back of recent experience.

Okay, so this post will be about trying to give some advice to guys (or girls) messaging other people ""out of the blue"" and maintaining that initial momentum.

Why this? Since piping up on Reddit i've had a fair few messages (naming no names) some lovely ones, and some...well, let's just say they were guys \*trying\* to engage in some sort of conversation or open up one, and it didn't go too well.

So let the advice commence! I'll use numbered points because everyone knows you mean business if you use them.

**1) Accept some Basic Limitations**

What I mean by this is accept some things you CANNOT influence or change. If the person you are messaging isn't in the mood, or receptive to your message, that doesn't necessarily mean YOU did anything wrong, it could just be the wrong time/place/person. You have to accept this. You cannot always ""win"". There is no way to guarantee replies every time. You must accept the potential of rejection and take from it what you can.

**2) Make it Clear Why You're Here**

Vagueness is the young brother to Aimlessness in the family of First Impressions Sins. When you message someone, give \*some\* indication of what you want. I don't mean ""hi I wanna wife you"", calm down there. I mean ""state your business"" as it were. A simple ""hi"" gives me no indication what you want. Do you want advice? A casual chat? Are you trying to hit on me? Send me a dickpic? WHAT DO YOU WANT? If the first impression someone sets for me is that they're not really sure what they're doing (or lack the confidence or manners to state it) then there's a good chance I won't reply. 

Bad: **""Hi"" ""Hello"" ""How are you?""**

Good: ""**Hi/Hello/How are you?""** PLUS ""**I was wondering if you've like to have a chat sometime? Maybe get to know eachother?""/""I wanted to ask you some questions if you have time and that's okay?""/""I just wanted to say X""**

The second set of responses gives me a clear idea of what you want, and even if i'm not interested, i'm way more likely to reply as to why that is, because I can give a specific indication of why. Also it shows you have courtesy, so i'll give some back.

Sorry. I don't consider saying doing the equivalent of sending a random person a note saying HELLO to be expressing courtesy.

**3) If you want them IntoYou, do not Interview**

Okay, so a lot of guys in my experience enjoy asking questions. Yay! Questions are cool, they help us find out more about stuff and so on, good times.

However a question's power is down to how and what is asked.

Try to aim for OPEN QUESTIONs that invite responses beyond a single word or phrase. If you increase the kind of depth an answer requires, you invite more out of the person and they can always flip some of it back on you. If you are going to use ""single phrase"" questions, follow them up with a more analytical question that extends upon it:

Guy: ""How are you?""

Me: ""I'm well, ta for asking, and you?""

Guy: ""Yes thanks, anything in particular to blame or just a good all round day in general?""

For example.

This switches up the generic question into some kind of follow up and is asking me to give more. If you just stick to generic questions (How are you/how old are you/where do you live/job) you can exhaust every single one of those questions in less than 30 seconds. No joke. Which is BIZARRE because those topics each can generate way more conversation than 30 seconds worth EACH if only you pitch it the right way.

However, as good as open questions are, stick to questions that can be reasonably answered!

Guy: ""So what do you think the purpose of life is?""

Yeah, I mean I can answer that, but that's a heavy fucking question! It's so big i'm probably going to give a hedged answer to avoid sending you an essay, so it actually doesn't give you the depth you're looking for. It's too complex to be messaged about without qualifications to the question to restrict it. You don't want a question that involves the person giving you their autobiography of mental activity to answer, you want questions that each give a piece of meaningful insight, and you add them all together. 

Think of it like how you eat breakfast, then a bit later brunch, then lunch...etc. You do them when it is time for them, and over the course of the day, you feel satisfied! If you tried to eat every meal at 9AM to ""set you up for the day"" you'd feel bloated, probably sick - it's too much, despite the fact it may technically be possible to do it.

People need room to digest things! So actually give them room to do so. This means giving spaces between your questions, because they may be articulating one for you. Don't turn it into a ""I ask, you answer"" conversation. Give them room to ask and if they don't, DIRECTLY CALL UPON THEM TO DO IT. This will indicate whether they're really interested in the conversation or not. I tell you now, any girl who is interested in you or curious about you will have questions she is prepared to ask.

**4) It Ain't That Deep**

Be VERY careful about how to interpret what other people type. It is all too easy to read into what is simple humour as a flirt, or something meant sarcastically as something mean. Always remember and if in doubt, ask.

I am naturally a quick-talking, deliverer of snappy lines. It's how I roll. It's how I message. Several times i've had guys interpret this as me flirting with them (despite the fact my comments made no reference to my thoughts about them whatsoever). For example a joke I made about my ""actual name"" being hard to pronounce was interpreted as me ""teasing"".

Just no. This comes across as massively cringeworthy projection onto the situation. Don't try and ""make things sexual or flirty"" unless you have more than one single piece of evidence to go on. It just comes across like you're not really listening to us and just trying to push the conversation in a certain direction irrespective of what we say. It's fucking rude honestly.

Just say to yourself ""if my friend said this to me, do I think my friend would want to fuck me?"" if the answer is ""no"", then don't overread what is being written back to you. Don't mistake your own feelings and thoughts for what someone else might think.

If you do misinterpret something, own the mistake quickly and clearly. If they tell you ""I didn't mean it like that"" do not waste time arguing with them to show ""well actually i think you're wrong.."" they're TELLING YOU they didn't mean it like that, so listen. It's not up for debate for you to tell them what they actually meant. Take the smallest of Ls, apologise and move on in the conversation.

**5) Read the Room**

Follow the conversation properly. Conversation should flow like a freshly poured jug of Pimms. By this I mean the top of the jug will always be poured first, and the bottom last. Such is the flow. it's coherent and logical. You do not have the bottom of the jug randomly getting poured first, right?

So it goes in conversation, follow what is being talked about. Are we talking about initial ""getting to know you"" still? Music? A funny reddit thread? Are we nearly done? Is this an alright moment to randomly introduce another conversation point? Is it a natural conversation point to add? These are all questions you need to be thinking.

This is important, it shows me many things:

\- You can follow our conversation

\- You're ""listening"" to me

\- We're ""on a similar"" wavelength

All very good things.

If you randomly decide to throw me photos of you when nothing in the conversation indicated I wanted you to do that or was wondering about your appearance, or you randomly redirect the conversation towards kinks, or anything else that is completely unreleated. I will see that as a combination of rude/bizarre. 

It tells me you're not terribly interested in the conversation ""we're"" having and you want to push the conversation YOU want to have, but without the good manners to actually try to redirect it naturally with me on board as a participant (by talking first and leading up to it).

Not a good look. I also makes a guy seem quite impatient. Seriously fella, if you ain't got time to chat to me for 15 minutes before you wanna send a photo, I ain't got time to sit in a coffee house with either. Just how it is.

**6) Don't Aim to be the GOAT of Acronym use.**

Overusing acronyms for basic communications is annoying, to me at least.

What's more it masks your potential character. I know they save time, but as said above, if you can't spare 5 seconds, i ain't got time for a date with you.

So whilst occasional use is probably appropriate, seriously consider whether every sentence really needs to end with ""lol"". If you're using lol to a similar degree to which you use full stops, it just comes across as a bit thoughtless and shallow.

At the very least use a different acronym or, to be a bit more daring, type out the laughter as in ""hehe"" or whatnot. It sure as heck beats reading six lines of text each ending in ""lol"". 

Also acronym use robs use of the opportunity to see a person's vocabulary and way with robs on occasion, an important well to let your quirks and whimsies be seen in conversation! Wordplay is a big deal.

**7) Don't Pretend This is Easy**

It ain't, and that's kinda fake. It's perfectly fine (and kind of charming) for a guy to completely own up to little blunders they make in conversation or to do anything, say anything that indicates they're not trying to pass themselves off as this kind of ""cool customer, totally aloof"". If that's how you naturally vibe, go for it. If you're a bit chattier and word-salad-like, then that's your speed, and own it! Fuck games. Fuck anyone who tries to tell you games are worth playing. If you want to reply to a girl, do it. Fuck any ""I need to wait X"" stuff.

**8) Maintain Perspective**

This is you messaging someone, it's a text chat. It is not a violin-ridden love story of disney fabrication, and as such, messages declaring ""gushing throes of text of admiration and desire for the other"" off the back of a few tidbits of info you have seen of them, is way too much. I've been very square with guys on this when they've been like ""I get the sense i'd have strong feelings for you"" - on the back of what? A few reddit posts? Please. It doesn't make you sound like a Romeo so much as Oh-my-days-what? It isn't smooth, and there is such a thing as being TOO INTENSE. We don't want gamepalyers and dickheads in our inbox playing games, but similarly a guy posting paragraph after paragraph after paragraph is misunderstanding the medium. We're not writing fucking pen pal letters here my friend, this is meant to be a form of instant messaging! Kinda kill that vibe if i'm taking 5 minutes to reply each time you know?

&amp;#x200B;

There are probably others, but this is all I can think of now, but if anyone wants to give some examples of ""messages thrown, that didn't work!"" in the comments, I'll be happy to advise how I would have tweaked things or whatnot.

The most important point is number 1, without exception. You won't always get it even if you do it right. It's fine. Doesn't mean you suck or failed. Anyone who tries to tell you you can succeed in 100% of cases when dealing with the thoughts and feelings of other people is a liar and probably has an overpriced book to sell you.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161281,public,self,Momentum in Messaging,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t09pir/momentum_in_messaging/,no_ads,0,,,,

I went up and talked to her for about 30 minutes, got her friend a water, got her number, and went home. A week later on a Friday night I texted her and she was out of town. 

On Superbowl Sunday I texted her again and she was back in town, but I ran into her at my favorite bar anyway that night. We got to talking and drinking, hit it off, and set a place and time to go on a date Wednesday night. We texted the next two days, some casual talk and some pretty flirtatious conversation as well. We both let each other know we were looking forward to the date and into each other. 

Wednesday night I picked her up and we went to a hibachi steakhouse but there was a decent wait (no reservations allowed) so we went and got Mexican and margs. We talked about life, interests, and even some deeper psychology stuff. Was not a dull or awkward moment, and conversation was mutual. So much eye contact, and smiling, and laughing. She had only moved into town 6 months ago, and we had both got out of 3 year relationships in September. We vibed very well. We went bowling after at this little arcade bar, and you could tell we liked each other but we were both nervous. When we left, it was 10pm so she thought she should go home because of work in AM. 

Disappointed but understanding, I drove her home. Once there we said goodbye, and she leaned in and I thought she just wanted a hug, but she grabbed my face and kissed me, then asked to see me again the upcoming weekend. When I got home I got a Snapchat saying ""Thank you again for tonight. I had a lot of fun :)"". I was happy but didn't think the date went insanely well as I could tell she was holding something back or was nervous, I don't really know. 

I didn't really talk to her the next two days except maybe one or two texts, and I sent her an indie song I liked and she responded she liked it too. 

I went to my favorite bar Friday night with my one best friend (per usual) and I saw her. I knew she would be busy with her friend Friday, but didn't expect to see her per se. I sent her a text saying ""Don't think I don't see your cute self at the bar"". She responded asking me to say hi, but I saw it late so she had already left. I went to the pool bar with my buddy a little later and she said she just showed up. My other best friend's girlfriend met me and my friend out by this point because he was out of town and she wanted something to do. 

Anyways, I see the girl sitting by a pool table, we go up, and we're just making eye contact and really close to each other the entire time. I saw some of her friends I met the last two times I saw her out, and everyone got along well. We held hands a little and it was a really good time. We settled on going out the next night together for a second date. To let it be known, we both were not drunk, just not sober. 

When we left, my buddy's girlfriend and my other buddy both said how we look like we were already dating and that it was so obvious regarding the sparks and the connection.

The next day I text her around 2pm if she wanted me to pick her up. 5pm comes around and she says her friends family is in town so she can't make it due to prior promises to go out with them when they come into town. I messaged her that I wish she told me sooner as we were supposed to see each other at 7pm, but inquired about rescheduling. She messaged back ""I'm sorry if I seem wishy washy, but I might be moving to Atlanta (4hrs away from me) in a few months so I'm uncertain about starting anything even casual"". I said I understood, and that I want her to be comfortable with me and talk with me about it at some point.

Later on, I went out with one of my other best friends (a girl) and eventually snapchatted the girl I have been talking to. We both said we wanted to see each other but it was pretty late. I was really in my feelings because I actually like this girl a lot, and I felt uncertain about where I stood. Got home and hung out with my friend and just jammed to some punk music and called it a night.

The next day I gave her a call to see if she wanted to talk, and she didn't answer. I left it alone, ran errands and worked out. She texted me around 7pm (this is now Sunday btw) ""Honestly I really enjoyed meeting you and the times we've hung out, but I genuinely don't see this working"". I thought about it for like an hour and sent back a decently lengthy text saying how 'I understand and will go with whatever she wants', that 'I want to be honest as well, I really enjoy when I'm around you and think it's a shame if we don't get to know each other better', and that 'I believe we have mutual feelings'.

I didn't get a response, and now it's Thursday morning. I haven't reached out or anything. I post on my Snapchat story sometimes, e.g. music, whatever I'm doing, the gym, etc. She has viewed them all, I haven't viewed hers. 

She gives me butterflies and I would really like a chance with her.

I am a divorcee with limited experience in dating so I'm looking to get thoughts on what's going on/what I should do. 

So I 29(f) recently got set up with a friend of my cousins 32(m). We start talking and things are going great, we seem to really like each other and set up a date. Yay! 

Guy is really forward talking about buying a house together and how he'll love xyz about me. Tell me he loves me when he's tipsy ect. 

I tell him that I don't really trust all this because I have a history of dudes going really heavy and then freaking out and bailing. He appreciates the honesty. I tell him that I'm really feeling it and am excited for our date. 

Our date get canceled due to weather we kinda talk about setting up next week and continue to chat. He's still being just as forward ect. Ect. 

Friday we talk about travel and places we wanna go, it's a nice exchange. 

Saturday I text him a cute song he's receptive. A couple hours later he texts me a mixed message saying that he's just sharing his thoughts but he doesn't think we'll be able to travel the way he wants (I have a child and a custody schedule to manage). 

I validate that I would enjoy to go with him where I could, would encourage him to go and would limit that, if he could please slow down and I'm not going to seriously conceptualize this when we haven't had a date yet and if we could please meet and go from there. 

He texts back ""fuck it"" and I haven't heard from him snice sat.

I have little understanding of the social etiquette but I am trying to be a decent considerate human being and I have no idea what is and isn't acceptable. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings (where possible) whilst simultaneously increasing my chances of finding a partner for a long term relationship.

So I've had 3 first dates with 3 women in the past week.

Date 1- Didn't enjoy the company of my partner and she felt the same way. We parted amicably and wished each other best of luck. Fine.

Date 2- Had a good time with this person, have since exchanged numbers and been chatting back and forth since. No fixed plans for a second date but presuming because of the phone number exchange and continued chatting that a second date is on the cards (I want some advice first that's why I am posting here). Ultimately would like to see her again though.

Date 3- Felt like I had an amazing time, only planned a short meet but ended up chatting for hours. Probably the best date I've been on. Felt an immediate attraction and there was barely any awkward silences or anything (and I'm not terribly well equipped socially speaking so this was a big deal). I could have spent hours more chatting with this woman. Anyway we parted ways, I dropped her a message on the app asking how she thought it went and she seemed enthusiastic and we have been chatting back and forth since. Second date is already planned for Saturday. I can't wait but trying to contain my enthusiasm a little because I don't want to seem clingy or anything. I noticed that she had updated some of her profile after we met though (not stalking, I just wanted to check something), I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or if that means that she doesn't consider me a good match long term, but if that's the case why would she agree to a second date and give me her number and even suggest some things we can do on Saturday?!?!!? Maybe just trying to keep her options open?

I basically just want some advice being completely new to this space. Should I just arrange a date with both women and take it from there. I feel some guilt in doing this though for some reason, almost like I'm cheating or something like that. Will both women just assume I'm seeing other people anyway? And if so when does it become appropriate to say that I (not going to say we because they might feel different) am going to remove my profiles, or stop dating other women. Or at least express the sentiment that I would be up for doing this.

I honestly feel that if I have a second date that goes well with my 3rd date woman I would feel that I would like to put all my effort into seeing what can happen there, not saying we would enter a relationship immediately of course, but just that I would like to put all my dating energy into that one person rather than trying to arrange things with multiple women. Maybe I'm just old fashioned though on my dating thoughts.

Would I be looked upon unfavourably by the majority for saying such things to a person even if we had only seen each other a couple of times in person. I am very much communication driven and would prefer I just explain my feelings and thought process but I don't want to scare anyone off. Likewise I don't want to squander my chances with one woman because I am scared to go on more dates even though I haven't discussed this with another woman. For instance I could stop dating the woman I met second (even though she seemed super nice) and focus on the woman I met third and she might decide she doesn't feel the same way (or even I could change my opinion on her) and then I missed my chance with the second woman!

I know this is an essay so if you can offer me anything like advice on how to play this situation I would be very appreciative!!!

ive never had someone say this to me or feel this way towards someone. 

it was rocky not gonna lie and i often felt i was walking on eggshells. i never told her though :(. i was just always patient with her due to her past,her being emotionally unavailable and such. 

i still care about her very much, and we might see each other one more time. but im not sure how to prevent this from happening again. 

she said the connection didnt seem there anymore, that i seemed somewhere else, distant, not present, that she wasnt seen or understood…all when i was with her in person. she’d also always ask me what im thinking and if i was anxious which was a little annoying too lol. 

also shes not seeing anyone else in case anyone says she might be. 

anyways when we met she came onto me strong and first but before our first date she says shes emotionally unavailable, bunch of stuff and cant promise a relationship..fast forward she also says  she doesnt believe in marriage etc..

it was all new to me so i was trying to get adjusted and such so maybe thats why? ive also never had sex or anything with someone i wasnt in a “relationship” with. 

did this all make me emotionally unavailable too?

i cant help but feel to blame for all of this and despite all my effort, not truly being able to show her how badly i was falling for her in every single way. 

any and all input is appreciated :). thank you!

I’m mainly speaking to my girls here bc I’ve noticed that men are very quick to leave a woman where she got him fucked up at.

Y’all give your SO many chances at disrespecting you but you know that if it was one of your friends, you would have been cut them off. How do you think you look when your man consistently calls you out of your name and you haven’t put him in his place the very first time he started that shit? You let one thing slide and they’ll start ice skating. What the fuck do you mean by your man has cheated on you and you’re still staying in that relationship?! If a man cheats on me, that’s a straight up ghost from my end. He’ll never see me again.

When it comes to acts of disrespect that he commits the first time, and you don’t see it as valid enough to break up with him immediately, PUT THAT MAN IN HIS PLACE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Let him know that if he was to ever try that shit again, you’re out. This doesn’t count for cheating. If a man cheats, you must leave that relationship immediately with no hesitation. If you don’t live with him and you don’t have any ties to him, straight up ghost. Especially if he doesn’t know that you know about his cheating. You don’t owe him an explanation for why you left. His presence should absolutely repulse you if he’s a cheater.

It hurts when I see women settle for less. Babes, fix how you view yourself. Stop inviting random people to singlehandedly mess up your life. Have boundaries and be extremely quick to leave when he serves you no purpose but is rather draining you. I want better for all my girls this year. Y’all need to do better.

She(F22) and I(M22) met at our job. we started talking on way back to metro after leaving office and during lunch hours.

I didn’t have her number and it felt like a creep to get her number from the company records so i e-mailed her a meme, she replied in text and we got on calls from that day on. 

We clicked immediately and have the same nerdy interests .  I’m sure she likes me (gives me compliments and flirts) but there is one issue . She says says that she will come back to the city after the exam for job .. which will happen at least after 1 year. 

I don’t know what to do , i have read that long distance relationships don’t last very long and i am scared as i feel that basically what i am doing is delaying the pain of breakup( now or in 2-3 months).

I’m not that good looking and it’s extremely difficult to  find a girl who is even half as smart beautiful and self aware as she is, not the mention as ambitious as i am. 

I even don’t know if I’m just a practice guy for her or she really likes me and could lead to something serious. I seriously doubt i am that I’m actually attractive/interesting to her.

To keep things short, we ended up hooking up the same night which she initiated. Now to be fair most girls I meet up with online end up being just hookups or friends with benefits however this girl I was actually interested in getting to know more as I actually enjoyed the conversations we had and she seemed to be fairly interested in me. 

After she left that night convo over text with her ended up being spotty however she agreed to wanting to go out again sometime the next weekend. After that she sorta went ""danny phantom"" on me. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt as she had a rough background and told me a tiny bit of her family issue going on(I know another red flag sorta odd to be open about that stuff day one). 

Valentines day comes around and at 9 at night I get message from her after like 3 or 4 days of radio silence. I ended up telling her that she could call me if she needed someone to talk to or  come to my house if she wanted someone to talk too. Bassically she just hit me up saying she was having a rough time at her house. 

I sorta regretted giving that invitation out but I did because of my past experience with knowing people in those shitty situations. The other part of me wanted to just ignore since she kinda blew off the plans we had and stopped communication with me. Anyways she comes over and that just led to whole lot of confusion for me. I ended up asking the questions being like what happened since you ghosted me she went on to give a short story because of her past experience she thought all that talking to me was just gonna be sex and how she doesn't want to be someone screwbuddy. I told her that I was actually interested in her and not some hookup. Which then led to her asking me that we should go out another time. (That night she was really just using me as a place to stay but i find that sorta odd for anyone to go to a person they barely know especially if you dont want to be involved with them).

Now I agree to hanging out with her again however she went straight back to ghosting me a few days later. So I felt fooled because I was pretty convinced of what she was telling me that night and thought there was just a misunderstanding of intentions.

At the party, we were briefly introduced but afterwards we had some small talk about where we're from locally while playing beer pong together. We didn't talk much but i felt like she had some sort of attraction towards me. Before she left, i asked for her insta which she gave and followed me back shortly after. A day later, I reached out to her, asking about one of her posts where she travelled to some exotic place. We hit it off but even through text, the conversation was short. She responded in short sentences almost every time with almost no enthusiasm. However, i asked her if she wants to grab food sometime and she agreed. I gave her the time and place and she was good with it. In a nutshell, we mainly made plans for the weekend to see each other but haven't really talked about anything else. The date is tomorrow and its been two days since we last texted. I'm thinking about texting her later tonight to confirm tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what do you guys think? Does she sound shy/reserved or is it possible she's not interested? We barely know anything about it each other so in a way, it would make sense why she's not saying much. I don't want to start full blown conversations/interviews over text to spoil the genuine interactions in person.

I guess for one of them, I don’t think we’re compatible so that’s not too much of an issue but for the other 3 girls, I just don’t know. Should I just spend more time with them to figure it out? What if I catch feelings for 2 of them, or worse 3? I don’t want to seem like some player because I’m definitely not.
