He has a very busy work life dealing with the family business and on top of that a very busy social life. He plays 3 different sports, has a ton of friends, and is usually busy every weekend. I have work to keep me busy during the week and on weekends I’ll have plans with my friends here and there but I’m not as busy as him

We live 4 hours away from each other and we’ve managed to visit each other 3 times so far. In person, he’s probably the most amazing guy I’ve met. A true southern gentleman. However, through text, I feel like he sort of forgets about me sometimes. I’ve expressed my concerns with him a few times and he’s been very patient with me. 

Last weekend he came up to my city, we went to an NBA game and he reassured me that there’s no need for me to have any doubts on whether or not he’s interested because he came up to see me. He spent 4 days, spent quite a few hundred dollars on accommodations, game tickets, etc. 

I came out of a 6 year relationship a little over a year ago so it’s hard for me to trust people even though I like giving them the benefit of the doubt. 

We text everyday, we both initiate conversations, his family knows about me, a few of his friends know about me, but because I’ve had a few bad experiences while using dating apps, I kind of just feel like I’m going to be strung along like I was before.

Today, he told me that once he gets off work he’s going to hangout at a friends for a bit, grab dinner, and then watch some boxing match. I followed up with a few messages about my day and told him to enjoy his evening and have fun. That was earlier this afternoon and I never heard from him again. 

He has the tendency to not reply after a night out with his friends and stuff sometimes. It’s not that I think he’s cheating or something, I just feel like he’s not into this as much as he says he is and I hate the feeling of being “forgotten”. He texted me this morning saying good morning and responding to those other texts...


I want to trust him but my anxiety just kicks in and I start over analyzing things. I want to stop doing this but I’m not really sure how I can so I’m here looking for any advice I can get.

10,mxk3eu,1619271291,I'm giving up...,"...and I feel great about it.

No longer am I going to let finding a girlfriend be my life's purpose. I'm going to learn to become happy as a single man. It's dangerous to let happiness depend on being in a relationship, because relationships will come and go. It's far better to achieve happiness within oneself - that has much greater staying power.

I'm going to find out what makes me happy, and do a lot of it. More exercise, more hanging with friends, more trying new things. Swiping on dating apps and struggling to get a girlfriend doesn't make me happy, so I'm going to stop doing it. No swiping, no dating and no girlfriend means more time to do whatever the fuck I want.

I'll still have sexual urges. Maybe rubbing one out once in a while is enough. Maybe I'll find a FWB. Maybe I'll pay for sex. Maybe I'll just live with those fucking urges. Who the fuck cares, in any case they won't define me. And if trying to find a FWB, or paying for sex or whatever is giving me grief, then I'll stop doing it. I've gone over a year without sex and, to be honest, it really isn't that bad.

Maybe when I've become happy on my own terms the girls will flock to me. Maybe they won't - fuck it, who cares either way. Maybe I'll die alone, it won't matter because I will have **learnt to be content with myself**. Not only content, but fucking happy and awesome. I'll tell people I'm single and they're going to be fucking impressed with how comfortable I am in saying that. In fact, they'll be jealous that I have all the freedom in the world to live my awesome life.

Maybe this plan will fail, who cares. If it does, it does. For now I'm excited to see what this new approach will do for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxk3eu/im_giving_up/

It’s so hard to constantly have to try and be vulnerable and trusting with new people all the time, especially for someone like me who has trust issues. 

I feel like the process is so daunting and humiliating, you know you would be a great partner if someone gave you the chance, but due to minor physical things you can’t change, most people won’t give you one (I’ve been rejected for my height, due to Turner syndrome which I can’t change, and my dark skin as a mixed race women) 

It’s even harder when you are desperately lonely and having to celebrate everything alone, go through life entirely alone. People tell you just to keep working on yourself, but if you are being rejected for things you can’t fix, then you can work on yourself all you want but it won’t fix the fact that you will always be forced to travel alone, watch all movies alone, never have anyone to  play silly games with or joke with. To sleep every night by yourself and never have anyone to share your days with.

She originally told me she would be graduating in May 2020. She never communicated to me throughout the semester she was struggling, and then suddenly when the semester ends she drops on me that she was having mental health issues and didn't graduate. That was a huge red flag for me, but I couldn't bring myself to end it because we'd been enjoying each other's company so much. Her lease was expiring over the summer and without her having a job and her being broke having student loans she basically had to move in with me or move back in with her parents half the country away. So she moves in over the summer, takes out even more student loans, and goes back to school in Fall 2020 to finish the last few classes to graduate. Fast forward December 2020 and she drops on me she has to take an incomplete in one of her classes. Not to worry though because the university will allow her to complete this class tuition free in the Spring 2021 semester. Well last week I realized I hadn't noticed her working for seemingly two weeks straight. I confronted her and find out she has more than 50% of the class left with a month left in the semester. I go into full out dad mode lecturing her failure is not an option, calculating that she has 3 days per remaining assignment left, blah blah blah. Right now it's not sounding good. I don't know when the last time she's communicated with her professor and there will be assignments she flat missed deadlines on and won't complete. I'm bracing myself for another failure. The one class was her one and only responsibility this semester. I'm at a loss for words how irresponsible this is to me.

31,mxlt04,1619276910,Finally found a guy I actually like and he’s super mentally ill,"So first off: I’m not saying this is a dealbreaker. But it’s definitely unexpected. 

I (32F) have been single since August and a huge part of the reason why is that I struggle to find someone I actually like. I’m someone who has led a pretty interesting life and has worked hard to never be bored for too long. Unfortunately because I moved to a small, fairly-rural place where people generally get married and have families in their early 20s and don’t go much farther than the nearby city, finding someone who isn’t intimidated by that and who can keep up with me (without overcompensating) is super difficult. I’ve kind of just resigned myself to being single until I go to law school in a year or two. 

I met this guy online, let’s call him Steve. Steve is basically the man of my dreams, for the most part. He’s an artist whose work I have followed for a long time and have a great admiration for. While he’s not what you’d call conventionally handsome and he’s also on the shorter side, I also think he’s just insanely attractive. Like I have dreams about him. On the surface, he seems like a very sweet, smart, politically active guy. Emotional and sensitive, sure, but I like that. He also lives in a city farther away than I’d like but I can deal with that and so can he. 

The thing is that I suspect (am in fact pretty sure) that he has pretty severe, untreated bipolar disorder (or possibly even schizophrenia). Early on, before we started talking, I hired him as a contractor for a project and while we were on the phone with him working out the details, he sounded manic and a little unhinged. Still nice, just... frantic. I thought maybe he was coked out or something, but I just ignored it and chalked it up to nervousness and caffeine. 

Last night we were talking and he was describing a piece he had been working on, and it was clear there is something else going on. He was telling me about experiences that I knew for a fact had not happened to him (because I knew what he was doing at the time he said those things were occurring), but so passionately that it wasn’t like he was trying to impress me but really believed what he was saying. They were very sad things too, that gave me some insight into this crippling depression he apparently lives with. It made me feel for him but also made me a little worried. 

I have anxiety and depression issues so mental health stuff doesn’t put me off. I am worried about the fact that a lot of what he’s told me about himself might be hallucinated. It seems like if I pursue this, a significant amount of time and energy will be having to manage that (he has done things like said he’s replied to emails and hadn’t, etc).

There are some other compatibility issues that will probably hinder this as a serious relationship down the line but it just feels like such a typical thing that I meet someone who is amazing in so many other ways and actually seemed very well-adjusted and he has this huge thing to consider. I’m hoping I am just catching him at a particularly stressful time because it’s hard to imagine someone could function so well and so successfully for so long and be this troubled.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxlt04/finally_found_a_guy_i_actually_like_and_hes_super/

I'm super self conscious and don't see myself as a suitable partner for her. But in my mind. Anything is possible. So through the time. She gets a boyfriend (not me) and then they break up like 6 or 7 months down the road. She gets all attached to me in a sense. Maybe because she feels safe. Or comfortable around me. Not to sure. But then one time we go for a hike. She gets all emotional. Saying thing like "" you don't really want me around""... ""I am such a mess "" thing like this. So me being me. I do what I feel is right. I hug her and try and make her feel better. (As I actually do want her around, and see her as a wonderful person in general) and so more time goes on and we get close. Intimately close. And me being self conscious and overly dumb about somethings.. I ended up not being able to preform(in bed) because of my stupid brain feeling I'm not good enough and she's too beautiful for a bloke like me..  that was probably the worst experience ever.

And that we all lie to get what we want.. but I genuinely want her. She makes my heart skip everytime I see her. I can't look at any other girl the same. The fire I feel inside for her is just too big for anyone else to draw my interest. And I wish I knew how to make things work. I wish I could just pass my thoughts to her with out having to use words. I always fail at expressing or explaining my emotions.
--
Is there something I can do or say that will shed light upon my love or attraction to her. Maybe I can help relight her fire for me? I just want her to be able to see that I just want the best for both of us. maybe she feels it's best we aren't together. But I feel closure would do me better the just super distancing herself from me and ghosting me :(

So I (34) was a victim of a brutal domestic violence assault earlier this year after having being single for some time, my abuser couldn't handle the fact that I was dating someone else (we also have a daughter together). There is a trial pending and my abuser is on house arrest until trial. I've been dating this guy (37) for about 4 months now but he is extremely hesitant because of the situation with my ex. Honestly, I'm a little hesitant as well, but I also feel like I deserve to live the life that want and not allow my ex to put fear in me.

46,mxmzdx,1619280528,When you are not their type. *sigh*😔,"I've been seeing this guy for 7months now. We first met as a hookup and then it turned into an fwb relationship.  I confessed my feelings for him pretty early into our encounters, a week before we went on a tropical vacation together. He rejected me so harshly and always felt the need to reiterate that he was never looking to settle down for the rest of his life because at his age (40), he has realised relationships arent worth it since they end failing anyway.

I accepted and kept seeing him for sex, because our encounters are always great and I wasnt willing to loose out on a friendship.

But deep down inside, even though hes made it so strongly known that he doesnt want a relationship with anyone, I cant help but feel like it's because  I'm not his type. I've asked him several times and he claimed he didnt have one. 
But upon further investigation and due to the guys I have seen him stare at, I noticed he is into one specific type. I confronted him about it and he did confess.  Now,  I can help but feel like if I looked a certain way, he probably would have been into me considering the fact that, he made it exclusive pretty quickly with his exs who basically looked similar. 
I feel like he just keeps me around because I give him the comfort he needs, but somewhere along the line, he'll dump me for the next tanned skin looking human that comes his way.

52,mxnyp8,1619283464,Moving on from being hurt by someone you love is ridiculously difficult. Men suffers too,"I'm a guy and I'm 26 yo. The first time I really got together with a girl that I loved and admired was last year. She was my friend before we started to date and we didn't date for a really long time, only 7 months. But this doesn't make this any easier do digest.

I never felt what I felt with her. She was my first experience with sex, love, companionship, not because I couldn't have it before, but I was looking for someone that made me feel like no one ever did, and that was she. Since the first time we met things went like we knew each other for a lifetime. I was learning things about her that made me admire and be so proud of that girl. During the time we were together I did my best to show her a lot of affection, love and care, and she looked like she was so much in love with me, constantly saying many beautiful things and crying over small things I did for her.

I wasn't like a doormat or a push over, but I was madly in love and stood by her during this pandemic when she needed me the most. One of the things that can give you guys an example, is when one weekend she would come over to my apartment so we would spend the night having sex. She came to my house and I was really in the mood, but she said she wasn't feeling very well and even throw up. I helped her shower and got her some clean warm clothes, cooked her some dinner and made her tea. The sex night turned into she sleeping at my lap like a baby and I taking care of her and while she was laying there I felt like the luckiest person in the world for having her. Like the person that you admire loving you back.

I had a ""friend"" that is a model and every friend of mine thinks she is absurdly hot, she is also rich. When I was with my girl this friend asked me out and started to tease me. What did I do? I told her I wasn't interested and to stop doing that, I loved my girl and had no interest in be more than her friend. I guess she never got rejected before and blocked me everywhere and never spoke to me again.

Few weeks later, the ex boyfriend that dumped my gf before we started to date came around, and to my surprise I was tossed aside like nothing. I heard from her that she never asked me to do all those things for her and that I misunderstood everything.. she left me and got back to him.... It's been 6 months and I haven't heard from her since.

I can't tell you guys how hurt I'm still am. Not a day goes by that I don't think about her and what we had and how it suddenly ended out of the blue because of someone that thought she wasn't worth it. My self esteem went from world trade center high to 9th circle of hell deep. I've met some other girls, but none of them makes me feel even closer to the admiration and attraction I felt for her. I just hope this to end someday and love again, because for now I'm still in a lot of pain with a shattered heart.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxnyp8/moving_on_from_being_hurt_by_someone_you_love_is/

I met this guy briefly as a family friend a few years ago. I knew him by his face and last name but that’s all. His age according to him is 28. More than a month ago, we matched on a dating app. He had a different name in the app and his face was familiar but I wasn’t sure. So we casually talked and ended up following each other on Instagram. At this point, he gave his real name. Then there he asked if we met a few years back and I said yes. I even vaguely remember him adding me on Facebook years ago but I wasn’t sure again so I didn’t bring it up. So by this point we already realized that we’re from the same town and our families are friends.

We agreed to hang out. It wasn’t really a “date” date. It went really well. We talked for 8 hours over dinner and drinks. We didn’t even leave our table. It was that great. After that, we started hanging out every day and by the third date he asked me to be exclusive. I said yes because I don’t like dating multiple people at the same time anyway. We saw each other every day for 2 weeks and we event went out of town for 3 days. We didn’t have sex but we were very very affectionate. We talked a lot about a lot of things too. He was the perfect gentleman. Caring, observant, would ooen car doors, fun to be with, very patient, he always makes an effort, and I really felt a connection with him.

However, some things weren’t sitting well with me and I questioned him if he had a girlfriend and of course he denies it. Until another week later, I told him I wanted to stop seeing him because I’m now sure he’s lying regarding his relationship status (but I was just bluffing). He admitted to having a girlfriend but according to him, he broke up with her the day before. Apparently, they were in a long distance + dead end relationship but the both couldn’t leave because they’ve been together so long and they were both afraid to end it. But his now ex girlfriend knew he was dating around and she was dating around too. The ex girlfriend knew about me too. 

He asked for another chance and he said all those things about making it up to me and he’ll give me time to heal from what he’s done. I said I won’t be pushing him away but I won’t take our relationship any further until he gives me some kind of proof they’re broken up. He said he’ll work on it. It’s been a week or two and he still hasn’t shown me anything but he visits me often and still talks to me every day. 

But I recently found out the truth about his age. I tried to confirm this with him but he told me he’s really 28 but I am 100% sure he’s only 22. I also saw that another one of his exes went to his brother’s wedding. I asked him about it and he told me that this particular ex is still close with his family. I think they’re still together. His stories regarding his exes weren’t matching up. I also found out today that he lied to me regarding his location. He was supposed to be at work but I have proof that he’s not. I also found out he has another private instagram account where I am blocked from. My profile particularly. He’s still active on both accounts. He has no Facebook account too.

It’s so hard to associate his lying side to the person he is when we’re together. He’s so kind and caring towards me that I’m starting to question myself and what I know.

I’ve fallen for this guy but I don’t think I can trust him and I’m seriously considering ending things with him. Should I? And what would I say? I don’t want to come off as some crazy chick who researched about him (although I did look him up).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxo62s/should_i_stop_dating_this_guy_what_do_i_say_to/

I am a bit devastated to say the least as I haven't had such a strong connection with someone for a long time. We were getting along very well, sex was amazing, had the same opinion on a lot of the things we were talking about.

The main problem is not that he couldn't give me what I wanted (which was more time together). The main problem is that he lied to me. On our first date I asked him what he was looking for, to which he replied with ""a relationship"". I wasn't looking for anything in particular, but I made it clear that I get attached easily and I don't want this to be just sex. I told him all about the boys I met before him, how they were assholes and blah blah blah; I really opened up to him and I felt like he was doing the same. He really seemed to understand, but today he told me that while he was looking for a relationship, he wasn't looking for the ""gf/bf relationship"" which to me means that he was looking only for sex.

I gave him so many opportunities to just bail out; I was so open in what I wanted and how I am and he continued in deceiving me even though he knew all these stuff. It's breaking me that someone can do this, especially someone so affectionate like he was. How can I ever open up again knowing that people don't give a shit? He could've found ANYONE on that damned tinder to have casual sex, but he chose to hurt me instead. To say it feels like shit would be an understatement.

I know that I am only 21 and young and have all life ahead of me, but wtf? Is it so hard to find a genuine human being? I cannot start being indifferent and fuck around because that's just not me. I feel so broken and hopeless; I really thought he was different...

She wasn’t  really emotionally available and she broke things off when she said that she wasn’t ready for something serious, but I felt like we understood each other and Ive never been so comfortable being affectionate with someone. 

After breaking up, I met another girl on a night out that week and she was grinding and dancing with me but wasn’t actually interested in me which sort of hurt. I feel like I’ve grown into myself enough where it’s surprisingly uncommon to go out and have a girl say that they like me or something happens like romantically or whatever.

Like I’m going on a date this weekend with a customer who I asked out awhile ago snd we had to reschedule a couple times but I only talked to her for 5 minutes snd she agreed to a date. What also helps is my friends believe in me for the most part as well, and even my friends that are girls have said that they like the way I dress snd have complimented my eyes, my skin, and they showed me someone who they thought looked like me in a girl version snd she was extremely hot (so that was flattering). 

All of this is to say that honestly I’m too sensitive to sleep around or be casual with most girls, but why has it been so hard to find a relationship. Really I’ve only been in two sort of kind of relationships, that lasted around 3-4 months.

72,mxptgy,1619288933,Need advice. I'm a newbie.,"So first if all let me give you my background. I'm (24M) single guy with no romantic pasts, no sex and currently no crushes at all and this is mostly because of my approach anxiety and social anxiety which started due to fact that for almost last 5-6 years (till 2019) I had very little female interaction as very less girls opt for the course which I'm pursuing. Though during the lockdown of 2020 I overcame it as I had ample amount of time. I used to be a shy guy which I'm getting over slowly, not a very shy person anymore.

So, after the lockdown was lifted  (in Dec 2020) I thought of getting in touch with my school friends whom I haven't met for around 4-5 years, so I called them and we had a get together. Now we were 4 guys and 2 girls, on one of them I had a crush on (let's call her X) in school and it was really hard to overcome it as I falled for her again when I started chatting with her around March 2020. The other girl ( let's call her Y) was just a nice friend and I wasn't really attracted to her.

But recently I started chatting with Y, not too often but sometimes. I felt like we had quite a few things in common, both are quite new to anime and loving it, we both are thinking of the same career options, into some self help books, she's kind of shy like me. I remember when we met in Dec, X was very comfortable breaking touch barrier and just hugging everyone in group, whereas, Y was even hesitant to shake hands with anyone until I initiated it just so she doesn't feel left out.

Now the main problem with me is, I'm not physically attracted to Y. But I still like that girl, she's good and somewhat like me. I can't decide that whether should I consider a relationship with her or maybe date her. **Can physical attraction be a deal breaker?**

**Actually, I don't want that in future if I get attracted to someone else, I just don't want to hurt her. Call it my inexperience but that's what I'm struggling with right now. I just don't know that whether should I think to pursue a relationship with her.**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxptgy/need_advice_im_a_newbie/

I'm dating this single mom my age and she's fucking amazing. We used to talk often how different things would be if we had met 7 years ago, but 


honestly, I don't think it would have worked out. She's deconverted too (and she took it very seriously to begin with. I don't think deconverting counts unless you did all the bullshit memorizing the Bible/no sex, etc) and her horrible divorce / becoming a single mom with no real marketable job skills (she lived out of her car with two kids until she finished trade school) pretty much matured her.

I learned to be a man by basically fucking my life up and trying not to go to jail, and/or trying to survive hangovers among prison hires in insanely hazardous jobs where those guys would have lived nothing better than to rape a prior Sunday school teacher/college graduate.

And like. I get it. I'm a smart kid from a white collar family but I'm kind of a fuckin mess and it's mostly luck I met this girl (thank god she helped me quit drinking an tolerate a normal fucking job. It gives me a lot of peace helping take care of her kids too; I think part of my soul just needed that) but I was talking to my dad, and my buddy, AND my sisters (I'm pretty much the adult of my family, siblings and parents included so it's sort of my ""job"" to find my friends and sisters SO's)

And I honestly couldn't think of where I'd find a girl who had her shit seriously together that I could relate to, who wasn't a single mom.

Men, maybe combat vets or recovered addicts/felons, but mostly the same. There is just something about being a parent that matures people in a way very little else will.

Anyway-like was there ever hope of me or anyone else finding a mature woman (or man) &lt;25 who WASN'T divorced and/or a single parent?

I'm not complaining I'm happy as fuck now. But for my sisters' sake, and the kids, I am hoping there is some kind of answer better than ""fuck up hard, fix it, and then you'll be an adult. Make sure you find someone else who has really fucked up hard too""

he's depressed from losing all his savings from a gambling addiction, he's struggling to get into med school because of his addiction. he keeps saying how my life went uphill while his went downhill after meeting me. even hearing that, i get depressed because i know it's not my fault but it just sucks that life happened that way. i was going through some shit aka not having my life together until a few months after going out with him. he was there for me and i know it and appreciated it.

i know all he needs is mental support and just me to be there for him but all me and his parents are doing is criticizing his actions for every time he relapses and gambles again. i want to mentally support him so badly but i've tried so many times in the last few years that i feel like i stopped trying. in reality i know he needs constant support but it fucking sucks when i just started my career and all i want to do is go on regular dates with him and enjoy our time together.

it's both of our first real relationship so it's been even fucking harder to do this. i know he probably hates me to the core thinking i abandoned him at his lowest point when he was at a low point last year as well. i tried to help him before and idk.. i don't fucking know how to feel at this point.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxqfxk/broke_it_off/
75,mxqma5,1619291229,I (23 F) broke up with my boyfriend (28 M) for certain reasons. I am new to dating. Did I make the right call?,"Hi everyone! So I (23 F) broke up with my boyfriend (28 M) of 7 months, a few days ago. I had my reasons but my friends and family are split on whether or not I made the right call and some of them have been pointing to my dating inexperience. I know it's ultimately my choice and I am not going back on it, but I still wanted some insight.

My reasons:

1. He is about to turn 29 and still does not have a driver's license, so I would always be the one driving out or going to get him.
2. I'm on my way to get my third degree while he refuses to finish the final year of his B.A. program. I felt like we had very different job goals in this sense.
3. Sort of connected to reason #2, I felt he had no ambition and no drive.
4. He refused to look into getting help for his mental health problems. He suffers from anxiety and depression and I tried so hard to help him see therapists or doctors.
5. He struggled with being emotionally intimate. We could never have any deep or personal conversations and if I tried to he would use humour to deflect. He also got angry at me when we played an Intimacy card game together because he said he wasn't mentally prepared to discuss certain topics.
6. I know this one sounds shallow but let me explain: I have way more money than he does. I asked him where all his money went and he said he blew it on partying, drinking, and drugs but reassured me that he is more ""mature"" now. This really concerns me as he is almost 29, yet I feel like I am way ahead of him.
7. He followed tons of instagram models but called them really derogatory names ...he is literally the market these women aim for so I thought it was hypocritical.
8. I had to tell him to clean his room because it was a disaster.

These were the main reasons. Was I right to end this? Please let me know

TL;DR: I (23 F) broke up with my almost 30 year old boyfriend because I feel he has no ambition, no drive, isn't mature, and I feel like I am way ahead of him in life. I am new to dating so I am unsure if my reasons for breaking up are reasonable",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxqma5/i_23_f_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_28_m_for/

I’m a 25 year old guy and I haven’t dated despite trying my best. I also have a mild stutter, which I think plays a role in my dating life. Or lack thereof. 

Anyway I tried putting myself out there by trying dating apps, going to Meetups, trying to take dance lessons, going to student events on campus, talking to random people on campus, and going to parties and clubs. 

Whatever I do isn’t enough. I’ve been on a few first dates but never a second. Because I see guys my age easily get women, I think there’s something innately wrong with me. I mean, I’ve been told I’m a handsome guy, I go to the gym periodically, and women have expressed interest in me in the past, but when they get to know me they back away. But enough of that. Here are the questions:



-Is depression and/or anxiety a deal breaker?

-Does it matter that I’m still a virgin at 25? 

-Is it possible to find someone who’s a pretty virgin in her 20’s? I feel like women get pressured to have sex in their teens.

-At 25, I feel like everyone is either getting married or hooking up and I’m missing out on the action. Is this the case or just me being insecure?

-Is a breakup as painful as being rejected by someone you thought you loved, but who didn’t love you back?

-Is it true that if/when I get a girlfriend, other women will see me as attractive? If so that would kind of irritate me. Where were they when I was single and lonely?

-Do you really remember or cherish the memory of your first love/first time having sex? Do you forget about that once you’ve found your soulmate?

-I’m a black guy who likes white women. Not that I wouldn’t date a black woman or hispanic woman or asian woman etc., but I really find white women attractive. What cultural differences and issues should I be prepared for in an interracial relationship? If any?

84,mxraem,1619293243,My recent bumble experience.,"I've never been a fan of online dating, but I wanted to give it a try.

I met an amazing woman and we had so much in common.

We called each other everyday, it was nice and we were always happy and smiling.

One day 
I talked about my work life and  how stressful it is, and me thinking I can talk to her about anything I told her all about all of my emotions....how I didn't like my job, how I felt like it was changing me into someone I wasn't happy with and how I didn't want her to have to deal with that if we got into a relationship and how that would be selfish of me to keep her in a relationship when I'm not happy with myself and make that her problem.

She told me that she would be there to help me and we could do it as a team, or just stay friends and I told her I'd let her know.....I wish I never said that at all.

A few weeks later were doing good and she has a therapist appointment, which I support, but ever since I told her how I felt about my life....she said she's been feeling the same way and she told her therapist that.

Now, last night. I got a call from her and I knew something was off by the way she was texting me. 

I was right, she called and told me that she doesn't think she can be in a relationship because she's not happy with herself and she didn't feel happy with me because of that. I told her I would help her and be with her and we can work through it, just like she told me, but she didn't want that. She wanted to do it alone.

So, obviously I cared about her so I was hurt, but I also understand her and care deeply about her, so what is a man to do....I had to respect her wishes and let her go.

Thanks to her, I'm going to see a therapist for myself and for the issues I have, that way I can be a better partner to the woman of my dreams in the future. 

But damn does it hurt I can't see her smile anymore. I just want to see it once more, but she said it would hurt too much and it wouldn't be a good thing.

87,mxs56w,1619295804,Does anyone else have something similar floating around in their head?,"I´m gonna be allover the place, but I have to rant a bit.

I haven´t been in the dating game for 10 years now, but it seems that this “game“ is getting harder and harder as the years are passing by. Both for me and for other people.

When I was 20yo, I spent some of my time on dating apps trying to find a partner with no luck and no luck offline. Browsed and contacted 100 or so profiles, most of them didn´t replay to me, those who did, made me feel like i´m pulling teeth trough a\*\*hole and went on a date with 3 or 4 of them. Needless to say, it didn´t work out with any of them. Tried a few other things but to no avail and thus I gave up (more or less).

As the years went by, I tried to make myself better both in mind and body (mostly for my own sake), even went as far as looking into how to make my self more attractive to women. Among other things i even stumbled upon few interesting channels on youtube and other platforms.

1\* Those dating profiles I mentioned earlyer, they ranged from thin to fat, younger to older and some even sayed “i´ve had my fun, now I want a serious relationship”.

2\* Then there was this one woman who asked me “what do you bring to the table” when we were on the topic or relation ships, mind you, she had 4 or so kids with 2 or more men.

3\*At a party of sorts, with a girl on that topic, came out along the lines of “a few of my girlfriends cheated on their boyfriends, but they worked things out in the end”.

4\* Seemingly everywhere I look, I end up saying “well, shit… these women want a traditional-ish man with traditional values, but aren´t anywhere close to being traditional themselves”. Bodycount 5+, attitude sucks, can´t cook or clean or whatever else the case may be.

5\*On reddit, in the relationship section, I see more issues than solutions or happy love stories

6\* interesting channels on youtube and a few other sources are giving me the same info as I stated in my 1\*- 5\* and then some.

Yes, I understand that  there are good women out there, but it seems that they are too few and far in between to meet them, thus my question is “what is the point of long-term relationships and dating?”

And yes, i´m aware that this text makes me look like i´d be messed up in the head and a wimp who can´t approach women…

Regardless, any and all input is welcomed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxs56w/does_anyone_else_have_something_similar_floating/
88,mxs58i,1619295808,A guy broke up with me by text at 7:30am on a Sunday,"So I was seeing this guy I met via Hinge for something like 2.5-3 months (during the lockdown). Things hitted off really quickly. I was extremely attracted to him and I feel it was mutual based on how he spoke and touched me. Sex was sooo good. According to him it is one of the best. First date he told me he likes me constantly and even mentioned about how he wants me to be his girlfriend.. second date he told me he loves me. And we started seeing each other on a regular basis every two weeks by me staying over all weekend there. Then last week I felt I hear from him slightly less on texts. Then last sat while we were texting I told him I miss him and I didn’t hear back. Then I asked him if we are cool?! And he replied back the morning after saying that no. He was thinking about it and he isn’t wish to continue, he can’t see a future and asked for my address to post my stuff. Now, this text didn’t make sense since just few days before he was all lovey dovy and we had great weekend. Then few days after I received this texts with no willing to engage and even talk about it. I didn’t hear back from him and I didn’t text him back since. 
I’m really confused 🤷‍♀️ can someone pls try to tell me what can be this sudden change from someone who I thought like me and been seeing me for 2-3 months and then completely ghost on me in such a cold way without any real details??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxs58i/a_guy_broke_up_with_me_by_text_at_730am_on_a/
89,mxs5xp,1619295867,Advice needed please!,"I think it’s fair to say that dating sucks period. However, it especially sucks nowadays because dating apps are the only way to meet ppl these days. Feel free to disagree, but you can’t go to any public place without half your face covered, so how can you attract any attention(unless you’re a body builder or have an impressive figure)?! My point is, dating apps are the only way you are on full display and have a “chance” to attract someone’s attention. So I finally broke down and redownloaded Tinder and Bumble. Yes, I used them in the past but they only brought me disappointment and heartbreak. But, a lot of ppl I know have met their spouses on these apps, so it’s been awhile, I’m thinking maybe things have changed and it’s not so bad anymore. But it the past where I would get several girls swiping right on me and I was left to decide if I liked them enough or not, now I’m getting nothing. Days after putting my profile up and I’ve received no attention whatsoever. So it’s actually worse than before. Why is this happening? I took recent pics that even I with all my crippling insecurities, I don’t hate. My bio describes me well and it has humor. So why nothing? What am I doing wrong? Have the apps changed where I’m not on display as much? That’s not fair. All I want is to meet someone to talk to, and maybe date eventually once things get better. But now it doesn’t matter if I’m online or offline, I get nothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxs5xp/advice_needed_please/
90,mxsnpm,1619297384,A reminder that you should be deleting dating apps.,"Men and women, if you are still using online dating apps, it’s time for you to stop wasting your time and move on. Online dating is a complete waste of everyone’s time. 

My personal experience with online dating:
I got around 10 matches. 2 were just looking for attention, 3 just wanted to exchange nudes, 1 wanted me to send a plane ticket to where I live after we talked for 5mins, 3 never gave me a response, and only 1 went on dates with me and became my gf for a while. How did this relationship go? She cheated on me :/.

This is an absolute disaster. It took me 2 months to match with these women, and this is the end result. I know my experience is nowhere near as bad as some ppls experience here where they never get any matches, or they get used for attention, or they get used for sex. However, this was enough for me to say “I am done.”. I think it’s about time you guys started doing the same. Let me know how your experience is. I hope it’s better than mine.

It’s way better to pursue women in real life. I personally found that I became better at making friends, keeping bad ppl out of my life, and saved a ton of my time, energy, and money when I pursed women in real life.

Does this mean I never got rejected? Or girls I went on dates with always ended up being my gf? No. I did get rejected and girls did loose interest in me after the second date because I was not who they were looking for. That’s fine because I know that I will not be everyone’s thing. However, that’s infinitely better than spending 2 months to get the results I did above with online dating.

I hope you men and women learn how to pursue men and women in real life effectively and delete the dating apps like I did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxsnpm/a_reminder_that_you_should_be_deleting_dating_apps/
91,mxsz2y,1619298318,"I got super hot and now my ex misses the “good times” five months later, what should I do?","Throughout our entire relationship, my ex treated me like shit. He NEVER put *any* effort into our relationship. We never went on dates, he only made time to see me twice a week and chose his friends over me. He would flirt with other women right in front of me and I later learned he was telling everyone we were “just friends”....  however, when I got fed up with his BS he would beg and plead for me to stay. I hung out with his friends on multiple occasions and he did cook for us and preform acts of service occasionally. 

It’s been months since we split up (he went on a five month trip) and during that time I’ve gone through a significant glow-up: I lost weight in all the right places, dyed my hair, graduated university and will soon have a high paying job, expanded my social circle, etc, etc. He will be back in our city soon and he’s been in contact with me for awhile. He’s seen the improvements I’ve made, and now all of a sudden he “misses the good times.” He wasn’t terrible to my face while we dated but I think I’m a great catch and I deserve someone who will proudly acknowledge me as their girlfriend. We haven’t seen each other in five months and I’m wondering what to do. Do I wait and see how things go down when I see him? Do I tell him my expectations now? Do I even give him another chance?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxsz2y/i_got_super_hot_and_now_my_ex_misses_the_good/
