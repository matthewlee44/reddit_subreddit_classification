0,szzwn3,1645671509,From beating off to boyfriend?,"I just got back into OLD after a good 7 year respite (49/f). My very first conversation turned sexual pretty quickly. I didn't initiate this, but I went with it. I'm pretty sure the guy got off on our messaging, but he wasn't trying to get me to meet him or push anything on me - it was more a discussion about a few preferences.

In his profile this guy specified that he's looking for long-term. (Yep, I know many guys lie about this). My question is, has anyone started off on this foot and had it turn into something long-term?

I'm not trying to turn this into something it's not if there's no chance. (I could totally handle a fwb situation for a while right now.) But I'm interested in hearing some thoughts on this...

4,t02329,1645677887,Dating safely,"I had made a post awhile back about when to go to a mans house . I am looking for a long term relationship and I don’t like to have sex until 2-3 months of dating. Alot of men were commenting on my post saying that they expected women to go to their house and have sex with them by the 3rd date and that if I don’t want to have sex don’t visit a mans house because that is a green light for sex. I’m not sure who came up with these rules , I think that having that mentality is just as worse as if a woman is wearing a skirt or low cut shirt she wants to get laid . Sometimes women want to see a guys house to see if he is neat, meet pets, or chat more and not be rushed by waiters in a resteraunt ,it doesn’t mean sex is on the table. However it was eye opening to see how so many guys have wishful thinking about sex. So because of that I will not visit a mans house until I’m ready to have sex. 

Now on to my next safety issue. One of my other worst fears of dating someone new is worrying if they are a sex offender or have a scary criminal record. I first like to find out a guys name and check out who he is on social media . However some people don’t have social media and will claim that they don’t see the appeal or are low key. That isn’t always a bad sign and quite the opposite to me. It shows they don’t feel the need to impress people perhaps . But if they are trying to hide something it is. 

I at one point was supposed to go on a date with a guy and the guy told me his name but I couldn’t find him on social media. He gave me a fake last name I figured out. I found out his real last name by just searching by his first name (he had a unique first name ) and the town he lived in. A huge criminal record came up of huge drug busts including unregistered firearms. I was suooosed to go on a Date with him the next day. I confronted him and he said he was framed and made up a story in my opinion lol. After that I got a little nerve wracked. 

I have noticed that a lot of men I went to high school with bad criminal records on these dating apps, so I think it’s true that dating apps can attract the worst sometimes . I made a post about my experience and asked others if asking for an id before the date was appropriate. Guys replied and said they would answer no to me because they didn’t want to be a victim of fraud. I replied and said what if I said the guy could block out his address ? Still men were saying no that’s weird.other people were saying a guy could make a fake id, but I would think he would need to know how to use photoshop well and wouldn’t be able to do it on the spot . 

I don’t know what the solution is with this one, but if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it .",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t02329/dating_safely/

She is a widowed single mother of 2 (quite young for her age) but it has been nearly 5 years since he passed. Her daughters don’t even remember him. I am the first guy she’s dated since who got to meet them. We had them and my son together frequently, did Thanksgiving together with her parents, Christmas decorating, tree buying, Christmas morning, etc together and with each of our families at some point. We hosted several dinner parties at her place, Christmas parties with other couples, even a pizza party with her dead husband’s uncle and cousins! In the time we were together, we never fought, slight arguments, but nothing ever heated. Then, about a month ago, she called me and said, “We need to break up”. I asked why, she said, “I’m having mental things, I don’t know, you didn’t do anything wrong, you’ve been nothing but great to me and the girls.” I picked up my stuff from her place the next day. It was all bagged and boxed neatly on her porch. I left her key on a table out there. I sat in my car trying to collect myself, just crying almost to hyperventilating state. Finally texted her that I left her key, I love her deeply, please just take a week to think about this. She responds, “You are a kind man. I will only think of you with respect.” Then blocked my number (I know because my next message went through as green after a while) then blocked me on FB. Her best friend messaged me the following day asking what happened, had no idea, talks to her every day and still didn’t know. We were supposed to be on a family vacation together this week, luckily my ticket was refunded, but I noticed, she unblocked me on FB. I saw that she liked a post by a mutual friend. I sent a text that said “I hope you and the girls have fun. Please return safely.” It went through, I have been unblocked. She said “Thank you. And thank you for loving us.” So, what the fuck happened and what the fuck is happening? It literally went Friday met his family, Saturday cooking and fun, Sunday signed up for a cornhole league, Monday break up. Completely cut out of her life break up. But why would she make any effort to unblock my number and social media if she has no intention of contacting me?

25,t1m46z,1645844043,Getting first dates,"I (F40++) am trying to navigate the OLD scene, for the first time in my life. 

While there are no issues with matches (I don't swipe much at all but whenever I swipe right it's usually a match), I see that the majority of the chats fizzle out and I scramble for first dates.

Maybe I am doing something wrong. I am originally from Eastern Europe, so I don't initiate anything with men as it is engraved in me that if a man does not suggest a meetup (or anything else), he is not interested. I wonder if this is the right set of mind...


I try to never leave any convo without a reply but my matches would still lose interest in me (or plainly unmatch) and I don't get that many dates.

I would split my faded away/unmatched matches into several groups:

1) Those who try to arrange a meetup without any talk, right after ""hi"". Well, I have concluded that if there is no connection online, there would be nothing offline either, so I now gently refuse these offers, after one first date with such a guy who spent half of our very short date looking into his phone and was visibly not interested. Seems that they just want to have it ticked, and that's all.

2) Those who bounce through the OLD, quickly rejecting you after a couple of msgs, I guess thousands of gorgeous women are lining up for them, so that's okay, too.

3) Those who start making explicit sexual comments and jokes, get offended and fade away if you either gently communicate your boundaries or ignore those jokes while continuing chatting with them hoping they ""will understand"", I guess they decide we don't vibe and there is no point in meeting up with me lol

4) Those who chat eagerly until they find out I am too foreign for them (well, I grew up in a different country, left it long ago though). They probably don't want foreigners in their lives and I respect that.

5) Those who just stop talking, sometimes after several days of messaging back and forth. 😀


I also try to mirror their enthusiasm and effort when chatting, i.e. I am not chasing anyone but try to encourage the interest towards me if there is any.


Well, is it normal for me as an average-looking woman to have more than 90% of the convos fizzle out without even a meet-up, or am I doing it wrong?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t1m46z/getting_first_dates/

 The conversation got one sided and he got critical. It is exhausting and energy draining as he does not take take interest in my thought or opinions once I agreed to the coffee date.. He is immature too and he is about 6 years younger than me. I get the impression he is interested in me because he is childfree and their are very few childfree women his age out there and I am also childfree. I need someone spiritual. He is very mechanical, factual, not light handed, serious, and he seems very autistic. He doesn't have a perspective on life yet. I never thought 6 years would make that much of a difference.

…Been chatting with a woman (mid/late 30s I think) via Twitter dm for about 3 weeks now. We exchange messages daily. I’m always the one to initiate but she replies pretty quickly. Sometimes one word answers but also elaborates and shares links to online articles/vids etc. The times she takes a while to answer, she would reply at 4:30ish in the morning when she gets up. She’s a morning person and her job can have her up at crazy hours. 

I asked her today if she’d be comfortable sharing her government name and she’s said no because the name isn’t common. Totally get it. We live in a small city and it would be easy to google her etc. 
I told her my government name a few weeks ago as a way to disarm her. My name is very uncommon and I’m easy to find on google. She also follows my most recent ex on Twitter. Ex and I were friends for years but dated for a few months last year and it didn’t work out. I broke it off in October. I don’t know the nature of their relationship. Ex and I both have private accounts.  

I guess what I’m asking here is, given the information here, should I ask her straight up…do you want to keep this exchange anonymous in the DMs or are you open to meeting down the road when/if you feel more comfortable? 

Im a bit wary of being that upfront because part of me detects a little game playing/mystery thing going on. Can’t put my finger on it but I enjoy it and I think I’m ‘patiently pursuing’ her.

So I dumped him via a brief, straightforward and respectful text Wed night (two nights ago). Didn't hear anything back from him, which I expected (I don't want to talk to him ever again). Yesterday, I kept getting this nagging feeling in my gut that I should message the ""flirty friend"" my coworker ran into him with back in January. I'd managed to get a first name from the asshole in question during a conversation where he insisted she was ""just a flirty friend and that nothing had ever happened between them."" I deduced who she was by her first name and she was the only one I could see of that name on his FB friends/Instagram who lived in my town.

We started piecing things together messaging all afternoon, and I found out he had introduced BOTH of us to his family when they had been in town. She'd been seeing him since Sept and though they never had a title, he claimed he was not seeing anyone else. His creepy roommate/friend, who she ALSO considered her ""friend"" totally knew about me the whole time, he was even there the night my ex and I met back in November! She even guessed to the day when he met me because of his weird texting/ghosting that night, and the week after.

We met up for some drinks after we both got off work, and talked for about 3 hours.

Apparently he spent 4-5 nights a week at her place, while telling lie upon lie about ""going to dinner with friends/a friend"" when he would see me. He also would tell me these same lies. Some days he saw us (and yes, lots of sex) both IN THE SAME DAY. It WAS her house I picked him up from the evening of the day my coworker met him and her out at a bar. The enormity of the lies has been a total mind fuck. We both knew in our guts that something was off, but he was just *that* convincing and had half truths and lies for everything.

She thanked me multiple times for messaging her. I'm SO glad I did, and I saved her from spending any more time with this creep. I really like her and she seems like a good, honest person. I think I may have even made a new friend! The Creep is out of town for a few days, so she and I are going to hang out tomorrow and I'll meet some of her friends (her REAL friends, not the assholes who knew about this). I'm going to let her decide what she wants to do in regards to him, and I'll support her 100% in whatever that is. She is possibly going to invite him out to a public place with the other friends of his who knew about me, rack up several six packs on The Creep's tab, have me show up, and then grab all the beer and leave with me. Or, she may just text him the same exact breakup text I texted him. Whichever it is, I'm totally on board.

Lesson is folks: *always trust your gut.* 

Oh, and the night of my birthday? He took HER out to the movies instead, because I was too busy with work and couldn't meet up until later. He lied about having work stuff, and his gaslighting text blaming me was complete BS, as I suspected.

36,t21ee3,1645894197,If the world was ending would you choose your ex?,"I’ve never loved someone the way I loved my ex. Even though we broke up almost 1.5 years ago I still think of him everyday. I have since made my life a priority and have been moving forward with healing. Out of the blue, I received a message from him containing a link to a YouTube song called If The World Was Ending. It basically says if the world was about to end, I would choose you to be with at our last moments and they want to know if the other would also choose them back. To love at the end without fear just to love. 


It’s such a sad, but romantic song. He didn’t say anything following the video. I said it was a beautiful song hoping he would then follow what he meant by sending it to me/what he wants out of this. He instead updated me on a few things in his life with completely normal messages you’d send to someone who’s an acquaintance. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so later in the day I asked him why he sent it. He said he can’t think of anyone else in the world he would rather be with at the end. That maybe we never would have worked out if we had handled things differently, but he still feels that way about me. 


I feel exactly the same way. If I think hard about who would I want to be with if we were about to die tomorrow? It would for sure be him. I don’t know what this means. Now we let each other know we feel that way and that’s that? I’m still not sure what to think, but it does feel nice he feels such big feelings about me, yet so sad we couldn’t figure out how to be together without the world ending tomorrow.

37,t21i3e,1645894477,Nice way to ask to stop contact?,"I was seeing a guy a few months ago and a series of events drove a wedge between us and it was too soon for drama so I broke it off. But I think I did it too passively basically saying I wasn’t ready for that serious of a relationship and I needed to focus on myself for a while to see what I really wanted in life.

Since then he has been checking in every week or so, sometimes asking if I am ready yet and other times acting as though he is being friendly only. 

But whenever I reactivate a dating profile he will either contact me on that app or text me to tell me how sad it makes him. It is creeping me out but I also feel really bad about it. I have tried to block him from seeing me but it’s like he uses different contact info than what I have so on some apps I can’t, so I just have them all off now. 

I guess I am looking for ideas on a nice way to explain that I am open to a possible relationship but not what we had and not with him. There was a time I may have revisited the idea but now I’m just uncomfortable and unhappy with our dynamic. I haven’t “dated” in a long time and I think I screwed this up and in the future need to be more direct, but don’t know what to do to fix this.

38,t244zs,1645901427,Optimism vs assumption,"I (45F) have not had a great romantic past. It hasn’t been much of a past to speak of honestly, but I got to wondering if that is because I am not an optimistic person by nature. Several times it has happened to me that one man or another would start talking very early on (imo) about having met me is so wonderful and I could be the one (not exact words) etc. I immediately panic when that happens. Sometimes I ignore it, sometimes I change the subject, but mostly I haven’t really addressed it head on before. So my question is what do you all think? In the early stages (talking, maybe a couple of dates) do you think that most people feel hopeful/optimistic about this new person being the one (those words not necessarily used)? Or is it creepy? Or am I jerk?

42,t2cani,1645924576,Need advice on how to date and identify red and green flags,"Hi, I’m new here, 47F. I am separated from my 2nd husband - divorce will be final soon. I am not dating again yet, I am doing some introspective work to figure out why I always choose guys who end up cheating on me. In doing this, I realize that I’ve never really dated per se. I was super awkward in high school, so no dates. College was college, I didn’t date but I made out with a lot of guys. I was a late bloomer sex-wise too, virgin till I was 21. I met my first husband in grad school and ignored a lot of red flags, thinking I was being a supportive girlfriend. We got engaged after a year and married the next year. We were married for 10+ years and I left because we had a ton of problems and he wouldn’t go back to marriage counseling (we desperately needed it). 

A few months after I moved out I met my next boyfriend who I was with for 2-ish years. Pathological liar who cheated on me. After that I reconnected with an old crush from college who I dated for 8 months until he cheated on me too. I met my next husband at the end of that relationship (and if I’m being honest I got into a relationship with him to get over my ex), and we dated for 6 years before we got married. I ignored a ton of red flags with him too, including an emotional affair with his ex-fiancé that he chalked up to his alcoholic mind. He got sober, things got better, we got married, and 3 years later he had another emotional affair (emotionally abusing me all the while) and I left. I sure can pick them!

Over the last few months I have gotten close to a male friend who tells me he has feelings for me (and wants to fuck my brains out, respectfully) but he flakes on plans when we make them and then doesn’t reschedule. I know that means he’s just not that into me, and I’m trying to recognize that it’s a red flag, but I also desperately want to believe his words over his actions. 

Anyhow, all of this to say that I have no idea how to date! I am excited about the prospect of meeting new people with no expectations, but how do I recognize red flags? Because clearly I’m not good at that and I always want to believe the best about people and trust them/their words until they give me a reason not to. I am a relatively intelligent person, but when it comes to guys and dating, I have a major blind spot.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t2cani/need_advice_on_how_to_date_and_identify_red_and/

47,t2gtc0,1645939422,So many red flags,"So I 39f started dating this guy 44m back in August. Seemed super sweet. He is going through a divorce which I get is a red flag. Also I was going through a rough patch was trying to relocate back to the west coast. We were both upfront him with divorce and me with my plans to relocate. However we both agreed we were both lonely and we would date. 

I had reservations as we were both in complicated situations. His more so than mine. We could talk for hours and both had a similar sense of humor and likes. Things are going good for a few months. Then one night he stayed over at my house his ex went off on him. I have no idea where you are etc. He then starts being a lot more careful. Which is fine as they are still trying to divorce amicably. 

Then he misses my birthday. We were supposed to spend it together. Apparently his kid got sick. I told him it’s ok it happens. I then already had plans to go visit my family for thanksgiving which for my job I have to put plans way in advance. So I was gone for a week. He brings me flowers the next time he sees me as a sort of apology. 

Then he asks what am doing for Christmas. I tell him I always go to my parents for Christmas and New Years. This is all planned way in advance. I offer to modify my plans. But he declines. I feel bad as this is his first Christmas on his own. But he insists I go through with my plans. 

I wound up changing my plans due to the mess the Airports are over Christmas and New Years and wound up coming back early. I tell him hey if he wants to do something I am back. He says he can’t because his kid is on Christmas vacation. He has to watch him. Fair as he is a kindergartner. But I was back for over a week. 

The other thing is he was going over to his ex’s house fixing stuff or installing things. He said he want make to set a good example for his son. Which I thought I understood. But the more and more I thought about it. She cheated on him. He took out a loan on his 401k to but the house. I am not saying he shouldn’t take care of his kid but it all seemed one step too far. 

Fast forward to January he starts responding less and less to me. He seems distant. I still better or for worse like him. Then we have a talk. I tell him like hey I get it I am not priority #1 but he could at least send a quick text when something is going on. That I can’t deal with radio silence. I don’t need details but just a quick hey I got caught up or hey I had a rough day and don’t feel like talking. 

He brought up that I joked about stalking him early on and I that is a sore point for him that I had no idea about at the time. I apologized as soon as he explained it to me. I left him alone for a couple of days. He told me he accepted the apology. He brings it up months later. The last time we hung out I just had my birth control changed and my gynecologist kept asking if I was sure. It ticked me off. I was telling him about it. How I never wanted to bring up a child in a broken home. It set me off as I had been lectured before about my biological clock. Which is a sore subject for as I terminated a pregnancy when I was in a abusive relationship. Don’t regret it. But it’s something I was pretty pissed off about. The whole I don’t want raise a child in a broken home comment upset him. Which yes I understand was insensitive of me. I again apologized and clarified that I was not thinking of him and his situation but that I was thinking of what I went through.

He keeps going over to his ex’s house to fill out paperwork or to take care of something for his son. One morning he discloses he slept over. I ask him is he getting back with his wife.he says no but he has something’s he has to figure out. I say ok I will give you some space. He doesn’t contact me for over a week. I then say hey are we over. If we are I need closure. Radio silence. I then tell him he needs to figure out what he wants and learn to set and enforce boundaries. I also told him you are letting your ex use you. What kind of example are you are setting for you son? Also I told him I was going to assume he fucked his ex. I said if you want your son not to repeat your mistakes then learn how to communicate and set and enforce boundaries. I told him I was deleting all his contact information. That I am not going to contact him again. I deleted everything from my phone. 

I feel bad in the sense that I knew there were red flags all over the place. I am really angry with  him and myself. But relived that I ended it. I can’t deal with someone who thinks radio silence is ok or doesn’t have the nerve to say no.

I am not innocent either but I tried to be honest and open. I just needed to vent. I am not perfect so not expecting it. But lesson learned.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t2gtc0/so_many_red_flags/

I told him the energy had changed. For one, he hasn't asked to see me again. And two, I was initiating communication most days (and I mean, waiting until the evening or next day to say, hi). He seemed genuinely surprised that I was questioning what's up. Then he admitted that he's dealing with some personal stuff. He proceeded to tell me he's probably not what I'm looking for, good luck, take care, etc. I was a little surprised he ""ended"" it so quickly. Kinda thought he might at least call to talk about it.

51,t2lbs5,1645957173,Should I write her or not? I can't decide.,"I am 41 years old and have been signed up on tinder for about a year now, with the idea of meeting a woman for a long term relationship. Recently, last week - Tuesday to be exact, I met a woman of the same age from 15 km away in a neighbouring town. That day it just so happened that neither of us were working. We talked together non-stop, ignored every phone call, text from friends, food, bathroom, from 11am to 6:30pm, with neither of us leaving the conversation for a second. That's how engrossed in each other we were. That same day, we agreed to go out for a walk in the city later in the evening. So we left the messaging and met at 6.45pm.  We walked around until 8pm, and another two and a half hours or so, until 10.30pm, we sat in the car. She is a cool chick, kinda ""crazy"", we laughed 80% of the time. Cool connection too! We almost couldn't believe how long we stayed together. This had never happened to us before. When we got home, we talked on the phone for about 3 more hours, even though we were up at 6am. We did the math and it came out to about 15 hours spent together, writing and live cumulatively, not caring about anything or anyone around us. There followed 3 more days of talking a lot through texts, including from work. I don't think an hour went by without us saying or telling each other something. We went 12-1 at night over those 3 days, texting and telling or joking about ourselves and other semi-intelligent acrobatics. Saturday morning we agree to have a second date a little later. So we meet at 1.45pm, and we're going to walk like crazy until 8pm, because we love walking. From 8pm to midnight we sat in the car, kissing, laughing, having fun, eating, petting, but not getting intimate (she was on her period anyway). I had all the possible signals, and I'm no novice, that the chick likes me and deifies me. In fact, she even told me that she brags about me in the city and would arouse envy. I gave her the same signals, obviously.   What man or woman wouldn't be happy to hear that! So, I swear I've never met a funnier, more giddy chick, and I have some experience under my belt. A great vibe she gave me. Besides, she also seemed patient or understanding, because on the first kiss we were in a bit of a hurry and it didn't come out right because of the awkward position in the car.    Slowly, slowly we started to settle in and it came out nice. We practically didn't feel like breaking up.    We said a reluctant goodbye at 12:15am, then texted each other on the phone as soon as we got home, until 1am. The chick is crazy, in that good way, she did pirouettes in the middle of the street in the city centre while we held hands, hugged everywhere we could, sat on the bench embarrassed in each other like two teenagers. For a 41-year-old... hats off to her in that regard. The whole encounter was accompanied by laughter and good cheer. We had a good time together. I'm a witty guy, I have humor, but I'm not that dazed.  I'm a quieter nature. The point is that the next day, Sunday, she was in no hurry to say good morning. It's not the problem, but somehow I was relating to the past few days. I greeted her myself, around 11.30. We talked for half an hour, I think... a bit perfunctory in my opinion... completeness. ...sort of. Around 2pm I send her cute emojis, she responds in kind, even kisses me with her words, and tells me she's about to leave for her folks to receive something from her mother. From what I knew from her stories, she doesn't have the best relationship with her parents and usually stays there for a bit - 1 hour max. Until the evening she didn't write to me at all, whereas before she used to do it non-stop - I mean she just couldn't refrain from interjecting to talk. I thought maybe she needed her space and let her.  I ask her at about 7.30pm how she's doing , to which she replies, somewhat dryly, that she's fine, at home, a girl friend has come over and they talking. Around 9.30pm, she texts to say she's in the bed, accompanied by shy emoji. Okay, me too, I say. I ask her how she relaxed, and she says the day was ok. Then, she asks me in turn, how I was spending my day. I answer her exactly like that: ""Well, neither you haven't told me how you spent your day"" Accompanied by funny emoji. Not at all in a serious tone, but more in the spirit of a joke, as we joked for 5 days and no one got upset or misunderstood. Well, this time it seemed to her that I wasn't joking and that I was offended. I tried to convince her I was joking but to no avail. She asked me not to insist on explanations and assured me that she wasn't upset or irritated. The point is, we didn't say goodnight to each other. I still felt she didn't like the situation. In fact, she even said she didn't like the ""tone"" of my answer, and why I answered her question with another question when she asked me how I spend my day. ""I'm not going to ask you things like that again,"" she said! Monday, in the morning, I greeted her and asked her how she slept then we wished each other a nice day. I sent her that final hug, but she replied with no emoji, no kiss, nothing, unlike the past... So, since Monday at 8 o'clock, I haven't written to her and she hasn't written to me. Tuesday night, however, I noticed that she also deleted my phone number from her address book. I no longer see her profile picture or last access, in whatsapp. I'm not blocked because it shows up when it's online, though. However, on Tinder I see she still has me listed, so no unmatch there, but she modified her hobbies section. Anyway, the point is, it's been six days of silence. She seems upset, or at least annoyed. I've been debating whether or not to write to her, though if she doesn't have my number anymore... I don't really see the point.

I am a 41m (getting to be 42 in 3 months) and have been dating a 41f for 4 years. We are both divorcees and met through friends a few years ago when we were both in 30s.

At the beginning we were just hanging out as friends for 1 year. but as the friendship deepened (we shared so much and had so much fun together), we both caught feelings and the relationship started. The thing is, I divorced early and have no kids, but she has 2 girls (now 8 and 10 years old) with shared custody. I have absolutely no idea what it’s like to be a step parent, therefore have been on the fence to take this relationship to the next level such as moving in or such. She has been patient so far and not rushing me. 

Today it hit me that I am getting to be 42 and I would like to have kids by 45. I don’t want to be an older dad at 50 which won’t be fair for the kid. But at the same time, I am so worried about the potential risks if we move ahead.

Apart from this hesitation I have in terms of stepping into a hybrid family and having kids, we are very compatible in values, life style, communication… basically most things. She is beautiful, smart, financially established, gets along with all my friends, and has a heart made of gold. There was never a girl who loves me as much as she does and I have no doubt she will stay by my side in hard time. She is also open to have more kids as she is physically very fit and looks much younger of her age. 

I love this girl heaps but my previous marriage didn’t end in a good way which made me more cautious about the whole relationship thing, especially when things are more complicated and kids involved. 

We have been through a lot and still feel like in honeymoon phase. I am afraid that if I left her it’d be very hard to find someone like this. At the moment I feel very lost and would appreciate any words to help me see through the mist.

I make well over 6 figures, dont smoke/drink, two kids with an ex, clean and simple guy but literally the only women I get online are not exactly what I’m looking for. When they do “swipe right” some ask the height question then distance themselves.

61,t2w54s,1645991237,"What are some profound things, or the most profound thing, you've learned along your dating journey?","This question is for both men and women.

I feel like every heart break, lack of success and even successful encounters have their lessons. Most dates leave behind something to learn from.

Even when having my heart shattered I thought ""well she's now forever gone, but she did leave me an extremely valuable lesson on what to do better next time.""

One guy on here wrote about how one time he was on a date with this woman, and she simply asked him ""want to come back to my place?"" When he heard that, a bell went off in his head like 'oh shit, it really is that simple of just simply asking.' And since then, he now asks women to go back home to his if the date is going well... and a lot of times he gets a yes.

I've learned how important it is to respect ""windows of time."" If a girl likes a guy, she'll give him a few dates to turn a flame into a fire. And if he doesn't make moves, boom friend zoned.  Pleasant dates don't matter without things progressing.

I've always learned that if someone is interested, you will know. If she's not, you'll be confused.

I've also learned that even though dating is a skillset, there is a portion of it that is simply out of your hands. I'm pretty sure everyone has had a cold streak even though they were skillfully trying.

62,t2wcpa,1645991806,Healthy relationship ending,"So I have dated a man older than I am for the last six months. He has been the kindest, gentlest and most generous partner I have ever had. I have learned so much and its been the healthiest relationship of my life.

Now its time to move on. We have fundamental life and value differences I can no longer ignore. I crave experiences, physical movement and intellectual stimulation. I love travel and good food (cooking it and enjoying it with my partner). We are financially disparate (I am a corporate girl and he medically retired living on little.) He is tied to the city and I at home in the muddy moor and forest walks with my beautiful dog and daughter. He is a homebody who prefers the Television and an unhealthy (to me) lifestyle. 

I can honestly say I value what I have learned and more that this beautiful human being came into my life. I also can say that dating him has shown me that wonderful people are out there and its OK to risk, love and allow myself to live.  Moving on from Toxic love is possible as is changing your patterns. 

The biggest lesson I have learned is you cannot change another person. You love them and intuitively you will know in time if you are meant to be with them for a reason, a season or a lifetime.  

Onwards I go to love again. May he find his person as he deserves the best.

Thank you all for your wonderful comments, I get it that a lot of people are telling me not to over analyze attachment theory and that I shouldn't be like ""I would have handled it differently"" because I was Myself that's what matters, and I should accept that she doesn't want to be with me, which all makes perfect sense, but here's the thing, let me tell you how the fallout took place

I had zero idea what DA is, and so all her avoidance and light contact, light romance, and kind of sensitivity to open up emotionally, I simply perceived has Lack of interest, or that she might have been seeing someone else even though she said she didn't.

Her DA approach to a relationship brought out only me blaming her and getting angry at her and feeling insecure, and she didn't justify any of her illogical actions to me, which hurt me more and reaffirmed my doubts about her and her lack of romance towards me.

She actually was shocked that I was behaving this way and tried to justify that I'm probably stressed or something, but already she was starting to disconnect, she perceived me as a needy insecure ranty guy, and that's not attractive, eventually she disconnected completely, not wanting the relationship anymore! no justification, no explanation, and then the more I pushed to fix things, the more I pushed her away!   

We were really into each other, I could tell I hurt her, I ruined it, no seriously, I am to blame for ruining what could have been a lovely relationship.

Had I known she's a DA and what a DA is, I wouldn't have blamed her for her lack of showing emotions the way I'm used to, I wouldn't have gotten overly needy and pushed her to show me attention, I would have given her space, played it cool, she even told me that the number one thing she cares about in a relationship is feeling safe.

I did the opposite, and ruined it all.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t2xdwd/re_didnt_know_what_dismissive_avoidance_is_until/

I’ve seen a couple of quirks but I thought I’d play it out and see how it went this weekend. We decided on dinner and hanging out last night. He planned on staying over since he lives an hour away. We went to an early dinner at 6:30 pm. While waiting for our table he started drinking double vodka and tonic. By 9:30 pm and a trip across the street to the local bar for him to do shots, he was hammered. I was not drunk as I was driving and it’s just not my thing. Anyhoo, I get him back to my house and he gets another cocktail, pees off my deck while smoking, and takes his pants down and is showing me his dick outside the sliding glass door. I tuck him in and try to get him to pass out and sleep it off. 
A couple of times he was pulling my hair and not in a good way. It hurt. I asked him multiple times to stop. Then he bit.my.face. TWICE. Like Mike Tyson biting. Not cute biting. No blood but not cute.at.all. I can’t send him home, his livelihood depends on a clean and valid drivers license, and I don’t want a scene. He was up and down all night semi-ranting and telling me “you’re not ready for a relationship”.    I just want to placate him to get him the eff out as quietly and cleanly as possible. He finally sobers up this morning and has a giant headache. I make him breakfast and he lingers for hours before finally leaving at 10 am. I am exhausted and for more than just sleep.

My work bestie (60sM) has asked me to help him set up a dating profile because he’s not good with tech and I am queer (this makes him think I am good with women idk). For context we are in the United States. Here is the problem: he has wifi, but no smart phone or computer or tablet. He is borrowing a computer for one day only (today!!) and wants me to help him set up a profile. 

I just don’t know which platform to use. He only has this computer for today, but he wants to give his phone number to women he’s interested in so they can call each other. I’ve tried to explain that apps are a thing where you have to swipe and wait for a match and revisit the website. But he can’t do this because he’s borrowing the computer for TODAY only. He also doesn’t want to use the local library’s computers, which I can understand in this case. 

So I considered suggesting Craigslist but that seems sketchy to me, like I personally would not go there to find a partner. I don’t think he will want to post his phone number in his bio on a regular app because he wants to see the women before they have his number. 

He is seeking a woman in her mid-30’s to mid-40’s, and the only app I know of that bases on age is the one for people over 50. HE is over 50, but wants a younger girlfriend. He has also given me preferences about children, drug use, distance, etc - so hoping for something that allows filters. 

I am just at a loss. I will be helping him at about 6:30pm EST today if anybody is able to help before then, I’d greatly appreciate it!!

95,t4arfn,1646149318,What is Secure Attachment for you? Have you worked on incompatibilities in relationships?,"I am just beginning to read the book Attached, because it was suggested by many people here. One of the things they say about secure attachment is that those who are secure take the time to communicate their needs rather than leave at the first sight of non-alignment. Yet, I have seen most of the advice (including from myself) here is to let go when there is incompatibility. Of course, I understand some incompatibilities are non-negotiable - such as emotional and physical abuse. I was surprised to see the example in the book where this woman (with secure attachment) have some mis-givings about her partner, including in the bedroom. According to the book, the secure response is to communicate and coach the partner to learn what would be enjoyable to her. When I read that example, I thought, in here, most of us would advise her to let him go because you are not sexually compatible. I am sure there are other examples as well. 

I guess my question is, are you in a relationship where it seemed you were incompatible but you communicated or accepted those differences to go on to have a satisfying relationship? Reading that and seeing some other relationships, I am wondering if I am running away at the slightest hint of non-alignment or if I was staying clear of control and irresponsible behavior.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t4arfn/what_is_secure_attachment_for_you_have_you_worked/
96,t4brfo,1646151875,How soon is too soon to bring someone around your family?,"I’ve been examining how to fit dating into my life and the reality is that my family does take up some of my weekend time semi-regularly. (at least 2x/month) Sometimes it’s obligation, but most of the time it’s welcomed! My limited free time has posed a barrier for me in the past so this concept that I might be compartmentalizing my personal life either too much or for too long is something I’m taking a closer look at. 

If I’m in the early phases of dating, is it really awkward to invite the person as a friend/ guest to social things with my family? I’m quite sure they would enjoy themselves and I wouldn’t see it as a “defining” step in our relationship. But would they? 

I’m just looking for another way to spend time with a person I’m getting to know. Or at least make it easier. My family lives an hour away, so if I visit, there’s a transition time to fit in plans before/ after.  Having the person join also allows for more getting-to-know-each-other time on the drive over and back.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/t4brfo/how_soon_is_too_soon_to_bring_someone_around_your/
