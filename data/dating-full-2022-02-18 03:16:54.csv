leaving a lot if details out to make it short and sweet, ask if needed 

weve been romantically involved for around 4 months, she was the one to profess feelings and came very strong onto me. 

she does have mental stuff going on and told me from the start she is emotionally unavailable and to not expect a relationship because she cant promise anything. 

that i was the first to become intimate with her so fast and have her open up to me etc. it was going good. 

“however we do everything a relationship does” lol. i said fine whatever, ill be patient..i like her and she came onto me yk? 

side note..like 3 weeks ago  she has lost a lot of friends too and in our friend group she treated her best friend pretty shit and we all know why her best friend is mad but she thinks she did nothing wrong.  she also has a bad habit of keeping people around that wronged her instead. 

basically thursday i stayed over we had a good time she said how happy she is with me, i pleasure her and treat her so well etc and a whole lot everything was fine

then over the weekend a lot happened with her house etc, she said she might have to move out now and get a job along with graduating college in a few months 

ive been giving her space, and we caught up over voice for a bit. 

yesterday she had friends over so i asked if late next week she would like to go out, ill pay for everything and we’ll have a nice day. 

mind u this.. we have had a few day break before but i asked if she was interested still so i wasnt wasting time essentially she said yes, and the break lasted for like a day lol.

so yesterday she replied that she needs time to figure things out etc. i said thats fine and asked about contact then…she said if i really feel like it but sorry if she seems tired and beat up. last time she said i could contact her whenever. 

im confused cause idk what this means and said well if we arent gonna talk i just need to know if u are still interested otherwisei feel  im just waiting around not knowing anything of whats going on
in a roundabout way having false hope, im not sure if i was right to feel this way and wanting to have assurance though

she said she wasnt sure etc, followed by a lot of blaming me lol
we went on voice this morning  
which she said shes not interested etc 

we are supposed to see batman as a friend group and she wants to see me in person again but idk man. 

i know people will say shes seeing someone else but shes not, she makes it very clear espiecallg during sex lol. 

it just hurts, she said she only started thinking of these things today and she meant everything when we saw each other. 

she removed me off her private snap too. (kept my friend tho lol and he doesnt even like her)

anyways any advice is appreciated for the future, and if i was wrong or not to ask for clarification etc.

Update: so the date I think went well! We met up at the bookstore and we browsed around a little bit and we ended up leaving and walking the whole mall while talking to each other. Later we went back and she got a book that she’d been wanting to get and then we sat down at the cafe and had some deep and meaningful conversations, it was really nice.

The date lasted around close to 5 hours but it didn’t really feel that long. I didn’t make any moves like hand holding or hug/kiss because she says she wants to take it slow so I didn’t want to overstep and also I was way to nervous lol. She said she had a nice time so I feel like it went pretty good, maybe could’ve flirted a bit more but I’ll work on that next time hopefully.

Just to clarify though before going on. Humans are very complicated and this advice will not apply to 100% of situations so use some intuition.  And yes before some men type this... I know it's a generalization which is why most people should use their intuition first. 


1. You met him at a place where people generally hook up. 

This is probably the best indicator of a guys intentions for the night. Some guys will just go out to have a good time but as much guys repeat this talking point in the back of their head almost all of them are looking to have some type of sexual encounter.  This applies for online dating as well. Yes you might be able to find a good match on the app. But if that app is known for hookups, that is what most guys will try to aim for. It doesn't matter how much of a connection the guy thinks there is generally he will try to pursue this after sex.  


2. His actions don't align with his words 

This is also a fairly common one. Most people can lie with their words but not their actions. Does he treat you like a booty call yet call you his girlfriend. Or does he take you out and spend time with you. Again this can also get tricky because a guy could genuinely mistake his feelings of list with love and treat her as a girlfriend.

3. He has a completely different side to him online or with his friends. 

This should be one of the first that you notice because everyone shares their social media. Obviously everyone acts different in person or with their friends but is it a 180 personality shift. If yes you might only be getting a tailor made personality that is designed to keep you interested. 

4. Is he too confidant 

I don't mean overconfident or rudr. But is he too smooth. If he is then that should signal something that this dude is trying to hide his personality blemishes by appearing too confidant. And he's probably doing this for a specific reason.

I was a complete stranger to her and she was very friendly towards me from day 1. I catch her looking at me like every 5 seconds and from a distance she'll stare for minutes on end. I haven't dated or met anyone in 2 years so I was excited about meeting her. We went to a party last week which was the first opportunity to hang outside of class. She wasnt gonna go until i mentioned i was going. She had asked what time i was going, updated me when she was on the way with smiley faces and all this stuff. We were talking there for a while and she said she needed to call it a night. Later that night she texted to apologize for leaving early and started a text convo. This helped me realize she may be actually into me more than as a friend.

Today: I asked her to get some food after class and she said yes. I suggested a few places and she didn't have enough time for one of em but said that she would love to go there another time. I took that as a hint she was actually interested in me too. We agreed on a casual quick place. I had to ask over text earlier in the day because one of her guy friends (clearly platonic, zero doubt believe me) was gonna be in class today when he's normally not and I figured they would hang out after cause he's real clingy around her. I wouldn't be able to ask in front of him or leave with her like I normally do. At the end of class, as her and I were making our way towards each other, she asked him what he was doing and he said getting food and asked her what she was doing. She kinda stumbled and said ""oh food cool"" or something weird and indirect like that. He asked her if she wanted to go and she stumbled again but SAID YES. like ""oh ummm...uhh...um....yeah???"" Then some other people overheard this and asked to tag along. She looked at me and kinda asked with her eyes if it was ok. What am I supposed to say no in front of all these people and make it awkward as hell? I figured she would have just told her friend she was going to get food with me. I just shrugged my shoulders like whatever. It was a very awkward situation and it seemed like she was trying to hide that we made plans so I didn't want to out it.

We all ended up going as a group and she barely made an effort to talk to me or walk near me on the way there. The past few times we've left class together alone and when we were at the party she's hugged me goodbye. I never began touching her, she just started hugging me after a week or so of being friendly. When we were walking back, the group thinned out to her, her guy friend, another guy and me. When I finally split I said goodbye and she didn't motion for a hug or anything. I fucking hugged her anyways cause I don't care and she's the one that began initiating it, so I felt comfortable doing that.

The whole thing went from so exciting to really disappointing. I honestly feel super sad now. I know if I was in her shoes I would have at least tried to make the other person feel better, or make a comment on the side like ""hey, sorry. I didnt mean to mess this whole thing up. Let's do it again this weekend"" or something. I get she may not want to let all her friends know she was about to hang with me but it just seemed very selfish and off putting the way she handled it. I'm planning on just waiting for her to reach out to me. Is that the right call? I figure if she actually likes me she would be able to realize that that was a bunch of bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I never ask anyone out. They make it so unclear if they actually like me and make me feel like an idiot, no matter how I approach it. I feel like I'm constantly putting myself out there and it never has once been reciprocated, or no one has ever had the decency to just honestly turn me down without making  up some crap.

He’s not from the states, and I think sometimes language and mannerisms get lost in translation a little.  

It’s been a bit of a whirlwind and fairly intense.  He came back to my city again for business and we met again, then that weekend he flew me to another city for the weekend to see him.  I met his biz colleagues and we continued to have a good time.  

A couple weeks later I went to his city for the weekend and we had a good time again.  We both have similar hopes for marriage/family, and have similar career aspirations.  I met some more of his friends and he was telling them how we deleted the apps.  He calls/texts every day, has gotten me some cute little gifts, shares his day to day dilemmas with me, asks for my advice about things, and introduced me to his parents on FaceTime.  

Today he made a joke that I was tired tonight because I was flirting with other guys.  I said I was not, then he said oh so you’re putting your eggs in one basket.  I thought about it awhile and sent him a text, and he called me to talk about it.  Should I be putting my eggs in one basket?  He was confused why I was wondering whether I should or not and seemed offended that I was questioning him.  He said he is focusing on getting to know me, and no one else.  I wanted to know how he felt about where we are going, because if it’s not going anywhere, long distance is a lot of effort and I’d rather keep my options open.  He asked if he had done anything to suggest he wasn’t taking us seriously.  He really has not, but I don’t like to make assumptions about someone’s feelings. 

Anyway, I explained that I prefer things to be stated, and he said he demonstrates his feelings through actions more than words.  He said he likes to take things slower and kept assuring me he’s not seeing anyone else and wants to see where we go, whether that is a relationship, marriage, whatever.  He didn’t seem to love the conversation but didn’t avoid it either.  

Even though I am for all intents and purposes attractive, smart, and successful, I always have anxiety in the beginning of a relationship.  To feel comfortable, I need obvious things to be said.   I’m always confused about how open I should be about my feelings at the start, and I’m trying to do better with it here because I’m 31 and don’t want to waste 6 months on something that’s destined to be casual.  

It is hard for me to feel passionate about something until I know it’s not temporary.  So, while he said he isn’t wanting to see anyone else, it also wasn’t stated whether we are in a relationship or not.

I have been dating my current partner for 2 years or so. We have been in a long distance relationship. We are about 2 hours away from each other but we are both extremely busy lives. She is a nursing student and I’m A medical student. About a year ago, her ex tragically was murdered. He was murdered by someone who he probably wouldn’t be around had they stayed together. 

I have tried being supportive and talk to her about what she is feeling, but she tries her hardest not to talk about it with me. I can admit that I felt insecure about our relationship at the time she began grieving but I tried hard to deal with my own feelings of living in his shadow. Over the course of the year, she has turned to drinking a little bit more than usual. I have tried to address it with her, but she shuts down and tells me that she doesn’t have a problem. I have tried my hardest to get her to see a therapist but she doesn’t want to see someone. I’m living in another city and feel very helpless at times because I don’t even know how to help her grieve. 

We have grown very distant. Our calls seem shorter and it’s hard to even connect with her without her getting angry or frustrated with me. I have asked her for more communication but that’s also hard because she works part time, goes to school and is a mom. So on top of all of this, her daughter is also grieving him. She is a pre-teen and I try to constantly tell her I love her. Today, I asked her why she never says I love back and she said it’s because she could never love anyone more than her mom”s ex. I know she is a child and that’s her own way of dealing with his death, but I can’t say that it didn’t hurt. And more than that could those sentiments be a reflection of how my partner is feeling. I wish I had some clarity but she shuts down every time I try to have a serious conversation with her about our future. 

Has anyone been in this situation where you feel your partner growing farther apart because they are dealing with grief? Was your relationship able to withstand the brunt of the grieve?

We both fell in love with each other back in 2017, i was 15, she was 16 at the time. We officially broke it off in mid 2020, 

I decided we were better as friends the. The feeling was mutual so there was no bad blood between us. We thrive as friends.



Skip forward to May, 2021. Her mom passes away and she inherits her moms house. Her dad is still alive, 

But

A huge reason her mom and her moved away from him was because he is a manipulative asshole, so she doesn't want to sell the house and move back.

she didn't keep any of her highschool friends.

So basically, she asked me to move in with her because she didn't want to be alone.

I was reluctant to, but ultimately said yes because i care deeply for her, she is my best, and only friend i have.

She has a house, with no mortgage, at the age of 19.



This is where I need help.

I think I'm ready to start dating again, but i have a tiny suspicion that she might still like me, just a little.

The reason why i suspect that is because, she will sometimes just sit on me while I'm laying on the couch, watching youtube or playing on my switch.(there is 2 couches, and i usually lay on the less comfortable one) and about 90% of the time, it will be right near my private area, and she would try to align mine with hers. It could be completely coincidental though, another thing is, we never had sex. The only thing we ever did was kiss, so this behavior is weird to me, my observation could be completely wrong.

About a month ago, we had a discussion.

She said that if i ever decide to get a girlfriend, she would basically just stop being my friend, further confirming my suspicion 

She says that ""we can still talk, but not hang out"" if i manage to find someone 


And there's also a little contradiction with her actions, that completely nullify my suspicions

There is a guy who gave her his number, and she is actively texting him. 

My only concern is that he is 9 years older than her.



Hopefully this can be a sign that she completely lost hope of us being together again romantically.

I don't think she is texting him to try to make me jealous. I know this because she is actually very mature.



I want to start dating again but I'm afraid of losing a good friend due to jealousy.

She was there for me when i really needed her.

She helped me through dark times, and helped me get over my darkest of times. 

I am very grateful to her

We may not be together as a couple, but i feel like if i pursue a relationship with someone else, she will feel betrayed, as if i cheated or something.

I don't think she is toxic, because most of the time, she genuinely makes me happy.



I also realize that if i want to look for someone, I'd have to move back to my home, because living with an ex would most certainly get me rejected 100% of the time 

But at the same time, i don't want to abandon her

Should I just not look for a relationship? 




What should I do?

I liked her and felt connection from our first conversation and she felt the same.

So I (F16) am meeting my boyfriend’s (16M) parents on his birthday. We’ve been dating for two years (in March). They want me to come to his birthday dinner with his family: both parents, 2 sisters, and maybe grandma. His parents have been through some financial troubles lately and they’ve been putting off meeting me because of it. They wanted me to come over at first, but my boyfriend refuses because he’s ashamed of his home. They decided that the next best thing is to meet at a restaurant for dinner, which I guess they can’t afford unless it’s for a special occasion.. hence his birthday. It’s at the end of the month and I have about 10 days. 

Thing is, do I pay for myself? I feel bad making them pay, but at the same time I feel uncomfortable paying, especially since they invited me. I come from a family where we always pay for guests, no matter the total. We invited them so it’s our responsibility. Disagree or not, it’s just how I grew up. On one hand, I completely understand where they’re coming from and I would TOTALLY be willing to pay for myself if they needed me to, but I doubt they’d straight up ask me to. On the other hand, I feel uncomfortable letting them pay for me because of their financial situation. I’m also scared that they’ll think it’s offensive if I ask to pay for myself. He said that they wouldn’t mind if they paid for myself. I just don’t know how to go about this or how to even bring it up. 

Also, if you guys have any tips on the whole meeting the parents situation, please help a girl out :’). I’m so nervous for this. I’m a very insecure person and meeting someone that’s so important for my boyfriend is terrifying. I’m scared that they’ll notice my crooked teeth and judge my bigger weight. I’ve talked to him about this and he said that he’s sure they won’t. I know it’s in my head but I can’t help it. I know that I’m just a teenager but it still matters a lot to me and I want to take it seriously because I do love the kid. I wouldn’t have been with him for the past two years if I didn’t LOL!

I unfortunately get a lot of matches who are a bit further out (45 minutes to an hour) than I'd like, so we'll do a video call, which also goes really well, but then in messaging afterward, we start getting more flirty, which leads to sharing saucier pictures, and next thing I know, we're back on FaceTime watching each other play together.

I'm going to guess that this happens because 1) the distance and 2) if you're having a pleasant conversation with someone, but you both mutually feel like the distance might be a dealbreaker factor eventually, you're more open to at least having some safe fun from opposite sides of the screen, and it's a nice change of pace from the usual disappointment that dating apps bring.

This hit me harder this week, because I realized I did this with TWO matches (one over the weekend and one last night,) and while it was fun, I also realize that I'd much rather match with someone who is easier to meet in person.

A bit of context: me and this girl did a back and forth for roughly one year and in mid dicembre she tried very hard to have a relationship whit me, but in that period i was really depressed i have barely the energy to care about myself. I want in the mood for a relationship.

Today I wanted to explain to her once for all what I felt during that period, i tried to be as clear as possible, i didn't want to get transported by emotion during the explanation, mainly because i didn't want to be perceived as needy.
But when I was talking about my isolation and my mental state and how i reacted to her past signs of affection my voice broke and tears started to appear on my eyes (too many emotion allat once). I paused for a moment and when I tryed to progress my voice was so high pitched that i couldn't say a single word.

After this we went to a bar and started talking about our lives and work like nothing happened.

When we left the bar i tryed to restart where I left the convo but the same problem reemerged.
She said that she has forgiven me for how i treated her and understand how emotionally unavailable I was.

We started to talk . about other things. And I carried her to work

The problem is that my goal was to explain to her that I care about her and i love the time we spend together and i want to spend more time with her how we once did.

Now my idea is to send her an audio on WhatsApp where i say the last things i wanted to say to her, mainly because I won't be able to see her for the next two days. Is this a good idea? Does someone have better suggestions?

This may be long but I think but I think some context of the date is necessary for just how bizarre it went at the end.   

A little context.   Me 51(m) with two daughters in their late teens.   I'm semi-retired as I just sold my two companies.  I'm tall and handsome (at least that 's what people tell me)  I have time to invest in someone, I can relocate anywhere in a year or two, and I have some time and money now to enjoy life and travel.  Divorced about three years ago and I've had on 1 year relationship in that three years.    And I'm straight.  (that matters for context)

Her:  47(f) tall,brunette, cool glasses and attractive. Really attractive.  One daughter in her late teens and a pretty high powered executive at a multi million dollar health related company.    Her profile is blocked to me now but I remember her saying she was interested in travel, road trips, exploring new restaurants.  I also remember it saying she was going to be an empty-nester and interested in a long term relationship.

The date.   We met at Portsmouth Brewery in Portsmouth NH.   I would describe this date as pretty normal.   I was a little annoyed by a few things.   As soon as she sat down she put her finger up to me and said ""hold on"".  Then proceeded to text for a full 3 minutes in silence.    ugh...

I like being challenged by my date.  It's healthy and fun to have a good nature disagreement on a first date!  If I say that Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars Movie, I want to be challenged with something like, ""no, A New Hope is the best and here's why""...   I don't want to be challenged on the small stuff.   

Soooo while we were discussing documentaries I mentioned that I liked the documentary ""Out for Blood in Silicon Valley about Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos"".   She POUNCED.   That's NOT the name of the movie she said.  You have it wrong.   I was kind of taken aback...  So I checked and the actual name of the movie   ""The inventor, out for blood...""   She seemed quite pleased with herself that I had made that slight error.   This is not the good nature challenge that I was hoping for....

As we walked out I did say a line that I've used on many dates.  I said ""if you're thinking about me over the next few days, text me and I'll do the same...""   She pounced again.  ""You're SOOOoo scripted!  Just go with the flow!""   I thought that was a little weird but ok... 

It wasn't all bad... we talked about our kids, our jobs, why our respective marriages had ended...   We had some laughs too.   I got in my car and had an over all (but only slightly) positive feeling about the date.   

So once you read the texts...Did i over react?  Am I the asshole here?

So you're waiting for the bizarre part...   Well here it is unedited in any way.   It won't comment below the actual text but I will just say (because this is the internet) that I wasn't offended by her accusation, it was just so bizarre and weird!  It came out of nowhere....   It's something I've never heard before in my life and just didn't make any sense.  I've been described as a lot of things but never the way she did...  So here it is.... i got home and the super pretty brunette with glasses had texted me.....

 

Her. 7:19 - Hey was thinking on the way home about how nice our meet and greet was and thank u for the drinks and appetizers but I got a vibe I don't normally get when I meet new guys and just want to be clear that I'm 100% **100%** heterosexual. Have a fabulous vacation 

Me.  8:14 PM I had a nice time too! You are very attractive. I'm not sure what you mean by a vibe you picked up on. Did I give off some red flag? | never thought you were not 100% heterosexual. Have guys thought you weren't heterosexual? 

Me. 8:43 PM The only vibe I think I was really trying to get through was that I have the time and motivation to invest in someone. ☺ 

Her. 8:44 PM Lol... no there is never a doubt If I like men or men like me. I just got the vibe that you may like both.. it's all good I just am being honest. 

Her. 9:52 PM Either way.. I don't feel the connection 

Me. 9:53 PM Gotcha. But I've never had that comment before or anyone ever think that of me. Kind of a weird way to leave it. Strange that you would go to such length to assure me that you ARE attracted to men. For what it's worth, I'm straight. All the best to you though. 

Her. 9:59 PM I certainly didn't mean to be disrespectful- it's the vibe I got. We live in a very open world these days 

Me. 10:02 PM Not even sure what to say...that was just all very strange... Don't go with the parting shot next time. Not a good look. 

Her. 10:06 PM You're a nice person- not a match - not a bad thing Be well 

Me. 10:08 PM You too. If we're not a match that's fine. I wasn't feeling it either. Just don't go with the parting shot of ""I think you're bi"" It says much more about your sexuality than it does mine. 

Her. 10:14 PM Be well. Whatever I'm very comfortable with myself 

Me. 10:16 PM So it IS about your sexuality... That's why you went to the trouble to assure me that you are 100% straight. And now that you are very comfortable with yourself. It's obvious now you're NOT comfortable with yourself. You could have just said you weren't interested. But you went to the trouble to say that you thought I was bisexual.   But what you were really talking about was yourself.  It's kind of clear now. 

Her. 10:28 PM I'm sorry.. I'm 1000000% comfortable with myself as a straight woman. you're very flamboyant- | have bi friends- sorry for the reality check the signs are there. It's NOT a bad thing. I was simply just stating I'm not. Clearly | was wrong... moving on 

Me. 10:33 PM Who sends the "" I'm not interested"" text followed up by ""I think you're bi but I'm 100% straight!!!""? Don't you think that's a little strange? Worthy of just a little introspection.? 

Her. 10:33 PM Agreed It's my perspective.. that's all 

Her. 10:33 PM Clearly other women don't feel that way, it's my point of view. Again, its Not a bad thing Whatever Best of luck 

Me. 10:34 PM And an incorrect one. Work on your people skills. 

Her. 10:34 PM Will do- thanks

I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for writing this, but anyway, I'd like to get your views on dealing with this.

Summer of 2021, I got in touch with a child hood ex gf who lives in a different country. We are both married (happily) separately to different partners. We began texting almost on an everyday basis (nothing too flirtatious) and tried to keep it as platonic as possible. Tbh, I did develop a lot of emotions for her but didn't take any action, believe she too had emotions but never showed anything.

Over the last 2 months, she started ghosting me from time to time, eventually also bread crumbing me. She would always come back for sure to text me, but never addressed the issue when I told her how uncomfortable and restless I feel when she disappears in to thin air. This became so frequent and now it has gotten to the point where she very rarely responds to a text and keeps it very generic almost as if she isn't interested. Whilst she may not be interested, I don't think that is the reason and there might be something else going on in life. She is mysterious, with history of unavailable parents , mental health issues and also never expressed emotions and also never is available when I want to share something,

My logical mind asks me to walk away and heal (which is the right thing to do and I'm trying it), my heart still craves for all the attention she used to give me during the good times . I don't believe she will even respond if I expressed how I feel about this (as both of us may be confused).

I was crazy jealous in my previous relationship, and i got really crazy when we didn’t talk for a day. It’s coming back in this relationship as well. We didn’t talk yesterday that much, and we just sent a few texts about the weather and how amazing we feel about it.

How can i overcome my jealousy and overthinking? She has been with a lot of guys before me (13 exactly) so i feel like it’s worse then in my previous relationship. 

I’m a busy guy. I worked today, now i have to study and i’m going to the gym after and maybe get some drinks with a few friends of mine. She goes out as well and i can’t get over the thought that she will find someone better than me anytime she goes out. I don’t want to be that guy who i was in my last relationship.

This is when his insecurities really started to come out.

He made comments about how my friends probably won't like him and about not being able to pleasure me. Then, later that night, he ended things with me. He said I wasn't what he was looking for. I was crushed but understood. I even got rid of him on snapchat. I followed up with a question that he didn't like and he told me he was gonna block me. 

That was 2 and a half weeks ago and we havent spoken since, despite my attempts at texting him. I decided to remake my tinder profile so I could get better matches and move on. I came across his profile and swiped right, assuming he wouldn't match back with me. Well, last Friday night he did. 

Saturday I sent the 👀 emoji. Tuesday I sent a message asking if he matched with me by mistake. And today I asked him to unmatch with me if he wasn't interested anymore.

It’s like I have to romance my colon whining and dining it. Why can’t I just go to the bathroom let it come out and leave like everyone else? Why is it so hard? I know people that can go anywhere. My friend Chris seems like an animal to me. He can go anywhere, anytime at the drop of a hat. There was that one time he could barely hold it in, until he got to his parent’s brand new million dollar house and then unleashed in their sparkling clean new bathroom, and as he was flushing the water started to rise, coming up pushing him off the American Standard with all the crap spilling out onto the floor and as he tried to get back up he slipped on his own feces.

He was the only boyfriend I ever had as I never wanted to be with someone unless I really liked them and could see a future with them, and he was the first guy to make me want to commit. Now it's over because it turns out he wasn't a great boyfriend and not the kinda guy I wanted to be with. 

I met a guy about 1 month after my break up and it's been a bit of a rocky ride since then. When we first met I thought he was really attractive and I definitely liked him, and we ended up spending almost every day together for like 2 weeks straight. This was obviously a mistake because then I started to dislike him and didn't want to be around him anymore. I think it was too weird to be so close with someone after ending something so serious.

But he has really liked me a lot since the very beginning. He recently asked me if I essentially want to meet his family next month, he wants to plan trips together, he always wants to be with me, etc. I found all this overwhelming at the start and ended up ending things with him because he only wanted to see each other if we were exclusive, and I didn't want that at the time. But, then I really missed him and we ended up getting back together a couple days later and we've been exclusive now ever since.

I was a bit weary of it still after getting back together, but now every day I am starting to like him more and more, and I really like him now. But I'm still really scared about actually becoming boyfriend and girlfriend, and I'm scared about how much I like him because now there's no turning back as it's either gonna last forever or I'm gonna get my heartbroken. I just don't know what to do or how to feel. 

I can't specifically imagine a future with him, but I don't want to not be with him either. The thought of properly committing to him just really freaks me out.
