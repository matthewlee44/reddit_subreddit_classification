I’ve always been pretty confident, but also a little shy when it comes to meeting new people. I’m just not great at striking up a conversation with complete stranger, but once I start talking to someone I’m fine. Anyway, I am a widow and after a few years I am finally starting to get back out there and will probably try OLD soon. But…I find myself having some insecurities about dating that I haven’t had in the past. I’ve never considered myself super beautiful, but I’m told often enough that I’m pretty or attractive and I take good care of myself. But I am older than last time I dated, my body type is average, not super thin or fit, but on the curvy side. My life isn’t perfect and has its challenges. I have a good career and I support myself and my kids, who are teens now, and I don’t have drama in my life, but I do have things in my life that I’m working on.

I just wonder what men our age are looking for or expect. Is it more superficial? Do they expect that you have everything in your life perfectly together? Or is more about who you are as a person and the connection you have? I don’t know if I am articulating this right, but I’d love to hear from men and women about this, and if I am the only one who has these thoughts and doubts when it comes to dating at this age.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,62938,public,self,Insecurities about dating again,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r9bn11/insecurities_about_dating_again/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to frame them as positives (so rather than ""dealbreakers"", ""must haves"" and have an example that illustrates.

Here are some thoughts so far.

Must haves:

- 1) Good communication / emotional maturity. Able to sensitively bring up things that are bothering them and listen, in a curious, respectful way to my feedback too. Ideally, able to practise ""non-violent communication"" or at least see this as a goal.  If an argument gets off track and they are triggered (let's face it, this is gonna happen), to be able to call time out then regroup and try again in a non-defensive, empathetic manner. Stays emotionally connected during this (or at least when able to regroup) and able to see the bigger picture of wanting the relationship to succeed.

- 2) Emotionally open, enthusiastically exploring / progressing our intimacy in relationship. Able to tell me what's deeply affected them in their life, what they feel in the present. Wanting (after getting to know each other) an emotionally committed, monogamous relationship with me (note this does not necessarily mean living together or marriage). Ie as into me as I am into them.

- 3) Respectful. Ie able to communicate without insults, put downs, one-upmanship, physical, verbal or sexual agression. With the understanding we all have bad days, and minor slips. In this case, see point 1.

- 4) Available, physically present. The amount of time is flexible, we all have busy lives. But I'm not looking for another LDR. Someone with the time and energy to enough spend time together. Our preferences there should be open to compromise..open to and preferring that to include my kids in due course.

- 5) Honest. Not just not telling a lie, but not concealing info. Of course, not everything needs to be revealed on the first X dates . But when we are both ""all in"", there should not be major skeletons in the closet.

- 6) An overlap of values / qualities / personality - kindness, inquisitiveness, intelligence (doesn't have to mean education), fairness, generosity, enthusiasm for life in general, optimism, healthy living (I'm pretty tolerant on personal choices but some choices don't gel with mine, eg drug addiction, smoking).

- 7) Chemistry, attractiveness (to me). Sexually compatible.


Nice to haves 

- Geographically close. Ideally within 30 min drive.

- Kids flown the nest or older than infants. Open to child free if they like kids and are eventually happy to get to know mine.

- Similar life stage, ie not about to retire or only just launching career. A huge party person is also at a different life stage to me.

- Solvent. Income or employment status is not important but ability to live within means is. 

- My love language is verbal affirmation, so if they are eloquent or even just heartfelt in words, this is a massive plus to me.

Im still at the exploration stage with this and am interested to hear what other people would put in each category.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,62940,public,self,Specific Green Flags,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r9c4vs/specific_green_flags/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

My bestie was beaming, and told me that this is exactly the sort of thing girls love. Being noticed, and being respectfully engaged with.

Thank you all who commented on the post I put up last week. It really made me see things through a different lens, and I noticed over the last couple of days a shift in my thoughts and feelings about her  since I put more contemplation to work.

A couple of days after this post went up,  I got a wishy wash answer about whether she was still coming with me to my friend's Christmas party this Friday. The reason, her parents were coming into town to spend time with their whole family at a local casino to dual-celebrate her birthday and her mother's. While I was disappointed about the party, it was not a surprise. I told her I planned on going without her, and if she turned out she will be going out with her family on Friday night, let me know, as I'd like to take her out for her birthday on Saturday night.

It is now just a few days from her birthday. I have opted to not get any of the gifts I considered. I just picked up a funny T-shirt related to an inside joke we have, and likely will supplement that with a card. No flowers, no sentimental gift like two I had considered. We did wind up getting together yesterday for a few hours, and the date ended with us kissing, laughing and hugging, so it certainly didn't feel platonic. There was no talk about the coming weekend. I opted to not bring it up.

Questions are these:

1. Right now my Saturday night is open still, but I have a woman from eHarmony who has been regularly in touch with me during the last week or so, exhibiting high interest even though we've not had our first date yet. Due to our schedules not aligning, we've not been able to find a mutual opening until this Saturday. Remember: the subject of this post and I have NOT made anything official even though we've been in a ""situationship"" for the better part of the last 14 months. Do I just go ahead and make a date with the new girl, or should I do a check-in with the subject of the post first?
2. Whether it's mentioned in the check in, or at some point in a talk after, would it be the right thing to do to say, ""Listen, I have someone pursuing me right now, I think it's time we decide where we want to take this. I have a strong feelings for you, but it's not fair to me to if we're on separate pages and I'm letting possibilities pass me by""?
3. Naturally I do not plan to let the day come and go without an acknowledgement. Do I even contact her AT ALL before her birthday, just sit back and let her come to me, and see what she says with the next contact (which likely will be a text message)?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,63033,public,self,"Follow up to ""What Effort Would You Put In?""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rahyyb/follow_up_to_what_effort_would_you_put_in/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can I share what is wonderful about dating at this age, at least judging from my first two dates? Being more comfortable with myself. Let me start by describing how each date started:

Woman #1: I get to the cafe early and wait outside. She arrives right on time, and before we even go inside, she says ""I don't usually go for guys like you. I've always dated musicians or artists.""

Woman #2: I get a different cafe early and wait outside. She arrives late, irritated at having to pay a lot for parking. She doesn't like the cafe I've chosen and calls it ""a cafeteria."" So we sit outside, which she is not enthusiastic about either, since it's a bit chilly. 

The beginnings to both of these dates would have totally thrown me when I was younger and more insecure. Yet both ended up being very enjoyable, because I didn't give into anxiety.

Woman #1's comment was ambiguous, and it did tap into some latent anxiety because I was already a bit worried about her finding me boring. She was very fashionably dressed, and I'm kind of square in my appearance. But at the age I'm at now I was able to take a comment and roll with it. I like confident women, and this one speaks her mind. All good. And the coffee went great. She definitely didn't find me boring (and she had, so what). It felt nice to kind of kill off that anxiety. Afterwards, it even occurred to me she was possibly complimenting me with her comment.

Woman #2 also made me feel not great to start. She was clearly not in a good place due to the parking hassle. But I didn't take anything personally. She was late; she didn't research parking beforehand; she didn't bring a coat on a cold day; she has oddly strong opinions about what constitutes a good place to drink some coffee. So I stayed even-keeled. And the date got better. We had an activity planned after the coffee that went really well, and she warmed up a whole lot.

I'm not going to post whether there were second dates here, because I don't think it matters relative to the point I'm making. They were first-date successes because I had a good time at each getting to know someone. And I didn't over-analyze sh#t in the moment and give into anxiety. I was completely myself at both of them, let the chips fall where they may. Something I couldn't do in my 20's. 

I'm also sharing this because I've been reading about others (at all ages) who seem to be giving into anxiety at dates, and maybe this can inspire you to try to just be yourself, and measure the success of the date along that metric of being true to yourself instead of how your date responds to you.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,63037,public,self,"What's Great about Dating in your 40's, Two Dates In",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/raijb9/whats_great_about_dating_in_your_40s_two_dates_in/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apparently, we've met 3 times.  I apologized because I don't remember him.  I know someone comes yearly but since we've never really spoken, I don't remember him.

I also don't want to be with the man all the time.  Meaning, I'm perfectly ok if he worked 4-5 days and just be with me on his days off.

It's all about planting as many seeds as possible. 

1st: Start a conversation with EVERYONE possible. Acknowledge people. It's good practice for you and some people feel invisible, so it's good for them. You also never know how attractive someone might be until you see them smile. Just say things. Make some relevant observation, and see if they reciprocate. If they don't, move on. Some people will be put off, most won't. Be that mom in the grocery store line who talks to strangers. Start with less intimidating people. Old men and women are great, and some of my most important lessons have come from octogenarian strangers. Start out with people that are unlikely to interpret your friendliness as a pick up. Flirt with old people. They know it's innocent. I'm straight, and I flirt with people who are my same gender. It makes talking to attractive, single strangers less awkward. I've been both obese and a personal trainer in amazing shape in my adult life. The results were pretty much the same with this practice.

2. If you like the way the conversation is going, try to mention something that would justify sending them a message, or ask them to send you something. Links to hikes, local events, restaurants, and books are my favorites. Make sure to tell them casually that they can text you ""if they have any questions"". I've taken landscape photos that happen to catch a nice photo of someone else and told them ""I accidentally got you in my photo, but it's a really good picture of you. If you want, I could send it to you. I'm super outdoorsy, and I've done this completely platonically and made some cool friends. The worst they say is no and think you're weird. That's on them for assuming it was a come on. AS IF!! You didn't mean to BOTHER  them with your friendliness. 

3. I prefer to offer my number rather than ask for theirs. It's less scary for them, and it puts the ball in their court to initiate further contact.

Really interested to know what people think I should do or how to deal with this. Could also post on AITA I suppose? It’s basically what I’m asking.

Background:
I’m now 41m with two kids 12, 10. My 20 year relationship ended when my wife got it on with a work colleague. All good between us now, I fought for it to be civil and we 50/50 coparent well - the 3 of us 🙄 they’ve been together ever since.

I had a 2.5 year relationship after this (a really good one with a single mum of 2 kids - my first ever match and first ever date until it ended)

But since only a few weeks after that ended and at the start of lockdown I met online another amazing lady 35 now, no kids wants kids.

I think she put ‘open to kids’ on her profile, so did I. I have kids, I like kids, my ex had 2 kids, I don’t want to exclude single mothers, I have always told myself if I met the right person and fell madly in love I could have more kids - I wouldn’t rule that out anyway. 
But she absolutely wants kids of her own.

3 months into my new relationship (it had a few jump starts) and the kids issue is getting pretty intense. Our relationship moved quick, she’s freaking lush so this was ok, is great with my children which was really nice and had basically said that she absolutely would have kids with me (previously with any partner she was just not able to see it) and that as I knew she wanted to be with someone that wants kids… So how about it?!!

I back tracked maybe at this point, or at least couldn’t articulate my ‘yes I’m open to having kids’ into a ’yes I want to have kids with you IF our relationship stands a test of time and love’. I felt the pressure so badly and basically just messed everything up. We have been in an on off state for like 18 months and basically I’ve/we’ve just ruined what could have been such an amazing relationship, and maybe marriage and kids. But maybe we wouldn’t have got there - I don’t know.

It took me 10 years to get married previously and a further 5 to then have babies. Obviously we were from 15 and into our 20’s so that’s different.
By her just saying ‘yep I’d have kids with you’ just put the pressure on me. It was just then for me to decide I wanted it.

The biggest issues came from the air of disappointment at the reach for the condoms. We did start having bits of unprotected sex - it just felt like we were going about it all in such an unhealthy and destructive way. We hadn’t reached any ‘yes let’s start a family’ milestones so really what were we doing!?

I’m now left with a relationship in tatters from so much on/off and a person I really like and love that I can’t be with. Even to be friends I’d take but I don’t think she will have it. She’s so in my head and can’t shake it. Can’t move on. But know I can’t make our relationship work unless I ask her to marry me and have a family (I’ve honestly seriously considered that, but argh the pressure(?!). Well it’s too late now).

Anyone?

I don’t think I did a great job describing “us.” I call him my BF because the reality is we’ve been seeing each other exclusively, but we agreed early on and again before I moved that we don’t need a label on this. Our lives don’t intersect very easily and that was obvious from the beginning, plus I knew I’d move eventually. So for those who describe it as “dating” — I.e. not a commitment or LTR — that’s what we agreed on. We also agreed that if we meet someone we wanted to be physical with or wanted to get to know we would tell each other FIRST. I’m not someone who can be intimate with more than one person so that communication is important to me. It just so happens that we really like each other so we make more of an effort with each other more than what I think is typical for two people who are “dating.”

Another point of clarification: I would LOVE for him to be in the same city with me. That man is a beacon of light in my life and I think he feels the same way. It’s just the idea of his moving FOR me that concerns me. There’s nothing else for him here. He doesn’t know anyone but me and it’s a very different vibe compared to where he is now. It seems like a big sacrifice and I genuinely am concerned about what’s best for him as a person and his life, not just our relationship. With all of the context above I hope it makes more sense.

Original post:

My (47F) BF and I have been doing pretty well with our LDR. Even when we were in the same city we saw each other once per week on average due to our jobs and commute. We currently see each other every few weeks but talk even more than before. Now he’s talking about looking for a job in my city. If we were committing to an LTR of course that’s the right move, but I just don’t feel we are there yet. It feels premature. What if he moves “for me” and we find out we aren’t a fit in the long run? It just seems like a huge step to take as an experiment to find out if we’re meant to be an LTR couple. I feel like I will be pressured to make it work and stay even if it ends up not being the right fit— out of guilt because of his willingness to make such a big effort. I really like him and don’t want to break up, but also don’t want him to move away from everything he knows in an attempt to propel things forward. 

I need to talk to him and want to find the right words such that it doesn’t blow up everything. I don’t want to give the impression that I don’t want an LTR with him. I just want us to evolve into that as a couple first, and once we’re sure, then make the efforts that go with the commitment, not the other way around.

I apologize for the long post. 
I haven’t dated much in the last four years since my divorce. And haven’t really even tried the past couple. Well, I reluctantly decided to give OLD another try. I finally matched with someone I felt like I would like to get to know. I let her know up front that I wasn’t a huge fan of OLD and the back and forth texting and would like to meet. She agreed with the sentiment and we scheduled a video chat through the app to see if we connected and should meet in person. It was literally one text a day leading up to our scheduling of the video and then no chatting until we confirmed the day and time. We both greatly appreciated the lack of back and forth as we are both busy with work and I have an 11 year old. 


The day and time of the video chat arrived and we missed are initial attempt to connect because we both tried to call each other at the exact time of our call. But we connected a few minutes later. There was almost an instant connection. We laughed and chatted for about an hour and a half. She let me know she would like to meet in person to which I was more than amenable. She gave me her number and we shared a couple brief texts immediately following the call. 


I reached out mid morning the next day reiterating how much I enjoyed our call and was looking forward to meeting. I received a reply at 10:30 that night. She mentioned a rough work day and that she was also excited to meet. 


I responded the next morning, inquiring into her rough work day and giving her some times and days I was available. I also, mentioned that I would be interested in chatting again as I wouldn’t be available until the end of the week. 


I sent that message on Saturday. I haven’t heard from her sense. I know ghosting is a common thing but it just seemed so odd after chatting with her. My head has been all over the place, second guessing this and that. After a lot of soul searching I came back to gratitude and messaged her this today,


“Hi Jamie. I hope all is well. My romantic side has been persuading me to hold onto hope that you needed to unplug for a while and you would be in touch any day. But my logical side is pretty sure that you must have had a change of heart. If it’s the former, I hope to hear from you soon. If it’s the latter, which seems exceedingly more likely, I just want to say thank you and let you know how grateful I am that I was fortunate enough to meet you. I had all but lost hope that there was an intelligent, interesting, feisty, beautiful woman still single out there. While we may not be a match, I am now reinvigorated with a new since of optimism! Thank you! I wish you the best. And take it easy on those spiders.”
The spiders thing was a joke from our interaction. 
This has given me some completion.

I soon discovered that relationships in 40s are pretty complicated. All the females I have interacted with are dealing with divorces under various stages. All of them have kids from their previous relationship. What I understood is that there is something called \*decree\* which makes the divorce final.

Sometimes I come across females with status as separated and they are separated from their spouses for years. What does this exactly mean? Are they still married? What is the (Indian) society's view in general on this \*separated\* status.

I am 41 and back to dating, well really for the first time :) I am still learning a lot about myself and how I make people feel when they are around me…. 

Anyways, I’m somewhat young at heart and generally a little immature because that’s how I have fun! I have a great job, home, no kids, retirement plans and have my stuff together. 

Id love to meet a girl early 30’s with younger children (hopefully) who I connect well with. 

What are your personal feelings around age gaps of 10 years? Do guys like myself come off as creepy or is this acceptable ?
