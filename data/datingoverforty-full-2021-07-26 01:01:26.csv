How do you cultivate and project confidence and calmness?

43F working on my social skills. My work requires me to be social, and I have no problems there, but in the personal sphere, I get self-conscious and nervous. My new goal is to talk to men in my day-to-day life so I may be friends and friendlier to men in general.

I am a small woman who has been physically attacked and assaulted twice in my life. Most men are larger than me. For much of my life, I looked much younger than my age and lived in areas where there was danger and poverty, so I put on a tough front so as not to be messed with.

About four years ago, I took up a hobby that happens to have a high male participation rate (70 - 80%), and that has helped me tremendously in my comfort with building friendly relationships and conversations with men, but I'd like to meet folks who I can date that might want to date me.

A friend of mine literally ""twinkles"" when we're out. She smiles, makes eye contact, whatever and within minutes anywhere, some guy will appear, chat her up and offer to buy us drinks. I'm always stranger-danger! Having lived in New York city most of my adult life, we don't make eye contact except to stare you down so you will get out of the way.

The other day at a brewery, I stood in line behind a gentleman within 5 yrs. radius of my age. YAY! Practice! I summon all of my courage and shout in an aggressive manner, ""So, what do you think you're getting?"" That New York tone doesn't translate to Texas very well. Anyhow, he answers me and asks me about my ordering and gives me a few suggestions. It's a start, but dear Lord, I do NOT want to shout at people. Also, smiling is not something you do in New York.

But I did get confirmation on a few things that I've suspected for a long time.  I don't know how to overcome it yet, but I know that it's a deficiency I need to get past.  tl;dr at the bottom...

  
Started my weekend by going back to an event that I hadn't done for a while. I knew my ex would probably be there, and I was right. Was able to have a good conversation with her and it wasn't awkward or weird. That's good progress on my part. I've pushed people out and walled them off in the past, and it was nice to catch up and chat for a few minutes. Not in a 'want you back' way, but just a 'hey, we did share lives together for a while' type thing and catching up like you would with a friend. 

Got invited by a woman from a local group I hang out with to come up and hang out (with a large group-not a religious thing) while they did out of town things. I felt like there was something there, maybe some interest on her part based on prior conversations, so I headed up there for the night.  Once I got there, it was clearly obvious that she wasn't interested in me, and way more interested in the much taller and leaner guy, who has been a casual friend of mine for quite some years now. It was disappointing, but I didn't let it ruin my trip, esp. since there was about 20 other people to hang out with and I came to have a good time.  Ended up at a bar with dancing available and probably 4 bachelorette parties in process at this location.  My companions for the evening were a few guys over 6 feet tall with beards, and if they didn't have beards, they had tat sleeves.  I am deficient in all three categories. Didn't stop me from having fun, until my anxiety kicked in. And it kicked in hard.  I have a tough time being in groups where I feel 'less than' the rest of the group, and the attention that my buddies were getting was well over anything I've ever experienced.  I felt invisible, and it was obvious.    I had to take a minute and process it all, but instead of it grinding me to a stop, I got back into the game. I was still invisible, but I worked through it and still had a good time.  It was a really good experience to have, being able to shake off that heavy shadow of inadequacy and allow the feeling to be there, and then to pass. The meditation techniques definitely were helpful, even in a crazy loud club setting.  

I capped the weekend with catching up the next day with some really good old friends from the area, and it made the whole trip worth the effort. (4 hour return trip)  I really need to work on finding a way to fulfill rule #1 (be attractive) in a sea of people that I feel are more attractive, but getting through that scenario mentally unscathed was a huge win.   


tl:dr - conversing with your ex is ok... no desire to get back or seek out, just if there's a chance meeting,  it's alright to be alright.  And being the 7 in a group of 10's is hard...really hard...but you can get through that and have fun.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,54214,public,self,"Interesting social experiences over the weekend.

A father who looks to be in his late 50‚Äôs/early 60‚Äôs just introduced his adult children to his girlfriend (50‚Äôish) with whom he‚Äôd been dating only 3 months.  Seems this us his first relationship after being divorced approx 6-7 yrs ago.   The couple is  already talking about marriage.  His  adult children are concerned that they are moving too fast, which is understandable.  

One thing that is important to know is that the family, including the new girlfriend, were all raised in the Jewish fundamentalism faith, although the adult children have dropped the various fundamentalist aspects and live in the modern world. The father and his girlfriend still live in Monsey, NY which is known for it Jewish community.  This is important because in their culture, women are often married young to a husband usually chosen by the family although both parties must consent.   The father and the adult kid‚Äô mother only saw each other for about 8 or 9 hours total before getting married!   It obviously ended in divorce, but they had 4 children during their approx 20 years of marriage.  Both were miserable and the mother left not only the marriage, but the more orthodox views.   Think the father is still entrenched but not as much as before.   So basically, 3 months is a long time in that world for the father and his girlfriend to actually date.   The kids worry this is just infatuation not love.   The girlfriend made the statement ‚ÄúThe moment I met him, I felt there was something special about him. I feel like I know him really well.  I don‚Äôt feel like we needed as much time as we did in our 20‚Äôs.‚Äù 

It made me think a bit and just curious as to what others think.   While I know myself much better than I did in my 20‚Äôs and even 30‚Äôs,  I‚Äôm still always evolving.  I would be wary of talking marriage to someone after 3 months.    Heck, I‚Äôd still be wary after a year of dating because I was love-bombed by a narcissist who changed as soon as a commitment was made.    While I hope to keep my baggage at bay, I realize that as we grow older, we have more baggage, and are set in our ways which often makes compromise a challenge, especially if you‚Äôve been single for awhile after a divorce.    Maybe the older we are the more likely we are to be ourselves when dating verses trying to be what someone wants us to be.  I‚Äôm no  longer wearing  my rose colored glasses and I‚Äôd like to think I can see people for who they are more quickly.  I‚Äôm still married but am planning on leaving once I get things in order so I‚Äôm not single yet.  When I‚Äôm ready to date again, I‚Äôm not going to be looking for the passionate all-consuming love, I want a long lasting friendship and companionship with someone who shares my values.

We seem to have great chemistry, and our conversations flow smoothly.  We text well, and our chemistry was great in person too.  She said she wanted to meet up again.  Later she said she even thought of holding my hand on our first date but was worried about it (I had thought about that too).  She also said I made her feel comfortable and she said thanks for that.  I asked if she'd want to meet tomorrow evening, and she said yes.  I had mentioned it would be nice to meet up for dinner, and also mentioned seeing a movie with her at some point would be nice too.  She thought so as well.

She wanted to clear up whether I was thinking of going to her place for a movie.  I said I thought the weekend would be better for a movie (she lives about an hour drive from me), and I also wasn't sure if she'd be comfortable with me going to her place yet.  She said she didn't feel quite comfortable bringing someone to her place yet, and that it's not personal but women need to be safe.  Even though I wasn't sure if she'd be comfortable with that, I still felt a little surprised that she wouldn't feel comfortable yet if I came to her place, since we seem to be getting along great and feel comfortable with each other.  Earlier this year I had met a few women who had me over at their place and seemed comfortable with it (though things didn't work out with them).  Also years ago, when I started dating my ex wife, she had started to come over to my place on our 2nd or 3rd date.

He seemed so kind and looked attractive from his profile. Long story short, I was really beginning to like this man. We‚Äôd talked A LOT and I shared so much about my life with him in our conversations. He too shared about his family and his life. He didn‚Äôt live close enough to meet yet in person, but I was really enjoying our online connection. Well last night it all came crashing down around me. 

Things seemed off or not quite right, I had that all too familiar feeling of vague confusion (which is a big indication that you could be getting gas-lit by the person). After suggesting we add each other on Instagram, and a few weird reasons why he didn‚Äôt want to. I googled his name and at first I saw nothing, but then I saw a random post someone had made actually here on Reddit warning of a scam going around meant to trick women to invest in a bogus Bitcoin company. The guy I had been talking to had apparently become pretty successful trading crypto currency. The woman in this posting said that she finally found out that she had been scammed by contacting the real man on Instagram. 

So I immediately went to his Instagram and messaged him. I told him how we‚Äôd been talking for a few weeks and I just wanted confirmation that he was HIM. Well what followed was like a GUT PUNCH. I got a video back, with the man (who I thought) that I had been talking to, speaking in a thick Russian accent, telling me that no, he was not the man who had been talking to me. That he, Mark Bence Kocsis, is actually a pretty well known crypto currency trader in Russia. That a lot of scammers mainly out of Africa have been stealing his images etc to post on dating sites (and now apparently Reddit) to scam women out of their money. (Thankfully, no, I did not give this person any money). But I felt SICK. 

I am left sitting here one day later, still in shock. I see his picture and I have to remind myself that the friend I thought I had found, is in fact not that man in that picture. That he was a lie. I feel so foolish, humiliated, and honestly just crushed. I keep crying. And I just feel more alone than ever. Women (and men too!) please be CAREFUL. I never thought that I could get tricked like this, but let me tell you, the lie was ELABORATE. His backstory so well thought out and detailed, he sent me video of him apparently jet skiing with his friends etc. Anyway, just feeling incredibly sad.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,54283,public,self,Feel lonelier than ever after being catfished.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/osjm71/feel_lonelier_than_ever_after_being_catfished/,some_ads,7,08ec5ff2-2760-11e9-aac2-0ea14477eb18,Giving Advice,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 2 months ago we had the relationship talk and I asked him if he had any concerns and he came clean that was planning to move. His friends moved to SC and offered him a job doing what he went to school for. He‚Äôs from an Indian family and is extremely family oriented. We decided that it was worth going forward because you never know what‚Äôs going to happen. In all honesty, I never thought he‚Äôd leave his immediate and extended family. His aunt and uncle from NYC are even house shopping up here at the moment..:I never thought he‚Äôd leave. 

So last night I brought the subject up again and he said that he‚Äôs visiting his SC friends soon and ‚Äúthe move‚Äù will become more real. That to save feelings, mostly on his part, but on mine too it would be best to take a break or hang out less with no sleepovers so the hurt isn‚Äôt so bad when it‚Äôs time for him to leave. He did say he didn‚Äôt want to go through heart break again and the pain would be less now than later on. 

I can not move with him right now because I have kids. I asked him to stay a few more years so I could come with him and he doesn‚Äôt want to wait.

Well after texting me for 4 hours after our date on Sunday including let‚Äôs pick out a Netflix show to be ours &amp; I‚Äôm deleting my OLD to concentrate on you plus daily good morning texts the last 2 days as well as others I just received another text from her. 

She decided that SHE wasn‚Äôt feeling the chemistry &amp; wished me well. I of course told her that she is a good lady ( which I believe she is) &amp; that she finds someone in the future that she meshes better with. 

I think it‚Äôs sad that what I‚Äôm feeling most is relief. I have MANY faults but not being honest with a lady or leading her on is never been one of them ( nor will it ever be). I had been thinking about the situation for a few days &amp; just knew it wasn‚Äôt there. 

So as many here will tell you go with your gut. Give it a second chance if the first date wasn‚Äôt awful and/ or you think there might be chemistry. If not be true to yourself &amp; kind to the other person. In this instance I‚Äôm very glad she wasn‚Äôt as into me as I feared she was. 

I will continue to move forward. Hoping &amp; looking for that special lady to complement each other‚Äôs lives. But if it doesn‚Äôt happen while I may get down momentarily I will be in good spirits as I‚Äôm comfortable in my own skin. Not only do I love myself but I try every day to make sure I‚Äôm the right kind of person so that I can continue to like myself as well. 

Never give up hope folks. You never know what may happen tomorrow.

So, here's the tl;dr, I'm worried we're waiting too long to meet the kid.

Recap: bf and I both 48 have been dating about 14 months. He has a 12yo son. When we met he was 4 months into divorce. Dating newly divorced or separated is not usually my m/o, but... I made an exception because 1) he had already been with another woman, so I figured the revenge sex was out of the way and 2) he'd been seeing a therapist for a year since he found out his wife was cheating. He's very clear about being done with her and moving forward.

We talked about meeting the son at 6 months in. That was around the holidays last year. I said it wasn't a good idea. So we waited. Then bf decided the closer it got to Feb and his divorce being completed, why not wait? Why risk passing her off at the end and making trouble for him. I agree. Well, here we are, approaching August. The divorce still isn't final. Just one signature is between him and freedom! I had thought I'd have the summer to get to know the son. Nope. And now school is starting soon. Then we're back to the holidays. 

Is there ever going to be a good time? I guess we could talk ourselves out of it for many more months. But, I had hoped to be spending the holidays with all of them this year. Not sitting on the sidelines. 

I do love that we've had all this time together sans kids, getting to know each other, building a strong relationship. I've read every book I can find on step-coupling, etc. I just want to do right... by everyone!

Of note, she's a super busy nurse who has her young kids FT until the 2nd week of August so maybe texting is better? I hate overanalyzing these things but like I said, she's gorgeous and kind and smart and just *swoon.*

I've only used OkC so far as one app seemed like plenty to start and it seemed more profile oriented than just pic oriented. I've taken it pretty slow as far as sending out likes, gotten a few matches that led to conversations that kind of ran their course, and one that has led to a few dates and is a still-developing story.

I'm curious how people generally handle profiles they see where there seems like a chance the person might be a good person to meet, but you aren't entirely sold. I've generally only hit like on profiles where I really saw content that ""sold"" me per se (strong mutual interests, seems like a good person, no red flags), and the pictures seemed like someone I'd want to meet. I've run across a handful that were in the ""close"" range - like, I'd need more information, maybe something in the profile was a mild yellow flag, or maybe I didn't feel the pictures showed me someone I found attractive but that could change if I met them. 

I realize that profiles are very abstracted from the person themselves in the end - the one person I've been dating I would say their profile didn't do them justice, there were a lot of pleasant surprises - but I'm not sure I want to spend both my and the other person's time if I feel there is still a somewhat low probability of a real match.  

Anyway, just wondering other perspectives on how you've approached this.

I‚Äôm sort of at a loss on what to do.   I loaded into Bumble late Thursday night, after a group of friends got together and we all critiqued/fixed each other‚Äôs dating profile.    Since then, I‚Äôve had about ten matches.   I have three on-going conversations.   (The rest have all died off in app, and just never got anywhere.).   Two of them, we have escalated to texting. 
 
Now, here‚Äôs my dilemma.  I keep looking and swiping when I have downtime.    Do you do this?   Do you take breaks after you start getting matches?
 
My other issue, I have my daughters every other week.  I can‚Äôt really get away too often when I have them, so it will be more than a week since a couple of these conversations have started, before I have the opportunity to ask someone out.

I know a guy (from OLD) who organizes all the women he has connections with in his cellphone contact list by their name and then 'flairs' it with their city or state.

So an example would be:

Carrie WY

or..

Rachel Oak Hills

Interestingly enough, the GUYS in his contact list don't warrant such specific details, lol.

Often when either of us answer the phone, he'll say to me, ""Is this...Eustacia from....La Quinta??"", as a joke. Even though we are just friends, it is a wise ass play on being just a number, or somehow easily forgettable amongst all the other fillies in the stable. We both like it, it's a running joke.

Cut to modern day and the real story;

Last night I was texting with a long distance love interest that I have been involved with for a year.

He lives in another state, (which is no big deal to either of us), and we have met already in person. In about a week, we have plans to meet again for several days.

So, we are texting about plans, and he sends me a screenshot of our current conversation (because my text came through in Chinese font, if you must know...)

As I peruse the screenshot he sent, I can easily see the way in which he has saved my name in his Contact info:

Eustacia Cali

Eustacia is not my real name, but for the purposes of this Post, I'm using it because my name is very, very unusual.

It is so unusual that I can't imagine having to denote what state I live in afterwards, as if there are possibly more than one of us in ""Cali"", much less his contact list.

Yes, I will live.
But I have to admit the surprised sinking feeling I had with that statehood flair affixed to my name. You..don't know me? Just from my name? Aren't..sure of.. who I am and where I'm from at this point?

In the end I am made to feel like one of many, to be separated, organized, kept straight, lest a text gets fumbled, or a message missent. When? I kinda thought I was the only one.

On the flipside, I have done this myself with people in my phone who I do not know well that have very common names. For instance, 2 men with the name John, etc.

Each time it gets awkward at that moment. It doesn't matter where I'm at in the dating cycle, it gets awkward. What is your first thoughts when someone discloses that they aren't drinking?

For example, we agreed to do lunch and the waiter asks for our drink order and I insist she go first and she ordered wine. I ordered ice tea. She then tried to change her order to match my non-alcoholic order. I insist it's fine, she should keep her order. And then it becomes a conversation. And sometimes a conversation that I'm not ready to have at that point.

When I decided to stop drinking I was depressed, still married, and drinking too much. I realized that alcohol was only contributing to my issues and decided to stop. And when I did, I lost most of my ""friends"". The divorce basically ended any other remaining friendships. In fact, I had one ""friend"" bluntly say, ""You can't trust people who stop drinking."" Alcohol was the social lubricant in all my friendships. And, I think this is true for the vast majority of over forty singles. 

I don't think I'm a recovering alcoholic. I have no issues with everyone around me having a few. It's just that I'm choosing to not drink at this time. In fact, I'd love to have a taste of what you're enjoying. But, I just want a taste and not a glass. Not drinking tends to be a nonstarter, a relationship killer. 

On the flip side, if I post that I don't drink, I tend to get people who don't drink for religious reasons and I'm not religious. I'm not interested in converting to their belief systems.

Or, people believe I'm a recovering alcoholic and they feel that drinking in front of me is tempting me or disrespectful to me.

He explained that his past few dates haven‚Äôt been good and that he would like to chat and be open to meeting. I felt that was open minded. 

Truth is though, I‚Äôm really down right down, but I am losing my mind being alone. I got divorced right before the pandemic and I lost everyone- including close family. I have a one ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who I see on a somewhat regular basis but even that‚Äôs making me feel like crap. 

Back to OKC guy. We have only exchanged a few short non substantial texts. He asked if I have been to a very expensive restaurant and I said 15 years ago, so I guess I could say no. His response was ‚Äúit‚Äôs $200 a person (IDK what the hell he‚Äôs eating &amp; unless your buying really great alcohol, but I don‚Äôt drink and I never want another alcoholic in my life), so it‚Äôs like a once or twice a year thing‚Äù. Ummmmmmmmm I know how much it costs. He then said he would like to meet up his treat. 

He‚Äôs already talking about money which is triggering for me because of the controling crap my ex husband would pull.

She is all over social media - she‚Äôs constantly on her phone on all platforms. After doing some searching, I noticed that she follows lots of guys that have certain attributes. Most of them have beards, tattoos, long hair, and spend too much time at the gym. I am not this way - no long hair, don‚Äôt have time for the gym (too busy working my desk job and taking care of my kids), and no tattoos. While she says she cares about me, she follows hundreds of these guys online. Her and her friends all talk about them, etc. 

I guess my question is: should I be concerned? I get that people have fantasies/etc. however this is a very transparent pattern and I wonder if I‚Äôm just a safe choice since I‚Äôm reliable, a parent first, hard working and dedicated.
