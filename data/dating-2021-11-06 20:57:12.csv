The last few women ive dated ive felt more chemistry, fun with, personality similarities etc. But not sexual chemistry. This one the sex is off the charts every time. And we also have good conversations/fun. But in the back of my mind I just feel that she isnt someone id really want a serious relationship with. It has its moments, like last night. We were laying in bed and i mentioned I had never been the little spoon. She began to spoon me and we layed there and laughed about it for almost an hour making jokes etc. Or the fact that the first night we were together I had mentioned my dads passing and she immediately became empathetic and asked questions about him etc. Nobody else has done this for me.. So i think maybe I just need to give it more time, explore having fun with her outside of sex and see if it develops. But also I have had the feeling on the past with other women that immediately I was more infatuated with them, and im.wondering why I m not feeling this now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qoeyoq/howwhen_do_you_know_when_there_is_a_potential/
5,qof6ux,1636252118,Do you think it is morally wrong to hang out alone with someone who is married?,"I know my situation isn’t exactly dating imo but I posted here since it sort of makes sense in terms of the demographic I want to answer it if that makes sense 

Background+My opinion: 

We are just friends as far as I’m(24m) concerned. She’s(25f) attractive to me yes but neither of us ever make moves on each other &amp; don’t see each other in that way

Ironically we did meet on a dating app then I found out she is in a different country &amp; was looking for friends to talk to+she’s also married

It honestly didn’t bother me at all plus I’ve had just online friends before for years &amp; still do 

We found out we like the same game chess so we would play online &amp; that’s all 

A few months later she texted me saying she moved out of her country &amp; actually to my area like a city over then suggested we play a game irl+also hang out with her friends she has in the area too

So we did that together as a group but I drove her since she doesn’t have a car &amp; she paid me back gas for the long 1 hour trip

She shared a lot of interesting stuff about her past+comparing a 3rd world country she grew up in vs America where I’m from

Also she mentioned her husband but rarely &amp; ive never met or seen the dude irl

I just know what he looks like from her pictures online in social media but I did notice that when she reached out to me all the pics of the husband vanished deleted

I didn’t bring it up at all

I even offered if he wants to come to but she said he doesn’t 

I’ve been hanging out with her the last 3 weeks &amp; today we went out alone to a cafe then had a wonderful time playing chess for a few hours+laughing a lot

However I noticed she doesn’t even wear a ring which again I didn’t bring up 

No flirting at all beyond joking with each other the same way I would mess with my bros &amp; I tone down the cursing

The only thing I do different with her is open doors for her etc because it just feels right/how I was raised which she thanks me for then we move on

We still pay our own separate stuff like friends though 

I’m not expecting anything stupid like she leaves her husband for me or some insane hallmark movie crap but I really enjoy her company/talking to her &amp; truly wanna stay friends 

I’m still active on dating apps trying to make plans for dates which have all recently been disappointing as hell in terms of chemistry so it’s nice being with a friend 

She’s also aware I’m still actively dating as she enjoys my stories about the hilariously bad ones 

My friends/family thinks hanging out with her is weird/wrong &amp; I don’t. Are they right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qof6ux/do_you_think_it_is_morally_wrong_to_hang_out/

We live 90min away from each other and both have crazy schedules, so were having trouble meeting up. We had great chemistry on the app. We were both looking forward to meeting each other. I asked him to dinner on short notice and he agreed, so we both drove an hour to meet.

It was a total flop. Just awkward. Lots of silences. I’m not sure if he was just nervous or what, but it definitely wasn’t worth the drive. As we were walking out, I told him I’d like to see him again, but my schedule was crazy. He offered his phone number and I told him to send it to me via Tinder. He sends me a neutral “it was a pleasure”, and I said the same. He asked if I’d like to hang again. I told him I’d be open to that. He sends his number, and I didn’t text him. He followed up on Friday and I told him I would check my schedule.

He seems like a nice guy, but it just wasn’t a great fit. I don’t want to reject him outright, since I had such a great time messaging him.

Last time we were all hanging out I realized that his gf (24F) is a bit possessive over him, and always seems to break up our conversation. I hadn't seen him in a while and I was bringing up another friend that was in town that we hadnt seen in a while and she barged in and starting hugging/kissing him, making it weird and i left. Then a while later that night we were sitting next to each other and he asked if I was seeing anybody and I had barely said yes before she again started sitting on his lap and being physical (which sucked bc i lowkey wanted to talk about the guy i was seeing lol).  I wasn't weirdly close to him, i wasnt flirting, it was all very chill but the more she did it the more i noticed she would intentionally break our conversations up. I dont know if she sees me as a threat, she did say that the first time they met at a party, she thought he and i were dating. I'd always gotten the feeling she didn't like me and idk if she thinks im gonna try to steal him but I'd love to be friends with her and I would not do that to another woman.

24,qogzl9,1636258768,How to work through missing out on dating experiences in my 20s?,"I am headed into my late 20s and I have never had a girlfriend or hooked up with a woman. I have been on dates but things never really worked out, I was rejected, ghosted, we didnt connect, or most of the time women played games and kept me as a back up option. This was probably due to my lack of confidence, being too available and accommodating, being naive, and never speaking up or just walking away when something seemed off since I didnt know what was ok and what wasnt since I trusted and cared about these women. I dont even tell women Im inexperienced but I guess they know. I havent even been on a date in a few years and dating apps dont work for me.

Everyone says things like the right woman is out there, and that dating gets better when youre older or whatever but I dont care about meeting some make believe perfect woman or waiting to get a chance when Im 60. I missed out on the best years of my life to start a long and meaningful relationship, I missed out on creating memories and sharing my most important and fun life moments with a woman, I missed out on the college experience, on dating around and having fun, on being a womans first anything and sharing that experience with them. I missed out on learning and growing with dating in my 20s and learning about what I want and how relationships and dating work.

To anyone who says dating in your 20s and in college is irrelevant or that you can learn all of that later in life youre wrong. A few years ago I was made fun of by friends who are women for being inexperienced and was told that women settle for guys like me in their 40s not have fun with in their 20s. I already missed out on everything I wanted and cared to experience, at best now I will be settled for like I was told I would be. And aside from what I wanted, women will find me repulsive for being inexperienced and they werent exactly treating me that well before anyways.

They will expect me to know how everything works, they wont care about my own insecurities or what I missed out on and wanted, they will expect me to be ready to settle down and they will compare me to their exes or other guys. And to anyone who says Im wrong or its not like that, it is. I know this happens due to how friends talk about dating, through what women told me directly, through all these posts on reddit. All the fun and excitement and worthwhile experiences can never happen now, at best Im the guy women settle for now or they will just never want me and I dont know whats worse.

Other people my age are still going around having fun or in long and meaningful relationships, and that will continue for them until they want to settle down or they will just keep having fun. They get to look back at their lives and think about all the people they were with, their college experiences, the fun in their 20s, all the memories they shared, all I have are my lonely nights in bed thinking about how women just played games with me and no one ever wanted me. There is nothing good or positive that can happen now in regards to dating and being a single virgin isnt some rewarding or fun thing or worth the wait if it ever changes. I just dont know how Im expected to just get over it and pretend to be happy for the rest of my life when everything I ever wanted that people have easily experienced over and over through their 20s will never happen for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qogzl9/how_to_work_through_missing_out_on_dating/

If im not mistaken I was his first kiss (mind the guy came out of the closet with very few friends). After that, we went to our houses and I sent him a text that I was happy about it, and he said that it was mutual. 2 days later, we haven’t talked and texted him how he’s been and that i’ve been thinking of him. He then replied like 7 hours later that everything was good, everyone is getting ready for haloween, and he’s been thinking about me too (idk why but the message seemed a little dry to me). Asked him later if he was going out and he never replied back which it seemed weird. 3 days later I texted him if we could talk, and he said yes. Told him I felt him a little bit out of touch and asked him if everything was good, and he said that everything was fine, that he spent time with friends, talked with friends and family, and just visited places, and that he was sorry I got that impression and that he will try being more interactive. I basically said that I had that feeling, and wanted to talk about it because I got really interested on him. A little more of talk, and he said that he’s down to keep it going and see where it took us, just small steps. Few messages more and we finished talking, me saying I love him, and he replied with 🥰🥰
We had that conversation on Monday and it’s Saturday now and he never texted me. Im obiously not going to text him, but im just confused about the whole situation because I basically gave the opportunity for him to tell me if he wasn’t interested but he said he was. I really dont know what to do now, and I need you guys to share your thoughts on this, and give me some advice.

34,qohl7r,1636261196,I'm pissed off at people who had a normal youth.,"There is a serious disconnect between my age (28M) and my ""expected"" life stage. So I'm pretty much screwed. It just makes me so goddamn angry at everyone who got to have all those normal youthful experiences that I missed out on. Both in dating and in socializing general. Why can't I have them too? Why am I expected to skip over those experiences and start conforming to the ""mature"" settled-down, corporate slave, lifestyle? I hate that fucking lifestyle. And even if I wanted to (which I don't) I'm so far behind I couldn't ever meet their stupid expectations. Cause it'll take for me to get that point, and by that time, I'll be even older and people will have higher expectations of me. 

So there's nothing I can do. I just wanted to be able to experience the things I missed out on, but everyone my age has moved on, and have become just completely shitty, unlikeable people. I hate them. I hate the fucking mature crowd. I hate the fact that they got to have all the normal experiences and I didn't. I just can't take this anymore. I'm just so goddamn angry and I don't know what to do about it. I just feel so hopeless.

In this seven year stretch there have been three women I had extremely deep feelings for and asked out, rejected by all. So I've been trying at least.

Anyways, been single since I was eighteen, haven't even had a single date since then. I don't know what to do anymore. Back around the three year mark I started working on myself, going to the gym, moved out of my parents house, got a good job, none of those changed anything.

I think the reason I can't meet anyone is my social life, I can't meet anyone naturally. No siblings to introduce me to anyone they might know, my friend pool is an odd situation, the two friends I have are both hella long distance, so they can't set me up with anyone they know.

36,qohppl,1636261663,bf claims to use tinder for validation .. happy bday to me,"… so here we are guys. just found out my boyfriend of three years has been using tinder. i’m fucking devastated. just signed a new lease in september. he has been logging on periodically for a fucking year. even has had tinder gold. twice. i am the one who made mistakes at the beginning of our relationship (that he’s aware of). i know he has hardly forgiven me for them. i sincerely regret it and i would never do it again. truthfully. i fucked up and i’m glad he took me back. he’s had trust issues for the last two years and i have tried to be patient with him. he takes it personally a lot when i don’t want to be intimate with him (sexually or not) and i feel bad because he’s just more of an intimate person than i am and feels loved most through physical connection. he basically feels as if i should rip off his shirt every time he comes home and i’m just not as physical, but nonetheless i still enjoy and need intimate moments with him i just don’t think the frequency completely satisfies him. so here we are. he’s admitting to it (there’s no way not to. i’m very thorough once i get set on something) and while saying it’s no excuse he says that he did it when he would feel super down about himself to get attention &amp; validation. that he had tinder gold to look at all the people that liked him. that he felt like shit after every time and it never did anything but he still did it. he said he talked to even unattractive women just to get attention. i noticed the women were very under his league and mine , (not trying to be rude, just didn’t seem like the type of woman he’d go for) and in the conversations it was pretty clear that they hadn’t gone further than just messaging. (still extremely extremely hurtful. never knew how bad my s/o talking about someone’s butt would hurt especially since literally last night he wrote me a card for my birthday where it talked all about how nice my butt was) 
i don’t know why , but i believe him. i’m still disgusted. but i love him so much. i really do. i believe that he fucked up because i know how it feels to fuck up. several times. and then realize it and completely change. he didn’t have to give me a second chance but he did and it was well worth it. i’m so confused. i’m willing to work with this but my idiot self told my sister and best friend. yes the worst possible people i could’ve told who already don’t like him very much. 
i know he loves me and is obsessed with me it’s not for a lack of trying on his part it’s a lack of receiving on mine and i know it hurts him. i try to have sex with him more frequently and make up for it by cuddling and being affectionate when i’m not in the mood but it doesn’t seem like enough. if you are still here… wow. you need to be a therapist

someone please tell me, is my relationship doomed? I will put everything into this… I love this man",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qohppl/bf_claims_to_use_tinder_for_validation_happy_bday/

39,qoi43x,1636263382,Best friends girlfriends friend,"
TL;DR: my best friends girlfriends friend went off on me for something she accused me of doing so I left and gave her the silent treatment when I seen her. Am I wrong for treating her like this?

I met a chick through my best friend’s girlfriend, this girl is my best friend’s girlfriend’s best friend if that makes sense. We all hung out in a group and it was ok until she went off on a server at a restaurant just because she told this guy who was obviously drunk or on drugs he had to order or leave. I thought she did a bit much but was still ok, next time just me and her hung out at a hookah bar which was really platonic so we just talked and stuff and I dropped her off at home. A week later Me, my BF,his GF, and that same girl all go bar hopping and it was fun until we went to go get something to eat and I started laughing because I was a bit drunk and she started getting loud and aggressive at me and accused me of laughing at her friend. At that point I didn’t wanna argue with her so I got up paid for my food and apologized to her, the next day I was pissed she snapped on me for no reason so I don’t text her at all until she texts me about leaving her charger in my car. After that I don’t contact her at all, my friend tells me to come through to his place to drink so I come over and bring some drinks. I notice the same girl who snapped on me is there, I just ignore her and don’t even say hi to her because just seeing her got me heated. My friends GF and that girl leave, I pack up my stuff and told my friend I was leaving because she was here before they come back. After I left my best friend who was a bit buzzed must of straight up told that girl I didn’t wanna be around her so she started texting me on Instagram saying things like “if I had something to say to say to her face”, “you’re not a real man”, etc. she even tried face timing me but I ignored all of it so she blocked me.

There are a couple of potential red flags though. He seems to be very invested already and deleted the app after 6 days of talking. He asked me to delete mine as well, but I told him I'm not ready to do that as we don't know each other well enough and wanted to wait to meet before deciding that. I asked him if he's that sure of me to delete his dating apps &amp; he said that he's sure and that he trusts me and that I'm different than other girls he's talked to. He is very charming with his words, and he's not originally from the US so sometimes the language/cultural barrier is a bit hard to navigate. I'm not sure if it is normal where he's from (China) to talk about marriage so soon. He seems to be from a wealthy family &amp; helps manage his family's business. He's even mentioned having me manage our finances together in the future and talks about wanting to help me achieve my goals. So I've recently brought up the topic of meeting up with him, and he tells me he is really busy with work at the moment and can't meet until his contract is up, which is in 20-30 days. I asked him if he's even free for a quick coffee and again he tells me that all his time every day is spent on work. My friend is telling me that he's just bsing me by delaying meeting me &amp; that his words and actions don't match up. I'm just not sure if I should wait it out because he might actually be busy? or if I should be pushing for him to meet with me soon? I'm really starting to like him, and it's only been 2 weeks.

I do however work from home on some days and so if I don’t see her for 2 to 3 days I’ll sometimes get nervous and think that I should at least text her to say hi. 

BUT the few times I’ve texted her just to say hi or to chit chat, she’s taken a long time to reply and so I figured that may be she’s just not a major texter, which is totally fine with me because I am not one either. 

Today she texted me asking if we could postpone a date as she wasn’t feeling well and wanted to stay in this weekend. I responded by saying that was totally fine and I hope she feels better. I then made a funny comment about a show we are currently both watching on HBO, to which she replied she can’t wait to finish watching it this weekend. I thumbs upped the message and assumed the conversation had naturally ended there. 

To my surprise she immediately, texted back asking how my week was etc. After a couple of quick exchanges, we both started taking long to reply to each other. It’s now gotten kinda weird and it gets weirder with each reply. I feel like we need to have some kind of discussion about our expectations on texting. 

Here are my questions: 
How can I bring up the issue of texting expectations and have a conversation about it with her in a non-weird way?

How do you determine when to maintain sustained text convos and when not to do so?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qojg9q/navigating_texting_when_you_see_the_person_quite/
63,qojhli,1636269608,AITA (M27) for ghosting a girl (F31) because she’s bipolar?,"This is a bit awkward— I recently matched with someone on a dating app. We’ve only talked for a day and conversation flows really well, smooth so far. She linked her Instagram in her bio and I checked it out and saw she shared a post about how a few years ago she was assaulted by a previous date, that triggered a manic phase in her that caused her to lose her job and spend all her savings, found out she was bipolar, and became homeless for a time — then by the grace of friends and others has re-settled and built her life back across the last few years. 

I’m glad that she’s in a much healthier place, lives in her own apartment now and maintaining good relationships — but she recently (this year) quit her job cold turkey to pursue her dreams of writing (and is doing fine with freelance gigs). I’m really concerned that she’s bipolar, not as a stigma, but if I’ll be able to navigate a relationship well. I was adopted so I don’t know my biological family’s medical history and my adoptive father was bipolar (before he passed away) — and I know the struggles of what that journey may look like. I don’t want to hurt her because she seems genuinely amazing, but I also don’t want to continue in starting a relationship that I may not be able to cope with in the future if things become too intense with her mental health journey. I don’t want to throw any stigma to her struggles, so I thought it might be best to just unmatch with her and not say anything?

He is looking for a serions relationship and seems like a normal Guy (stable job, Friends etc).
During our last date, I guess we felt more confortable with each other.
Then he tells me he doesnt like interracial couples ( hmm okay). I Tell him that it doesnt make sens since he is white and i am North African.. why is he dating me ?
He then tells me he thinks it's just shouldnt be the rule and changes the subject.
I was surprised because most his Friends are not white !

I can’t say he fully ghosted me, but … he kinda did. It was basically a “no answer is an answer” kind of answer. 

While not devastated, I was really hurt. I went full no contact for seven months and never heard from him. 

It just … wow. I still feel awful about it. Is it a bad idea to send him a letter saying how hurtful his behavior was? I don’t expect him to change or come back, but I wonder if it would help me feel better for voicing how much it bothered me to be treated with such disrespect. I had always been really good to him.

74,qok9kv,1636273268,Tinder location updated,"Hi everyone,

26M here - over a month ago, I matched with this girl, and we hit it off immediately. 

We’ve since been on 5 dates, 3 of which we basically spent the whole day/night together. 

We haven’t had sex just yet, but lots of cuddling, making out, and oral sex.

During the 3rd date, we were cuddling on the couch, and her phone popped up a generic Bumble notification. We both saw it but said nothing. An hour later, a Hinge notification popped up - we both saw it, and I made a quick joke to say ‘You’re a bit popular this evening!’. She quickly turned it down and said she wasn’t active / using the app. 

The next day, we were hanging out again at my place (4th date), and we were cuddled up at night, having a deep/meaningful conversation. At this point, I told her that I wanted to date her exclusively, in the sense that I was not talking to any other girls or seeing any other girls, and wanted to focus on building us. She acknowledged this and firstly apologised that I had to see those notifications, and she assured me that she wasn’t talking to anyone else or seeing anyone else, or even using the apps. 

Now today, she’s been out of town, visiting a close friend from high school, and she said they were hanging out for the day. I decided to open up Tinder to delete my account, and her location/kilometres are exactly the same as the town she is in (she otherwise lives like 10 minutes from me, so I know the location is different).

I don’t know how I feel about this. After I explicitly told her how I felt about us, and her acknowledging this, it feels like she still is using Tinder?

Should I ask her about this?

TLDR: dating a girl, we both talked about not using dating apps / seeing each other exclusively, and her Tinder location just updated. Don’t know whether to talk to her about this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qok9kv/tinder_location_updated/
75,qokci7,1636273661,Breakup that I don't understand.,"Okay so a few months ago a coworker and I started talking. She asked me for my Instagram and my Snapchat, I apologize for my bad English it's not my first language. So her and I started talking we hit it off instantly, we got along very well. We started talking sexually very fast, she told me that from the first time she saw me that she liked me and that she knew that she would have me one day. I told her I just wanted to have fun but she told me she wanted to be in a relationship. I told her I didn't want to date and that I wasn't ready she told me that she would wait. She kept asking me over and over again about dating her and stuff like that. So a few weeks after her and I started talking we hung out we went on a date we had a great time. We went out again a few weeks later they went a lot further this time. Turn the time her and I are talking everyday having a great time getting to know each other everything was going perfect. A few weeks after her and I started talking she told me I like you I said I like you too. So we hung out again another time and this time we had sex multiple times in the same night. So after that a few days after she asked me are you ready to be in a relationship now I said yes. Everything was going fine. When her and I started talking we even spoke about traveling together, she said I'll meet her sister and her cousin. About a week or two after we start dating she told me, everything was going really fast she didn't get a time to think, she said I'm trying to get to know you everyday but I don't think this is it she said I don't think we're meant to be. A few days after that I spoke to her after can I tell you how I feel she said yes so I basically gave her a long explanation about how I feel about her. She said let me get my head together. The thing is the same day she told me that she doesn't think we're meant to be her and I were speaking and talking about hanging out on that weekend she was acting like she was cool with it. I asked her  is there anyone else she said no why? I don't remember what I said though. I asked  do you like me she said yes, she said yes I like you. This happened the third week of October I don't hear from her anymore unless I message her. I messaged her a few days ago telling her I don't hear from her anymore I feel like she doesn't care, we never speak stuff like that she said I'm getting ready for work I'll message you and again she never did. But she's always posting on Snapchat on Instagram. I want to delete her and unfollow her but my friends say no because you never know what could happen. She talks to me at work but now she doesn't really make eye contact we spoke a lot a few days ago work but outside of work now I don't hear from her anymore. We used to speak everyday I would message her first or she would message me. I just basically wanted to know everyone's opinion? Another thing is she told me she said she's going through a lot right now she needed space so I gave her her space but I still don't hear from her anymore. Another thing is she told me she doesn't have sex with her friends so if we had sex we have to date after so we did date after that happened. The thing I don't understand is she kept asking me so many times about dating her and why don't I want to date her she kept telling me she wants to be in a relationship. We get in one everything was fine then she just ends it. Her and I got along so well it's so hard to see her everyday still, everyday we went on we always had a great time together and we always spoke about it after. We were able to talk so long about so many different topics and it felt so nice. Cuz she actually did like me then why hasn't she messaged me in so long why do I always have to message her.

I know it shouldn't. But my girlfriend has told me details about her past and that is hurting me. Details like how many times she met her ex (only 1 ex) and I think it is around 20 times. My count in the past would have been the same but I don't remember exactly. She just wanted to tell me everything beforehand in being super honest. For her, sex was really a big thing and she did only because she thought that the guy would marry her but that guy is a certified asshole for using her in the name of love.

She feels sorry for herself a lot and while sharing her thoughts, she often brings the topic of her ex. I feel sorry for her because she was treated very badly and she beared it just because she thought that guy will marry her. She was in depression due to that guy. She sometimes even thinks she doesn't deserve love because of her past.

Now I love her very much.. I want to care for her all my life. She too loves me a lot. But whenever I remember her past, I feel bad and hurt. I think I would not be able to give her happiness because of my habit of overthinking. I even got anxiety when she used to tell me those details and even suffered from a loss of appetite.

I really can't imagine my life without her but at the same time I think she has really suffered a lot and I don't want her to make her suffer more because of my overthinking.

Yesterday I asked if she was free today and if she wanted to meet up for lunch. She said yes and asked if her time was fine. I said yes and asked what she's craving...

No reply, message seen. The whole day there was no reply and the following morning nothing. So I sent her a nice message saying things most likely won't work so best if luck etc.

Anyone knows what is going on? Genuinely confused. Is this a sign of catfishing?

I mean if you planned to meet tomorrow, shouldn't you at least reply so I could plan and stuff... What's this leave on read shit",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qom2d4/i_was_talking_to_a_girl_who_takes_ages_to_reply/

91,qome4h,1636283262,He mocked me while we were hanging out. Don’t know how to feel.,"TLDR: A guy I thought I liked, and who apparently still likes me, mocked me twice at our catch-up and it kinda hurt, and I don’t really know what to do.

Yesterday I met with a guy who has been my friend for several years, but we’ve always had chemistry (and ages ago we told each other we liked each other). Back then, we went out on a few dates and they went well. Then Covid-19 happened, and we drifted a bit. We couldn’t see each other for an entire year due to the lockdowns that happened in my city. We talked on and off during that time, and then drifted a bit more. More recently, due to the lockdowns ending, we got talking again in a nice/flirty way and he seemed really interested and keen to see me again. I was interested too. We arranged this and met for a garden walk and coffee.

It was really nice to see him again, but to be honest, I felt low and quite disappointed after our catch-up. He was the same as he’d always been, but maybe the year apart changed certain things. Maybe it’s me who changed, and now I see him and some of his flaws with ‘fresh’ eyes. Maybe I realised we’re not as compatible as I thought (or hoped). 

He barely asked me any questions about myself at all. Whereas I was the one who asked him questions about different things in his life. He talked a lot about stuff, and about himself, but didn’t seem to truly want to know about my life or how I’d been. Whilst we shared good banter/jokes as usual, I felt as though we were on different pages in terms of emotional intelligence. He also mocked me twice (mocked what I said and ‘copied’ me in a high pitched voice), which I didn’t like. I was really thrown off-guard by this. I actually said to him, “please don’t mock me” and he said, “whoah, okay, that’s going against my entire personality, yikes”. He jokes around all the time with everyone, but I just didn’t like how his comments made me feel. At the same time, he mentioned things like me meeting his housemates, or us going on a road trip, which implies to me he may still be interested. Yet, I came away feeling down and a bit disappointed - I’d hoped I’d still have strong feelings for him like I used to. 

Now I don’t know what to do. He’s still messaging me, and he probably thinks yesterday went really well. I don’t know if I should give him another ‘chance’, or whether I should mention that I’m not sure if I’m interested in him in that way anymore. Maybe I should wait to see if he wants to meet again. I feel stuck, because I think he still likes me, and he thinks I still like him too, but I don’t feel good about him mocking me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qome4h/he_mocked_me_while_we_were_hanging_out_dont_know/

94,qomoga,1636284536,Just found out he is divorced,"I (24F) met this guy (M24) on Bumble. He was only looking for hookup plans because he ”can’t feel anything and doesn’t want to commit”. But three months later the truth is we now have a really nice relationship (he is my first bf and I really like him). I thought his heart was broken because of a past relationship that ended poorly but I just found out he was married. Everything makes sense - the fact that he was sleeping with multiple girls, that he doesn’t feel anything, that he is emotionally detached… 

But I don’t know what to do now that I know and that he still thinks I don’t. We never talked about why he was like that as I knew it was a hard topic and I wanted to let him talk to me about it when he was ready.

95,qomq90,1636284754,So Iv been talking to this girl a lot and we are both each others best friend on Snapchat. Then all of sudden she just left me on open. I sent her 2 more snaps in the past 24 hours and she left those on open too. Why is this?,"Should I send another snap later today? She has been on her phone because her score has gone up a lot and she’s posted on her private story. 
She is in half of my classes and walks with me daily. We talked all day on Friday, she left me on open in Friday night (I’m like ok that’s fine she is probably going to sleep). I send her a message in the morning and I get left on open, I then send her another one at like 11pm and that gets left on open too…..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qomq90/so_iv_been_talking_to_this_girl_a_lot_and_we_are/
