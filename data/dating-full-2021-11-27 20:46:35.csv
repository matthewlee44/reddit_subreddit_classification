I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130278,public,self,Is she attracted to me?

I recently ended things with a guy (I’ll call him W) I had been seeing the past few months, though it was nothing serious. I have been also seeing this other guy and felt a true genuine connection that I wasn’t receiving from W. Everything kind of just feels “right”, where as with W I couldn’t exactly pinpoint what was wrong but it felt like he was putting up a barrier that wasn’t allowing me to connect. 

When I ended things with him, I was fully upfront in explaining I had deep feeling for someone else and I mentioned that I didn’t feel like he was that interested in me. He then said that he was bad at communicating and the drive (40 min) was difficult for him to make all the time so he wasn’t able to see me as much as he wanted to and probably is what led me to think he wasn’t interested. He then added that he cares about me and wants what’s best but also to let him know if things don’t work out with the other guy….. 

Though truthfully there was some kind of internal guide, my intuition, that was telling me it wasn’t gonna work out with W even though there was a major attraction there. Whereas with the other guy I felt safe to be authentic from the get go and even though I didn’t feel an initial attraction it was one of those situations where I was like wow I would’ve never imagined I’d fall for this person. 

But I feel conflicted. On the one hand I have someone who I feel in my gut is right but W’s response has been gnawing at me. Idk if it’s cause I crave some sort of chaos and ambiguity but I’ve entered into relationships in the past where it didn’t end well because of that. W also is leaving for a job out of state in a few months and I didn’t wanna risk missing out on someone who I could see a relationship with and offers stability just to stick around on the possibility that W would pursue something with me. 

Did I make the right choice? I feel like I may just be doubting myself because W likes me but there’s also a sort of passion there…. But again I feel like the other guy gets me inexplicably and I find that he’s the first person I go to for advice and reassurance",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130276,public,self,Intuition,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3mths/intuition/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Sorry this is long, I just wanted to provided detail if I could.

In the first class, there are two sets of three rows of desks, facing each other, and we face each other at an angle.

The teacher's desk is on my side, but by the other wall where the whiteboard is. She doesn't really have a reason to look towards me because of whats going on in class, but I would see her look my direction a couple times each class. It wasn't a lot of staring or anything, but more than normal. I tried to avoid eye contact so im not being creepy, but it would occasionally happen, and typcally we both looked away quickly.

This goes on for about two weeks, and there was a time when I was working in the hall alone, she looked back at me over her shoulder. Again we didn't make eye contact, but I was alone so I can't imagine she was looking at something else.

So, I go sit at her table in the the second class as she sits with a few of my friends, and we can move around to collaborate on worksheets. The first day, I ask the whole group if I should stay to do a mini presentation with them, or go back to my group. She's the first one to tell me to stay, but my friends do too. Normally she's quite shy around people she doesn't talk to, she'll talk really quietly and that sort of thing, so this kinda surprised me.

Over the following couple of weeks, I go to her table when we have worksheets. I could get her to laugh, but that was when everyone else laughed too. We've got a good bit in common, we both play soccer, we both have a lot of the same classes, that sort of thing. There was a time where a sub incorrectly said my last name, and she brought it up later when I went to her table. So, she's paying at least a little bit of attention to me even when I wasn't at her table. She also would lean over to watch if I was coming over to her table when my friends invited me over.

I see a lot of good signs, and I ask for her number after a class. She gives it to me, I immediately text her so she has my number. That weekend I text her asking a question about soccer, as it's something we have in common and we can start talking more outside of class. I get no response.

So, I think she's not interested and I messed something up. But then she's staring even more in the first class. She'd glance over while laughing with her friends, she'd angle herself so she could face me, and she'd even lean up and over people at times to take a glance, and I noticed her messing with her hair sometimes, something I didn't previously notice. Again, I avoided directly looking at her as I thought she didn't want to talk to me and I didn't want to be weird.

A week goes by of this, but we moved tables in the second class so I no longer have an excuse to talk to her. I do manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and apologized quite a bit. That doesn't really make sense why she couldn't text back later.

Another week goes by, and I decide to text her again, as I don't think I'll have a chance to randomly talk to her, and I have no other choice. I ask her if she didn't respond because she didn't want to talk to me, and tell her I don't mind if thats the case. Again, no response.

That was a thursday, and the day after she's staring waaaay more, and its pretty excessive. With the new seats in the second class, when she turns her head to look at the board she has an angle to look at me before she looks at the board. When im looking at the board I see her in my peripheral vision, and every single time she looked to the board from her notes and back, she paused for a moment when she had an angle to look at me.

I am not exaggerating here, even though I wasn't directly looking at her, I could clearly she her head turned towards me, she was touching her hair a lot, and sometimes looked at something irrelevant like a wall after she paused for a moment, and sometimes staring for several seconds. Again, I never made eye contact as I thought she didn't want to talk to me.

This goes on for the following week, just toned down a bit. She's still messing with her hair frequently, and glancing over very frequently. We get off wednesday for thankgiving, so I finally decided I should try to talk to her before the break. I stare back that tuesday to get her attention, we made eye contact a few times and I'm pretty sure she noticed.

She left the first class a good before I did, but she was walking usually slowly and ended up right in front of me. I still was unsure of what she was thinking, so I just chickened out and slowed down too. After the second class we both go the same way again, so I figure I'll just try to talk to her then. I usually leave first, but this time some people I know wanted to talk about a recent test. She was about to leave behind me, but sees this and stops to look at her phone. As the group leaves, she follows, and I see her staring at me the whole time when I look over my shoulder at my friend. I figure I'd just wait for the group to leave to talk to her, but she goes home early. So, I feel like and idiot for letting the opportunity slip twice.

Based on that, is she interested or not, and just being weird? I know all I can do is actually talk to her, I'd just like to see if someone else has a better understanding of wth is going on.

Normally i'd just let it go by now, but she's a very nice person, she's also in like the top 1% of kids both academically and athletically, like she probably has an equal chance of getting into a D1 college for soccer or a 10% acceptance rate school. Plus, she's very pretty so if I have a shot I definitely dont want to quit before I figure out what's going on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130280,public,self,im in a confusing situation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3n106/im_in_a_confusing_situation/,,,,,,,

Our dynamic has always been fun, sarcastic, and all around great.  I would go to his office often and just vent to him and he would talk to me and give me advice and just chat. He even gave me his phone number before I ever had him in class, so that I could text him if I was going to campus to do research during the breaks and see if he would be there too. Weve always been kinda touchy too (not inappropriately, but whenever we would pass by each other we would maybe play punch the other or put a hand on the others shoulder or something. We also hug every time we see each other. ) he does that with other students too but I feel like it’s more frequent with me. I remember once we were walking down the hallway and I put my hand on his shoulder and he put his hand on it. Idk, small things but they make me think. Weve still been in touch since I graduated in May. It’s all very platonic (I think?) but I just can’t help but have feelings for him. We have great chemistry and everything is so effortless with him. Now that I’ve graduated, he vents to me too and it’s great. We don’t really text or anything though, only from time to time whenever we plan to go to lunch or something. I also know how highly he thinks of me as a student and always tells me how much better I am than other students. I stuck around after graduation and helped him and his research student, and we’ve gotten lunch a couple times in the last couple months. We both consider each other friends.

I've (27, m) recently been dating this guy who's all around great. He spends a lot of time with me, is very fun and flirty, and is just generally very nice. When we're together, I feel extremely secure and happy. However, he's been very straightforward with me that he's not a good texter. Honestly, I don't even like texting and my texting with friends is very sparse.

Unfortunately, when we're apart I start feeling insecure and I guess I feel like I ""need"" him to text me in order to feel like he's still interested. This is pretty ridiculous on my part--he does so much outside of texting to show he likes me and he already said he's not good at texting. He even *attempts* to be good at texting, which I know is an effort he's making just for me.

Still, I just can't get over the mental block. I really don't wanna fuck this up. I catch myself thinking things like ""wow, he never messages me just to chat, he must not be thinking of me"" or things along those lines which then makes me question if I should just let it go. It's so stupid. And the craziest part is I know that if he *did* start texting me all the time, I'd be genuinely annoyed by it. 

How can I overcome my insecurities in these times that we're not together? I think this is being exacerbated by the holidays where I'm not seeing him nearly as often as we're both out of town.

We had both decided to take some time off from each other due to our depression making it hard for us to maintain a long-distance friendship. We started talking again last month and had been texting each other almost every day until last week. I haven't heard from her since last Wednesday. Two days prior she apologized for being bad at responding to my messages. She told me she's not doing great right now because of her depression and school piling up due to finals. I don't hear from her on Wednesday so I decided to send a follow-up text on Monday just to check in on her. I don't get a reply. Days later I notice she's posting on insta and hanging out with her friends. I can't help but think this is something personal but on the other hand, maybe texting requires a lot of emotional energy from her. I just don't understand why she couldn't tell me she wants to be alone or is incredibly busy at the moment. I find it odd that we were having fun texting each other then she suddenly goes silent without warning.

This isn't the first time she's gone silent like this for a couple of days. Months prior to our break she was also going through rough depression and would disappear like now. Before she went silent last week I wanted to have a call to discuss boundaries and communication so if something like this were to occur we would both feel secure. Now I'm conflicted on whether I should send a message telling her I want to have this conversation. I feel like I shouldn't because I'm not sure what's really going on and if it's really about her depression and school piling up due to finals then I don't want to stress her out even more. School is already hard for her due to her ADHD and she's prone to having bad depression.

She's been avoiding me with stupid excuses and it hurts me. We live in two different cities so during this month we could only communicate by texts. She was always ""too busy"" for a quick call and even to catch up, while being in a nearby town for her relatives over the past weekend. In my last message, I played it cool by saying I respected that She had other priorities and I wasn't entitled to her time. Then, I reaffirmed that I wasn't seeking for anything more than a platonic friendship (that I wasn't hoping to get into her pants basically) and shared something personal about my orientation issues. I concluded the message with a question: do you still want us to be friends?

We started hanging out alone this summer when he invited me for lunch and then we went out for drinks a couple of times playing minigolf and satt and there's been some flirting on snapchat. He sent me selfies of himself asking which ones to use on his social media accounts and I was like I'm really bad at this you'll have to ask another girl and he was like you're the only girl I'm talking to. We used to text regularly on Snapchat although the frequency has kind of stopped a bit. If I'm not mistaken, there is sexual tension between us but I'm not sure. I think I might be mildly autistic because I suck at picking up subtle cues. 

I've met his friends and I've been to his place briefly when I had to pee and he was like let's go to my place I live nearby (lol). He has asked if I have a boyfriend in a joking way and whenever I'm out with some male friends he is always asking who I'm with. Recently I've also noticed his friend acting weird whenever I'm around, like there's a teasing vibe in the air and he knows something I don't. There was also this time recently when I was joking how I could only get socially awkward guys because I'm socially awkward myself and he was like no worries, those guys go on to become the next Bill Gates/Musk, and then in his last Snapchat he was like ""who knows maybe I'm the next Gates/Musk"". He has also said once I should stop using Tinder and try to meet someone in real life. He has also had longer hair and beard before, and I once said I like guys with short hair and beard and he got a haircut after a while and kept the beard/stubble.

My crush has always been snapchatting me when out drinking. What I find funny is that he never says something substantial. I feel like he wants my attention/a reaction from me. He calls me names from our internal jokes, says gibberish stuff, and has even called me when quite plastered. I took a snap of him being drunk and was like yeah I have this saved now trying to embarrass him and then he sent a snap he took of me when I was drunk and was like yeah I have one too! The day after he reached out and was like ""send me the Snap you took of me drunk"" and then asked me something completely different about some game, recommended me a tv show to watch and so on. Quite weird. 

So I'm like 100% positive he isn't into me and I probably just want to move on with my life and get rid of this urequited crush. Should I just be honest with him that I like him more than friends and want to move on with life if he doesn't feel the same? But I don't want to pressure him or anything and would like to maintain a cordial friendship with him. How should I tell him?

Again I'm mildly autistic and I don't trust my judgement when it comes to dating and relationships. Would appreciate help.

Hello all,
Please be prepared for a long read….
I have been dating this guy for over a year now, and he’s chased me for a few years before I finally gave in and gave him a shot with me.At first things were great and now things seem as though it is falling apart. Well about 3 months ago, we signed our first lease together for a home and have been here ever since….around the same time of signing the lease, he asked me to marry him. In period that me and him have been together, we rarely have any happy memories shared together whereas spending time takes place because…he always hangs out with his friends and nearly always cancels plans with me to hang out with them….he also feels that I shouldn’t know his whereabouts but any time I should go out, he has to know mine. We both work different shifts at our jobs and sometimes 6-7 days a week and rarely have time together and when we do, he always leaves me home alone and when I start to tell him how I feel, he tells me to “suck it up” or sometimes it leads to a heated argument. I had even began to suggest to him that he should find a way to balance his time between spending time with I and his friends, but it’s going nowhere. And lastly, lastnight, when he came home, he left his phone unlocked and I happened to see that he has added his ex on social media and started sending her the “😍” emoji and swears that it was for her 4-year old daughter’s picture but the picture isn’t anywhere to be seen. This ex that I am referring to is the ex that he dated for two years before me. I am feeling so many emotions right now…. 😢🥺…I don’t even know what else to do…",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130310,public,self,Im exhausted and feeling too many emotions… I don’t know what to do at all…,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3pplt/im_exhausted_and_feeling_too_many_emotions_i_dont/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Her friends are really chaotic tho and will do pranks or take her phone or do stuff to mess with her. But she’s a relatively calm and peaceful person 

We go on dates once or twice a week and just Vibe. The dates have been amazing and she told me she really likes me. 

She’s a very sweet, innocent and genuine girl. Everything felt real and connected and shes so kind and considerate even tho she’s a brat at times lol

The other day  We had an amazing date, she told me she really liked me, she wants to be dating and she texted me when she got home. Later I got a text from her phone…it was another from dude and it said “she’s not home bro, she’s with me. I’m the guy she can’t leave” and send a pic of her shoes on the ground 

I texted her this morning asking what the hell. 

Apparently she was seeing a guy a month or so before we met 

They broke up and hes been asking her for his stuff back 

She was gonna drop it off at his place in the afternoon before our date but she was super busy so she decided to drop it off after she and I had our date 

He asked to talk. 
She said no and he took the stuff that belonged to him and got mad took her car keys, and her phone and dragged her inside the house to talk and she said no 

He apparently threw her in the house, threw her in the couch and took off her shoes and started yelling and arguing about why the won’t get back together 

She said she hid in the bathroom and he still had her phone and send pictures to me and all her family and friends 

Apparently he sent a mass message of dick pics to her contacts and send exclusively messages a picture of her boots next to his saying “she’s with me bro I’m the guy she won’t leave alone” 

She then yelled at him and he started hitting and choking her and she fought back (this was at 2 am)

She then said they fought and argued til 10 am (8 hours) when she finally got her phone and keys back and she texted me asking to explain

But now she either no longer responds to texts and mainly on social media but its a hit or miss there to. I understand the time difference and she might be busy with work she got out there. But now I feel like all the effort I was putting was just diminished. We still follow each other on social media and private stories etc. I am trying to be patient and wait for her to come back so we can talk and try to re connect, there friends still talk to me and even there sibling started randomly following me on social media not to long ago. 

I am trying to let them have space so they can see there old friends again and work, but I am starting to feel neglected somewhat because sometimes my messages are just left on ""seen"" or just hit with a like button. I don't know what to do.

Hi everyone, I’m posting this here more as a way of venting then anything else. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. When we started it was very casual and we definitely didn’t want anything serious with each other but unfortunately things didn’t turn out the way. I’m in love with him and I know he is in love with me too, corny I know. I study abroad and I still have three years left to do but he studies back home and I don’t know if I’ll be here any time soon, because I wanna travel the world I wanna embrace new opportunities and I feel like I can’t do that here. I’m about to start my course and we started having conversations about what are we going to do when I leave. It’s just really hard because we don’t think we can do long distance, I would like to try it but I don’t think he’s into that but actually I know he doesn’t think he can do it. He’s scared and freaking out about fucking up. It just really hurts to break up with someone you really love and for the first time in nearly 3 years is the first person I’ve been able to be close to and love. I’ve had a very toxic relationship before this and it broke my confidence and my mental health, and I finally feel like I’ve regained it. I just don’t know what to do. It’s really hard to be in a relationship with a timestamp, I feel like we’re in a countdown. I know this is selfish, The thought of him moving on hurts me. It’s complicated because we won’t be in the same country for a few years, and it’s not like I can ask him to move with me abroad. So I guess I just have to accept it but it really hurts because this is someone that I’m still in love with, and I don’t know how to deal with the situation it would be so much easier if I didn’t like him anymore.

We did things intimately and even went out on a date, with thoughts and hopes on both sides of making things official. With immaturity and bad communication on both of our sides, we ended up getting into a bad disagreement but never stopped having sex for at least a year when we ultimately both moved back to our home towns; me in NY and him in MD. Besides our initial disagreement, we never really ended things. I could tell he didn’t want to talk to me and relationship was a bit strained but respectful. 

I entered a long term relationship a year after the split, stayed in it for 4.5 years. During the last 2 years of my relationship, a mutual friend of the college guy and I would tell me that he asked how I was. I shrugged this off as I felt like it was just coincidence and nothing to look into. This continued for 2 years where more recently he asked how my relationship was and if I was happy. Still not directly to me, my friend told him that I am still in a long term relationship and was planning on marriage - which was the truth at the time. 

I reach out cordially to college guy to invite him to a party I was throwing out mutual friend. Not expecting a positive response as he was the one to give me the cold shoulder years ago. I had convinced myself that I misunderstood his intentions in the past and that he hated me. Upon response, he was actually very nice and warm in conversation which I was not expecting. I confronted him via text that I heard he was asking how I was and said he could’ve just reached out. To that he responded that the conversation clearly wouldn’t stop at hi and he wanted to respect the boundaries of my relationship. 

In between the time from texting college guy and the mutual friend’s party, my relationship ended - I ended thing. Not because of college guy, there were plenty of reasons why the relationship wasn’t right although he was amazing and I love him deeply, it wasn’t meant to be. A week later, college guy and I meet up for the party. We talked about the reasons why it didn’t work but how he liked me the whole time and didn’t want to interrupt my relationship in any way. We had sex a couple times during that weekend, it was amazing. So sensual and full of eye stares and I missed yous. 

We have now decided to take it slow. Which I agree with as I want to see how we’d work out if we both are putting in the effort and I just got out of a long term relationship 2 months ago, not feeling the best. But we have a problem of defaulting to lust and having sex rather than real conversations. Multiple things contribute to this; he is very busy during the week with 2 jobs and grad school, also we are still 400 miles apart.

No matter if it's some random person on the internet or someone I see in public, no matter how pathetic they make themselves out to be it always seems like that they're in a better position than me. I'm 19 years old living out in the middle of nowhere where the biggest freedom I have is being able to drive 45 minutes 4 days a week to the most beige community college I have ever seen that has *anything* but a ""community"". Meanwhile, everyone else (including all of my high school friends, who don't even like being on campus, no less) has the luxury of staying on a campus with a near infinite abundance of people and things to do, all in walking distance no less! I tell you, I must have really pissed someone off in my past life.

Usually it doesn't get to me, probably because most of the time my brain is too occupied with meaningless busy-work to care. This is the first time I've used this account in two months, and I've had longer streaks than that. But when it does come back, it comes back hard. I start noticing the people around me, I come to places like here and notice posts from people that are younger, the same age, or slightly older than me and see that what they see as problems I see as victories since they managed to get there in the first place! I try to make friends, but it is NOT easy in my current environment, especially since my interests are so far from the average person. Usually, I have no idea what someone my age is talking about and when I do, they don't want to hear anything from me. This is especially true with women. the few times I try to start a conversation with a women, one of two things happen, either A) They give very bland one word responses that allude to me that they aren't interested in conversing with me, or B) We converse how I would expect and they turn out to be a lesbian. I'm not even joking, I've had like 3 platonic female relationships and they all have turned out to be lesbian. I try really hard not to generalize people especially when it comes to gender, but is this insanely bad luck or what? The correlation is just too weird.

I don't know where I'm going with this. Basically, what I'm asking is how do I trick my brain into thinking that it's okay if I never get into a relationship? Is it just to work myself to death so then I'm constantly distracted and don't pay attention to all of the better things my peers are doing? Because as it is, there is no possible future. There's either no opportunity at all, interests and personalities are way out of line, or my line of work is entirely male dominated. Dating apps completely turning the world upside-down doesn't help, either.

Not sure if this is even the right place to post this, this problem probably goes way deeper than simple ""dating"" but I wanted it to be somewhere it would be seen by a lot of people in an opposite situation as me.


Frequent Responses:

R: ""Bro you're literally 19""
A: Okay? And most people my age are already having way more fulfilling lives than me. Don't see how that helps

R: ""Don't worry, things will get better over time.""
A: Bullshit. I've been feeling this since I was 16 at LEAST, I keep thinking it will get better between me developing new hobbies or meeting new people but it never does. If anything, things are now WORSE since I had to move to a new, worse location after high school to afford paying for college.

R: ""I didn't lose my virginity until I was [insert arbitrary age here], you'll be fine!""
A: Good for you, but your situation was probably much different than mine. In my experience, most people that say this stuff either had opportunity and just ignored it to a certain point or consciously avoided it because they didn't want to focus on it until later in life, which is perfectly fair, mind you, but not really relevant to my situation. I would love to at least *try* to get to know someone, but I feel that the opportunity for me simply doesn't exist unless someone can point out something I'm not seeing.

R: ""Any hobbies/clubs?""
A: The most ""normie"" and relatable hobby I have is probably guitar, which unfortunately I haven't picked up in a little while since I've been so damn busy with this shitty school stuff as well as other unrelated work things. My other hobbies are something that I guarantee less than 0.5% of the population are into and would probably scare more people off than I would befriend. For example, I have what I believe is probably the biggest [rhythm game guitar controller collection on the east coast](https://i.imgur.com/bAgRFS4.jpg) (until I'm proven wrong anyways), being worth at least $1000 going by ebay prices. You know anyone is real life that's into this crap? Didn't think so. 
As for clubs, I was into a fair bit in high school, most notably my robotics club, but I honestly didn't make too many connections at those and I also realized I hated STEM, so that's off the table. In my current ""community"" college, there is nothing once you subtract all of the religious and race-oriented groups that I obviously couldn't join. I did sign up for their music group, but it's been months and I never heard anything back. Oh well. Probably too long of a drive anyways, lol.

R: ""Why not transfer/drop out if things are going so shit for you there?""
A: Money and sunk costs, mostly. I do actually plan to transfer to a 4-year institution in fall 2022, but I most DEFINITELY will not be able to afford to live on campus and I hear that most friend groups are basically solidified by the end of the first year anyways, so the damage is basically done at this point. And as much I would love to drop out and immediately move to a more populated area, I don't want to live on the street all my life as fun as that sounds.

R: ""Just lift bro!""
A: Not a bad idea, but unfortunately I don't know of any gym that doesn't require a membership and isn't a 30 minute drive.

I knew she had a coil fitted.  

That said when I had sex with her on the first date I insisted on wearing a condom. 

I messed up because after I cum, I didn't pull out.   I can usually keep going and cum multiple times without losing my erection.  

Big mistake!!!   

Because my little guy must have not stayed has hard as I thought he was.    


So carried on having sex for a while I came a few times before finally pulling out.   Went to take the condom off and I wasn't there!!! 


I didn't panic.  I didn't catch anything or get her pregnant.  She actually become my long term girlfriend after.  

That said it was a bit of a disaster at the time.   


So on the first date we spent about 30 min trying to find the condom.  I tried to look inside her couldn't fine it.  

She asked me to look again.   So like a gynecologist I'm there looking for the missing item.   After thoroughly searching I find it deep inside her and manage to fish it out. 

Sounds weird.  We were both cool and we are very natural and chilled around each other with zero hang ups.

So there was a happy ended.    

Although I realise how risky it could have been.

We've seen each other 2-4 times a week, every week. We're both in our mid twenties. Honestly, we do everything a boyfriend and girlfriend does... without the title. As the internet calls it, I'm in a ""situationship"". lol

Now, we've had some very long and honest conversations about where we stand. We both are looking for a relationship. Three weeks ago, in a fit of emotional frustration, I decided to be brave and ask him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He told me he wanted to get to know me first before committing to a relationship. I understood and agreed. 

And then I asked if he was seeing anyone else, and here commenced the heartbreak. He told me he had a fwb he had arrangements with before he met me, and was seeing her too. I didn't get mad-- after all, we never spoke about exclusivity. But at that moment, I really crumbled down and I felt the guards I let down coming back up again.  

After some time, I decided that my desire to getting to know him more and seeing where this went was stronger than my discomfort of him having a fwb, so I decided to let it go for the time being. 

A few days ago, we had another conversation, where I asked if exclusivity was still not an option for him. And he told me he wasn't ready to do that yet. And he encouraged me to date other people too. 

A little background. He's dated quite a few girls, had long-term relationships, and he's at a place where the next person he meets, he'd like to marry. For myself, I've only done a LTR where I saw my partner once during the 9 months lol. I've never been in a relationship with someone IN-PERSON. 

I'm not really sure what to think. He's very honest about everything, and he tells me that if there's something that's bothering me that I should always just ask him. I've told him about how I felt. I told him that it bothers me, but it doesn't bother me ENOUGH to stop seeing him. Am I being stupid?

I’m not someone who sleeps around, my number is in single digits and I’d like to keep it there for as long as possible. I’m a confident woman and I’m not bad looking.

Anyway, I went on a date with him at a bowling alley, he was 20-25 minutes late. He said he’s going to be a few minutes late tops… we had a good night. Spent about 3 hours on this date until the shops closed. We continued talking and it was really fun and easy going. Last night, I had a Friendmas dinner (Christmas dinner with friends) and we started texting again. He asked if I wanted to come over and I wasn’t sure because I had work this morning. I went over and we watched a stand up comedy for a while, laughed and had some banter so it was great. He slowly made a move after about and hour and I eventually got on top and started it. I laughed a bit and said, “I thought you’d never kiss me” and we proceeded to make out. It was going good, he didn’t really seem to know what to do with his hands at times. We both got undressed and he went down on me and I returned the favor. He seemed to enjoy it too much and because i didn’t want it to end so quickly, I asked if he had a condom which he said yes but it’s in the car. I laughed a bit and said “okay could you please go get it” he then called me “intense” which I’m kind of taking offence to right now.

He came back and I proceeded to get him ready again. He laid back, said he hates condoms as he put it on anyway. I got on top and rode him. Everything felt good, he didn’t just completely starfish so he did a bit of touching. I eventually took his hands and held on to them by his head and did a bit of dirty talk. He enjoyed it and it was over soon. He went to clean up and I was chilling on bed waiting for him to help me out when he’s done. That didn’t happen which is fine. We watched more tv and he started falling asleep. I left and got home after 2. Sent a “just got home” message and fell asleep. 

The “intense” comment was stuck in my head so I asked him to let me know when he’s up because I just wanted to clarify with him if that’s a bad thing or not.

Turns out he blocked me. This really knocked my confidence and I’m a bit hurt by the lack of respect and communication from someone in their 30s.

Most of the things I experience every day make me feel nothing or make me feel anxious. I’m numb most of the time. Things that should bring me joy (friendships, hobbies, engaging and personal work) usually don’t give me more than a lukewarm satisfaction. When things are bad, nothing feels worth doing and there’s nothing to look forward to.

My ultimate desire has always been for a relationship. Growing up, I was obsessed with romance oriented media. All I consumed and thought about was romance. I constantly got infatuated with random people in my periphery I didn’t even speak to. I don’t date (combination of body image problems and social anxiety) and berate myself over it, have no platonic relationships with men, and still embarrassingly become infatuated with men for no reason. It’s usually just because they’re near me. I’m also often preoccupied with my appearance and agonize about how I look. 

I was reflecting recently and recognized I actually don’t know what love is. I’ve only experienced infatuation. I have no practice in building relationships. I actually don't really understand how to make new friends what with all of my mental health problems, so it's bizarre that I even think about dating. The more I think about it, the more I realize I only “want” a relationship because it would make me feel good. Or normal? I think the idea of being in a relationship, being loved, being attracted to somebody, gives me a drug like high. I become obsessed with people extremely quickly because the behavior becomes self rewarding. When I’m really depressed, which is most of the time, it’s the only thing that reliably makes me feel good and breaks the horrible numbness. 

I always thought that I wanted a relationship but I don’t think I want a “real” relationship. I just want someone to cuddle who pays attention to me because it will make me feel better about myself. I’ll get that high when I’m feeling down. I don’t think I really want the hard parts of a relationship, the having to try with new people in my life, the ups and downs. I just crave anything that will make my brain feel baseline. And I know it's not true, but I really strongly believe there's something wrong with me and I often think another person loving me will make that go away. But it won't. 

I always fall into online relationships with men and it momentarily makes me feel better, then it makes me deeply depressed during. I think if I managed to find a relationship, I’d end up addicted to the other person and will be even more unable to be happy on my own. I might even end up leaving them once that high feeling goes away. I also think I'm not in the right place to choose the correct people to date. I would 100% be led by my sense of self worth and could easily allow myself to be treated badly because I think I deserve it. 

So this is a success in a way. A year ago, I wouldn't have known myself enough to identify this, as obvious as it may sound. I would have just thought I wanted a relationship without understanding what was going on in my head and why I wanted that. I just don’t know what the next step is. I’m glad I realized this but I still don't know how to live for myself. I know what I want. I want to be able to form platonic relationships with men. I want to only think about making friends instead of being obsessed with the idea of ""love"". I want to learn about who I am as a person and what makes me feel whole instead of relying on other people. I don't want to keep seeing people as this image I create of them. I just don't know if I'll ever get there. I don't see the path right now :(  It just sucks when you're depressed your whole life and nothing really makes you happy, it's so easy to let things stay the same because everything else is so much work. But things seem to be changing in my head, so I have some faith.
