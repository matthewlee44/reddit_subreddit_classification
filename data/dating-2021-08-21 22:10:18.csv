1,p952iu,1629602302,How do you know when your SO’s “craxy exes” are actually crazy or if your SO was the problem?,"I went on a few dates with some guy who mentioned that his longest relationship was with a psycho who verbally abused him with extreme paranoia issues. Found out that he cheated on said girlfriend multiple times then harassed the shit out of her trying to win her back until legal action was taken. I blocked him on everything and, thankfully, he didn’t know where I lived and never tried to reach out to me, but he seemed like a shy, charming guy. I would have never known that he would do something like that. 

So now I’m wondering if there are telltale signs that the person you’re dating was the “crazy one” in their past relationships? You can argue that anyone who talks badly about their exes or calls them a psycho is obviously lying, but that girl who got cheated on and stalked seems to have valid grounds to call her ex crazy. I’d rather not wait until the other person tries to harm or harass me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p952iu/how_do_you_know_when_your_sos_craxy_exes_are/
2,p952wa,1629602348,"I was single and on/off depressed over the course of 5 years. I want to share my experience with a recent change in my life that proves that no matter how much you think something good won't happen, it will.","So I want to kind of vent and share my experience with how my life was very depressing and how it has recently changed after I thought it never would, this is mainly an effort to help someone who may have been mentally in the same spot as me. So back in 2016 ish the girlfriend I dated throughout high school and I had broke up after 2.5 years and that kind of ruined me because of how she treated me for the last couple months (just not showing nearly any interest). I was going to a College where I was miserable and had terrible teachers who treated you like trash (I believe out of the 4 semesters there were 2 good teachers). A bunch of my friends started treating me different and slowly but surely, they started going 1 by 1 and soon enough I would have almost no friends. Now sure there were a few good things to happen here and there, but for the majority, since 2016 ish I was constantly on and off a wreck, and I never really told anybody because they wouldn't understand. I was beginning to think that my life would forever be an emotional rollercoaster of just ups and downs day in and day out, and it all changed a week ago. I ended up coming across a girl that is the same age as me, we would hangout when we were younger but lost touch over the years, and out of nowhere I ran into her and we got to catching up. Now we are starting to hangout more and more, and we have gone on a few dates.  Very safe to say we are into each other and its like she revived a part of me that died many moons ago.  I was thinking my life would be a lonely dark cave for the rest of my life as foolish as it sounds, but I know there are others out there who can relate. Now again I am not making this post to look for sympathy by any means, just wanted to share my experience and say for those who want to give up or maybe have had a similar scenario to mine; the light at the tunnel will come. It may sound cliche but it could take weeks, months, years, hell even a decade. You have to do anything it takes to be happy and push yourself to get there because it will happen and I can ASSURE you that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p952wa/i_was_single_and_onoff_depressed_over_the_course/

6,p956d8,1629602766,Not sure what to do after a night with someone. Not sure if it was a joke or not. Need serious advice,"I ( M32 ) recently went out on a date with a younger girl ( F23 ) and had a pretty decent time. She was very reserved and shy but I didn’t think much of it. We went to get dinner, some ice cream after, and then we ended up back at my place. We decided we were going to watch a movie but first we were going to smoke. I live in Seattle so it’s legal here.

We head upstairs to the bathroom, and I start doing my thing and rolling up. After a couple passes I can’t help but notice she’s looking a bit anxious and I ask her if she’s alright. I think I hit a nerve because she looked like she was on the verge of tears by my question. She was hesitant, and wanted reassurance I wasn’t going to tell anyone what she was going to say. This of course makes me curious and a bit weirded out. I promise her. 

She tells me I’m the first person she’s had socialization with in years outside of her family. She tells me she left a very abusive family where she was pretty much trapped in the middle of nowhere. She said she hasn’t had friends since she was a small child, wasn’t allowed to leave the house, forced to do homeschooling, emotionally abused, physically etc. and even when she became an adult it wasn’t as simple as just leaving since she was stranded with nothing. 

She told me she had gotten a PTSD diagnosis years ago and was able to collect disability for it after some headaches. Apparently this was the reason she was able to save up and finally leave. However she expressed fear of her family trying to do something to her. That they might come looking for her. I could tell she wanted to file a report but was too scared of that as well. She showed me images, videos, screenshots, dating all the way back to even 2014. Tbh it all added up and seems legit. According to her she only left less than a week ago and “tried dating” for the first time because she needed some form of human contact. 

She’s never had a job before and I know that what little income she’s getting isn’t sustainable. I know she’ll eventually have to go back or end up homeless. I don’t think she can work with how on edge she is. I know it’s not my issue but I can’t help but feel bad for her. What would you all do in my situation? Should I encourage her to file a report or leave it be? We’ve been texting since then and she wants to meet again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p956d8/not_sure_what_to_do_after_a_night_with_someone/
7,p95776,1629602866,Should I go on a third date with this guy?,"So I had my first date a week ago with this guy I matched with. We went on a walking downtown + ice cream date and it was pretty great. It was nonstop conversation and smiles, we had a lot in common, both are hoping for a serious relationship. even talked about things we could do together on future dates. However, there was nothing SUPER flirtatious and no physical contact except for a very short hug at the end. He did text me almost immediately after that he wanted to kiss me but wanted to be respectful/careful (especially with the covid situation), and scheduling a second date.

Second date was this morning, we planned on bringing takeout to a park and going on a walk there after eating. Since it was really close to his place, I picked him up in my car (maybe this was the first mistake, and i should have suggested he drive instead?). We ate and talked, but it seemed a little more awkward than last time, and at some point in the convo I also started to realize that he didn't seem as cute as I thought he was the first time. After we finished eating I asked if he still wanted to walk, but he said that he had to head out and get ready for something else later. At this point, I was thinking, alright, he lost interest in me, but I park in his driveway, we had some awkward end of date convo still in the car, and then he asks if he can kiss me. I was caught off guard and not comfortable yet, so I said ""ahh sorry, not yet..."" and he said he understood, but left the car without even a hug or anything. I texted him after to apologize again, saying that I'm just nervous in general with kisses, and thanked him for asking first and also for the lunch. I again thought he lost interest, but he's texted a few times already and seems still open to talking/going on another date. Now I'm not sure how to go forward. 

I guess for some context, I'm a female in my early 20s, and have never been in a relationship and have never been kissed. I obviously would love to have a kiss, but I have had a few instances of guys overstepping my physical boundaries and borderline harassing me before, so I ideally would like some physical touch progression (ex. nudge, legs touching, hand holding, ANYTHING) to gauge how comfortable I am and not to be caught off guard before a kiss. I liked that he was respectful to ask me before kissing, but it also kind of turned me off since it seemed so out of the blue and awkward. 

So far he seems like he would be interested in a third date, but I don't know if I should keep talking to him. From what I have heard, it seems like the 3rd date is a ""signal"" that a girl is definitely ready to kiss a guy if they haven't done it already. I would be interested in going on a third date to see if I am still attracted to him, but I don't want to set the expectation that I'm ready to kiss or lead him on in case I'm not attracted. I also don't want to be in a situation where he just ""goes for it"". Should I just be honest about my uncertainty and ask him to be friends? Should I be honest and tell him that I'm unsure but still open to seeing if there's a connection? Should I just continue texting and go on the next date as if the second one wasn't awkward? He does seem like a great, respectful guy, so I don't want to hurt him or anything.

TLDR: Went on a great first date with a guy but there was basically no physical contact. Second date was awkward, he cut it short, and then I rejected his kiss because I wasn't ready. Again to physical contact even though there were many opportunities, and I'm not sure if I like him anymore. Should I go on a third date to see what happens?

8,p95h34,1629604077,Work on yourself and then girls will come? What if that hasn't happened for you yet,"Has not happened to me and I know I must sound like a broken record to keep going on these subs but it makes me so frustrated to know in because I tooken so much advice people give to guys like me who just can't succeed

I have real intangible years worth of experiences of me actively working on things and some of these things I realize I really did not have to work on and some things on this journey I realize that I could have actually retained but for the life of me I still feel like there's something I'm missing and dating

I have taken a lot of girls out on a date but I need to get really close to somebody to have sex and I think that's the very thing that is holding me back

It's already hard enough as a guy

I've been virgin shame since middle school and men are still very much expected to be sexually virile and more experienced and this will only get worse as you get older but almost paradoxically men are still expected to pursue an approach and even if a man and woman are into each other the man will still be expected to put his self-esteem on the line and ask her out

I've been through the motions of all of that and now I'm wondering what else I need to do.

I still do not have a car
I still am broke

I am a good artist and people are recognizing me for that but that's still nowhere near enough to be attractive or impressive woman and I never did it to do so but everyone says that a man has to work on himself in his loves and his hobby to be attractive

I've had the ultimate hobby that I've worked on since I was a kid and that is art and that has had no correlation between a woman looking at me differently

I didn't expect it to but after hearing so much advice on working on yourself I can't help but think of that and other things

I really feel like I was cheated out of something and I know that sounds childish but that's what it feels like because I have done so much hard work and it still feels like it's not enough

And the sad thing is no one can really see or judge you on what your laundry list of things you have to get over or work on are but yet again that's the same advice that is peddled and now I'm left running around in circles

To give you guys an example I used to lead groups of people

It's safe to say I have a leadership personality

I used to lead clubs and join clubs and I have been around the country and outside the country

I have worked on things that I liked and enjoyed and I know where near perfect but given how much work I put in I would think that dating would be a little bit more easier now

It really does make you question everything you grew up with because it really does feel like human beings are stuck in this darwinian struggle

Other security of mine is even though I know that I have worked on a lot of things and I do still try to every other guy in the world is also doing that and it feels like I won't catch up

My ex made me wait when I was a virgin and I respected that decision but looking back she clearly wanted me to still push her boundaries and push for sex even though she did not want to and I feel like she cheated me out of that opportunity because I later have to go to school without any experience to draw off of and it was clear to me that a lot of girls saw my inexperience as a negative

While my ex-girlfriend could still have all her negative traits and get love and sex much easier because she was a girl and I'm not saying it translated into good experiences but I find it so frustrating to think about that

I have no choice but to take stock and try again after everything she put me through and after all of that it still wasn't enough and I could not even find another girl to at least replace that negative experience.

No I can't be upset or negative or sad or entitled about all of this and I try not to be but it's hard to still try to muster a fake positive attitude towards all of this when you still end up failing no matter what avenues you try and no matter how hard you try

Now I will admit I have had tons of your messages and looking back there were tons of girls who were into me but because I am a guy and I'm expected to just know I completely dropped the ball because these girls either weren't showing obvious signs or I was in a place of my life where I just did not want to do the song and dance and try

I avoided it but I think it might have come off to him as rude or apathetic.

He seems genuinely nice and not creepy, and has told me he wants me to feel comfortable with him, he just seems unaware of this. We are going to hang out again and I still need to be cautious again, because I’m still getting to know him.

Should I carry on, pretend nothing happened or put all my cards on the table?","A month ago a new guy who is my age started working at my job. He's only a weekend worker so we haven't talked much, but the time we have has been, well, great. He initiates a lot, asks questions, listens... He just like.... makes me feel seen in a way a lot of people and friends never ever have. I just like him.

We matched on tinder last week. Sounds great, but ehhh. The conversation was good, I asked if he'd like to go out with me and he said yeah. I sent my number and he didn't respond for like three days. I hate dating apps and it was just making me super anxious, plus I want people in my life who are excited to talk to and see me, so I deleted the app and figured he had either saved my number and was busy or didn't care and wasn't that into me. (I know it was rash but 72 hours is time enough IMO 🤷)

Come into work this morning and... nothing's off or different. He actually jokes with me about it and tells me he dismissed the notification and forgot to check back in until after I'd deleted my account. I felt more reassured and was going to say hey look, straight up if you really DO want to go out just tell me and I'll give you my number. But work got busy so I didn't get a chance.

During that time I was busy he talked to another coworker who is both our friend and our age. Afterwards, she told me that he thought I was mad at him and that she had told him to apologize to me. Later I saw him and he looked like he felt bad and had a lot on his mind. I just felt really anxious and sad about him feeling badly and the misunderstanding and just everything.

THEN, before being able to talk with him about any of this, he had to leave early. As it turns out, his roommate got COVID. 😀🥴

So, now there's NO way for us to talk about the weird vibe for two weeks. Neither of us has the other's phone number and I have no social media. No way for me to be like, hey I was sorta disappointed you didn't answer, but not at all mad at you, and if you wanna talk or go out (or not!) that's okay. No way for him to say anything he has to say, either, if he has anything to say.

So what should I do at the end of these two weeks when he comes back? Act like nothing happened and continue with friendly vibes? Lay all my cards on the table?

Okay so I did this teen science program in Texas a few weeks ago and I'm a really quiet guy and usually keep to myself. This other guy (LEt's call him Orren) I knew to be extremely outgoing, but I never really spoke to him despite the fact that we knew who each other were.

Anyways, the last day of camp, I noticed he followed me on Instagram. Okay. Interesting. I dunno how he found it? Very few people had my Instagram, especially people who I often saw around him.

Cut to a few weeks later, I make a instagram post regarding a mistake I made with my computer which was very funny. He messaged me a description of what to do next time. I thanked him and asked him how he was. He said good. I mentioned being glad he found me on Instagram because I was quiet at camp. He said he noticed that.

We continued to talk about school until Myers Briggs came up. he mentioned our personality types are compatible and that we would get along. We spoke about our passions until I had to go. I asked him if there was somewhere else I could contact him. He gave me his number..

Next day I text him that I'm in class and bored. We continued texting about our passions, and he began telling me about a cool project he was working on. (maybe trying to impress me?) He knew I was vegan (I made a post and in the caption was ""Vegan Ice Cream"" so he must've read it. (Maybe I'm looking into this too much idk.) He said he remembered small details about people and some people find it annoying. He also said there's an inside joke almost everywhere with him. He called himself flamboyant (I KNOW IT'S A STEREYOTPE BUT LIKE COME ON!) Next day I texted him again and the day after that I had anxiety and texted him ""sorry if I'm bothering you when I text you"" and he said ""Don't worry about it. I WAS DUMB AND TEXTED HIM ON BOTH INSTA AND IMESSAGE LITERALLY UGH.

I then texted him 8 hours later asking if we could call or text while I was away since I'm gonna be bored and have nothing to do. He said to call or text anytime and he'll respond if he's available. I then said ""Thanks for being so nice to me"" which like EWWW that sounds so weird but I'm not used to friendliness like this. Anyways PLS HELP. IDK if this is just friendship or if I'm making more out of it. If he wants to be friends I'm more than happy with that.

Im a 33M single dad of a 3 yrs old(results of the only hookup,attention i've ever get).So the question is pretty much says it...why n when did you call it quit looking for relationships or romantic partner?
I tried these ""dating apps"" they never worked...when I was in my teens used to go out whit my cousines not too often maybe once a month but I was the guy always went home alone (They always got Hookups/long-terms) sometimes by myself....time goes by finished school (still kissless,virgin at the times only lost in cuz my cousine paid a hooker to kick start me"") so I just did my buisness..like get a job etc etc...now time pass by and after the last 17 mnth just completely given up...no longer has the apps (find them pointless) to be honest.No longer going out as all my cousines in relationship and I don't wanna be the 3rd wheel so and they obviously busy whit their SO and after a while they not even asks me anymore(they know my anwser)
Thats understandable plus I don't drink alcohol anyway.
Still hurt time to time but am I alone?Is that a validation reason to just stop looking as its just cause more pain and rather just shove all that behind me so its just one less fuckup of life?

48,p98t4g,1629620568,My dating life is a joke,"Ok my friends, first of all I don't want to brag about a single thing about me or my life (since I am very depressed about both of them). But I am truly losing any hope. Sorry in advance for the lenght. English is not my main language.

First of all, people constantly say me that I have a very good personality (caring, funny and entertaining. I like talking about history and philosophy. I read a lot) and model tier looks (you can check my pics on my profile. I am also 6'1).

Let's go now for the three ""advices"" that people give me every single time I vent about my singleness:

1- ""That's a matter of time"". Absolutely false. I see people that jump from a relationship to another in a matter of days / weeks, while for me, I had a bunch of lame and short relationships and a single LTR ended about 2 years ago. Since then, nothing. I tried everything, but nothing. Not even a single kiss lmao.

2- ""Work on yourself bro"". Lame and pretty unrespectful advice imo. I have many friends (and with many I mean around 30 people I hang out with regularly), I work, have cool hobbies, perfect personal hygiene and I am graduating very well in Uni. But everything seems to be useless. People are interested in nothing but themselves. Plus, I hate social. I am a pretty timid person. I don't like to brag every day on a social about my life posting my pics. Fun fact: menawhile I see sociopaths that get a different girl every month.

3- ""Hit the gym"". I literally work as a nude model for people that learns to draw. So yea, I lift. Since 2018. Lmao.

The only girl that is sincerely interested in me lives in another country (fml) and here, in my country, all I've got for these 2 years is ghosting, rejections and so on. I tried Tinder and made a ton of matches (about ~130) but every single time, if I manage to meet these girls, they see me only as a friend or simply Ghost me after the first date.

So, if my personality, my looks and my social / working life are fine, what the hell am I supposed to do at this point? Conquering a freakin star? Lmao.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p98t4g/my_dating_life_is_a_joke/

She was kinda weird and had some drug problems but im kinda used to people having that so I ignored that red flag and thought I would give her a shot. We talked through snapchat alot, and her intentions were crystal clear. She was reaaaally into me, even told me that her self. Eventually I just asked if she wanted too meet so I invited her to my studio to listen to some music and smoke a joint. She pulls up and I let her in. We sit down and listen to some music while I roll. Right off the bat she pulls up her phone and uses it. At first I didnt think much of it cus I was rolling a joint. We went outside, smoked then went in again. This is where she started to just stare into her phone and barely talked to me. Whenever I tried to spark up a convo it was very short lived. And whenever she had something to say it was either about her wanting to get fucked up on stims or alcohol or that shes so depressed. Plus she smelled fucking horrible. Like i dont mean that “its been a long day” type of sweat I mean that “I aint got no shower cus showering is bad “ type of sweat. She fucking hated everything. Now I aint saying she wrong for being depressed but this girl was fucking hopeless. I got so bored I called a friend and asked if he wanted come and chill and he was on his way. I asked of she was hungry and she replied that she wasnt but hadnt eaten today. So me being who I am I bought her hella food cus not eating is fucking stupid and nobody gon die in my watch. On the way from where we got food we met up with my friend and was so happy. We went back to the stu and I just forgot about her. Eventually i had to go home so we all walked to the tram station. It was like a 25 minute walk and the whole way this girl put her hood up, put on headphones walked behind us. At this point I did not give a single flying fuck about her. When we got to the tram station her tram was arriving in 15 mins. I didnt feel like waiting for her tram to get there so I just said bye and left. Luckily didnt have to take a tram home so I just walked and talked to my friend about how fucked this girl was.

54,p997b0,1629622799,Did I say or do something that causes her to react so harshly?,"It's not like I go out of my way to **TELL THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT HOOK-UP CULTURE IS GROSS!!!**

I really don't care for how people live their lives, I have my own problems to worry about, and by problems I mean *things that keep me up at night.*

I don't feel the need to judge others, yet alone belittle them; I always felt that it was a very **pathetic** thing to do and comes from some sort of personal insecurity; I mean.... *if I'm accomplished and content with my life and continue to strive for the things that give my own life meaning, value, worth and happiness; why would I ever waste my time demeaning someone else's life?* **Anyone else agree???**

The part is people just can't grasp that you can exercise preference, without necessarily *insulting* them, I am not saying you aren't *valuable* I just don't think we are **compatible.**

I had matched with this woman on tinder, not only did she catch me eye but I also got anxiety while texting her lol. **I was extremely attracted to her!** it almost felt to good too be true. We spent several days exchanging texts and also facetiming, it felt so natural. 
The chemistry was undeniable, and she insisted that **we meet up and hang out.**

She asked me out, and I was very ecstatic! I didn't want to get my hopes up that she may be a potential lover, but even as a friend I'd be happy because *she just wasn't all beauty, she had brains and a very intoxicating personality that just made time go by so fast everytime I interacted with her!*

I was okay to be her friend in case things didn't workout, I didn't have it necessarily in my mind that we would date; possibility but not a probability. 

Anyways, we hung out the first time, and it was **magical.** This woman showered me in so many compliments I felt like Brad Pitt! I've always been told I'm extremely attractive but it's hard to believe other people's compliments when you don't think too highly of yourself. I don't necessarily have low self-esteem **I just don't I'm all that.** Past relationships shown me *how quickly I can be replaced* so clearly I can't be that good looking lol.

She was funny, sweet, thoughtful and generous! I had to fight her to let me pay the bill. **By the 3rd time we went out, I had it already in my mind that she would make a life long friend If we decided not to date, just because I saw that much value in her as a person; people like her you keep around, they add tremendous joy to your life, and life is just suffering so why not suffer with someone who makes you happy?**

In the midst of our third date, we decided to eat out at a pretty nice spot, and then she kind of interrogated me about sex lol. I got really shy because I just get anxiety talking about sex to people because it's usually something I'm extremely private about and really only discuss it with my partner. She questioned me on *kinks, fetishes, favorites, to-do's &amp; not-to-do's and it got down to size.* I just got hit with questions and although I answered truthfully, my face was at pink as bubble gum just because I was super shy and anxious talking about it. **She told me it was cute that I'm so shy about it and that I probably wasn't a** *""F#ck boy""* which didn't make any sense to me. 

This is where things went south, she asked me about my partner history *(the amount of people I've been with)* and I told her the truth, only **4,** and she just refused to believe me. She kept calling me a liar and was obviously getting annoyed. But I had to really explain to her a timeline to get her to shut up about it, it didn't make sense why 4 people was such a big deal. **I pretty much told her that I've only been in 4 relationships, all serious; and those are the only 4 women I've been with and cared to be with at the time.**

She said it was *""weird, and suspect""* which I asked, why? Why would that be weird. Is it because it was 4 serious relationships? I know it sounds like a lot. So I went on to explain to her how all 4 ended since I'm still relatively young **(only 25 atm)**.

1. H.S sweet heart, we broke up because she wanted to ""experiment"" with dating while in college. I didn't care to beg for her to stay since I'm pretty sure this was premeditated. Needless to say, this hurt deeply. 
2. Old best friend, great girl, decided to take things further. Was an amazing relationship, but I was moving and she couldn't come because she pretty much established her career in our home city. Painful breakup but still friends. 
3. Old coworker, she cheated sadly. Apparently, I didn't ""give her enough attention"". Shotgun wound to the chest. 
4. Wonderful girl I forced myself to date to stop grieving over being cheated on. Therapist said terrible idea, I didn't care. We eventually agreed to be friends when I realized it wasn't right to try and ""replace"" my ex, she began dating someone else. Ironically, around the time I stopped grieving and started dating again she just happened to be single. We dated, it was amazing, but she wanted to get married and have kids **now** but I wanted to wait just because I was still traumatized &amp; wanted to get to know her a bit more. She refused to compromise and left. Very tough situation but at least she apologized, I offered her friendship, she wanted to ""try again"" but the damage was done. Still friends. 
(Whats wrong with waiting so I can thoroughly get to know you? I just wanted to protect my heart :-/)

After I told her all of this, she finally understood and dropped this preconceived notion that I was *""lying""*, she said usually men have way more partners and its not often you see someone like me with so little.. I  explained to her that I can't really have sex with someone I don't love, because I don't have a desire too; that's why I haven't been with a lot of people. She questioned me further to dig deeper and I just told her how I felt. **I don't do hookups because I think I'm worth more than an orgasm that's all. I deserve to be loved, appreciated and cared for, and I'm not just a penis a girl can use for a climax, I'm a human being with feelings and would rather date and have sex with someone meaningful than give my body to someone where to them I'd be meaningless. I told her I'm not just a number for another girls body count, and I have more value than that.** When she said what do I think about people who do hook-up often and have been with a lot of people, I told her I personally thought it was gross and I told her about my teammates back in the football team who would just run through every girl on campus and how disgusting I thought it was.

**She snapped on me, and said I was insecure and projecting my own insecurities.** Then she told me she's been with 32 different people and doesn't feel ""disgusting"", she pretty much just snapped and got offended but I never meant to offend her, she kept asking questions and I transparently let her know how I think AND  why I reason this way, I was just being sincere with someone I thought would be a great friend and potentially a great lover.

She ended up calling me an insecure misogynist and said I have ""little dick energy"" but why? Why would she say such cruel things to me? I don't have insecurities outside of the insecurity I got from the trauma of my ex cheating and none of it is a physical or societal insecurity, it's just an insecurity that the person I love won't be loyal to me. That's all.

But why would she say such hurtful things and make statement that weren't true? It hurt a lot, to be honest.

I was so flabbergasted by what she said that I ended the date right there. I opted to pay since I thought it'd be a gift for the pleasant memories prior to this, and dropped her home. We haven't spoken since. 

Why would someone react this way? Can anyone guide me please?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p997b0/did_i_say_or_do_something_that_causes_her_to/

57,p99nw4,1629625415,How To Feel Better After All This?,"(If you wanna skip to the ""all this"" part, you can go to down to the three squiggly lines).

Almost two years ago I got interested in trying to find a possible partner by playing online games with random people and seeing how it felt. For a while it was just me helping out strangers but then one time this person texted me back and we hit it off. I was from Finland, she was from Denmark.

We started playing together and because of Covid we did this like every day for months and grew closer. Eventually flirty jokes turned into just flirting and it went to the next level. We started video chatting and things went really well for months. This was probably the best period of my life and I loved it 🥰

Then something happened that really shook things up. A couple of times she completely rejected me over some very little thing and said stuff like ""I'll never love you again""... But afterwards she said she was sorry and was more affectionate than before. But after she got over her thing, things went on just fine. 🤔

(This is about 8 or so months after we first met now): She had even asked her family what they though if she was with a younger guy from a different country, joking about living together, and we said ""I love you"" to each other all the time. I could tell it was definitely some sort of a romantic relationship now ❤

We started seriously talking about physically meeting. We agreed on me coming to stay at her apartment for a week in Denmark. So there I went and got on a plane. When I landed there I literally couldn't stop shaking ✈

~~~

We met and went to her place, both burning to get *close*, if you get my hint. I'll try to summarize basically what happened: I had troubles performing and it seriously fucked me up since I couldn't do what we both thought we were gonna do. She assured that it was okay and that there is time 😐

First couple days went okay, but this problem persisted within me. I just couldn't feel anything and I felt like I was letting her down. By the end of the week I realized I had let it get me down too much and apologized, she promised it was okay and that she still had a good time. I flew back home feeling really bad but still hopeful since she had assured me. We hung out as usual for a week or so and it seemed all normal.

Then suddenly... She went completely quiet for a couple of days and I wondered what the hell was going on. Afterwards she texted me with one of her ""I'll never love you"" meltdowns again... The moment when my heart sank was when she said that she had been just thinking for herself for the past couple of days and that she didn't think our thing could work 😟

This came out of nowhere and I had literally no control over myself. I had a giant panic attack. We still hung out after but the mood was bad and I was just trying to figure out what had happened. She gave me every single excuse but they didn't seem genuine to me. It continued like this for the following weeks, with me proving to her over and over again that we can still be friends. It was extremely painful especially because we had good times and she promised we could remain friends, but she always seemed to forget it later.

Then came New Year's Eve... We were just talking and my heart sank again. She texted me ""I have to tell you something but I think it will hurt you"". Then she revealed to me that she had been seeing some other guy since like a week after I visited her 😞

After this it was just months of extreme pain and confusion for me. Then came the day where I had to cut the contact. She kept blaming everything on me, even things that never happened. Every time she had a different excuse for it, ""you don't look good enough"", ""you are too young""... (she had always told me age was no issue). I had to stop talking to her and she was saying we couldn't be friends anyway...

---------

So... What the hell do I do now? I feel like it ended so suddenly that I never processed it. To this day (like 8 months after) I still lose sleep over thinking about it. I just don't understand if some of the thousands of excuses she said were actually true... Am I actually too ugly? Is there something wrong with me? 😟

All I know after the fact is that she definitely cheated on me. Not just the final time but she slept with some of her friends way before that, while she was having one of her meltdowns. She even boasted to me how she fucked her friend when she was just supposed to help him move in.

I didn't realize it until after this whole thing that she had constantly manipulated my feelings by sleeping with other guys, her meltdowns and by blaming me for things I wasn't guilty of.

I have lost hope of dating after months of being on dating apps since there is literally no-one my type on there, only gym freaks, and I'm rapidly also losing hope of making friends again (that's a whole another story). I can't trust people especially in dating since all the promises made to me were broken and I was cheated on and manipulated. What should I do? 🙁

Btw, if you read the whole thing, I wanna offer you a genuine hug 🤗 I miss hugs, hah...

63,p9a3bs,1629627804,How do I accept that my face is less than attractive and not let it hold me back from approaching women?,"I understand that the main rules are 

1. Be attractive 
2. Don’t be unattractive 

I be been working on myself for awhile and I think I have a relatively decent life. I own my own condo, I have a awesome newer car, I’m getting promoted in the coming weeks, I have a cat and a dog at home and I go to the gym 4 times a week. 

For the longest time I’ve tried really hard to be attractive by having goals and by going to therapy to keep my mind from going all over the place. The hardest part has always been that I am not facially attractive. No matter how much my body looks, my face knocks me down a few pegs. I’m absolutely good at making sure I dress well, smell good, my hairs cut and nicely styled and that I am always respectable and can take rejection relatively well. 

The problem is that I still have an issue where I can’t approach women at bars or social settings to chat or flirt. Because I’m afraid that I’m simply too unattractive to approach them and that if I do then they’ll think I’m weird. I’ve slowly tried to make small talk at bars but I still feel like my face is honestly getting in my way, I always think that because I’m not congenitally attractive that they’ll think I’m weird or even stupid for even trying. Because of that I’ve usually never approached anyone at bars, on top of that I almost have no idea what to say or how to keep a conversation going because I’m always thinking that they think an ugly guy is trying to hit on them. 

I really need to accept that my face can’t change and idk how to psyche myself up to actually approach and talk to women. Because I’m at a point in my life where I absolutely need to get over this hump. I’m too old to still be worrying about this stuff but yet it’s still in my head that I’m competing against all these other attractive men at the bar. On top of that online dating hasn’t been very good to me either, since I know a majority is based on looks, just going to the subreddits and seeing the success of some guys makes me think that I absolutely have no shot against the competition and that I’m really playing a losing game.  

Does anyone have any pointers about how to simply let go and accept that you’re not good looking but still have something to offer? Because I know I have good qualities I just hate that my face is getting in the way of any change or progress.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9a3bs/how_do_i_accept_that_my_face_is_less_than/
64,p9a43u,1629627936,Should I go on a vacation with my ex (who cheated on me)?,"Context : Me and my ex broke up 2.5 years ago. We are both 24 and we dated during university, on and off for 3 years. We had a toxic relationship, he cheated on me multiple times (went on tinder dates, pursued other women but never had sex with anyone else, so he claims atleast). Everytime he'd cheat, AND get caught, he'd come back crying and pleading asking for forgiveness and how he'd change the next time. Happened thrice and didn't change. (One of these 3 times he tried to fuck one of my best friends, God bless her, she not only removed herself but told me everything). Ultimately when Uni ended, we moved to different countries in the EU and broke up. 

We decided to stay friends. 
I have zero feelings for him and don't even think of him as a fruit but he seems to think of me as one of his most important friends. 

In the last year, I have really taken control of my life,
1. Working out and getting in shape
2. Going to therapy to get over the anxious attachment style the shitty relationship gave me.
3. Got back on OLD last month and been on 2 dates with an amazing guy.

The event : My ex got back to me yesterday and asked if I'd like to join him on a weekend gateway to Barcelona AS FRIENDS. He was looking for some company and would even plan most things.

The question:
Should I consider going? I don't trust the guy. I am sure he'll say something on seeing my transformation that'd probably hurt me. At the same time I wanna visit Barcelona so having a planned trip could help -- knowing I don't have feelings for him. 

I am confused.

66,p9aabu,1629628873,She will not stop seeking exact details about why I rejected her.,"It wasn't a break up though, because we were not a couple. Like not even close. It's a weird story:

So we met on okcupid. We went on a few fun dates. I was pretty interested, i'd say my interest level was like.... a 7, 7.5 maybe. So we're talking and going on dates and i'm trying to push us into relationship territory and she shoots me down, she's not interested in dating, only friends. We hadn't hooked up or anything, it was just activity dates with flirting and great conversation. 

So some time goes by, its maybe a year later. We've been talking very sparsely if at all. I come up with an idea for a date she can't refuse, a trampoline park. As expected, she did not refuse. But she insist's it's not a date, we're just hanging out. 

So these ""dates but not dates"" go on for a long time and eventually we do start hooking up. I don't remember how long that went on for, I don't think very long, I think it was only a few times. Then I decided that I didn't think we were a great match as a couple so I said I think we should just be friends. This was genuine, I wasn't just doing it to be an ass or to ""gotcha"" her back. We had spent a lot of time together, and she is a very cool girl and very interesting but she's not someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. And I'm 40ish years old at this point, I've lost my taste for ""just for the hell of it"" relationships. She is mid 30s. 

Then the pandemic happened. So we've been friendzoned for over a year now. We have still been hanging out periodically but no hookups or anything romantic. She seems to be ok with being friends most of the time but then from time to time she is not. Lately it's gotten worse. We had a fun day kayaking in a cool spot, everything seemed to go great. Then the next day she was insisting I explain in much more detail what it is I ""don't like about her"". She's totally overreacting about how don't care about her etc etc. But this is the kind of thing she should have went through days, weeks, a month after we did not become a couple. Not a year and a half later. It's so confusing, I've been slow responding to many of her messages lately because I read them and it's like she's been on another planet, i don't understand her point of view at this point at all. 

I guess at the end of the day, the situation is pretty clear. She wanted to be in a relationship, I did not, she was ""dumped"" kinda, and feels bad about it. I get that and I sympathize more than you can imagine. But I still don't want to get into a relationship with her. My feelings are that from a romantic point of view, it came and went, it ran its course, time to move on. From a friends point of view, she's great and I would love to remain friends with her. I've remained friends with many of the girls i've gone on dates with on okcupid - but definitely not all. 

So now she wants a specific answer. And there are specific reasons. There are hygiene issues among many others. But I don't want to give her specifics because I don't want to lead her on and make her think these are problems to be fixed and then we can be together. - thought on the flip side, somehow apparently no one has ever told her about awful hygiene issues and i feel like someone should tell her. There are lots of reasons and listing them out would just pile on and make her feel really terrible. She has some self esteem issues already and this will just make it worse. After all this time, it is only now become clear that this is a situation where being friends isn't going to work. If she's in a bad place, talking to me at all is only going to make her worse.

Was I ever what you wanted? Did you ever really see us together, or was I a comfortable waste of time? You confuse me. I saw your sadness, and I saw the you who was deep down, who didn’t want to lie anymore and hurt the people around him. I’m confused because I saw that person, and I knew that person, but at the same time, I constantly learned about the you who was hiding things and lying, who put me down for just being myself, who had more ego than heart. It’s confusing, even now. I wonder where you are and how you’re doing. I wonder if this hurts you too. I wonder if you regret anything, and I wonder if you know how badly you hurt me. 

I remember that day in the park so well, after the first lies started to surface. We were both crying. I was hurt and confused. You were apologizing, telling me how badly you wanted to change, how you didn’t want to lie anymore. I saw you shaking, I saw your hurt that was inside of you. I wanted to pull you close to my chest, pull you inside next to my heart so you didn’t have to hurt anymore. I wanted to show you that somebody cared, that somebody saw you. 

After that, we slowly unwrapped the perfectly orchestrated stories, which was all I had known of you. Even though we painfully and slowly peeled off layers of lies, I still knew the real you. We were connected. It hurt so badly to learn again and again and again that a little piece of you was a piece that was never really you. You painted yourself with stories to camouflage the hurt, the shame, whatever it was you carried inside you. Maybe you weren’t carrying anything. Maybe it was just emptiness. Maybe you were starving.

74,p9bk6w,1629635129,Asking out a longtime friend,"I (25M) want to ask out a longtime friend of mine (22F) on a date. We've known each other for almost 8 years now. We met back in high school and we hit it off from the very beginning. We've always gotten along well and have always enjoyed each others' company. We have similar backgrounds, interests, and political beliefs.

In full disclosure, I confess that I have at times over the years considered asking her out before, including back in high school, but I never acted on these inclinations at the time. I was always content just remaining friends. I want to emphasize that I have always genuinely valued her friendship, and I still do.

I wouldn't say that we're super close, but we have always been good friends, and run in similar circles. She's dated several guys over the past few years, but I've never been a ""shoulder to cry on,"" and I've always sort of felt we've kind of straddled a line between the friendzone and the possibility of developing into something more (totally subjective on my part, I understand). For my part, I've tried asking out girls and been trying my hand on dating apps, but haven't had much success. I've always been shy with girls and had anxiety and self-esteem issues, but I've always been comfortable around her.

As I said before, I have considered asking her out before, but I never really dwelled on it too long in the past. A multitude of factors contributed to this, namely our schedules (school and work commitments), that she was dating guys at various times, and that quite frankly I didn't really know what I was looking for in a potential relationship at the time. But I've reached a point in my life where I'm feeling more secure in who I am as a person and in my career path, and I know now what I want in a relationship, and I think that she would be right for me. Funny thing is, my friends (and even my kid sister) have joked over the years that she would be a good match for me. She's not dating anyone right now, and her last relationship ended a couple years ago.

I want to tell her how I feel and ask her out, and I know that I can't just keep it bottled up forever, but I'm genuinely worried about potentially losing a friend that I value and cherish. I'm afraid she may be offended, or at the very least made uncomfortable by the feelings that I've developed for her, and may no longer want to be friends. I find now that the anxiety that I've always felt when interacting with other girls has now arisen when I text her or speak with her. I want to firmly express my feelings and my intentions, but I don't want it to potentially come across in a way that might be misconstrued. Above all, I don't want to lose a dear friend, and it's been driving me crazy for weeks now.

They took it for GRANTED so they don't know how valuable it is anymore. It's like when you have good health, you take it for granted, you don't ever value that you are in good health until you get sick, then you will almost trade anything to get that normal everyday health you had back.

If you go to a place where women are treated like shit, and you are a nice person. you will instantly become a hot commodity there. Everyone will lust for your kindness and warmth.. and will just be with you.

Now that was all just a FYI. The real info comes below:

It's not really the 'bad-boy' they are attracted to. It's the 'respect' or 'fear' or 'strength' aura that they draw from others around them.. 'bad-boys' tend to be seen as people with stronger personality and not afraid of conflict. Strong guys, that others are afraid of. 

Now ALL women like to feel safe and protected, being with a 'bad-boy' will give the feeling that they are safe and protected since people 'fear' or dont mess with that 'bad-boy' or he's seen or felt as a strong guy.

Drop all this “bad-boy” bullshit. Women are extremely easy to understand. I will tell you the secret recipe that so many men are oblivious to nowadays. 

Every woman wants to feel safe and protected by their man and also be attracted to them. He needs to be a calm and positive energy. That is - for the most part - all there is to it.

The above means, you need to be a man who has a strong personality and presence. Respected by others (could be because you are the strongest personality in the room, or strongest physically, or successful in life, maybe a 'bad-boy', or even just because you are the most athletic... whatever the reason is, find your own way that forces others naturally to respect you). 

Women are HEAVILY attracted/drawn to guys who are looked up/respected by other guys. they just melt and lose it.. suddenly that guy seems to them like the strongest and most 'alpha' while the others are just followers. 

If you are someone who does nothing when someone slaps you on the face, who is gonna respect you? The fact that you did nothing will instantly lose everyone's respect to you. Even though If i saw that i will come and defend you and maybe make the guy regret slapping you, i will still have less respect to you than how it was before the slap and will give you shit later for allowing it to slide.

Basically, my point is. You can be the NICEST most kindest person anyone has EVER met, yet be the strongest person and most respected person in the room. And girls will literally go to the hospital because they lost so much liquid when they see you from how wet they got... cause they just saw that even the 'badboy' who they thought was the hottest, look up to you and respect you. You will become 10 times hotter than the bad-boy.

Now, guys.. now that you understand the formula, it will take you 3-10, if not even 20 years to become that person I just told you about, depending how much effort you put in to work and improve yourself.

But not for the reason you think 

I’m disgusted ON BEHALF OF THE GIRL that she’d have to be kissing someone as unattractive as me 


It’s a conflict of my desire for intimacy and the extreme guilt that I’d be SUBJECTING a woman to my gross self. 


Anyone have a similar pathological disgust of their own appearance that they actually feel guilty at the very THOUGHT of kissing someone?

91,p9dx17,1629644345,How do you get over the fact that you will probably never communicate again with a 'one night stand'/ person you went on a few great dates with?,"So I guess the issue of 'no contact' is something that mainly comes up for people that have gotten out of long term serious relationship, but not really for ONS or casual relationships.   


To add a bit of context. A few months ago, I met someone whilst out with a few friends at a bar. I spoke with her for about 2 and a half hours, and at the end of the night we exchanged numbers. I felt that we really vibed, because I find out that we had heaps in common, and we even had quite a few mutual friends since we grew up in the same area. After texting for a few days, we arranged to go on a date together the following week.  


The date we went on was probably the best date I'd ever had in my life, and it was such a surreal experience from start to finish. She was such a warm,  easygoing person and down to earth person, that I felt that I could just be myself around them. After approximately 4 hours, she invited me back to her place. I ended up staying the entire night and morning with her even after we had hooked up. We went out for a really nice walk in the morning, where we just held hands and cuddled for a bit and got some coffee, before I left.  


Even though we did make plans to see one another again on the date, she did tell me a few days later that whilst she had a great time with me, she wasn't in the right space to pursue anything serious, and did not want to lead me on. I know that that can sometimes be an excuse to 'gently' let someone down, but regardless of whether she was honest or not, I obviously went with the flow and let her know that that was completely cool and I was glad to have met her.  


To cut to the chase, that was the last time we communicated with one another. Looking back it was a great memory and a great experience(something I've replayed in my head a thousand times now), and not because of the fact we hooked up, but rather because of the connection/potential connection I felt I made with someone. Whilst i'm not in any way hurt by this or feel 'lead on', there is a bit of an empty feeling, knowing that I've never been in contact with them since and accepting that I'm probably never going to communicate with them again(both in text and in person). The latter part really does sting because I do realise that I still would have loved to stay friends with them.   


I guess what I'm trying to get out of writing this post on an internet forum, is to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation? How do you really accept the fact that you will never be in contact with someone again whether thats in the context of a short term or a long term connection? I know that there are heaps of subs like 'reddit no contact' and heaps of others places  which discuss not contacting an ex partner. But I don't really think the advice really applies here, because I was not in a LTR with this person, nor was I really even 'dating' them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9dx17/how_do_you_get_over_the_fact_that_you_will/

After dinner she asked if I wanted to go back to my place for a while and of course I was down with that. So we hung out the for a while and started making out.

After a while she told me she isn’t ready for us to go any farther yet and I told her I was ok with that. She asked if I was mad about it and I told her of course not. Right now we’re vibing so good and getting to know her better has been great. I’m not willing to mess this up for anything. When the time is right it’ll happen.

Anyway she told me she thought maybe she was ready. She said she had packed an overnight bag just in case but she got cold feet. She just wants to be sure and she wants us to take our time. I said I feel the same way. We talked a bit and we both have some bad experiences in our past that make intimacy a little challenging at times.

Well it got so late that she was yawning and I felt like I was about to pass out. She said she was going to drive home and I said if she wanted to sleep over I’d take the sofa and she could have my bed. She thought about it for a second and said ok. 

After we got ready for bed she asked if I wanted to cuddle with her for a little while and we laid down in my bed and ended up falling asleep like that.

98,p9ejrz,1629646358,"I think that I (26, M) have been using my girlfriend (22,F) What do I do?"," 

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for four months, talking for six. It feels like she is putting in so much work into our relationship and she is doing so much for me because she loves me, whether it be, being aware of the way she acts or what she says so that it doesn't bother me, doing things for me that I don't want to do so that I don't have to, the list goes on and on..

Don't get me wrong, I put in my fair share into the relationship, I care about her and I am there for her when she needs me. I have been trying hard to make it work, but something in me feels off. I feel guilty and I think to myself that she deserves someone better, someone, that doesn't make her feel stressed, someone that really loves her, because I have no idea if I truly do or not.

The first couple of months we were talking, I thought to myself that I will get to sleep with her and I will figure out my feelings for her eventually so I left it at that. Over time I would find something about her that I liked and my feelings for her would build up, but then I would see something that I didn't like or found annoying and I would think about it until my feelings for her would disappear. I would constantly switch from liking her to not liking her from week to week. I had periods of time where I thought about breaking up with her, and I would stop because I would think to myself that there is still more I can learn about myself being in this relationship.

Last week I was madly in love with her, I couldn't wait to see her and I loved spending every minute with her. This week we have been fighting and trying to come up with a solution every day and I told her why I wasn't sure if I truly liked her or not. She asked what is stopping me and I told her that because I am learning so much about myself and from her that I don't want it to end yet. She then asked if I was using her and I didn't know how to respond. I felt so guilty right then and there, it felt like the truth or that she was spot on. I looked back and thought to myself that I never really thought of it that way other than the few times that I thought to myself that I don't want to break up yet.

This has really hit home and is making me question whether or not I have been. I am starting to think and believe that I have been using her and I feel terrible about it. I think that I should break up with her because she doesn't deserve it.

TL;DR I think I have been using my gf, but I don't know for sure and if it's ok to keep on with the relationship. Don't know if I should end things with her or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9ejrz/i_think_that_i_26_m_have_been_using_my_girlfriend/
