This post is gonna be long so please bear with me. 

I received a message from this guy on Instagram a week ago. He hit on me casually and I kinda refused his advances, since he was persistent in getting to know me, I started talking to him and eventually gave him my number since Instagram isn‚Äôt necessarily the ideal place to chat. We live in two geographical locations and due to the covid situation in my country, meeting up for a date is a long shot for now.
Things were going great. We both have our jobs and his seems to be more occupying, in the beginning two three days we used to talk for 2-3 hours. Then the weekdays came and his replies grew shorter and the duration became longer. He did mention he was busy with work, otherwise he really likes talking to me. It was perfectly understandable but I do see him online on Instagram often. 
Not just this, Idk if he is a bad texter or doesn‚Äôt seem interested, but he doesnt really make a conscious effort in getting to know me. He stopped flirting altogether, maybe as a consequence to him being busy. I sent him a long ass text two days ago, asking him if he is playing games to get me interested in him,and I look forward to remain friends with him. Idk if that makes me look needy, but I felt I had to tell him this. 
Since his replies seemed low effort, I sent him a two word reply yesterday and didn‚Äôt text him again.

I really treasure alone time and talking to people I don't feel completely safe with makes me extremely nervous and anxious. I only have female best friends and have some male acquaintances but never really talked to guys in a non-platonic way. FYI never dated. 

But the first guy I talked to frequently that was semi non-platonic (he confused me with his flirting and even told me he'd date me if we were not long-distance but would always be my friend) made me realize something was wrong with me. I just instinctively want to avoid him for fear of making a mistake or stress. Like I don't even know if I had feelings or not, and honestly don't think I would let myself like someone I know I will never meet in real life. Like I just didn't want to talk to him because it stressed me out so much in a way I couldn't understand. I really regret my actions because I realized I could have hurt him, knowingly or unknowingly. 

When I talked to other guys I saw myself doing the same thing but not as chaotic because I kind of learned how to text. Hating the need to text back. Like when I see the notification I kind of dread it. I don't know why I feel this way. The funny thing is when I cleared up that I only wanted a platonic relationship, my stress disappeared and the dread disappeared. 

I don't know what it is. Is it the fear of having an ambiguous relationship when I personally don't have and ""can't"" have feelings? Am I just avoidant of feelings in general because I am scared? 

The thing is I really want to love but in the face of opportunity I just dread it????? I crave romance secretly and reject it outwardly it is just so weird. I really don't know if I can even date healthily like this, or even date at all because something is wrong with me.

Why is it I meet guys and they seem like such gentlemen and wonderful people but I have no feelings?

I was hoping to turn this around after moving to Scotland early this year. It has not been the best time for anyone. I have been trying to meet people online and it seems to be next to impossible. 

I find it hard to make an impression through pictures or brief interactions. Longer chats, talks, or time in general is the key for me. Dating apps work purely based on the popular notions of attractiveness. I see that my while tall male friend manages a date every other week while I struggle to get matched or start a conversation. This makes me worry and has resulted in a low self-image of myself. I do not understand what the barrier is (race? color? Or something else?) or how to overcome it. I mostly attribute it to my looks (not that it is bad, but not one that can make a great first impression). 

I just want the opportunity for more human interactions. I have waited a long time to be in a more open minded and liberal society and really want to make the best of it. Maybe I sound desperate, but these are desperate times. Is it next to impossible or is there a way to make this work?

If another comes by, I won't ignore it, but my own personal standards have only ever been met by that one woman.

On that note, my goal is simply to meet women and get dates. I'm really not disqualifying for lackluster personalities at this point. I haven't been touched in 3 years, and it kills me.

I'm a guy in my early 20s, I work the night shift, and have my own place. My only hobbies, things that I genuinely enjoy doing, are going to the shooting range (VERY taboo in my state), hunting (activity that is normally done alone/early in the morning), and watching movies, usually at home. I'm also very into politics, but I fall into a pretty hated category by folks both sides of the isle, so it's often times best to leave that subject alone around new people.

I'm decently attractive, and I'm starting to work out consistently. Confidence has certainly been my downfall, but I'm attempting to work on it day by day, and I do see progress.

With all of that in mind, I'm wondering: how am I supposed to meet people?

I'm a firm believer that women can sniff out fakers, so thrusting myself into situations where I don't want to be (social events, etc) and attempting to play it cool would be pretty unproductive; I couldn't do it convincingly. On the same note; I can't, for the life of me, fake small talk. On occasion I can add a joke or two (usually never a good one). But, by in large, unless you're my friend or I have a legitimate topic to discuss with you, I CAN NOT pretend to carry a conversation. I get quiet, my brain fogs up, and I can't conjure up anything I deem valuable enough to say.

I see friends and family extremely often, but typically at my home or theirs. On my own, I live an extremely solitary lifestyle. I don't leave the house unless I've got somewhere to be.

I've tried Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, PoF, OkC, all of them; and in most cases I've paid into them. I won't begrudge anybody with the problems of 2021 online dating, but I'm sure you can imagine the results I've gotten.

I know that the simple answer is ""keep improving, love yourself, forget about women"", but I've got a massive libido, and more importantly, admittedly being desired by a woman sexually or otherwise brings me more satisfaction than anything else I've accomplished.

Given that my problem isn't attractiveness, or even personality (I'm very compassionate and empathetic, I simply can't feign interest or add to a conversation if I'm not personally interested in the topic), what should I do?








Tl;Dr: I live alone, work at night, and rarely see women (save for, perhaps at a store every few weeks). My hobbies are extremely taboo where I'm from, and I'm horrible at pretending to enjoy or do anything else (women can detect this, anyway). I can't hold a conversation unless it's something that pertains to my interest, or if I'm being asked for advice/opinions. I've taken time to love and better myself, but I have an extremely high libido, and being desired by a woman is what brings me the most joy.

Sometimes when I'm talking to her about something and she disagrees with me she snaps at me and it makes me feel like sh*t, or if i respond to her saying I know, she thinks I'm basically telling her to shut up.

He was my 3rd serious boyfriend and was my boyfriend for the longest amount of time.

I thought he was really going to be the one but our relationship got toxic a year ago. I tried to hold on, I couldn't see he was bad for me and our relationship finally halted when I found out he cheated on me with numerous girls.

I was so devastated I couldn't get out of bed for a week and even stopped attending online classes.

I stopped school for a semester.

I hated myself. I told myself I don't wanna feel this down ever again.

I began throwing all the stuff he gave me. I began throwing out all the clothes I've worn when i was with him.

I've re decorated and re-arranged my room.

I've decided to become a new person!

I'm just a simple type of girl who doesn't wear make up. I just dress in a plain blue t-shirt and jeans. I just always wear sandals or plain blue chuck taylors. That's all I wear and when it's winter, a black coat and a black jacket. I wasn't a girly type of girl. Just plain.

I began shopping for new clothes. I began buying dresses. I also brought all sorts of clothing in colors that I don't wear: Red, pink, yellow, White...(I always wear blue)

I brought my first tie dye hoodie. 

Also brought new 6 pairs of shoes, shoes that I don't typically wear.

I've always had short hair up to my shoulders. I began to let it grow until until it reached my back.

I also went to a salon and got a new hairstyle. It is much wavier now and I had it dyed from my natural dark brown to blonde.

I also began putting on makeup a lot more.

I also enrolled in an online cooking and baking class and just recently made my first cake.

I also began making new friends and acquaintances.

Plus I began taking care of my body a lot more. I began jogging and brought a pair of weights.

In the past I had a little bloat in my stomach but now since I jog, it disappeared. 

And lastly, I changed my name. My full first name is Natalie Grace. My parents, cousins, friends, schoolmates call me Natalie and Nat. 

I do not want to be called Natalie or Nat anymore. I changed my name on my socials to be only Grace. I began calling myself Grace when introducing myself to new people.

Recently I also began opening up my heart again.

And I made the decision that if there is an opportunity, I would like to date out of my race.

I've always dated Caucasian guys. All my ex boyfriends are white.

I began a change of perspective on who I view as attractive.

It is time for a new change!

I want to date someone I don't usually go for in the past. I want to become more open-minded.

Very recently I just met an Asian Cambodian American man. We met through my cousin and I think he's cute.

He's very sweet and a gentleman. He's the first man to ever give me flowers and old fashioned hand written loved letters to me (All my exes does not do that and who knew I would really like that!)

We began flirting and as of now I really like him.

Time will tell if this will go well, I hope it does.

This time I'm NEW.

I also began reading about what makes a good a lasting relationship, how to screen potential  partners properly and how to figure out what I've done wrong in the past when it comes to relationships so I can approve.

I just don't know how to act around this girl.

Me (32M) she (27)

It all started around the beginning of January. We hit it off on tinder and then quickly moved to WhatsApp and started chatting intensively. After a while, we decided that we should hang out and I went to her apartment and it was great. The sex was great, our conversations were great, true chemistry. So this went on for weeks. I was at her like every second day and we're chatting constantly and both were deep in a crush. Sometimes I had the feeling that she was better than me. She had more education, had worked on better jobs, had traveled more and I guess I become envoys, but never really showed it to her. 

After about two months of this, we decided to meet each other's family. She went to mine first and the day after we were both hangover and she said ""we are different in a way"" Of course, it gave me severe anxiety but she calmed me down and said everything was good, just a thought she had. The next two weeks were not great. She had a lot of troubles at work and it took a toll on me as well. I thought that she didn't want me around but she said ""no I want you here, it's just the job"" And we decided that easter was going to spend with her family. All this got to me and pressure from work and I collapsed back into my OCD and had to start on anti-depressing again.

Easter went by and I thought it went ok.. but she told me afterward that it didn't go well. She thought that I did not want to be there with her and it was not fun for her. We had a quiet couple of days and then we met up and she said that we were too different from each other. She did not see a future with me. Somehow we could not separate from each other and started to kiss and she said ""let's just take a couple of days apart, I have to think"" And it was tough. She wrote to me and was sad and I was really sad. I mean, I have strong feelings for her. We met up at her apartment and had sex right away and later during dinner she said ""this is not gonna work""

We both cried cried cried so much the whole night. We both realized that this could not be the end. I mean, we can't do it. We want each other, but it doesn't work. And the day after she came to my apartment and we had sex again and told each other to ""phase this out""So we started to meet every couple of days, had sex but now we, according to her: ""we're not actively going for a relationship, just dating at her place and having sex""

This went on for a month. I felt like shit because I have feelings for her, but at the same time, I started to hate her just for not liking me back. She got cold and could say stuff like ""I've given all I can, but I still want you to text to me like everything is normal"" or small hints that she wanted to ""have the cake and eat it as well"" It got to a point where I would wake up three in the morning and just google ""I'm being used an FBW"" just to get advice. She gave me small indications that ""I can't say where this is leading, I don't know if I'm going to fall in love"" but I mean her eyes were cold. She loved the sex. But didn't want to know anything more about my personality.

Somehow I finally dared to stand up and say ""Enough, I can't do this anymore"" and we both cried and talked on the phone and she said that she lost respect for me in the last month and admitted that she had been mean and we both triggered things, bad things, from each other. She wanted to reach out in a week (upcoming Tuesday 18/5) just to see how we are feeling and if everything is OK, but I don't know. I said I did not want her to do it, it must be me.

Of course, I want to talk to her, I mean, I still have feelings even though it's been shit for a while, but don't know If I should just give her the cold shoulder or reach out?",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,777528,public,self,Don't know how to act around this girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndpr8c/dont_know_how_to_act_around_this_girl/,all_ads,6,,,

And brushes it off as (it‚Äôs over now/I‚Äôll be fine) and I‚Äôm starting to feel like hes hiding how he really feels about me , I feel as if he‚Äôs tired of me. 
And i can see he hasn‚Äôt been happy, idk if it‚Äôs me annoying him, or I‚Äôm just adding on to his issues . And every weekend I come to him happy and excited to see him, just for me to do something that will piss him off and our whole day wasted.
I believe a break is needed, so I don‚Äôt hate him.

*Things to know:*
‚Ä¢My bf does have anger issues and he‚Äôs aware of them 
‚Ä¢ He goes to counseling with his mom and brother(but idk if it‚Äôs specifically for his problems or his family‚Äôs)
‚Ä¢ 10 month relationship
‚Ä¢My first Bf, I‚Äôm his 3rd serious GF, every other fling/ gf he‚Äôs been with, he states they‚Äôre toxic/disrespectful etc.
‚Ä¢always talks about our future and what we‚Äôll do, talked about a wedding not too long ago. 
‚Ä¢ he hates working night shift but does it for school
‚Ä¢when he‚Äôs angry he leaves and comes back okay/happy, as if he‚Äôs over it (he leaves for at least 20+ mins
‚Ä¢this problem hasn‚Äôt happened since the beginning of our relation 

Been dating since last July, during the first semester of school i seen him once a month for the weekend, cause he stayed in a dorm and went to school 2hrs away. This semester he‚Äôs at a closer school and commutes and I been seeing him every weekend. When he started his new job at UPS (night shifts) in March, I would only see him once or twice on the weekend and I wouldn‚Äôt know until that weekend. 



**Anyway:**we have been good for a very long time, no arguments 3 weeks ago we had a lovely picnic in a park by the river. (To note recent feelings: that he told me that he was grateful for me and appreciates our time and dates) 
However, after that weekend he‚Äôs been so angry and annoyed by little things.

For the past 2 weeks he‚Äôs been having issues with his mom, (him and his mom don‚Äôt get along well) and they been arguing. He lets me know how frustrating and tired he is of her and can‚Äôt wait to move out. Some days he stays at his granny to avoid her. He has been coming over with an attitude, because of his mom and normally  it‚Äôs because fri. Is his longest shift 9-6, and he always complains about sleep and being tired, so I‚Äôm it‚Äôs both of those things. 

One Sunday I was laying down on tik tok, and my door shut. He texts me hear and I sent him an talkin emoji telling him to come in, the door was locked (but I thought it was unlocked cause my mom just came back in and she doesn‚Äôt always lock the door), so he claims he was knocking for a while, and I got up when my dog started barking at the door, but my mom was in the kitchen and opened the door before me. So come in with an attitude, ‚Äúwtf are you doing why you not answering the door..blah‚Äù, 
And I tell him, I just didn‚Äôt get up in a hurry, and figured my mom would open it cause she‚Äôs right there. So he was annoyed about that for hrs, he stayed tho and didn‚Äôt go home. When we talk about a couple hours later he like it ‚Äúit don‚Äôt make no f‚Äî sense why u just didn‚Äôt get up, like I‚Äôm trying to understand it‚Äôs so dumb, and yk I was outside and told me to come in...blahs‚Äù
So after that he leaves, (he always leaves his stuff and just go drive around) and then comes back, happy and like he wasn‚Äôt just yelling at me &amp; nothing happened. 

Yesterday, I play sports(college) so had meet, yesterday and unexpectedly my dad came (he from MI) and had me out late, he wanted to spend time with me. The day before me and him planes to spend yesterday together, (just our normal watch movies and eat). He knows my meet was an 1.5 hrs away, So I txt him and let him know I‚Äôm with my dad at 2:30 and we are visiting ppl, but we are on our way back now . At 4 he‚Äôs responds an reads my text (so I‚Äôm guessing he just woke up cause he normal wakes up between 2-4) and says okay thank u for letting me know cause he was about to come over
So I say we stopped to eat, tbh my dad was just fooling around and I told him I wanted to go home, but he drives slows and makes so many stops.
So I let him know I‚Äôm home at 6. And he‚Äôs txt smart like (are you sure) and th. comes over with an attitude. And doesn‚Äôt talk to me or in short sent. Until 8:30 and the whole time I‚Äôm asking him what‚Äôs wrong, how you feel, are you okay, do you want to talk,etc? 
He leave a and then comes back.
Then he tells me he was upset that he basically put off his whole day , waiting on me thanking I was gonna be home at 4-5. And that‚Äôs when he tells me he woke up around 2 and had to take his brother to work and help his granny and then look at Message. And  his friend asked him at 3 if he wanted to go play football and he told him know cause after he takes his brother to work it‚Äôll be 4 and he‚Äôll be coming over my house . So he‚Äôs upset he didn‚Äôt get to hang out with his best friend and been waiting on me all day .

So I told him will take a break for a couple weeks and next weekend I to stay home and i texted his friend to hang out with him, to make up for yesterday. And he said that‚Äôs fair, and next time he let me know when he wants to do something else besides come over.
This morning he told good morning he loves me and to let me know if I‚Äôll be home for him to come over ....",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,777638,public,self,I [18F] think my bf[20M] is unhappy.

I met F18 in HS , and we‚Äôve been friends for quite sometime. I showed up to her Apartment with flowers and we started our date. Now to give some context, F is not a touchy individual, doesn‚Äôt express emotions as much, and is extremely straight forward. Also, this is the second person I‚Äôve been on a date with. I‚Äôm a pretty nervous guy and sometimes let my anxiety get the best of me at times. I‚Äôve been on one relationship which only lasted 7 months. But that‚Äôs besides the point. We continued and got lunch, laughed a bit then we went to the arcade. But I started to notice that she was snapping during the date which I don‚Äôt mind, since I didn‚Äôt know who it was. I then realized that is was this guy, and this guy was were PlayStation friend. I was like ok, but in the back of my mind I found it kinda strange. We then we were on our way to the arcade, and the conversation of her father came up and she then said how I‚Äôd meet him soon. We then arrived at the arcade and had a blast. We then got smoothies and then I noticed she had snapped this guy again, so I went to the bathroom to just take a second since my anxiety was getting to me. When I got back I just asked if they‚Äôre a thing at any time and she told me how they‚Äôre just friends on PlayStation and nothing more. So then I just dropped it. We proceeded to a nature park and then I dropped her off. I then said how I had a great time and was wondering if she would like to do this again sometime. She said how she had a great time and she wants to go on another date. After she left she snapped me saying, ‚ÄúThank you for hanging today :)!‚Äù. Now first off, I 100% don‚Äôt mind girls having guy friends vise versa.

I have been working out consistently 3-7 days a week for about 20 years now since I was a teen but I'm still kind of ""scrawny"" by most definitions. If I eat more I can easily gain weight but it mostly ends up being fat and when I trim that off after I'm back where I started. A lot of people seem to think if you work out regularly you should look like The Rock, but in reality most guys just end up looking like Hugh Jackman in the FIRST X-Men movie (all the other ones he was on major steroids). ie. Like a trim and fit but still normal guy.

Health and fitness is important to me so I would like to match to women who are lean and fit as well. But the only ones I get likes from are severely overweight.

I have a 10 year degree and a job that pays top 1-2% income. I have had loads of female and male friends in my life and most people describe me as kind, friendly, outgoing, and upbeat. I have lots of hobbies and varied interests. I have tried going to MeetUps but they're all guys.

I have had female friends and relatives make me profiles which do no better than my own. I have posted for reviews and been told my profile looks good. I even bought a fancy DSLR and tripod to take new photos but it didn't make any difference.

The only ""problems"" I or any of my relatives or friends can identify are that I am 5'8"", brown, and have a mediocre face. It's funny because people will on one hand say ""Those things don't matter!"" if you bring them up. However, on the other hand, if a guy on a dating subreddit says ""I'm 6'2"" and white and people call me handsome"" the automatic reply is ""Well that should make it a lot easier then!""

I suppose I‚Äôll provide a bit of backstory before going into it: I‚Äôm fairly recently out of a LTR that was touch-and-go/unstable, and overall just really not good for me. Totally over it at this point and thoroughly enjoying being free from that person. They were too much. Neediness, clinginess, I felt smothered, happy to be out. Grateful for it though, because now I feel like I have a really solid understanding of what I want/don‚Äôt want in a partner. Landed a really solid new job, finally feeling fully independent and stoked on starting a new chapter in my life.

So, I took a good amount of time to myself, started getting into my new work routine. Then, since I am but flesh and blood, I downloaded Tinder. Been there before, dated people off there, met FWBs, etc., so like a lot of people my experience there is a mixed bag. I figured what the hell, I‚Äôm not attaching myself to any outcomes and I‚Äôd just like to see where this leads.

Matched with this girl. And wow. We really hit it off. It‚Äôs super rare that I have this kind of rapport with someone just exchanging messages. We have a ton in common, particularly taste in music (I‚Äôm a lifelong musician). That was a big factor in this sudden attraction, its so rare that someone has the same kind of taste that I do. Theres a lot more I like about her than that of course, but that was the first thing.

So, naturally, I really wanted to meet her in person. We moved off the app, started texting, exchanged tons of music recs, talked about other interests, set a date, and we met yesterday. Grabbed some coffee, and went to a nice place in a nearby park. 

I was so excited leading up to this, but also super apprehensive and worried. I was concerned that we wouldn‚Äôt vibe talking in person and that everything would fall flat. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. We talked for hours, conversation just flowed and I found myself going from liking the idea of her to really liking her as a person. And she‚Äôs also way way way cuter in person, like damn.

So, after extended conversation it was getting to the point where we both should probably get going. And I was like, *hey so how‚Äôre you feeling about this?* She was slightly taken aback, and offered me the same question in kind. I said *I definitely like you, you‚Äôre super smart, we share a lot of similar interests, you‚Äôre really interesting, and on top of all that I think you‚Äôre pretty cute. Are you interested in seeing me again?* She giggled, and said *You‚Äôre direct, I like that, and yes I‚Äôm definitely down to see you again. Also I definitely think you‚Äôre cute too, I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt have swiped right if I didn‚Äôt, right?*

So, I walk her to where she‚Äôll catch the bus, we hugged, I told her I‚Äôd send her those albums I told her about later, and I was on my way.

As I make my way home my heart is in my throat. I can‚Äôt get her out of my mind. This feeling has been more or less constant since yesterday, still there as I‚Äôm writing this. I haven‚Äôt had this feeling in my chest and butterflies in my stomach for a long long time. Its so fucking unexpected. And I‚Äôm scared. The few times I‚Äôve felt this way about someone it has not ended well. It usually gets chalked up to the other person just not feeling the same way. 

I‚Äôve spent so much time slowly, brick by brick, building my confidence in myself when it comes to matters of the heart. I have my flaws, but I‚Äôm working them out. I‚Äôm not perfect, but I know for damn sure that I have a lot to offer someone. Now that I‚Äôm getting this feeling again I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll get shut down and all that confidence I worked so hard to build up is going to come crashing down. I also absolutely hate the fact that I can‚Äôt get her out of my mind. How the hell did I become so infatuated with someone so easily? Its really messing with me. I know I just have to be patient and see where things go, but its not easy. I just wanted to get this all written down and vent it out to some strangers on a subreddit.

I dated a guy some time ago who was very much a ladies' man. His way of talking to girls was very flirtatious. When we were dating he refused to tell anyone that we were dating, citing cultural reasons that dating is taboo/only tell when you are engaged or married, etc. So, everyone thought he's single.

I was by no means insecure. I know we all have friends of various genders and I'm fine with that. But it did irk me that he wouldn't tell anyone that he even was dating me and then went around flirting with other girls...it may give them the wrong idea. There was this one friend that he had, a single female, whom he always talked about-he always apparently hung out with her. It was impromptu post-work hangouts, according to him, so he didn't invite me-which was fine by me. It was always them one on one. She like anyone else had no clue this dude was even dating someone (ie me).

One day he uploaded a FB profile pic of the two of them SUPER close to each other. From the way pic was zoomed in, you couldn't see the rest of their bodies (ie, arms around each other etc). Now normally I wouldn't care if there were pictures like that around or floating on social media. But I tried to explain to him that: (1) I totally trusted him but (2) people in the outside world don't even know he's dating me or about me and (3) they'll see his, specifically as a profile picture, and get the wrong idea. Profile pictures with someone of the opposite gender are not always indicative of a relationship but that's often what it is...they were so close together too. He refused to take it down, I said nothing about it, but admittedly it did hurt that he wouldn't tell anyone about me yet seemingly led this girl on.

A day later: she apparently strained a muscle in her thigh. He volunteered to go down and massage it. 

We broke up for other reasons. But reflecting back on this makes me think someone who is serious about a relationship would at least tell their close friends about it and not pose as a single person.

In case anyone wonders how the story ended: the girl got a boyfriend, maybe 3 months after I broke up with mine. She then stopped hanging out with my ex.

Regardless of this when I see a woman Im interested in I approach her and introduce myself, and I get to know her, I talk about things that we have in common, for example a girl I talked to at gamestop who was looking at Destiny, we talked about the game, and I enjoyed the conversation with her, or when I was at the library and saw this girl browsing the sci fi section. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I always try to be myself during these interactions and I am able to get them to laugh and I hope enjoy the conversation but whenever I ask for their number I always get rejected. This has gone on for a year without success. I

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldnt expect girls to give me anything just because they enjoyed an interaction, and I do my best not to let these things get me down. but it really gets frustrating when I see other guys have more success with girls in 2 weeks than I do in an entire year. I've read from advice on other posts by women saying that its a lack of chemistry and that its fine because you arent supposed to have chemistry with everyone, but like, if thats the case, why are there other guys who can get multiple girls numbers as easy as it is to slice butter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things that I've tried to improve my chances of getting a date is, giving a girl my number instead of hers. Not expecting anything of the interactions that I have and being outcome independent (for about a year, this post is now my breaking point). Asking more about the girl and focusing on getting to know her past her looks(I've started loving this more because before I used to be really shallow and nervous about girls because they were really attractive to me and I used to put them on a pedestal, but after getting to know some of them, I realize that some of the entitled ones that I met were really not worth the time.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have a pretty good personality and figured out recently that what I love most about my character (a woman friend of mine told me what she liked about me the most because we were talking about the self esteem we have in each other and she told me this out of the blue and it made me really happy and I sort of started liking my personality more because of it) is my patience, apparently Im not short tempered like most freshmen in college and my patience for others is comforting because i dont put pressure on people when getting to know them, doing something with them, or helping them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get a little bit envious at times (Im trying to work on it) when I see women friends of mine who fawn over other guys because of their physical apperance who they havent gotten a chance to know, its like they see them, and BAM, the ladies are simping for them, usually its white guys with some really sharp jawlines (I state race because I have an insecurity that im not attractive to people because im black, I got bullied a lot because of my skin colour in highschool). I get mad at myself when I think like this because I know its bad that Im getting jealous over guys who women think are more attractive physically than me.

Anyway, I just wanted some advice, I just had a panic attack while thinking about this earlier and wanted to get it off my chest.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,777936,public,self,I feel like im not physically attractive enough to women to have them interested in getting to know me beyond a simple 2 minute interaction when I approach them.

So I don't often do this however I feel need help with this one. So basically me 26/25M (birthday soon) has never been on a date! WHAT I KNOW RIGHT! So several reasons for this confidence is basically extinct like I have been hurt ages ago and I have lost confidence massively and I have never really met the right person who I might have wanted to go out with also  I have been so work driven literally haven't had a full week off work since September. However recently we have had a reshuffle and new staff have joined. I saw this one person caught my eye. She is exactly my type a great sense of humour (Like seriously good sense of humour) and just all up a great person. However I am not sure..... Basically the first interaction was AWFUL! I was such a Fricking arsehole as I was having such a bad day due where I was living was HORRENDOUS! However I basically didn't hear her get introduced to me and basically I ignored them and was really rude! Its not me at all and I have apologised profusely as I was completely in the wrong. However from then we hit it off and well over this weekend we were having a great laugh and just found each other funny and even today she shared stuff with me about some stuff and it seems like its going well. But I am not sure because I am a try too hard sorta guy and it always fails when speaking to her with other people around but when I am with her I am relaxed and super chilled and just find it super easy to talk to and this never happens. WHAT DO I DO! I like her but she works with me but  is in a different department and is away from where I work for a few days at other locations so I question the rule of don't poop where you eat. But I just don't know I fear asking her if she wants to go for a drink after work LIKE SERIOUSLY FEAR IT if it were to go wrong but when I am around her and today it was great is it me being stupid. I just don't know what to do.....",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,777953,public,self,Heart says yes Head says maybe not!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndvcz1/heart_says_yes_head_says_maybe_not/,all_ads,6,,,
