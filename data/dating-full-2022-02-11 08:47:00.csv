Now it’s been two month that we are out together, spending so much time together, every other day I go to his place. 

He is painting the girl, that now he calls her “his sister” (which I hate because I feel like it’s just a term that he uses for the girls) for her birthday present. He is really good at painting anyway. 

Now because of what he said in the past about her, or any other girls, always come to hunt me sometimes when he mentions them. 

And one thing: he never says I’m beautiful ever. Not when we are high, or sober. Never heard of it once. 

I hate to overthink, I’m trying to not. But sometimes when he says things about these girls that he used to compliment, I feel like he’s hiding something.

Is this valid at all? I hate of my ability to not trust people so I had to ask.

About 3 months ago she shot her shot and we became intimate, since of this year we became more serious about our thing. We discussed a bit about our sexual past and hers is a bit troublesome. She had a few toxic boyfriends and I think that messed her up a bit. Some abused her emotionally and some tried to force her into sex sometimes and from what I see she developed a problem in saying ""No."".  


She is astonished at the fact that I pay attention to her, such as packing lunch for her when she sleeps at my place, remember small thing about her(she sleeps with a bottle of water next to the bed because she gets thirsty over night, I always put one when she sleep at my place and similar things). I am assuming she dated mostly douches in the past years.  
Last night I've asked her if she still has social contact with people she slept with and she said there are 2 guys. One that is in her social circle and they had a fling about 3 years ago and a college colleague which is now a co-worker. At the time she slept with the latter they weren't co-workers and she doesn't plan to stay much more in her current office. What bothers me is the fact that they were kinda good friends before sleeping with each other and now they still snap each other for some reason. I've mentioned that I'm more upset about the fact that they still talk outside of work than they're hookup. She said that if she stops talking to him he becomes a upset and starts nagging her why she doesn't text him anymore. Here her saying ""no"" problem comes. I don't know how to proceed from here.  


Overall I really like her, she is sweet and we are compatible on many sides of our life(gym,sexual,emotional) but I really don't want to endorse this behavior of hers. I'm assuming as of our discussion last night she will talk to him and try to cut ties, but if not how to I proceed from here?

Lastly I want to ask her more about her sexual past because it is concerning but I don't really know how to ask without being to nosy. I want to ask her how many sexual partners she had but this is double edge sword.

I want to provide him with that safe space or that moment of contentment when he's with me so I'm wondering what makes males feel this way? It can be both in a physical or verbal sense but primarily non-sexual.

I would ask him ... but I wouldn't want him to think I'm manufacturing that for him, I just want to provide for him just as he provides for me (he brings out my fun, spontaneous side and encourages me to do things out of my comfort zone)

That being said, I’d like to get into the dating pool (once I feel like I’ve become a good enough guy). One of the things I value the most is time. So In all of your guys experience when is a good time to mention to a potential partner that you aren’t interested in having kids.

We already had 2 dates, which went great. We speak a lot and whenever I'm with her I feel such a huge sympathy and attraction to her.

But I don't feel the emotional connection yet. The problem is that she is a very introverted person without experiences in social life in general. She already told me a lot about her past, that she moved very often and that she doesn't had the chance to make friends or even get into a relationship, or so.

She is quite open with me and tell me a lot what she experienced and felt in that situation, but I'm not sure why, but I can't feel this. It's like someone is telling me the news. I wouldn't say without emotions but I don't feel her emotions when she tell me this things.

Again, she is a really introverted person and because of my past I know that it's hard to open up to someone when you've never made such experiences. 

A few years ago I was always like that. I also was a very introverted person and I would have behaved the same way then. I think this is also a point, why am I so much into it, without feeling this emotional connection.

We've been on three dates and get on really well, I'd love to keep seeing her. One drawback is that she has Celiac disease, and for anyone who doesn't know, it's essentially an extreme allergy to gluten which is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Celiac can be a little different from person to person, but generally the reaction to gluten is so extreme that food prep areas have to be completely sanitized to prevent trace amounts of gluten from contaminating food being consumed by the person with Celiac.

She's expressed that it's been a really tough journey being diagnosed - she'd been told the symptoms were all in her head throughout highschool and it took a long time before she finally got diagnosed. Now, she makes every effort to avoid gluten primarily in food but also in any sort of skin products or comparable items since it's the only way to ""treat"" Celiac. 

Gluten appears in all sorts of food items in which you wouldn't necessarily expect to find it, so I respect that eating out and trusting that her food has been handled in a way that won't make her sick is extremely emotionally exhausting and stressful. I respect how impactful this obstacle has been on her life and I want to support her as she navigates it. 

Here's the problem scenario: last night, she asked me if I wanted to get dinner today. I said sure and asked where she wanted to go, but she turned the question back on me. I said that I wouldn't want to choose somewhere that she can't even safely eat at, and her reaction from there kind of rubbed me the wrong way. She said verbatim ""yay time for you to improve your research skills. you can take a small look into my life by doing so."" I wrote back basically saying I have no idea where to start because I don't know if she trusts any given restaurant to sanitize the prep area during the food prep process just because they have a gluten free menu, I don't know if she trusts establishments just because they verbally say they're taking precautions, and I don't know if there are certain dishes or cuisines that she completely dislikes anyways. I told her I'm perfectly willing to Google around, but it would save the both of us some time if she could rule out certain places immediately so I don't have to keep finding options, bringing them to her, and then finding out they won't work for her all before tomorrow night. It seems like the standard disclaimer for plenty of establishments essentially states that they'll take reasonable measures to keep allergens away from food if you specifically request it, but they can't guarantee it'll be completely allergen-free. I sent her two menus that have plenty of gluten free options, but both had the disclaimer at the top of the menu. She said ""haha it's stressful isn't it? I hate gluten-sensitive menus so much"" without giving a positive answer on either place.

Here's how I feel: I'm more than willing to only eat at select restaurants with her because I'd absolutely rather see her happy and healthy than risk her getting sick at somewhere I was adamant about going to. I'm absolutely willing to sanitize and deep-clean my kitchen before we cook together because I don't want to risk her getting sick. I'm more than willing to brush my teeth before we kiss so I don't contaminate her with gluten particles (she requested this as well). I can take these precautions but at the end of the day, everyone's health is their own responsibility and no one else's. It feels like she's told me to choose a restaurant on short notice as a game or test to see how I'd do based on how she's responded so far. I'm more than willing to go to any place that's safe for her, but if her food restriction is truly of the utmost importance and she already has an idea of which places are safely gluten-free, I don't understand why she's being so vague about giving me any direction whatsoever or giving me a positive yes or no on which places she's willing to trust. That's my point - ultimately, we're not going anywhere that she's not okay with - I have no food restrictions, so I think it makes way more sense for her to take point rather than me presenting a list to her so she can be vague about which places do and don't work for her.

So for context, I'm almost 19F and have liked a guy for more than a year now. Recently I've been feeling more inclined to tell him, but I can't decide. The thing is; he's only an acquaintance, we've only said a few words to each other and once hung out with mutual friends. So, the only way I ""know"" him is through friends, but I guess that's how crushes are. He'll be graduating from my school in a few months though and I feel as if I'll regret never speaking up. 

Now the reasons I'm hesitant; I know from a friend he likes a girl who rejected him once but he still likes her, but probably won't pursue her again. Would it be insensitive to shoot my shot despite knowing this? And then; I've been dealing with some medical issues lately which took a toll on my mental health and I'm unsure whether it would be fair to pursue him now when life is difficult. On the other side, he has a medical condition too so maybe he'd be understanding in that matter. It would be my first relationship in case it worked out so naturally I overthink every little detail 😅

The alternative to telling him would be participating in an anonymous Valentine's card exchange which my school organizes, just to get the feelings out and let him know that someone likes him. At the end of the day I just want him to know he's loved in one way or another. But I'm scared he would figure it out which would only make it awkward in case he's not interested and would prevent me from confessing in the future if I changed my mind. 

What do you think? Sadly I can't tell anything from his body language because he's very shy, the time we hung out though he looked super nervous and couldn't look me in the eye even when I talked to him, haha :) Not sure if I should write it down to shyness, avoidant behavior or jitters.

I knew that I have to ask her out so I can be more intimate with her(phisical touching and stuff like that). She agreed, so we exchanged phone numbers and set up time and place of our meet up. A few times during the week i saw her we talked with each other and sometimes there was the flow and sometimes not. When the day of the meet up came she wrote me a message where she told me that she is ill and we should set up another day for our meet up. So I told myself ok when I see her again so we setup. The next time that I saw her it was one week later I had set up a new day our meet up with her. When the day of our meeting came she told me she didn't feel 100% healthy so she would like to change the day of our meeting for another week. At this moment I thought this something wrong I got a little bit suspicious in my head but I agreed. The next week she writes me a message at the day of our meeting and writes me that she feels a little better and she only can go out for one cup of tea. At this moment moment I got more suspicious and realized that she isn't interested in me. I thought she knew I wasn't interested for one cup of tea with her and lying that she can't go out would made me more suspicious and not interested in her. So I wrote her back and tried politely explain her in the message  either we go out or not and if she is still interested she should set up day of our meeting. She replied me that she thought that is a friendships meeting something like that. I felt happy that I have the clarity and I know I will not have the feeling that It could be something. The next time I met her she was little polite to me and avoided interaction with her. Then few days later I talked with my friend on the street and she passed us by and she sad Hello to my friend that she didn't know. I told myself nice try to make my jealous. The next time she i saw her she was sad, mad and almost cry.

I've seen it said here, elsewhere and in person on dates.  I'm just talking low level stuff here, like putting my arm around her, giving her a hug , holding hands or going in for the first kiss.  I understand how important it is for a woman to establish a good, solid sense of trust and safety and it seems that some women would take not asking for consent here as a red flag.  Makes perfect sense.

However...

It's also been my experience that some women find this a turn off.  Some prefer a guy who can intuit when she's ready for that and get closer in a smooth and, uhm..'natural' way where consent is suggested by subtext like body language and eye contact.  These women seem to see the lack of ability to intuit this as a red flag because constantly asking for permission gives off a less confident vibe.  This also makes perfect sense.  

As for me, I'm perfectly comfortable either way.  I have no problems asking for consent or looking for it less explicitly I just want to know I'm doing what feels right for her as an individual.  So my question is....

Imagine you're on a first or second date with a guy and he explains this situation to you pretty much as I described above.  Then he asks ""which would you prefer?"". 

How would that feel?

I would like to be able to communicate that my intuition is good but at the same time that feeling of appreciation for being considerate of her sense of safety and readiness is lovely too.  I want to give both good things.

I hope to see how much answers vary between women here.

31m met 32f online. First paragraph is context, feel free to skip ahead if it's too long.

She  initiated the match online and set up the first date. She seemed to  have a good time, and initiated a hug at the end of the date. When she  got home she texted me that she had a good time and wanted to see me  again. She has not been active on her dating profile, and the only time  she has been active was briefly after she got home from our date while  she was texting me, presumably checking out my photos while we talked  more. We texted for the days after the date and everything seemed good.  Then we didn't talk for 4 days (which is fine with me, I don't need a  lot of chit chat between dates).

So  I asked her out for this weekend, which would be 2 weeks between dates.  She agreed, but just seems different. At first I asked for Saturday  night at an arcade/bar, and she said something like ""I might have family  plans but I'll try to get our of them :)"". In response I told her I  have Sunday as well. 2 days go by and she finally tells me that her dad  bought ski lift tickets for Saturday already, and that she tried but  couldn't get out of it. So she agreed to Sunday, but will ""watch the  weather forecast"" after I mentioned there is possible snow coming that  day. This is a bit different than the first date as she was chasing me  down to try and lock down a specific day/time. So as of now we agreed to  Sunday but not a time. I know I'm the one setting it up this time but I  can't help but feel she's keeping an escape route.

Am  I over reacting? It felt like everything was easy and we had equally  mutual interest leading up to, and after the first date. Then 2 weeks of  not seeing each other it's harder to get a firm day/time for a date. If  she cancels last minute (if the weather is clear) should I drop her? I  have another girl that I've gone out with multiple times interested in a  meet that I could slide up to my 1a spot.

I️ stupidly said, I️ wasn’t looking for anything but things could change. Mistake on my end. I have never had a boyfriend before and I️ let this new relationship manifest, started getting in too deep, and saying commitments way too fast. By the time our one month came around, my military friend started texting me again. We chatted for a little bit and he was wanting to see me again. I️ told him a lot changed over the month and I’m in a relationship that I’m trying to take serious. He said no worries and that was that. Shortly after that my feelings for my current relationship were fading as I️ was missing the excitement from my military friend. My current relationship hit a low point to the point were I️ couldn’t even look at my partner because ruined a big moment in my life. That’s were things started crumbling. Because of that me and my military friend started talking again and discussed about how he’s leaving in a couple of weeks and wanted to see me before he leaves because we were actually friends. We made plans to go have drinks. I️ ended up seeing him at the gym and we talked for a while and I️ ended up going to his house while telling my current relationship that I️ was at a different names house. We had drinks and then we had sex. I told my partner that I’ve been talking to him very recently. I’m not proud that I️ went behind my partners back, but I’m also not really into our relationship like that anymore. Or at least until military friend is gone gone so that door can be closed and my partners and I️’s relationship can be purer. I️ do have love for my partner, it’s just everything was to fast for me and I️ felt like I️ couldn’t say no. I️ would like to start over when my friend leaves and learn how to be a friend with my partner and then learn how to be in a committed relationship with him. He’s been nothing but amazing to me and I️ low key feel like shit doing this to him. I️ just know I️ can’t stay away from military man because we did make a meaningful connection and I️ want to send him off. I️ just know this action I’m doing is hurting my current partner and I️ never meant for it to go down like this.

I've had 3 dates so far, the first one I knew immediately that I wasn't interested, the second one it wasn't really clear but after the first time meeting with her and sleeping with her, I knew that I had no romantic interest in her. I feel kinda bad for telling her just after we slept together. 
The third date was fun and I had a good time. She came back to my place and we hugged, kissed and dryhumped all night. She didn't want to sleep with me on the first date, which I of course respected. A few days later she invited me to go party with her and her friends. Later she came to my place and we had sex all night. The day after we had already something planned together, but as the night went on, I kept losing interested and started seeing things that I didn't like about her or she didn't really meet my expectations of a romantic partner. Now I feel guilty for leading her on and building up her hopes. I never said that I was interested in a relationship, but I also never said that I just wanted something casual (how could I at that stage). I didn't tell her about my thoughts yet, but I feel like I will hurt her just like I did with the last girl. Am I doing something wrong? This is scaring me away a bit from continuing to go to dates, and I'm afraid I will never be happy with my sexual life like this, unless I meet the right person, but it always takes me a long time to find out. Am I thinking too much with my d*ck? I appreciate every little piece of advice, it's also possible that I'm acting normal but I'm overthinking it..

I need a bit of help here, because I'm struggling.

I've recently started going out out in pubs/clubs again with friends. Yeah, I'm single, but the people I'm out with aren't on the same vibe that I am; they don't really have any desire to find somebody so they never accompany me in approaching women.

Still, there are looks over in our direction or something and I'll really want to go over. Sometimes, I don't and I'll miss the opportunity for two reasons that I'll outline below:

* **I worry about looking like an idiot or something because they can't hear me due to the loud music;** you can't hear each other speak at first, so you have to repeat yourself.
* **I don't know what to say.** Should I just go over and ask if they want a drink? Something else?

I used to be someone who would frequently initiate conversation with women in bars a few years ago, I had my brother and our mutual friends there and there was a shared goal among us of finding someone. The thing is, I would always make up an excuse to go over such as 'We look a bit stupid standing here on our own, mind if we join you?', rather than asking them outright if they'd want a drink.

It's like the knack of it has deserted me a little bit due to rustiness. What do I say? How do I get around the loud music/not being able to be heard thing?

The responses there were really different. For example people from here told me I can kiss her on the second date if I feel to. It seems to be quite normal if not a kind of rule here to kiss a girl after the second date. My therapist (which is maybe 5 to 8 years older then I) told me that its pretty uncommon to kiss a girl at the second date.

A couple of weeks ago I asked him upfront what he wants. He asked me what I want. I've been clear, told him that I like him and want to go on a date. Zero response. So I ask him the same question. No answer, just tried to kiss me again. I got irritated. I had been quite vulnerable and he didn't even have the decency to answer a question? So I walked away from that situation. This week I saw him again at the same party I was at. Didn't talk to him. Not in a weird way, just like all the other people that you don't talk to if you don't necessarily like them.

When I got out the bathroom  my friend, who was there too, came up to me and told me that the guy I like walked up to the guy I was chatting with and told him to 'not start anything with her' in a bit of an aggressive way.

Thing is, he really ain't being that nice to me, a bit mean even, and still I'm thinking about all this too much atm. Objectively there's not much to like, but I'm still.. idk. It sucks. I just wanted a nice time. He can reject me, that's okay. That's clear and some 'closure'. But now it just keeps dragging on. Maybe I should actively start dating other people, but I don't feel much for that either. I was actually in a state of just living the good life  and if love comes along, that's cool. If not, no problem. But this is unwanted headache material. Maybe a bit my fault too, maybe not. I don't think I've been unreasonable. Doubt if anyone's going to read this long post ahah. Maybe some advice from someone who's older and with a different look on life would be nice (I'm in my early twenties). Well, that's it.

I installed Tinder recently and made a profile with 3 pictures - they were just meh in my opinion, I couldn't find pictures in which I looked very good. I had a short bio of what I like to do and I selected 5 hobbies. After a few days I had around 1500 likes - I live in a city with a 2 million population. So I don't know if that na big or small number of likes.

I liked some of them back (I bought a gold account). And after that they didn't start conversation with me or acknowledged me at all. I decided not to start conversations first - in real life I have no problem with asking guys out. But online i wanted to see who is truly interested since I don't see their body language etc. So as for today I have a lot of matches but no one is talking to me.

Im in my mid 20's and my ex is a year older than me, We dated for 2 3/4 years, a first relationship for both of us. 19 months ago we broke up on amicable terms because i was unable to give her time, as the start-up that me and my friends started was consuming to much of my whole thought process not to mention my time.

(Just adding this that my ex is a very smart , mature and sweet women. There wasn't anything weird in her personality while we dating.)

This had caused the time i had assigned to spend with my ex to drop from 2hrs - 20mins everyday
And then we broke up because i didn't think it was fair for her and she was complaining about it also.

So recently as my company as expanded considerably, i have currently finally found time for myself and i was being much more active in our friends group. (I used to maybe once in 2 months be online)

Now to cut to the chase, my ex who was also a part of this friends group, perhaps after monitoring my activity, contacted me if i wanted to catch some drinks with her and talk about getting back together.

This sounded pretty nice to me, since i still loved her but after finding out that she had dated 3 men after our breakup, something has shattered inside me... I just don't want to get back with her anymore although i still love her very much.

Now I want be able to convey to her that i don't want to get back with her again and just be friends with her.

 But I can't find myself to think what i should say to her because im too shocked and everytime I think about it, it stings.
I will be meeting her in 5 days by the way.

(Sorry if my english seems a bit bad since english isn't my first language)


TLDR: don't want to get back with my ex because she dated multiple men after we broke up while i was working on my company, now i want to let her know about it but can't find the way to say it because it hurts.

Any advice given on what i should do is very much appreciated!

Edit : Just adding here that please don't give advice related to how its me being petty about her being with other man even after we broke up.
I respect her decision and before you say ""i wont be able to date any other women again due to this attitude""

One man (50) who I’ve been with the longest and who I spend the most time with, is not emotionally expressive. We’ve had some big fights, but come back after because we enjoy each other. He’s an amazing cuddler when we sleep/rest together. The last night I stayed over we were cuddling, me laying on his chest, and I had been drifting off to sleep when he leaned in and gently kissed my forehead. We both fell asleep shortly after, no words, no other actions.

Tell me if I’m way off base here, but I feel like that had deeper meaning. It wasn’t done out of any sexual passion (he’s not much for kissing in general) and I don’t even think he knew I was awake.

I've always struggled with it due to having depression, anxiety, BP2 which makes me feel worse after looking around reddit and most people saying it's a huge red flag in a partner, and probably undiagnosed ADD. Not only that but I'm also introverted and shy. I've been renting a room at my relatives for about 4 years now since I started my job: I mean I've been saving like he'll for the past 2.5 years and could probably move out. I'm afraid to make that jump since I'm living with my grandmother and help out around the house. She just turned 85 and is still pretty mobile. The other reason is I've been looking at applying to other positions that are out of state or applying to unions so I don't want to move in somewhere only to have to move out in a short period to somewhere else. My current position is around 50k, while it isn't much my parent are proud cause it's more than what they make,, but I can't see myself doing this job for another 30-40 years. 

However I've come to notice I still live like I did in my early 20s, I mean I do my own chores and cooking so I'm self reliant. I've also decided to stop drinking as it causes nothing but panic attacks now. Weither it's permanent or not I haven't decided yet. 

I also keep getting these thoughts that I should be more at this age: my own place for the most part. I also get this weird idea that I'm still in my early 20s and not late 20s. This stems from most of my friends being in their early to mid 20s, but I do have a few friends in their 30s. I'm living through my early 20s cause at that age (20-25) I didn't really have any friends and was working nights between 18-22. I also didn't bother to attempt to date, but cleaned myself up and was highly motivated to go to the gym and eventually dated someone till I had my first major panic attack and realized she was kinda toxic. I then switched to a different job where I worked days then went to night classes. So I wasn't able to join clubs at the CC I attended. That was between 22-24. While I met some classmates nothing stuck and they were all older than me. I also tried to go out and socialize, met another women and ended up ghosting me and dating someone else. 

Between 25-28 I ended up moving to now my grandmother's and accepting a job that was 2nd shift. For those 3 years I had little to no social life or relationships with an exception for one women I met on okc who ended up having GAD and made me a nervous wreck afterwords. And met someone else at 26 that we went on a few dates got physical/messed around. I realized I probably had some attachment issues cause I wasn't sure what was going on and she was pretty vague with stuff. She ended up ghosting me and going back to her ex. 

27-28 I switched to a day shift and met this other women and made this mistake of chasing after her, she ended up rejecting me cause I was too far away but ended up in a LTR with someone on the east coast.


Tldr: I have little dating experience or haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than 6 months that, lack of self confidence trying to dated, and some mental illness. I keep telling myself to work on myself for the next 6 months but I keep feeling to older I get ther more of a red flag I'll become because of the lack of experience.

We started out night out getting drinks and dinner I had a great time talking to her and getting to know her. We got a little drunk then we went to my house. There she insisted we smoke some weed. we did. Then we started making out and stuff. Then she kept on insisting that we go to hers so that we can smoke more. She was pressed that we smoke more. We ended up going to her place. on the ride there she was being supper touchy and kept on saying how hot I am, how much she likes me even though I am not her type, and how I have an amazing energy and aura. When we got to hers I was asked multiple times if I wanted to smoke more and I said no because I was at a good level. She ended up not smoking and we had sex. The sex was hot but the work up to it was weird. We made out for a long time and did some touching stuff and she was not good at that stuff which made it weird. She would also stop and ask about smoking again multipole times. She said she wanted to do it but seemed reluctant. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it before we had sex and she said yes every time. Also while we were drunk I was having a great time but then when we smoked the vibe changed and she became super pressed to smoke more. like that's what she was mainly concerned with doing.

Also, when she was talking about how hot I am and everything in the car. she said that I have a very positive vibe and she said that she needs more of that in her life to help her do more with her life. That made me feel like she would use me and my energy for her benefit and that's why she wants to be with me. I worked my ass off for years to get to this level with my energy and positivity so that made me feel weird.

Just wanted to share an idea with you that might help you with your inner game.

So there's a pretty common notion in entrepreneurship that says:

***""The shittier the product, the bigger the advertising budget""***

If the product is shit, people won't write great reviews and refer their friends. They won't stick around or come back. And without sinking tons of money into advertising on a regular basis, that product will sink.

But how does this apply to dating?

Well if I re-wrote the above quote for dating/seduction it would be...

***""The more unhappy, anxious, needy or insecure you are, the more you need techniques/systems to convince her otherwise""***

I know this is pretty common knowledge in this community. But it still baffles me when I come across ""accomplished"" pick-up artists who got there by developing cringey systems of seduction, only to still be utterly miserable (For example, Todd V and Mystery both look tired and depressed these days IMO).

To me, techniques, tactics &amp; systems reek of unresolved trauma, repressed emotions, insecurity, fear and a desperate need to win her affection and *control* the outcome.

I want you to be an emotionally healthy, genuinely confident, sexually **wanted** man WITHOUT feeling like you need to memorise a boatload of confusing bullshit.

**So what do I recommend as an alternative?**

Well, in a nutshell, it boils down to walking the long road of becoming a naturally attractive man who women choose. This is the road that most men avoid but when you walk it, you change forever.

**This man:**

* Doesn't need to prowl the streets like some sex-starved adolescent, because women are throwing him signals all over the place as he goes about his day.
* He accepts himself just as he is.
* He embraces his sexuality, his insecurities and his shortcomings.
* He also KNOWS what he brings to the table, and doesn't need anyone to tell him.
* He loves his life and he loves himself.

You don't get there by memorising systems, openers, negs or the perfect escalation ladders. That shit just reconfirms the false belief that you're worth fuck all without them.

***You get there by doing the real work on your trauma.***

You address the root of your emotional neediness and the bullshit beliefs about your own worthiness and desirability. You slowly let go of that 60kg pack of shame you drag into every one of your approaches.

Do you have to stop approaching while you do this? Of course not. In fact, action is essential.

I'm just saying that if you're obsessing over the perfect system of seduction or the ideal ""method"" to get ANY woman into bed with you in 5 seconds or less - you're probably being sold to by a coach who needs you to believe that all you lack is his system.

You're majoring in the minor.

The reality is, you are okay just as you are.

You just don't believe it. You read those words and you can't comprehend it through your shame tinted goggles. Your experiences and conditioning have told you that you're just not enough and you're looking for a woman who will tell you otherwise.

Despite being enough just as you are, you have work to do.

**So here's what you can do now to start becoming that shameless, confident natural...**

1. Write your life story from start to present.
2. Join a men's group and start unpacking the shit you're carrying.
3. Cut out distractions and practice sitting alone in silence for 30 minutes a day.
4. Write 3 pages of incoherent brain dump in a journal every morning.
5. Stare into a mirror for 5 minutes every so often and let yourself feel whatever comes up.

This isn't an exhaustive list at all. I still pretty much guarantee though that if you started implementing the above, you would notice a deep shift in your confidence within a couple of months.

Anyway, that's all I've got right now. Thanks for reading.

And good luck on your journey, men.

So I was super excited when we matched and started our conversation.

We even called for a straight hour a few days before the date. Fast forward to yesterday evening I was super scared that it was some sort of catfish but not only was it not, she was even prettier in person. From the moment I saw her till she left it was non-stop joke, deep life stuff and chemistry. We even both said aloud how nervous we were and how it all seemed too good to be true. I walked her to the train station and we kissed! 

When she was home we called for another hour and it was amazing, could not sleep the entire night haha.
