He opened up on the second date about his anxiety. He apologised for not having messaged, and had been worrying about his not doing so, because of where he was at.

I have been asked out once by a very overbearing and clingy guy (turned down the offer due to multiple red flags), but other than that I don’t receive much male attention in public or on apps. When I’ve tried initiating, I get blown off or ghosted (hung out with this guy in a group setting not long ago which went very well, tons of chemistry, exactly my type, and he bought me a drink. I said I’d love to go for coffee with him when he’s free, and after saying he’d see what was going on he never followed through. I gave him my number and haven’t heard back). This one hurt. 

I’m relatively tall (5’9”), curvy but physically fit/healthy, very pale with long black hair, usually dress a mix of casual and alternative, and I put great effort into my appearance and hygiene. I wear makeup most days, but it is tasteful and by no means too much. My hobbies are fitness, cinema (I’m BIG into movies), various collections (artwork, oddities). I currently work a boring “gap year” job (taking a break between MS and PhD) but will be a professor and research scientist by age 27.

My friends think I can’t get dates because I am too intimidating or am “too good” for them (they probably say this because I earned a Master’s degree 2 years early and have a clear career trajectory in an intense subject) but this is confusing to me. I’d think a guy would be interested in a dedicated and smart woman who knows what she wants (guys like this are definitely a turn on for me), so what gives? I put effort into reaching out on Tinder/Hinge, I get matches and responses, but the guy either just wants to smoke or have a one night stand; or when one of us asks about a date, I’m either ghosted before we can plan it or they mention they’re poly and/or smoke weed (both dealbreakers for me).  

Everyone tells me to use apps, because they are in a happy X year long relationship thanks to them, but I’ve got nothing. Meeting people in person is very hard for me, other than random occurrences, because I don’t have many friends where I currently live. I met the guy from earlier in the post through one of my two friends and I don’t know if I should call him out on leaving me hanging, or let it go and just be sad. I’d love to date casually and am open to an exclusive relationship, and everyone around me gets to have these experiences. I deserve love and happiness too but it seems off limits.

Not long ago I (M24) read an advice post on this sub saying that men should better themselves and meet the standards they want from women if they don't get dates, the main implication behind the thread was that men who are unsuccessful at dating are aiming too high. The thread was frustrating to read because, as a straight man, trying gay dating proved to me and will prove to you that you are not unattractive, most women (not all) just have unrealistic looks standards these days and I want to understand why

**I see too many men who are in my same situation on this sub and at this point I don't think they are all lying.** I literally find 95% of women my age  physically attractive. I'm 5'11"", fit, below average face, I have never had a woman interested in me sexually or romantically. I'm dateless: 0 matches on dating apps, no woman has ever approached me or shown any interest in real life etc. Yet I can get attention from gay men very easily when I look for it. I tried switching my preference to gay men on dating apps and my match rate was insanely high, 30-40% match rate, the same exact rate as average to above average women on straight OLD so I was being judged the same way straight men judge women. I was shocked, I matched with men of all looks levels, hundreds and hundreds of matches, including  hot guys. I received so many cute messages and compliments, I literally never felt so desired. Meanwhile  I even swiped left on hot women to not waste likes since I've never matches with one.  I tried changing my bio, I  think it's good but I wanted to see whetehr it was a problem to women or not, I tried differnt bios that did not represxent me just to experiment, some were written by women I know and some were templates I found on the internet, results? Still 0 matches from women and tons from gay men.

 I'd say it's safe to assume that most gay men my age (24) find me physically/sexually attractive, this percentage is close to 0 with women. And this is not just me, this is every average to below average looking straight guy who has tried the gay dating experience. **When I tried gay dating, I literally felt attractive for the first time in my life.**  And it's not like women do not find anyone attractive through pictures, inspired by many online experiments I saw online I tried creating a fake profile with pictures of a hot man. Suddenly tons of women matched with me and messaged me, even more shockingly they kept messaging me even when I purposedly added red flags in my bio (criminal background,  grammar mistakes  et simila.   If gay and straight men can find the average and below peson attradctive, women seem to  feel the initial physical attraction only towards a minority of people.

I can't believe there are people who think straight men are being judged like straight women are or that we straight men are aiming too high, it's so absurd. If I were gay I wouldn't be in this sad situation at all, unfortunately this is what dating looks like for most straight men and I want to understand why.  **Why do women apprently have such unrealistic looks standards compared to straight and gay men in modern dating?**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1114241,public,self,Why do women have such unrealistic looks standards compared to straight and gay men in modern dating?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkgpn7/why_do_women_have_such_unrealistic_looks/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

She said it was very painful because she wasn’t into it. I asked her did she tell him to stop. She said she rebuffed him. She did admit a few times she did ask him to stop but said he wanted what he wanted and she just grit her teeth and endured the pain several times. Her body wasn’t into it and responded accordingly, hence the pain from penetration which probably was a very dry or nearly dry penetration which would cause a lot of pain for her. 

It sounds like to me her ex husband raped her and I mentioned to her it sounds like the R word / Sexual Assault when she was married. She did say that she had to get drunk at times to endure it and he was mentally and emotionally abusive (she said never physically but after hearing this, it sounds like sexually abusive too). She has been out of this marriage for 20+ years now but I could see while we were discussing it, it was painful and we did pivot away from it. 

She mentioned that her relationship after she got divorced she could not have sex with her boyfriend because she was scared of how painful it would be. She says she is over it but I want to be sure I am very sensitive to this past trauma and supportive. I am not sure if it is an issue where she does not want to fully accept (at least verbally say out loud) that she was raped / sexually assaulted or maybe she does not see it that way as a protection mechanism. She mentioned that she or her son won’t even tell her ex she is in a new relationship because he (although remarried with a child outside of his marriage) will probably try to interfere in it. It sounds like he believes it believed that he owned her. I could be wrong.

We went to the same school, then reconnected a few years ago. Went on a few dates but neither of us were in the right place for a relationship.

But we got on, so stayed in touch and met up whenever we were in the same area.

Recently, as I (28M) was going away for a few weeks we had a conversation that lead to us going out again. She (27F) seemed keen.

We texted whilst I was away a fair amount. I let her know my dates for coming home.

She asked when I was free, suggested a few ideas for what we could do to hang out. I replied with a suggested time.

Since then I’ve heard nothing. It’s been about 4 days. Usually our texting rhythm has been lots of messages once or twice a week, but it seems odd for her to not have responded at all, even a rejection.

Or the classic some were pure jerks. one 2nd date  went Soo bad that involved cops and the guy stealing my stuff. 

I'm not dating to just date. I am wanting to find that guy who accepts me then me changing into the woman they want. 

After that bad date I met my recent ex. He was everything I wanted, did things I prayed to see in my future partner but mental health played a factor. He is from a small town and mental illness didn't exist there. He is still a guy I truly still love and talk but he has some things to handle of course. Also he doesn't want kids and after much thinking I do just a bit later.
It seems like that's always the excuse or reason. I understand and want to give space when I meet someone like that. 

Ok back to my point is it weird to not want to use dating apps anymore, now that it's like how people meet now with COVID and shit. I'm not the most social personal. Heck my best relationship was a neighbor ex that was shy like me but he accepted my flaws and loved them. After that it was tinder exes. Sorry for this long post.

He’s good on paper but is that enough to date on when I’m not attracted or should I wait for attraction/love? Read for full background. Also posted on r/dating_advice

I (23f) recently am out of a 3 year long relationship with A (33m). He was the only person I have ever been even remotely attracted to, dated, kissed, etc. but I genuinely love him and everything about him. He is super kind and the calmest most loving person, that I would happily spend the rest of my life with. But he is going through a transition period, a mild crisis, where he honestly doesn’t know what to do both life and work wise, in part from the pandemic, or how long figuring it out would take, so he ended things so I would not be left waiting for him to figure it out. I took it hard but we are still fully friends and talk daily still.

It has been around 5 months sense then and I am still a little fragile, but a male friend B (31m), that I’m not really close with and is more of an acquaintance, has become super flirty, especially over text and constantly holding my hand or being relatively touchy when in person. I had been playing it off with jokes but then people around us, friends and my mom included, have started telling me that I should give him a chance. We have a lot in common hobby wise and B is good on paper but I am not physically attracted and some things about him bother me, like his intensive flirting. I genuinely do not know if I am being superficial about his appearance, if I am just not ready to try and date again or if I just genuinely am not attracted to people in general with the one and only exception of A so far. He’s not terrible looking but even seeing old photos of him and trying to think of him that way makes me really sick.

After some pressing from friends, I asked B if he’s just being friendly with his flirting or if he really is interested in dating. He says he really wants to go out with me. Because of the pressure, I said that we can hang out more, go on a date and kinda see where it goes. That opened the door to him asking me things like my ideal date, my favorite flower, my ring size, how things ended with A, and even if I was a virgin (which was his top question because quote ‘you have an innocence about you’). I now really feel sick about the situation because while I appreciate his seemingly genuine interest, I just don’t see him that way and it’s really too fast for not even going out on a date yet. I think I really made a mistake on saying we can see how things go.

My mom says to give things some time because I might just need to spend more time with him to see if I can be attracted to him and that he has a lot to offer me.

My mutual friends with B say that he would be really lucky to have me and now are even starting to speak poorly of A for being selfish. That being said while they all know each other, A is not really friends with them so I understand why they are choosing B’s side but I don’t think that gives them a right to talk so poorly about someone I love to me. 

I even talked to A about things and he said I should do what’s best for myself and that nobody should pressure or talk me into anything and to do whatever I’d like or is best for myself.

So all that being said, should I still give B a chance and see if the attraction grows?
Or should I stop things now because I really do feel sick over everything?
Do you wait to feel love again?
Or if I do give it time to wait and see, how long should I give it?

We swapped answers and he didn’t seem stunned or uncomfortable.

Turned out we had a lot of common interests and we started talking for an hour or so. The whole group then went to a club together. Upon entering the club, I'm waiting to buy a drink and the girl was a few people ahead with her girlfriend. All the sudden a drink gets passed to me and it turns out she bought me a drink, never has happened to me before (possibly the strongest drink in mankind also), and then started talking to me again. When her friends wanted to go deeper in, to the dance floor, she put her arm around my waist to usher me along with her. Then unfortunately a little while later her girlfriend had some type of meltdown so they had to roll without any notice.

Usually I never look up people I just met on Instagram in an effort not to be seen as creepy, but I've been single for a while and figured this chick is making advances, I should see where it leads. I followed her, then she followed me back and started liking many of my old photos. I decided to message her, just saying hey it was nice to meet you the other night and check this band out (we were both super into the same type of music). We proceeded to message for hours, pretty much continued by her. Always following up with a question, asking me about what I do etc. Eventually I asked her if she wanted to go to this cool art exhibit near me next weekend which was related to some of her other interests, and she replied saying she will be with her boyfriend next weekend...lol. 

What the hell am I supposed to make of that? First instinct is to just say no problem and then never contact again, kinda shady. Also it could be that she's about to leave this guy or something cause she was acting so obviously flirty, or maybe they have some open type of relationship.

I F(23) dated M(24) for 4 months. And boy I fell hard for him, making excuses to his actions which not always made sense. 
So I've come to conclusion that he used me as a rebound because even though I expressed how upset I am about him not spending time with me and he still didn't make effort to come see me that same day when he lives 20min away. I've told him that few times (happened a lot) and he listened but never really done anything about it. All he did is apologize that I feel like this and repeat how much he loves me and cares for me etc yet not saying that he will try and do better or just come down and prove me that he means what he says.
So I finally admitted that to myself, and I would like to move on from it although we didn't officially end it (because he didn't come, just messages like if we were 15).
 

Feels like my heart been ripped out of my chest, and everything is still in the air and I don't know how to deal with it. He didn't reach out to me the conversation ended just him saying that he cares and loves me and that I should know that and he wished me goodnight and I just said that if he did he would've been with me at that time not chatting away and that's all. Ideally would like to make this work but since he doesn't seem to be able to be honest with himself I don't know it would be possible.

Been amazing we truly love each other. We always laugh barely argue and when we do we work it out maturely right away. We are on the same wavelengths a lot. 

Except this one instance. 

We go to this one Halloween party and she is dressed like a sexy devil and she drinks a good amount but not crazy drunk. She's very loud and kind of attention seeking and I don't care obviously I want her to have her moment and have fun and she is. I was wearing a full frog costume and was very stoned and usually when i get stoned I go into observation mode and don't talk much.

I noticed that my girlfriend was flirty with my one particular friend that I have warned her about in the past. She keeps yelling to get his attention and keeps kind of gently punching his chest and grabbing his arms. I noticed when she would try to get anyone else's attention she wouldn't try as hard or touch them, just gives up right away.

There was also an instance where they kept locking eyes and she was flirting with him more while my friends girlfriend was there, whenever her back was turned they would look at each other. Like she was trying to steal his attention away from my friends girlfriend. And he was loving it.

I was just talking to a friend pretending not to notice and I'm sure my girlfriend had no idea I was noticing this.

Fast forward next day we have a talk and I don't leave anything out, I fully express my perspective. She pretty much denies that she was flirting. She says she remembers touching him but thought that kind of stuff was normal in my friend group. Denies locking eyes with him etc. Overall she was very sorry and didn't want to hurt me and says she had no idea she was flirting.

She was very sincerely but I sometimes feel like she has 2 versions. Like she gets drunk and doesn't realize she's flirting? Maybe I am paranoid? Am I looking into this too deep.

Is this a double standard? If it is, how do guys feel about it?  Would you rather someone swipe left if you don't have a beard, or ask if you're open to getting facial hair if compatible?

Personally, as long as my guy shows respect when sharing his preferences, I am open minded.  For example, I've worn my hair long, until it's length became unmanageable, then I kept it as long as I could when I did have to cut it.  But, I might get offended if meeting someone online or on a first date they said, ""I like long hair, you need to grow it out.""

I start to pay attention to her as I have a bit of a crush, and I realize that she looks at me, very frequently. I might be working in the hall, she'd walk by, and she'd glance over her shoulder to look at me. She might get something out of her backpack on the floor, and while leaning over she'll look, and she'll glance over while a teacher is talking or sometimes outright stare for seconds. I haven't been keeping track, but this as been going on for at least 3-4 weeks. We make eye contact on occasion, it's been more frequent the past week as I've been looking directly at her more to try to get her attention, rather than keep her in my peripheral vision like I had been.

So, two weeks ago I decide to talk to her in my physics class since I have friends that sit at her table, and seating isn't strict as our teacher wants us to work on assignments together. When I am over there, we talk quite a bit, and can hold a conversation easily as we have a lot of classes and both play soccer. If I wait outside before class and end up next to her, she will start talking to me, but in neither class does she ever approach me.

She's normally a very shy person, she talks very quietly when talking to people she doesn't know, but is pretty talkative to me, and not quiet. Her being such a shy person is what surprises me about the staring, it's so much that if she's giving an analysis on something we read in English, she won't look at the teacher or the class but she will look towards me out of the corner of her eye. At her table in physics, there is another girl that I hardly talk to, but one time I was listening to the other girl, and she was too, but she kept glancing at me to see how much I was paying attention to the other girl.

The issue is, now in physics we moved seats, so I don't have an excuse to go and talk to her. I asked for her number last Thursday after a class where we spent a bit extra time talking, and I texted her but she was pretty slow to respond.

I am not particulary bad-looking, I have a job and I have a steady life. But I am starting to think I am afraid of relationships and what chaos it could bring. 

My last relationship was disastrous. I am going to try and make a long story short: For years she was ""sick"", she kept saying she was suffering from hypoglycemia and could not do chores around her apartment or study or pretty much anything. So it was up to me to help her while I was trying to study and manage my own life. In the end she started gaslighting me, saying that if I did more for her, she would be better. And in the end she joined a cult that told her she had to break up with me because I have demons in my midst. This whole ordeal hit me really hard and took years to rebuild from. 

I don't miss her one bit, not at all. But I think that whole ordeal and the relationships I had before her (which wasn't sunshine and rainbows either!) has made me afraid of getting in a relationship. What if I meet a lovely woman, who at first is nice and caring and all that but later the whole thing turns sour, and it brings on a storm that messes me up mentally and turns my life upside down?

And I could of course fully embrace the bachelor life. I could just spend the rest of my life here on my computer and games and books and movies. Go to work and go straight home. But something tells me that is not the optimal way of life for me. 

So my question is: How do I overcome this fear of relationship?

Hey!

Im a young guy, who recently started to talk to a girl in my school. We hit if off really well, and talked to each other in a nice way. I started developing feelings for her, and she would slowly open up to me a bit more, trying to get me alone some places, and striking up small talk.

Well that was untill we had talked for a few weeks and she suddenly is insanely hot and cold, meaning she sometimes, will come and greet me multiple times in a short amount of time, and go out of her way to talk to me, just asking me small talk stuff. The hot and cold stuff will happen pretty instantly, and could happen on the same day.

I even confronted her about this, and asked her ""Why are you being so cold to me all of a sudden, we seemed to really hit it off"", and she instantly refused the idea, that she was acting in that way, and reassured me that she thought i was really cool. The same day i asked her this, we would in a big friend group go eat, and we sat across from each other, and she would lay her shoes on mine under the table and start tapping on them for like 40 seconds, obviously feeling mine under under.

She could go a whole day ignoring me, not initiating talks, and just avoiding eye contact mostly, but then she will text me about something and seem really friendly again in tone, laughing at jokes i text back and furthering the conversation.

Now i have not even flirted with her ever, i've kept everything on a friendly level. I like to be good friends, and really get to know a person before asking them out. Just been asking normal stuff, that a friend would, interests stuff like that.

In this time we have grown very close so much so that we have considered a future together. This future was almost completely planned out until I was offered a position across the country. It was something that I didn't want to think about for the longest time but eventually I decided it was probably for the best. I accepted the position and our relationship went long distance, and now we are still talking and seeing each other but I know our lives are going to completely change very soon. It will become more difficult to make time for our relationships and will put a strain between us that is going to be pretty hard. Still, its too good of a position to pass up so I think I am going to take it.

But the day after that (two days after our first date), she messaged me thanking me for the effort I put in and said that she needs to think things over. I asked if she wanted to end it and she replied saying that she needs time to think about what exactly she wants and a thinks we should take a break for now. I was shocked since things were going great. She mentioned a couple of times that this past week (which started right after she ended/put a hold to us) is going to be very tough on her due to it being a tough rotation. She hadn’t dated all of last year since year 3 of med school is tough. So I’m not sure if it’s because she felt overwhelmed and not ready to date again or something else? She doesn’t even check my ig stories anymore: she’ll check the first one (maybe by mistake) and then cancel out to not check the others. She basically pulled a complete 180.
