So I can not get girls to save my life. Let me list of some personal things about me real quick. 
-I’m 22 
- I’m 22 
- I’m 5’’9’ 185 pounds with very low body fat percentage (I’m very fit) 
- I’m an amateur boxer (pretty good tbh)
- Work at Tesla (have tens of thousands in the bank) 
- Very smart (not bragging just being honest) 
- Extremely confident (say what I want and not afraid of rejection)
- Wear nice clothes
- Take care of my hygiene (beard , haircuts , etc) 
OK so you got the gist of it. I perceive myself as an absolute catch and somebody that girls should be chasing. One of the reasons why I built up confidence is because I’ve literally worked so hard on improving myself the last two years and I feel like I am the best version of myself right now. The problem is is that despite all of this I still for the life of me cannot get girls. They literally treat me like I am A scary bogeyman and they run away. So as an example I’ve been on tinder for like six months and have matched with some beautiful girls some in my league some outside of my league some below my league but I have literally not one time gotten any girls to do anything with me from tinder. They will literally tell me they find me attractive and if I post a boxing video on my Snapchat they will comment with emoji‘s seeing how hot that is. I play it so cool and obviously eventually I come around to say to these girls that we should go out and do something. The second that happens they run like bandits. THEY LITERALLY DONT WANT TO DO SHIT WITH ME! ITS DRIVING ME INSANE. No I do not want to come across and say that these girls owe me anything. LIKE I SAY I AM NOT BEING WEIRD OR ANNOYING OR DESPERATE. I am being so cool about it when they reject me to do stuff. I will say something like hey no problem why don’t we do something next weekend just let me know and leave it at that. They will never contact me again and then I will have to reach out to them again if I want to do anything. Eventually I’ll just delete them off my Snapchat because I don’t wanna waste time but they don’t give a fuck. I do every single thing that I am “supposed” to do to get girls but literally I cannot get them to do anything with me. I feel like I am constantly having to deal with girls looking for other dudes and I am just one dude in a stack of 500 at any given time. I literally feel like even girls below my league girls that I am better than getting won’t do shit with me either. There are girls that I would give a rating of a three that will not do anything with me. I literally laugh at how pathetic it is that even girls that are objectively ugly don’t wanna do shit with me. SERIOUSLY. And trust me , I have girls that are 10s saying “omg that video of you boxing is so hot”. “Omg you are so  hot” AND THEY NEVER DO SHIT!!! I have tried to pick up girls in person to but I honestly feel like most girls don’t want to do shit. I’m also not even seeking validation. I don’t give a fuck about having girls tell me anything about my appearance or anything. I literally just want some fucking girls to hook up with and have fun.

I threw a party the following week and he kept asking to invite his college friends. When I met his college friends, it was obvious he told them about me because they knew a little about me including my occupation and hometown. 

I wanted to get to know him better so I asked him to grab happy hour and he picks 8:30 pm at a bar.

I assume these things happen to me because I have more feminine, or pretty boy features as I’ve been told and when I style my hair, I get called the f-word by hordes of dudes that are in large groups, so I figured that validates the femininity of my face.

Could the above reason be true; are my dates bragging about their sexual exploits to me because I don’t look manly in their eyes, or is their possibly another reason?

I wanted to ask you guys for advice on how I can get close with her, but I think that it needs a lot of context first (so sorry if it’s kinda long haha).

So there’s this girl that I’ve been schoolmates with since grade school (she’s also a senior at the university I recently graduated too). She was a batch below me in a small, private school, so we’re pretty familiar with each other, especially since everybody pretty much knew everybody, and that my batch got along pretty well with her’s. She was the sister of one of my oldest friends too, so I’d see her around sometimes. I think that, since then, the general gist between us was that we were friends, and that we can get along pretty well because we come from the same roots practically. The thing is, I always assumed that she was this posh, rich girl that might’ve been snobby, I’m not sure (I was a little sensitive too about my social status then, and maybe a little less by now). I never got to know her much then, so that was neither confirmed nor denied, I guess.

So jumping to junior year in college, she remarks that i lost some weight and kinda started to look more toned, so ya know, i seemed to have that college bloom after styling up my wardrobe and hitting the gym. It helped too that she was also into crossfit and I into mountaineering, and she was pretty fit herself so we were on the same page about working out, which i really like about her. It also helped that we kinda had the same sense of humor, as we’d like each other’s memes on our feed. At that point I kinda assumed that I have a shot at her now, at this point when I’ve worked on myself more, and feel like I have a chance.

Come the pandemic, I didn’t get to talk to her at all since I was still pretty shy to make a move. We’d react to some of our posts, but that was the end of it. What changed mow was that I kinda had this dream about holding her had for some time and we started to date, and I kinda realized that I’ve had a subconscious liking to her for some time now, and I really wanted to find out if she would really be worth dating (we’re also still having a lockdown right now, so anything f2f is probably off the table).

SOOOO (and I am very sorry for the long post), I wanted to ask you guys what I could do to actually make some progress in talking with her, since I don’t wanna make the wrong move and scare her away.

We started texting and it turns out we scarily have everthing in common.

I feel like we have some kind of connection which I can't explain, it's like everything weirdly fits with the way it all happened that day.


I've slowly started dropping compliments and mentioning little things for her to get the message that I like her. She doesn't usually react to these at all but does make effort with her replies. She’s never flirted and brushes it off when I do. I get the impression she is quite shy or reserved. We are both 30. Assuming she's had a boyfriend but I could even be wrong about that. She lives on her own and comes across very independent and hard to read. 

Over the last day I've felt she hasn't been as responsive but I know this is mainly due to work. Her job is extremely demanding and involves working long hours, but I'm finding it hard to work out what's going on in her head.

She had a busy day yesterday and when she eventually replied to my text last night there was no questions even though she was still being friendly. She seemed not herself and almost distant. I took the decision not to reply to that text, I'm now worried she knows I like her and she's taken a step back. 

Just to add, I was in a car accident so I'm not able to go out and do things for another few weeks. She mentioned before she'd be up for doing something with me afterwards.

We went to school together for 9 years. After we graduated, we still went out with our group (2girls, 6 boys) for like a year or so. After falling and breaking my leg, i decided not to go out with them until my leg had healed completely. I had cast on leg for month and couldnt walk without crutch for another month.

One boy kicked me and another guy from the groupchat we had because we stopped going out with them. After that i havent spoken to that girl since 2017 july. I keep thinking about her, but im afraid to do anything. It literally takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep because i keep thinking about her

Any tips what to do?

I just recently got out of an almost 9 month relationship. She left me. I'm over it now and I barely miss her anymore because she honestly wasn't mentally stable enough for it and her past and life weren't wifey material.

I'm sorry if this is long, but I need help from you guys because I'm losing hope.

I lift 4-5 times a week, I dress fresh, I'm confident, smart, I got a good sense of humour, and know how to lay down the pipe. I kind of struggle with accepting that because I doubt myself a bit on the inside.

I didn't meet any girls in high school because my friends weren't in those types of social circles that had girls in them. We were edgy stoners. I also look way older than I am so that probably scared girls off. I had decent success with online dating tho. I started dating at 17, I've been in 3 relationship, had a couple f-buddies, and kissed a few others. 

All of that was ok, but I can't find a girl that I can take seriously that won't hurt me in the end. I'm a very loyal person and could care less about any other girls. I'm one of the few willing to make a relationship work instead of leaving when effort os required. I put commitment first and all these girl don't actually love you, they just like how you make them feel.

I'll be off to community college soon and there will mostly be girls taking my major. I'm gonna do everything to take advantage of this opportunity. College girls are a no no when it comes to a relationship, but since this isn't a big campus school it should be better.

I want to talk and meet girls there, but I feel like it's not even worth it. None of them are dating let alone wifey material. They're all th0ts, bisexual, tattooed, they drink, they cheat, suck dick, act masculine, or are fat.

All I want is a good traditional feminine girl that is loyal, is either a virgin (sadly impossible to find) or atleast not a th0t, vibes well with me, doesn't have tons of emotional baggage, doesn't show off her body, and is actually in love with me.

Looks honestly don't even matter that much. I don't don't want her to be fat or ugly. I'll gladly take an average girl that's a better person. I've had a few hot ones and they weren't good for anything except their body which they've given away to countless guys before.

If I'm single, I'm okay with smashing a few th0ts here and there, but I ultimately want something real with the right person.

Its a funny story actually. I ended up in the psych ward 4 years ago and had given up on life basically. Not going to repeat myself since I have told the whole psych ward story before.  


Fast forwarding to last week. I had been in doubt for some time. I thought she was the one sending out mixed signals but turned out it was me. We are both suffering from pretty severe mental issues. I tried dating her before and that went to shit.  


But we became friends for a reason 4 years ago. It is weird how the psych ward made her cross paths with me. We became soul mates basically. It is nothing I dont know about her at this point. I know she has panic attacks every night and have massive sleep problems, anxiety and psychosis. I know she can be severely depressed. Some days she will cry in her room for days on end.  


I know how she can be on her good days and on her bad days. She knows me 100% too. We have no secrets anymore. We have discussed politics and religion, been there for each others trough Brimstone and Hell fire.  


It was never meant to be anything more than a friendship. She lives in a different city and we have met almost weekly for the last 4 years.   


Last weekend however was something a little different. Things have been escalating slowly over the past several months up until the point where I wasn't sure if this was just a friendship anymore. We went to the movies to watch a horror movie. She never goes to the movies. She likes horror but for some reason she has huge anxiety for large rooms especially if its a lot of people there.  


She had a panic attack not because of the movie but because she was afraid that the theater would be packed with people. Ironically, no one showed up. We ordered two deluxe tickets for about 40 bucks so no wonder we were alone really.  


The seats had ass warmers so we just turned up the heat on one of the seats and used it to keep our popcorn warm. She calmed down when she realized we were going to be all alone in the entire movie theater.  


We shared the popcorn and the movie was actually the worst piece of horror shit I have ever seen. I can handle a lot but that stuff was pretty damn creepy. So we ended up holding hands. Then she basically jumped into my seat and we went out of the theater all sweaty and shaky.  


So back on the outside she gave me this stare. Like she was actually considering kissing me. I always considered her pretty but this was different. I always had deep feelings for her but this was also different. It was deep, friendly feelings. But now she made me feel something else. She made me feel the butterflies.  


So I got confused. It was pretty late so I followed her home, gave her a hug and we agreed to meet up again the next day.  


I had the entire night to think about her and with the horror movie fresh in my memory it was no way I was getting any sleep. I think I tried to go to bed at around midnight. At around 3 am I had pretty much given up on getting any sleep whatsoever.  


I looked out the window and it was a full moon, a lot of stars, some dark trees and a river. No one about really. It was still pretty warm. Over 20 degrees Celsius. I decided to go outside and get some fresh air. My friend was literally living next door to my sisters apartment. It was the building right next to it.  


So when I went outside, she was sitting there smoking a cigarette. I walked over to her. She just looked up at me and said: ""Not sleeping huh?"". So we ended up talking a little. I borrowed her one of my earbuds and we listened to a pretty good song from my Spotify.  She leaned in close and rested her head on my shoulder while we looked at the stars.  


She sighed and asked me if I wanted to go for a walk. I agreed. We walked trough an empty park and up along the river. As we walked, we got further and further away from the city and the lights. The stars shined brighter. The moon was a huge glowing dot.  


We eventually got to a quiet lake in the middle of nowhere. We took our shoes off and tested the water. Some fish were swimming around. The moon was reflecting in the water. She suggested we go for a swim. We both stared at each other and sort of contemplated if we are really going to do this?!  


So we sat there for around 10 minutes without saying a word, trying to build up the courage to jump into the water. She eventually stripped off her clothes and jumped in. I had to follow. It was honestly a little scary swimming around after just watching some super natural serial killer movie.  


But I forgot about all of that. My next thought really was when I looked at her and thought to myself: Since when did you get so damn pretty? Obviously she was thinking the same thing as she was pulling closer and we eventually kissed. And we kissed for probably 5 minutes straight.

His parents feel very entitled to my boyfriends personal belongings, that my boyfriends bought himself.. there are other things that bother me, but its just a lot of little stuff that adds up, you understand? 

Is this normal? Is it okay? My boyfriend himself does not bother me at all living together, i thought he would be it is just his family. This is my first time living away from home, it was a hard decision for me because i was comfortable and loved living with my own family.

I'll try to keep that quite short, but I can't guarantee anything. So please forgive me if it ends up being a scroll or something, lol. I hope these words reach each and every one of you, no matter who you are. You deserve it. 

“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.” - Siddharta Gautama, AKA the Buddha.

I want to offer you another path than the one you've most likely heard of. Instead of focusing on self-perfection; be it - personality traits/looks, focus on self-acceptance. It's very hard, though. It's quite excruciating at times, even. You won't be as successful as incredibly (physically) attractive people, meaning you won't be having that many matches on Tinder.

BUT!

You may, if you are patient and determined enough, be happier than you thought you ever could. When someone rejects you, you'd be peaceful. You'll want to change... Absolutely nothing. Not about the situation, not about their response, and sure as hell, not something about the way you flirted with/approached them. You'd see the ultimate truth; there's nothing you could've/should've done better, and no one is to blame. And best of all, you'd focus on improving your life for your own happiness, not for the sake of getting more matches on Tinder - which, at some point, you'd care less about. More than you think is possible.

This all starts with self-compassion. Change the way you conduct your inner monologue, and make hard decisions, such as taking care of yourself. Training - but not necessarily in the gym. Walking sometimes is also fine. As long as it's purely for your health. Start adopting a moral code encompassing a certain way of speech - so that you conduct your life with morality and you regret nothing. When you set aside the external, you may very well stop seeing external results; but you'll start to see inner happiness. 

I wish you all unconditional love and happiness. No matter who you are, or what you've done, I wish you to live at peace with yourself. Because when you do, the world will start looking really nice! 

However, just like the Buddha himself said - do not believe me. Try it for yourselves. With Metta! :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,954881,public,self,Compassion Is the Answer,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4extb/compassion_is_the_answer/,all_ads,6,,,,

We exchanged eye contact a couple of times and i felt a mutual interest. I am super shy but not insecure. We didn't see each other for a few months and i decided that the next time I see her i will approach. I like her to be honest. She was a bit ""distant"" when i saw her next time. I still saw interest in her eyes though so i approached and said hi, how are you, she responded with a short answer and the  walked away. I felt her relationship status might have changed so i just didn't bother her again even though again whenever we collide i see interest in her eyes. I saw her again few months later and she positioned herself in a way i could approach her, the place was empty and she chose to sit closely so i approached and opened a conversation with her. Believe it or not after almsot a year we didn't know each other name or what we do for a living. She was responsive and the look in her eyes was of someone interested, you know with pupils enlarged, etc. So i asked her,let's go out sometime? For which she took a few seconds to think and said hmm i don't think so. I was super confused and equally disappointed! I tried to avoid this place for a while. A year later i saw her and I noticed a huge smile on her face when she saw me from a distance, and she even came very close so that i can approach her, or that is how i interpreted it but i played not noticing, honestly, i didn't understand what is her purpose and i was afraid it would go like last time. I could tell she was disappointed with how I handled it. I regretted that i didn't make another attempt! I should have made it and If she said no that would have been it. My interpretation now looking back at it is that she might not has been single the first time i approached her, then when she became single again she was much open to it? Or may be she just like the attention of me checking her? 

Long story short, i still like her, haven't seen her for a while after Covid started so i found her social media account. Should i try to approach her or would it come as super creepy?  I could for instance add her on LinkedIn? Less creepy? If she accepts the invitation i would start a Convo and sense her interest level and take it from there? Would that be considerd creepy as well?

He followed back, proceeded to text me and ever since we've been having amazingly funny, entertaining, thoughtful convos everyday so far. Anyways, as a girl, I generally have good intuition and can tell from a text the sender's intention. This time I'm not sure because people can genuinely be friendly.

He was in relationship, had a 3 week ongoing  break before his gf decided to end things for good. He reached out to me a day before the official breakup. Before he used to mention her and all, and now, haven't heard abt her which is somewhat relieving.
But essentially, we pretty much hit it off and we talked a ton. There was banter and teasing that could possibly be interpreted as interest/flirting. He's really tall so he picks on me for being a few inches shorter than him. He knows my height and weight and keeps repeating that he could easily pick me up and put me on his shoulders. He asked me when I'm coming back home from holiday, and tells me that we'll sort out things then ( a height debate). He then says "" Either mall or whatever the hell"", as if to brush it off. He also said: You see I would ask if you wanna go but HMMMMM [to the gym together after I said working out with someone is better than being alone]. After that text, there was a slight pause as I was unsure how to respond. More recently (yesterday), we had a convo about meeting up. We were talking bout horror movies and my dislike for them and he ended up saying that we should watch one together. Maybe at his place or mine or wherever. I'd suggested virtually and he insisted on doing it in person because it's not the same and that he can't wait to see me get scared. Also asked me if I've ever brought a white boy home 😂
We also text goodnight and good morning. Ask about each other's day. He sends hearts with his gm and gn messages and I reciprocate. Could be insignificant LOL. When he goes out, he lets me know and that he'll text me once he's able to have WiFi. Today he used his data cuz no WiFi. So there's that but he also asked me advice for how to proceed with his ex (day 1 and 3 post break up tho, haven't heard about her since as aforementioned). Hence why I was a tad bit confused. 

Anywho, others who reached out referenced the school/program to start conversation. To me a guy who starts with "" Hi, what's up "", and especially judging from previous experience, signals something more? Do guys talk this much with a random girl if there's not a pinch of interest? It could be the beginning to a great friendship who knows LOL but.... 

TDLR: Is a guy reaching out first to a girl and then talking everyday about everything, and suggesting meeting up just friendliness or possibly more, thus justifying him reaching out in the first place?

I’ve been a single dad for the majority of the last decade.  Dating has always been a challenge and I attribute some of that to the single parent status but I know it’s not just that.

I am a bit of an introvert&amp;a homebody.  I don’t really like big crowds or heavy traffic/overpacked places etc.  I do enjoy nature and things like hiking and kayaking etc.  I’m relatively healthy although still a dad bod.  

So I can honestly say I’m not a horrible guy and I’ve never, as far as I’m aware, done anything terrible to anyone.  I’ve got financial security and stability.  

My dating periods/relationships never last very long and I think it’s because I’m boring.  In fact I’ve literally been told I’m boring before by a dating partner.  I don’t really have friends and I don’t know how to just “get a life” in my 30s in a small rural town.

I ordinarily don't mind bad habits.. we all have them. This was just too much for me and I didn't have the balls to say something for fear of hurting her feelings.

Everything was going pretty well until our dinner arrived and we began to eat. Immediately, the sound of teeth sliding along her fork with every bite caused a shiver while the soul fled my body to escape. At first I ignored it. Shit happens, sometime you misjudge while slamming food down your gullet. Then.. it sunk it. It was every bite. Now... I'm not saying it was light contact. This was full on teeth clenched to the eating utensil, then degloving the satanic device with a solid flick of the wrist. 

Here's what I'm thinking. Maybe she was attempting to preserve her lipstick? Perhaps the screetch resulting with each bite is a form of communication with other alien beings and she was reporting to her superiors regarding the human currently convulsing at this dinner table?
