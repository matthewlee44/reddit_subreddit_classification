Admittedly i had grown on her as we’d been talking over the last month or so, and I was planning on telling her after we’d met so I knew for sure I liked her.

But she unfortunately broke her ankle, so she couldn’t make it but offered to reschedule for couple weeks time. So i went out anyway and, stayed in the hotel. Had a great time. 

We were still in contact through the weekend, and we said we missed each other &amp; she was asking stuff like how the weekend was, if i’d gotten home ok etc. Then we wished each other happy valentines on Monday.

All seemed good until she suddenly stopped texting Monday evening, and for her to post on her snap story that she was on way to Newcastle Tuesday/Wednesday morning &amp; so i messaged her to have a good time. She replied with ‘thanks babe but im not doing anything in newcastle cos of my ankle haha’ (assuming to say she wasn’t there to f*ck) which i did find bit weird. 

I know it sounds incredibly stalkish but her snap map showed of her in a hotel. 

Then, shes posting stuff in a restaurant, food &amp; cocktails with this guy &amp; she was there for couple nights.

So, I messaged her to ask what was going on and I’d felt mugged off cos she was with this guy couple days after we were supposed to be meeting.

Then she didnt reply all day, then decided to delete her off all my socials as per to a friend’s advice as it was all hurting too much &amp; at that point i couldn’t be bothered with her anymore (Now looking back, not my greatest move). Until she messaged me last night saying she was in a mood as i’d deleted her off all our socials and, she hadn’t replied as she was having a bad day.

So i explained that I’d felt mugged off as I’d spent almost £200 on hotel &amp; transport, before drinks and food I was going to be paying for, for her to run to another lad in 2 days time. And within this text i’d confessed that i had feelings for her. 

She immediately apologised and, agreed we should’ve communicated better. 
But also said she felt bad &amp; wants to call tomorrow or, Monday to talk it all through as apparently she wasn’t aware I’d spent almost £200 (when i thought she was but never mind) &amp; had feelings for her. She’s also saying the lads just a good friend, and they’d met to sort out some issue they had with a friend.

We broke up because he was manipulative and love to use white lies as an excuse to impress me. He tried the age old thing of  we could just be friends but I was just so broke I broke off all communication. Later I found out that he was dating a much younger female (23) . 

He worked with me initially when we started dating then broke up with me before the big Covid lock down in the states. And came back to work after he felt comfortable being around a lot of people in a small space since we work in a tourist attraction. He left me alone for the most part and I made sure to stay away from him to avoid any drama but kept it civil. 

Now I'm not sure if I'm being to nice, honestly I'm just being my cheerful self because I've healed from all the pain he caused me. And he's started making subtle advances towards me. For example not  looking at me but making sure he is present and that I can see him or gets in the way of me trying to do something so that I can ask him to move. Normally would not be a big deal but it happens frequently throughout the work day.

I don't want to get caught up in any thing I'm 31y/o and don't need the extra drama. But I'm not trying to do anything but my job. But what is this? Do I even address it?  Like you have a girl what do you need?

There is this perfect looking and smart girl that was really into me 7 years ago... At that time she has been trying hard to get me for a long time. Although I liked her, I was not in love. We have been meeting each other once or twice a year, usually when I was bored... The dates were mostly just kissing and nothing more than BJ.

I have met her again this January after 3 years of not seeing each other. The date went well. We have been kissing at the end and it seemed like she wanted to go into my apartment... It was not possible, so I just booked her an Uber and sent her home. She sent me a message that she liked the date (and me) and thing were looking great.

I asked her to meet me again, but she has told me that she has exams lined up (medical university, super hard) and that she would really like to meet me after the exams in a few weeks. I respected it. I have been trying to keep in contact, but not texting too much - I think I did it right, she seemed super interested in me - she has sent me a picture of herself (nude, but elegant without properly seeing anything), texts about us having sex, replying instantly to my messages, etc.

However she did not pass 2 of her exams and our date had to be postponed for another 2 weeks. This is the part where I fucked it up I guess. There was a 10 days window where she had the first compensatory exam and the last compensatory exam... And I started pushing harder... I have tried to settle a date for the next day / in the evening after her first compensatory exam. She told me she will go IF she pass the exams. I told her that in this case I can not book a place in a restaurant and she can go into my apartment. She agreed. At this time I started to be super kind (I thought I owe it to her after being mean to her in the past) and was cheering her up regarding the exams a lot. I have sent her supportive message in the morning and she texted me that she passed the exams. That is where it went wrong:  


ME: Great job! So you will be in a great mood today!  
HER: Well I am thinking of celebrating with my mum... :D  
ME: Then don't think, I have a champagne ready for us!  
HER: And couldn't we postponed it..? &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  
ME: Noo, come today  
(HER: No reaction for 5 hours)  
ME: It would be great to let me know if you will come tonight or if I should make other plans for the evening.  
(HER: No reaction for 12 days... till now)

I would like to hear any opinions to help me understand what happened. Do you think she was just trying to boost her ego and waited until I was really interested about her..? Or do you think that she has got an opinion that I do not care about her..? Or that I started to care too much and she was just playful..? Also should I forget about her..?

There's one girl I'm talking to and she is from Southern California. I've never been to the US and quite honestly I've never had a desire to.

We've really hit it off and get on real good. She seems real super keen to have me stay over, get to know each other, meet her dog etc.

I've never ever even travelled more than 100 miles for a date or hookup, so the prospect of travelling 12 hours on a plane to meet someone random is almost for me, a deal breaker. She can't really come over here yet because of her work.

And yet I can't stop talking to her.

Here is my story:

I (21M) met a girl (20 at the time) on Tinder last summer. I have never dated anyone and before this never even been on a date, mostly because I never really wanted to date someone. So I was on Tinder purely for fun chats and was looking for people to add on snap to socialize. Out of all my chats on Tinder I had actual conversations with this girl, we talked about our ambitions and we matched each other's energy. We moved on to snap after a while but didn't snap that much. For context, I live in the capital of my country but she studies in a university town, a 2-hour drive away. 

In September I went to go see my friends there and to have a night out. After being out for some time we decided to go back home but when coming out of the club a girl who is waiting to get into the club pulls me aside and looks me in the face. It took me some time to figure out who this was but after a second I realized that it was her. We hugged and had a few words but then we left (we left because the place I was staying was some distance from downtown and we had a friend who was willing to drive us home and get some food on the way.). While going through a drive-in I chatted with this girl again, she asked me to come to get some drinks and we settled to a shot, and then I was to go back home. I told my friend to drop me off at the club and I went to do the shot while they were eating in the car. I then went in, we chatted with this girl, had a shot, I tried to kiss her cheek (hit her ear), and then I left. When I got back home we chatted for a bit, and I still regret that I didn't go back to be with her, but we thought about seeing each other the next day. We didn't meet and when I asked her about this, she said that she wasn't sure if I wanted to meet. I drove back home from the uni town but after this, we started talking on a daily basis. After a month or so I was in the uni town again, out with friends. I invited her to come and she came. We both got drunk, we were pretty touchy and at the end of the night, I sent her home while holding hands. 

Pretty early into our chats, we talked about how she was not dating any guy at that point and didn't feel like dating anyone anyway. She had a boy in her mind for some time but wanted to forget about him, as she thought that this boy was not coming back. I was fine with it because at that point I didn't think I was going to catch feelings. But the next following months changed that. I drove her home multiple times when he was in the same city where I live and where she is originally from, she invited me to the Christmas market and we spent like 6 hours together, we went to a party, we saw a movie and so on and I started to catch feelings. Our chats were also good, she was open with me and we had a lot of other fun as well. 

All changed on Valentine's day. So turns out that she and this guy on her mind bumped into each other on a night out before Valentine's day. At the end of the night, the boy walked her home and they talked things through. They went on a date on the 14th and the girl told me that it was like a movie, that this guy did things that no one had done to her before (wanted to pay for the food, put the coat on the girl when leaving, and held her so she wouldn't slip on the icy streets.) I felt really bad, especially because these were things I would have done if I knew that she liked things like that, but I got a vibe that she didn't.

After talking things through with my friends I figured I would confess to her because that might be something that would help me to get over her. She said that we had agreed that we were going to be friends and that she thought I had some other crush and so on. After a big and pretty confusing talk, I told her that I am willing to be always there for her, but I need to take a pause from talking to her so I can come to terms with stuff in my head and try to get over her, she agreed and said that she also has to figure some things out. But this is the hard part, there are days where I feel good and only imagine positive things in my head like us driving somewhere and blasting music as friends. And then there are times when I think about her having sex with this new guy (I'm a virgin and never think about sex at all and never when I was with her. This thought is even worse because I heard her moan when trying to open a bottle with force and this makes my bad thoughts even more detailed.) 

I have talked with some friends about this and read some experiences from other people online but it's still hard. If whoever read through all this has some ideas or advice to give me I would really appreciate this (also ty for reading through all of this). Could this be a case of the right person at the wrong time? I feel like our energies matched, we had a lot of fun together and were a good match for each other. Could the situation have been any different if that boy was not on her mind, I regret not asking her this while confessing. I know that she said that she did all the things and thought of me as a friend the whole time but I mean I have been out with my friends but I haven't messaged them something along the lines of (""I had a lot of fun tonight!"", ""Tonight was fun!"") and gotten the same reply back.

Is there a winning situation for me or not? When should I talk to her again, is there anything that would make me think about her as a friend? Are these real feelings or am I just jealous?

The truth about dating is that a lot of women (not all) can date more guys, is because more guys are looking to take advantage of them. It must be kept in mind that these relationships are unsuccessful and are probably caused by our unwillingness to lower our standards.

Think about it like this. A college professor is flirting with their student. He is successful. His retirement money was saved. He has a family. Why in the hell would he want to get with a college student? That's the thing. He doesn't. That student is getting played. And the reason that student is, is because we as humans always want the best when it comes to who we want to date. Even if ""the best"" takes advantage of us. Every dumb male on this site talks about how ""omg the lesser attractive girl is dating all of these hot guys"" when they're not looking at the bigger picture of this. A lot of them, are getting played by these ""hot guys"" because we don't want to lower our standards. They end up depressed and heartbroken at the end of the relationship a lot more times than the lonely male who can't get into a relationship. And chances are, that pain is 10x worse for a women's mental health. To keep dating the wrong person over and over again is horrific. No one should want that.

Now let's look at men. Oh, men. The sad poor boy who ""can't get into a relationship."" Chances are, the ""too high of a standard"" situation is affecting you just as badly as it does women. Maybe it's a little worse for women. You see, while women can get into more relationships with men (who's sadly have the intentions of taking advantage of them) on the opposite side of the spectrum men believe they're entitled to date someone who looks like a supermodel. A lot of men follow into this notion where they don't even try to pursue someone ready to date because they're ""not attracted to them."" So they don't even try. So just like women, they get crushes on people who are way above their standard and eventually get...Hurt.


I'm sure you understand where this Reddit post is going so let's wrap things up, shall we? As someone who is non-binary it's interesting looking at both women and men and seeing where they fail relationship-wise. With Men failing more than women. The key to dating is unless you're rich, an actor, model, or someone who's treated as important in our sad capitalist world- the key to successfully dating is for the average people of all genders to raise their own standards which they fall into while simultaneously lowering their standards for who they should date.

im going to keep this as short as possible and leaving out some details. 

i met her through a friend group, one day she started texting me and next thing i know shes coming on VERY strong and tells me she likes me. 

as we know each other though i noticed that her opinions are very strong and sometimes it felt like walking on eggshells, all my friends feel the same. 

before we go on our first date she tells me shes emotionally unavailable, cant promise a relationship and seemed to be scared when it was possibly brought up yadda yadda. i noticed myself starting to build a wall. i liked her but knew i would get hurt. but i was patient with her, gave her space, didnt make her uncomfortable. we go on some dates and she tells me im the fastest shes ever gotten intimate with someone before etc and that we are perfect for each other

we would do things both of us never have done before

as progressively we go on more and more red flags appear. i stuck to it though because she goes to therapy and we were so bonded. 

but as our dates went on i was afraid of making her uncomfortable, not knowing what im able to say or do because i didnt want to push a relationship even though it pretty much was. constantly asking things i could do with her got old and i felt myself being anxious and afraid with her, she even asked if she intimated me once. i started to feel like she got too comfortable and i was only a priority when she wanted sex. i started to notice i was always texting first and reminding of plans brcause shes terrible at making them.  i felt i was making way too much effort. 

she keeps too many people in her life that wronged her and prioritizes the wrong ones. her guy best friend wronged her before and she complains all the time about him how she feels likeshes taking care of a child yet constantly spends time. 

she lost a bunch of friends recently including one of her best thats in our group, she was totally in the wrong but thinks she wasnt. and her best friend said she was always the one to reach out etc. not “my” girl. which is true. 

before i stayed over for the first time she told me she thinks she is non monogamous,saying getting married is stupid, she never wants kids etc. however she is only seeing me and wants to just see me for now at least. and that shes not actively looking. this hurt so bad because it added onto my confusion and that fucking me and someone else is unnattractive to me

she was also feeing sad cause she had just lost a bunch of friends and said she cant promise she’ll fully be herself that day but for me to be comfortable with her, what? so i backed off and wasnt trying to push anything on her. 

im so afraid of getting hurt at this point but still am falling and being patient and there for her, when i stayed over she said i seemed off and not present, she made a move on me and then asked what i i was thinking about…afraid of pushinf her away i blamed family issues and getting a new job. unrelated she asked if trusted her i said yes but she told me she doesnt yet, that she shared too many details of her life already. that i know nothing about her. 

little bit later she iniates and we have sex. she says how happy she is with me etc. and while sleeping she half asleep says she trusts me. then backtracks and says she doesnt yet. 

last thursday i stay over again, the whole week leading to it she was ovulating saying how badly she wants sex with me.  i was a little more comfortable but still unsure of things i can do in public now. it became better and a good night. she said i seemed off again though, and not present. and kept trying to pry things out of me when i said i just didnt want to make her uncomfortable or anything and push things. 
we then have sex three times, says over and iver how happy she is with me, how i pleasure her so well and she trusts me now. 

4 days later we talk over voice she is mad and stressed because she is having problems with her house etc and getting her period on top of everything. next day i ask if she wants to do things one day i planned to get her mind off things etc. she then says she wants some time but wasnt clear about contact. so i say thats fine but if we dont talk i just need to know if you are still interested so im not waiting around etc. 

says shes unsure, she likes spending time with me etc but hasnt been feeling a connection, we are different, that i always seem elsewhere and never present, she doesnt feel understood or seen that i dont try and she puts too much effort into making me feel comfortable + other reasons. a lot of blaming me and i took it..idk why but i just accepted it. i feel its all my fault now. 

we both want to see each other one last time, we are going to see batman with our friend group. beforehand we are going to talk though. is it okay for me to say i didnt think its fair she blamed me for everything and just go down everything im pretty much writing here? she took me off her private snap too and next day i had a msg sent to me on insta but deleted, shortly after she deleted her insta which she didnt use much anyway(she didnt block me)

idk if she even misses me…do emotionally unavailable people ever regret their decisions? it hurts so much how a few days later she just changes her mind saying she meant everything but she was thinking about it all the day i asked. there were so many red flags yet i still want her and idk why. 

sigh, any input is appreciated.

So I just cut ties with someone I was seeing casually, which I definitely should’ve avoided to begin with seeing as there were red flags from the jump.

I get it’s casual dating, but it’s then she talks about wanting to go exclusive. I’m all in with it as I think this girl’s a vibe. This was about 2 weeks ago.

The first week is cool, then the second week comes and she just went ghost. Okay this is kind of weird as it was a complete 180 from the weeks prior. With us having gone exclusive I wanted to at least put some effort into seeing if I did something wrong. 

Then I found her flirting with dudes that fit the usual stereotype of who bigger dudes get left for, six pack, chiseled jawline, veiny hands the whole runaround. Finding this out totally gave me a shot of confidence! It’s hard enough to keep telling myself that my dating pool isn’t limited because of my size, but this experience just fed into that thought.

The funny thing too is when I confronted her, I got the usual run around “It’s not you it’s me” “Can we still be friends?” Fuck no we can’t. 

Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with having preferences on who you’re dating, just make that shit known from the get go. Or if you want to give it a shot, don’t do what the person I described did. Just be straight up with them and tell them why you aren’t feeling it.

We have a great connection and gives hints on where she would like our first date be. But I think that being upfront to her is the only thing that I should do.

 If it's a dealbreaker for her, I will respect that.

Or will it give her a wrong impression that I'm judging her?

My boyfriend (22) and I broke up about three months ago (the day after thanksgiving). He broke things up with me over text saying that he didn’t feel like we were growing/ always arguing about the same thing. I told him that I didn’t want to stay friends as it was too hard for me. I took the breakup pretty hard and we went no contact for about a week. After that he contacted me to check up on me and I pretty much broke down and told him that I missed him and wanted us to get back together. He rejected me again and despite that for a week I continued to stay in contact with him, hoping he would change his mind but would keep getting rejected. 

When I realized that wasn’t going anywhere I stopped replying to him. He would still continue to try and talk to me but I would just ignore him. About a month later (Christmas Eve), he reaches out to me offering to drive with me to my apartment so he could collect his things and also help me with moving out. I told him that my brother had already helped me pack up his things and he could come and collect his things from my parents house. I knew right away it was just an attempt for him to talk to me again and shut it down. 

When he realized that wasn’t working that’s when he tells me that the reason he kept contacting me was that he missed me and still wanted us to work. By this time I was already over it and had no desire to get back together after I practically begged for a week only to get turned down every step of the way. We argued. In a nutshell I told him that I wasn’t interested in getting back together and didn’t want anything to do with him. 

Yesterday I reached out to him to collect some of my things from his place and asked if I could come by next week and also asked if we could sit down and talk since we never got a chance to talk face to face since the breakup three months ago which he agreed. 

Since the breakup I’ve been seeing a therapist. And one of the exercises that I had to do was make note of all the people who have hurt me and vice versa and write down all the things I would say to them if I could see them. 

So I wrote one for him. There were a lot of things that I never got a chance to say to him or get off my chest. The letter ended up being five pages long front and back. In the letter I basically apologized for any hurt I caused him or things that I may have done in the relationship. I also told him I forgave him for ending things and told him that I had no ill feelings towards him and that I still love him and always will but I think it’s in both of our interests to move on. The letter is pretty detailed and includes a lot of personal things including the sort of mental breakdown I went through when we broke up

I’m planning on reading this to him when we meet up. I wanted to get some advice on if I should or if trying to get closure is even worth it. The issue is he’s in the military and I know he’ll be getting deployed soon. God forbid something happens to him and I never get a chance to tell him how I’m feeling. I just don’t want to have any regrets.

I (32M) am looking for a woman around her 30s or older, to have some sort of online dating relationship. Things I do want to invest in and provide is a healthy, acceptable and respectful environment with a woman who is willing to talk with me, share ideas with me, views about life, and have a contact as friends, while also we can engage in to some sexting and mostly, voice sex with our fantasies becoming a thing in that moment. I used to date and be with girls when I was younger and I am not a stranger to online dating either, but due to work, pandemic, life situations, and, of course, growing older, even though I do still look the same and am decent looking as a guy, I feel tired with just physical contact from girls who don't appreciate me or even willing to have something more than that.

How do I look like? I'd upload a picture but not feeling that confident with myself for doing so right now, so I'll just give a description instead.

Height: 188cm / 1 m 88 cm / 6'17"" / six foot seventeen

Skin Color: White

Eye Color: Hazel Green

Hair Color: Light Brown

I am from Europe but I can stay late at my time to talk with friends from USA, JPN, and most of the rest of the world, so, timing shouldn't be a big problem, unless, you live in the other side of Europe which is hours ahead of me and impossible to talk or anything. Overall, personality wise, I don't know how to describe myself in a perfect manner here, but I'd say that for the most part, I am an easygoing person, I don't judge others harshly and for no reason, I value honesty and good manners and I am open for discussions even if I am totally new to any different opinion/perspective. I tend to care a lot and always trying to find reason behind things and people's actions. I know that most of the time this is pointless to some, but I had to learn in the hard way, that sometimes, reading out people and understanding them can help in protecting them from doing something wrong or bad or put themselves in danger.

I did lost people from my life, either because of disagreement, situations, accidents or death. So, I can't really say I am the happiest person you'll ever meet and talk with, and in all honesty, no one is. Everyone got a story behind them and it is what made us, but not what defines us to move on to something better. That's what I think and I like to be pragmatic about what I want.

About likes, I do enjoy some quality time working out with myself, trying to lose more weight and pump it up on my body as extra muscle so I can be stronger. Sometimes, I like to watch tv shows, anime, or play video games but these are all personal things and would not be the point of interest in our discussions and possible sexual encounters. Some other times, I prefer to read and learn more about history, countries, languages, and science. I am a big fun of CRISPR and I hope the methods working on it will give more results in the next upcoming years so every human can have an easier and better life. It's a farfetched dream, I know, but it has a solid base and structure to help our race for the better.

That's all I could think of to put here as a summary, without writing too much and drag it pointlessly. Please, don't hesitate to reach me out, I will try to reply here or in messages that will be sent to my inbox but in all honesty, I just hope I can find a woman who will be okay with talking and having something intimate with me on a LDR (Long Distance Relationship) but nothing serious or life committing because I know how hard it can be when attachment becomes real and how unfair and painful it can end up in most situations. We're not talking about those who succeeded here. lol

That's all. I don't think this will get any serious attention if at all, but I realized, I want that, and I want to find and talk with a woman close to my age. You can be yourself, you can participate in activities such as gaming, anime, etc like I do, you can be anyone that can be in this life, you can look how you want, just be yourself, be honest and let's talk it out first. We will not do or talk about anything that you don't feel comfortable with and I respect boundaries, secrets and private life. For real, I do.

PS: Not 100% sure if this is the right place to ask this but I hope it will get an attention. Talk to me for more details or AMAs.

For the past 4 years I have been focusing on school (Computer Science), advancing my career as a programmer, fitness and my social skills (which I’m proud of the most. Going from awkward skinny guy in high school to a confident 6-pack ab muscular man who can talk to anyone). 

I met this girl(26F) at Starbucks waiting for her drink, gave her a compliment about her beautiful blue eyes. She got her coffee and stayed there talking to me. I made her laugh, then I asked her out. She gave me her phone number and we agreed to go out in 4 days for some coffee and a walk in the park. 

We texted each other, she definitely texted me more than I texted her. I tried to keep up but I have life to live and can’t be on my phone all day long.

Couple hours before our first date she asked me if we could move the date by making it an hour later. I thought she is genuinely busy and life happens so I agreed. I still showed up on time and waited in the car. It all went great, I went for a kiss at the end but she said she doesn’t kiss on the first date. My gut/intuition felt that she just didn’t want to kiss me in particular. 

Same thing happened here, she said that she’ll be late by 1 hour. But 2nd date went good too. We had dinner and passionately made out in a car afterwards. She invited me to her place but I said that “I don’t have sex on a second date” to tease her back and create desire for later because I was looking for something deeper with her than a hook up. At this point I started giving her more attention

I kinda kept a few red flags for me in the back of my mind. She was late both times, selling me her “good relationship” with her father little too much, haven’t offered to split the check (even tho money is not a problem, I still wanted her to at least offer)

3rd date we went out for drinks. Didn’t even feel like a date. In the middle of it she started talking about her “guy friend” that she met at her work a month ago stopped talking to her. At first I listened, asked questions but then I called her out on it and said that there must have been something between them if she feels that way. She denied it. Later on I tried to kiss her goodbye when dropping her off she denied it, gave me a hug and went home. 

I stood there like an idiot contemplating if I should follow her and ask what’s the matter. Then I remembered I could ask her coworker the same question. I’m very direct and logical so my creepy ass went onto her IG and found a guy she follows with that name she told me earlier. I reached out and asked if he works at that place. He responded and I asked him if this girls is his ex. He said he was seeing her along with 4 other coworkers all buying her nice things, dinners, taking out on drinks etc.

I (28F) have had my fair share of dating experiences and I would always get very invested very fast and then get disappointed when it didn’t work out. Whenever I’d get ghosted or things would fade out, I would feel so frustrated I’d hang onto the situation and try to regain control. Numerous times this has resulted in MONTHS of toxic contact and back and forth with men, thinking every time they texted me back when I’m being forceful, I had a chance. Anyway, after last year this finally got exhausting. 

I’ve decided to view life as musical chairs: there are only so many chairs in my life. Anytime I let someone who isn’t giving me good energy sit on a chair, someone better (hopefully) cannot access a chair. Furthermore, I’ve realized my damn worth. If I’m not getting what I am giving, why the hell am I giving? What am I giving? It’s quite frankly pathetic. 

Over the last two months under this approach I have removed various exes from social media and some have been completely blocked. Such a relief, holy Jesus. 

For the last month I had been seeing someone who checked every box on my list. I thought this was it. It had been fading the last two weeks and in the past week it essentially finally died. Yesterday and today I stood at the crossroads of do I try to resurrect this or do I bounce and make that chair available. I went and removed him from Instagram, I deleted our WhatsApp conversations so I don’t reminisce. It sucked for about 5 minutes because I’m disappointed but now I’m sat here thinking how exciting and liberating it is to not be hoarding people who waste my time. No intentions, no access.

Stop clinging onto disappointments. Put them in the bin where they belong and certainly don’t be one of those people who keeps tabs on everyone you once went on a date for. Clear that space and energy for the right person so it’s available when they Finally come along. 🥰",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159952,public,self,Highly recommend cutting people off early,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/swm1dh/highly_recommend_cutting_people_off_early/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I was always bringing her around my family but never around hers because we have different cultures and hers doesn’t go along with mine. She hid me from her parents and one day they found out. Our first breakup happened after because I had to move out the country for studies and I guess she didnt see the point of having LDR with her parents telling her not to see me so she ghosted and blocked me everywhere. I kept trying to text her so we can be back. 1 year later when covid started I came back to stay and tried to contact her again. We ended up back together last summer 2021. She was very close to me physically, but distant emotionally she would not engage herself at 100% by making me not come through her close ones by any means. She told me she talked with guys during my absence, but nothing serious she ditched them, I believe her. We ended up back for around a month only for her to leave me again saying that I do not communicate well which is true, I just tend to keep stuff for myself, I am not good with small talks. I really appreciated that time with her, I could not ask for a more loving person than her. Now here I am in 2022 still trying to text her into coming back with me for another chance. All the way through my only way to contact her was by creating a new account. Last time she told me to move on and threatened me with a restraining order. I still asked her again for another chance.

Only recently have the classes been in person. She is on the only person I know in the class and I think it's the same for her as we had our classes moved.

# First Week

My first interaction was very awkward, was heading to class and was lost. She was heading to class from somewhere else and had already dropped her stuff off there and we happened to like meet on the stairs. She asked if I was heading to the class and after I said yes, she asked if I was me (asked my name). I was surprised that she knew who I was considering I didn't know anyone, had only recently got to the country to study on campus and this particular class hasn't had any like teaching/interactions so it had been a whileee. But for this remote class I had shown my face before and I think she and I have been in breakout rooms as pairs for the class and she recognised me from my voice? We get to the class and find out we'd been moved to a different class so we rush to the actual class with small talk on the way. She usually initiates the conversation like what I was studying and stuff. In class we sit together since we went there together. Fast forward to the end of the class and we just say bye briefly and she leaves pretty quickly.

# Second Week

The next week, the same class I get there a bit early. She gets to the class and sits next to me. But I guess we only know each other in the class so it isn't something to read into? This time round I think we had a more fun/playful atmosphere. It helped that the language class was about using new adjectives like interesting and forming sentences with them. While doing the tasks for the class she says I'm a boring and laughs I think (think it was jokingly) for not finding movies, bungee jumping interesting. Throughout the class she asks me about what I do in my spare time and stuff due to the previous situation. And being the shy person I am I didnt ask her what she did and only realised she'd been initiating the conversations a majority of the time. So I try to reply by asking her the same thing she asks and we talk throughout the class. At some point she asks for my Instagram and saying something along the lines of we could be friends/get to know each other but I don't remember if she said the word friends exactly but I think it might have been implied? Because she knows I'm very new here and have meet one other person. Fast forward to the end of the class and this time round we get to the elevator together with a bunch of other people. She gets out before me and waits for me (could be because Im not familiar with the building and she has other classes there) and we walk together while talking until we part ways. She said she won't be going to next week's class and asked me to take notes for her. I said yes say bye and give a little wave. Can't remember but I think we both were talking about being hungry and it raining that day before the bye. I asked if she was cooking and I think she said yes but unsure, was debating asking her to grab food before heading back but was too scared.

I text her the next day after a class if she was out and jokingly said the rain was nice cause previously I had said I liked the rainy/cold weather. She replied to that and asked if I had class that day. I ask if she did and she didn't. After sorting some stuff out I take shelter from the rain at a mall and she says she thinks she saw me somewhere near a store there. I ask her what she was up to and stuff. The replies are between 10-30 mins and a day. She was out with her friends. The conversation over text didn't seem like she was as friendly as irl.

So please be nice!

I met my then girlfriend when we were in 1st grade, I was a total introvert and avoided the other kids at all costs. I’d rather sit in the corner and read than talk to people. One day, this girl I’d never seen before walked up to me and introduced herself. She was a cute little brown haired girl who had these big blue eyes and long brown hair. Now, I was obsessed with oldies music back then and still am now. I loved Elvis, Johnny cash, The Beach Boys etc, etc. and when she said she liked that stuff too, I knew I was gonna marry her one day. We hung out almost every day and went to each other’s houses a lot. We became best friends quite fast and remained so for a while. Then she moved to another school across town and I was heartbroken. I never saw her again after that until 8th grade when I went on a field trip to a local community college. I got off the bus and walked towards the school. Suddenly I heard someone yell my name and I turned around and someone did one of those running jump hug things. She nearly cracked my spine and I couldn’t breathe for a second. When I realized who she was, I was over the moon! She had changed slightly but still had those beautiful eyes and long brown hair. We spent the entire tour together and made plans to hang out. Once plans were made, we were equally ecstatic. We decided to go for a walk and talked about our lives from 1st grade until that moment. One thing she did that supprised me was when she tried to hold my hand. Me being an idiot, ignored the obvious sign. I thought she was just being nice until one day she professed her feelings for me. I was flattered and realized that she had a crush on me for months. We began dating and I got my first kiss with her. Everything was going great and I was on top of the world. (Side note: we were both freshman in high school, probably should have mentioned that). But then, only two weeks later, she broke up with me, saying how she wasn’t ready and all that. I said it was fine and that she could take all the time she needed. I was devastated but eventually moved on. We remain friends to this day and text regularly.

On the 11th (a week ago) I had a bit of a conversation with her about how her classes were going that semester and other things. Our conversation went well, so I asked her to exchange numbers; she agreed, and that was that. 

Last Tuesday I decided to start texting with her, and we’ve been texting pretty much every day since then. I started out by asking her about her hobbies, and one of the things she said was that she has a huge rock collection and that she could tell me about any rock. I took a chance with this, and we ending up talking about amethyst rocks for about at least an hour. That night I decided to flirt with pickup lines, and she never told me to stop or anything, rather, she also threw some pickup lines at me when I asked her if she wanted to. She also told me that she’s starting to really like talking to me. Yesterday, after I asked if she had ever dyed her hair out of curiosity, she showed me a bunch of pictures of the different colors she dyed her hair. 

This afternoon, I texted her, “Sorry I couldn’t text all day, I went swimming.

24-year-old Indian man here. I mostly date through OLD. I have been on plenty of dates and matched with some girls on tinder but my god is this app making me lose faith in humanity. It's also increasing my negative feelings towards a certain gender which I know its wrong but they're still there. With women on tinder, the experience can be average to downright rude and racist. Just recently a girl matched just to troll me and insult my appearance. I have had girls who made fun of my d\*k size saying Indian ones are tiny. I can't believe someone would match just to say that. Others have such a fragile ego, they will demand an apology if I don't do something they live, aka having an opinion on something and not agreeing with them. The majority of my dates have come from the hinge and I have had not one single negative experience there. My question is why are these women so filled with hate? I know some of them are online just for followers and validation which is fine, I don't swipe on them anyway. But even normal girls seem to be stuck up. I asked a girl out for coffee, she went on a rant about how it was a stupid idea for a first date and to try again. I know young women are drowning in attention on these apps but what right does that give them to treat me like shit? Don't they realize looks don't last forever?

Now of course I know the majority of women aren't like this. It seems OLD is filled with these toxic types. But even in university, it's just a pattern I noticed.

The first thing she does is give me a look of disappointment, followed by a loud, stress-induced sigh. Next question is, “oh but you’re not looking for a relationship with this guy, right?”. I told her, if I continue to like what I see from him then possibly. More disappointment ensues.

Her opinions make me second-guess my choices and it’s frustrating me to no end. He’s a great guy and we’re getting along pretty nicely and she has me asking myself, “maybe he isn’t someone I should pursue?” Mommy knows best, right?

I find it so hard to talk to her about this part of my life without her having to insert herself like she knows better. And I get it, she’s older and wiser so she knows a thing or two, but it feels like she doesn’t trust me to do this myself.

So we are going to try an open-relationship… it’s not new to us, as we were kinda wild in our early 20s together.

Trust and honesty is the root of our relationship and we both are very secure in our relationship — plus life’s short and we want to enjoy the last remaining nectar of our youth before we hit 40. 

The reason this is in dating advice rather than relationship advice is because this is a dating question — it’s important to my husband and I to be respectful to our partners as well as each other. 

How honest should we be with our partners? We want our partners to understand this is casual but don’t want to seem rude about it. Is it better to explain that before or after being intimate? I don’t want either of us to make it awkward with our partners or kill the mood, even if our partner agrees on being casual. 

And the biggest question — should we tell our partners that we’re married? We definitely don’t want to lead people on, and I can see in certain circumstances the answer should be yes and in others no… but at the same time we’re not going to lie either. 

In a situation where I tell my partner that I have a husband and we’re in an open relationship — I can see a potential (male) partner thinking that’s cool; but if my husband tells a potential (female) partner that he has a wife and we’re in open relationship — I can see her getting creeped out and thinking he’s a sleaze, but it’s not like that.

I bought a fifth of Jameson and some cherry coke for us. We mix drinks with the friends (3 couples) and then go out to a bar. There's a huge snow pile in the parking lot which is empty. I told my bf when we leave I want to climb the snow pile, I always used to do that, I love playing in the snow even as an adult. Now I haven't eaten anything and I am a bit lit upon arrival, but not bad. I do a shot with my bf, get a beer and then I did a shot with one of the girls there. My bf kisses me and says ""I love you so much, I have never wanted to put a baby in someone so bad, you are so fun."" We order pizza, I pay for it. We eat it.

I start getting really dizzy some time later, so my boyfriend got me some water. I go to the bathroom and as I'm sitting there I was like wow, I'm so dizzy, so I sat there longer just so I could regain my composure or something. I was having a good time, but I guess nobody else was. One of the girls comes in the bathroom and asks if I'm all right. I said yes, I'm good. She tells me everyone thinks I'm so beautiful. 

We eventually leave. I take my boyfriend's hand and I said hey, let's do the snow pile! We sit on the top of it and then come down, it was fun! We got back to the friends' house and they order Taco Bell to be delivered. My boyfriend is quiet at this point. He takes a taco, gives me one. We eat them. He takes another, and then unwrap it, does not eat it. I asked him if everything is okay, why you not eating the taco? The friends say we can spend the night, and my bf says ""maybe."" I look at him and say ""Oh. I thought we were. I brought my stuff inside."" He gets up and takes his boots off and the side of his foot is covered in something red. I said oh my God, are you okay? Your foot is bleeding! He does not answer. He says ""You coming to cuddle?"" I get to the room we're going to stay in and he tells me he's very annoyed with me and I was so rude the whole night. Now I do not remember being rude. I paid for his drinks, his food, bought him the Jameson, drove an hour and a half. My boyfriend was late and I had told him earlier I got nervous because I drove so far, he was 30 mins late and wasn't answering his phone. He had told me I was being dramatic. Now when he tells me I was rude all night and did 4 things he didn't like, but could only tell me 2 of them I got extremely upset. I started crying because I have no idea why he said that. I had a good time. I thought we both did. 

Today he told me he wishes last night had gone different. I brought him out with my friends a few weeks ago and he basically told me the same thing. He told me I was rude. I wasn't that drunk, I remember everything from both times, but the things he tells me I do not remember. I am starting to think he is making it up? He told me his friends didn't like us and he's really irritated and I really made it worse. He told me his friends said he was being mean to me and the girl I did shots with told him to shut up. She was mad at him for being mean to me. I guess when I went to the bathroom a girl bumped into him and he said hey to her. One of the girls that was with us saw him talking to this girl and went over and asked where I was and why he's talking to someone else. That's when she went to find me in the bathroom. Now today my bf told me he was upset I did so many shots with the girls and bought so many shots for everyone. I was like dude, I bought one shot for me and one for her because you suggested I go do a shot with her. After that was when he said he wanted to put a baby in me. 

Tldr; so does this sound manipulatve? Something doesn't add up. I don't remember being rude. I don't remember any of the stuff he said I did when I was with him with my friends either. I have never blacked out from drinking. I was 100% there in mind and body. Why would his friends think he was mean to me if I was the one being rude? I am really embarrassed if I was mean....

My(21f) bf (20m) was toxic in the past and we had argued about him not giving me  time,not having boundary with female friends and him going to a female’s friend house when I told him it’s okay as long as the third friend is there but he felt bad and stayed. He can’t say no to ppl and has boundary and time management problems.We are in long distance relationship rn.( 1.2 year old rs with 6 months of LDRS)

He has been working on it after months of me begging and arguing about it and I can see him changing rn. But since it took months for him to learn those boundaries and especially not giving me quality time with him alone when his type of quality time is met for 5 months, I resent him on it very much. I always told him  exactly how I want to spend time but he would say he’ll try and doesn’t.’


And not that he’s changing and working on his toxic traits, I tend to bring those up on every chance I have. I feel like I need to keep reminding him those hurtful things he has done to me so he will keep working on them and be guilty. I know it’s toxic and I want to work on it. Nowadays he’d give me quality time 3 times a week, this is the first ever time he tried and the first week of trying. Maybe it’s because he just started changing I don’t believe he’ll and on days he don’t spend time with me after work, he’d game while I’m on discord voice channel and go straight to sleep after, I get upset. It gives me flashbacks of the past where he’d game every day and go to sleep and only come to me to jerk off. I know I can’t keep bringing them up forever but I don’t know how to move on from them.
I always hold grudges very strongly and I’d always be wary of the person that has hurt me before. It’s natural for some level but in this case I feel like I’m getting mentally abusive.We were talking about him needing to work on boundary and explaining him how it felt for me openly. Then he made a comparison of his cheating friend with him saying ‘, my friend would watch movie with his gf online and leave her there and go talk to other girl’ when I talked ( video call) about him talking to friends at 2 am when it was our time in the past when I had like only 2 hours free at night and I spent it with him.It felt to me like he’s saying “ at least I’m not cheating on you get over it “ which he says he isn’t. Then I got emotional and talked to him while crying about how it felt when he did that and he suddenly said “ I need to sleep” and I got upset and I said ‘okay sleep well ‘ and ended the call without saying anything. He cried and told me he need sleep because he has work in 4 hours with voice messages late and that I’m not being understanding. But from my pov, I just didn’t want to be on call anymore when he’s going to sleep and I got cut off with this pent up emotions I have. Am I being abusive already? 
Is he trying to put the blame on me saying I get upset at anything and trying to get away with having to work on his boundary ?

Tldr; I can’t forget what my bf did in the past and I keep bringing up on our conversations.He’s working on it but it’s the first week only.

I'm a 26y/o male and I just moved to Honolulu about two weeks ago. I'm getting almost zero matches on Tinder and Hinge. 

I don't know what's wrong! I was in a town of 70k people before this and honestly I got a lot of matches. I got a ton of matches when I arrived, but now days will go by now and I'll get nothing, which seems something is wrong because in a big city like this I'm bound to get at least something. 

I'm honestly a good looking guy, my photos are good, prompts and stuff are eh, but I just feel like the apps aren't working tbh. 


Does anyone have ideas what I should do? If I could meet someone normally that would be great! I just don't know where to go, what to do or how to go about it. I'm a little shy too lol 

I love going to the gym, (I go to UFC😉) I think it would be nice to meet a girl that shares my interest, but starting conversation at the gym is hard! I feel like I'm rude if I talk to a gal there and it always feels like a bad time. Help! Haha

So I wasn't getting any likes or swipes from women at all, so I figured there must be something wrong with my looks or something so I started going to the gym and wearing better clothes and styling my hair. I've been hitting the gym and I've made some pretty impressive gains, plus my body looks really fit as well, I decided to rejoin and give dating apps another go but still, nothing and I used all the photo optimization tips and wrote a pretty good bio. I even had a female friend of mine review my profile and she said it was good, but I barely got matches and when I did it was either obese women or trans women, and single mothers. I have nothing against these people they just aren't the women I want to date and I put in so much effort and I still got no results honestly, fuck dating apps.

For some more context, I'm 180cm, 84kg, I have clear skin, dark hair, hazel eyes, and I dress nicely I also have a career as a cardiac nurse I just think dating apps are designed to make men pay tbh.

I am trying very hard to form relationships with my bf’s family since we’re planning to get engaged soon (according to him.)

In the several years we’ve been together I’ve only seen them a handful of times. They have made it very clear to me from the beginning that they aren’t thrilled about me. He has a large Mexican family and everyone speaks Spanish but me. Since they all also speak English, I didn’t see this as being a huge issue but apparently it is. 

When I visit they will only speak English long enough to say hello how are you. Then it’s Spanish for the rest of the time. I can’t join any conversations, I have no clue what’s going on, and I just sit there in silence while everyone ignores me. I’m actually trying to learn Spanish to solve this problem, but the LEAST they could do is try to engage me in conversation until then. 

Even his cousins who are my age ignore me. They sit on their phones instead of talking to me and when I speak to them they’re rude and uninterested. It really pisses me off because I’ve told my boyfriend about my concerns several times, and he says “it’s all in my head.” 

What really makes me sad is how welcoming my family is of him! They adore him. He loves spending time with my family because they make it enjoyable for him and they genuinely are happy for me. He even made it into our family group text Which is HUGE! They go out of their way to make sure he is comfortable and having a good time. He goes on every trip with us and texts all my siblings, cousins, etc. Meanwhile I have no relationships with anyone on his side. 


Lately I haven’t been open to going with him to his family events. I just can’t take it anymore. He gets mad and doesn’t understand the problem for some reason. His grandmas birthday party was tonight - I didn’t know about it until 30 minutes before it started because that’s when his aunts had the courtesy to invite me. (He claims he thought i was part of the initial discussions weeks before, which I wasn’t.) So obviously I didn’t go and now he’s upset.

We had tons of good communication about what we were and how things would be going forward, we established that we would see each other once every week or two, and it seemed pretty established that we’d be a long term casual thing. However after the third date he unfollowed me on Instagram and blocked me on Facebook, and I’ve been so confused as to why he pulled this ghost. Or why didn’t he block me on Instagram also, but just unfollowed me making it so that I could still message him there? 

A bit of background info: we knew each other for 7 months as I taught him piano before deciding to officially start hanging out. He also didn’t want to see me on Valentine’s Day because he said it would make things more serious than he was ready for and that his priority was on work and not on a serious relationship. He also said he didn’t plan on getting into a serious relationship for the next five years. I agreed to his terms to be casual, despite the fact that I knew it could lead me to getting hurt and he was aware that I am the type to get hurt easily as well. So basically this guy was not serious from the start and I was okay with that, but I don’t know why he would go ghost when this relationship seemed to benefit him.

These all seem like good signs, but one really weird thing (and the reason for why I'm making this post) is that it takes her anywhere from 2 hours to more than a day to respond to texts. She did apologize for being ""bad with snaps"" and gave me her phone number, but the average response time is still about the same. I originally chalked it to her being busy, but I noticed her texting other people frequently during class, and she posts on her story a few times a day. And personally, feel free to disagree with me on this, a few days it took her about 1.5 days to reply and I just don't think it's possible to be too busy to text for that long.

At first it was good, (don't get me wrong I had my doubts if this was the right move). As well I did expects things to change after the first month of living together.

Well last night I glanced over at him and saw his phone. He had a message from someone (not sure if it might be his mom or not. It was hard to see the name), and in the message I saw the hearts emojis and the kissy fave one. This triggered me to have doubts that this relationship is going in the right direction and regret of moving in. 

So later today when he got back from work, I didn't say anything/say much. I'm assuming he didn't notice or didn't care. Before bed I tried to talk to him just about something I saw online. He completely ignored me and just kept looking at his phone. Which made me really upset and I just went to the bedroom and cried.

When he came in, I went to the bathroom to finish crying (which it is adjacent to our room. So clearly can hear what goes on in there). I came back to the bedroom and started to sob again. Yet nothing from him, didn't bother to ask if I was okay or why I was crying. He just carried on his phone.
