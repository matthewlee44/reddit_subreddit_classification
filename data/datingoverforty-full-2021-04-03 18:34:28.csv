I was always the chunky girl and was verbally abused by my grandmother about it for most of my life.

My ex was never forthcoming with compliments, nor would he ever call me hot, cute, whatever.  Nothing.

One of the hardest things I have had to deal with being single is getting compliments.  I dont ever feel like they are honest, but are just said to get laid.

I had weight loss surgery 3 years ago and am smaller and healthier than I was, but I'm still thick.


My new SO is much smaller than me. A strong wind could blow him away.  Hugging him at first was like hugging an ironing board. 

Every morning he texts me and says good morning beautiful, and asks how I slept.

I can't wrap my brain around beautiful. Im older, I have the body of a mom who had 3 big babies by csection, my arms have wings and wave by themselves, my thighs touch.  Im short and I still feel chunky.

My therapist knows this is a hangup for me and says I should accept the compliments, but its so foreign to me.

Plus....he showed me pictures of his brothers ex. Fucking smoking hot teeny bikini model gorgeous.  That just adds to my lack of confidence....bringing a thick woman to meet his family...ugh. No pressure there. 🙄

On September 15th, I came home to find my wife and kids (one a stepchild) gone.  There were refried beans left on the stove, the kids' bunk bed gone, a Dear John letter on the counter.  I couldn't find them for three months.  While I was on the other side of the country on business, she had consummated an affair with her ex-boyfriend.  A week later, she admitted it to me and told me she wanted a divorce.  We were one year and seven months into our marriage.  We had a civil ceremony so I threw her the wedding she never had for our first anniversary.  While she was renewing her vows and wearing the (frankly, stunning) dress I had found, she was already carrying on with her new guy.  The attitude was basically, ""Don't hate the playa, hate the game.""  I wasn't playing a game.

Coming back into the dating world, I found there were all sorts of pills I could take.  Red ones, blue ones, purple ones...even black ones!  As a result of all this pill taking, people started seeing ghosts.  They were the omnipresent ghosts of the past, ghosts of the future (!!) and, apparently, dating had become murderous because there were a \*lot\* of ghosts of first dates.  It was like a demented dating version of A Christmas Carol.  Take enough pills, I suppose and one starts experiencing things.

I discovered that to be successful in dating, I had to make sure I got a professional photographer, learn how to smile, figure out how to be charming and charismatic with the first words I said to a complete stranger, write a detailed bio (but not too detailed).  People didn't want to be chatted up in grocery stores.  Again, I had to have ""game"".

I \*do\* hate the game.  The ""game"" has cost me a list of people in my life.  The ""game"" has cost my son a lot.  I accept that I'm just waking up to reality.  Perhaps, I didn't want to see it as it seems so...""ugly"" is the word that comes to mind.  It all seems to center around cheap sex and materialism.  Ignorance might have been bliss.  Bliss is what I was aiming for, not ignorance.  It's the ignorance that seems to continue intruding.  I find it tragic. 

I've got my pros and cons, like anyone.  I know myself well and I continue to work on improving life for my son and myself.   I think I'd check the boxes for someone.  But, as an older solo dad, it all became too overwhelming because there's one thing that seems to be missing from the debate and ""strategies"", the rhetoric and the ""-isms"":  Love.

Choose love, people.  Choose to not reduce other people.  Choose to send the text instead of ""ghosting"".  Choose to see the courage behind the awkwardness.  Just...choose love.

My frustration was many matches, few responses to my ""first move"" messages. As background, I definitely consider myself a catch. I've not been in a relationship for almost two years, had plenty of hook-ups with guy friends but nothing ""real."" I decided on Bumble as I heard good things. I just got wrapped up in advancing my career - which I did, and I'm thrilled/proud - and setting up a solid ""me"" foundation.  One of those two years was pandemic ""on my own"" stuff we all had to deal with. A Covid-related job furlough notwithstanding, I came out of it with an even better job (a dream job, really) and I'm in better shape than before the pandemic, somehow.

But I found one regular theme - people not giving anyone a chance. It seems to me (and gents, and those who identify as men, please let me know what's up here) that dudes are really jaded. I'd trade messages and it would go to the negative (like, ""If you even respond,"" ""This app is horrible but glad to connect,"" etc.) really quickly - OR - we'd hit it off, and move to iMessage. Meeting up was definitely on the table. And then, boom, one night of a discussion ends with him deciding I'm ""\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and blocking me completely. The biggest bummer of the recent, and maybe I dodged a bullet (likely, but still) was, to me, a friendly-vibe heated discussion about the role of the vocalist vs. singer in rock or metal. He shot me down, said I was too aggressive, ""you're too hot for rock,"" and ""you're a one album fan,"" (which is laughably inaccurate) then blocked me. He's never met me.

In my experience it seems men have been quick to assign an untrue narrative, then use THAT to end the interaction. What happened to giving people a chance?

Dudes, what's with this? I do have comfortable self-esteem and confidence (I have a GREAT career, I'm secure, and very emotionally aware but definitely not perfect, and fit, and I truly, truly listen to and know obscure genres of metal among many other genres) and can, with ease, argue my point in discussions. I always try to give someone at least ONE meet-up so I can get to know them. Why is this consideration so rare coming from men? Or is it just me? 

Would love some insight. Insult to injury was he's six years older than me, as I started dating older men (I'm 40, so ideally 41-49) because dudes under 40 were way insecure (my experience only, not a generalization.)

We have a lot in common and the passionate kisses are incredible.  I am a single dad with 50% custody and she knows this.  She also recently quit her job and does not have another one lined up, but it's good that she quit because it was a toxic work environment.  

Anyhow, this weekend is my custody weekend with my child, so I texted her in the morning and asked her if she wanted to drop by my place to see me and celebrate her finishing her work after my son goes to bed at 9:00 last night. She said yes.  I was looking forward to seeing her all day.  We texted in the afternoon and everything seemed fantastic and then radio silence.  At 7:30, I told her I'd have my little one in bed by 9:00 and no response until 9:00, when she texts me and says she is too exhausted to drive safely.  

She then called me and told me that she went out and got too stoned with her friend and was not in a position to drive so she just needed to get some sleep and wake up early the next day.

I am a pot smoker too, and I enjoy smoking with her, so that's not an issue.

However, do you guys think it's a sign that she's irresponsible?  I feel as if I had plans with her and the tables were turned, that she would not be cool with me standing her up because I got too stoned with a friend and couldn't drive to her.  If she really wanted to see me, she could have taken an uber.

Putting myself in her shoes, if I were tired, I would take a nap instead of hanging out and smoking with a friend because I would want to save my energy for her.  It dismays me that she chose to cancel on me at the last minute and she definitely could have given me a heads up in advance.  

Everything about her seems amazing and we have so much in common.  I really like her a lot and want to spend as much time as possible with her and grow this relationship, but I am now feeling that it may be too one sided and I am leaning towards pulling back and away as a response to this last minute change of plans.

I'm really not asking for advice, I'm just venting to express myself and get this off my chest so I can go enjoy the holiday with a socially distanced family visit.

 I thought to myself, well, what quality guy will give a tall, bald, wig wearing 44 year old woman a real chance?  I've already been dumped three times for the bald thing.  Yet, I can't really accept nothing either.

I took years off of dating, because I had 3 experiences IN A ROW with men on dating sites who ended up being either still married, engaged, or just plain cheaters.  All of whom claimed to want committed relationships.  At the time I was physically in very good shape.

So for a while, I let myself go, gained weight and too time off from dating.  When I decided to get back in the game, I still had extra weight on me.  Met two guys who were both living in their glory days - Also overweight but wouldn’t admit it, solid 5’s who turned out to be obsessed with women online who were absolute 10’s.  Gave up dating again for a while just disgusted.

Lost weight again and got in great shape.  Was constantly being hit on, cat called and men trying to randomly pick me up.  Not even flattering, because it feels disgusting when a man just wants you for your body.  Met a couple guys online and all they wanted to do was get in my pants.  So there goes the cycle and I gain weight again.

Now I want someone in my life, but feel awful about myself when I’m overweight.  I’d like to lose it, but apparently not enough to do something about it.  A little while ago, I heard neighbors behind me talking about ‘trying to get laid’ and saying I was gross after I stood up from where I was sitting.  What a wonderful reminder about why it just seems like I can’t stand men.

And ladies who manage to do this are welcome too. 

I am now officially on OLD sites again. I have chosen to maximise my reach and date across many of them. 
I have recent pics, full length, active, b&amp;w, face ones etc. 
Smiling in all of them (of course). No fliters, exes, kids, pouts. 
I am pretty specific about what I want and there is no indication in my profile that somehow... I am some craven s3x fiend. (I just play one on Reddit. *pmsl*)

So to my questions 
1. Why after chatting for 1 day does every man I talk to eventually test the waters with a comment like? ""Blah blah blah in the bedroom. 

2. How the heck do you answer/shut down  the above without seeming like a total prude? I enjoy passionate expression in a relationship. I just prefer getting to know someone for a period of time before I am propositioned. 🙄

I am tired of reading bumf on high value women blah blah. There is no secret we need to learn to be decent to each other. I don't desire to manipulate, cajole or convince a man to like me. That is patronising.

Simply put I hold old fashioned values of honour, respect, mutual appreciation and treat my friends, mates and lovers with admiration and decency. 

Answers on a postcard please...

A guy friend of mine advised me to not bypass the “Not sure yet” guys but instead ask more questions. 

I did. 

It turned out we had quite a bit in common. 

Long story short, we took our time moving from dating to exclusivity to using the terms “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” but those things all eventually happened. At his lead. 

A couple of months ago we had too much wine together and he admitted he’d been looking for a partner all along. 

We seem pretty well-matched. We respect each other, meet each other halfway, have met the kids (there’s a few teenagers between the two of us). Our cats even like the other person. 

Our relationship has been tested by kid issues, ex issues, work issues, natural disasters, a hospitalization, and we’ve just kind of moved through all those. We’ve spent Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, NYE, Valentine’s Day, and Easter together so far and had awesome celebrations each time. We went on vacation together two weeks ago and had a great time!

Our families each know about the other person. My mom and sister in law and his mom and stepmom seem to be cheering us on. His sister and I chat on social media. After Covid we may eventually meet.

I do ok on my own with apps, but my picker is off so maybe outsourcing would yield better results.

Does anyone have any experience with matchmakers?  My experience is limited to being in their candidate pool. 

Long story short - my friend from high school worked for the one advertised on TV and was building her client books, so she included me for free as a matchable person... so I'm sort of familiar with the vetting process and had one really short, but intense relationship that formed from being matched - that quickly flamed out because we wanted different things in life - she wanted kids and I'm done changing diapers and didn't want to be the old dad.

My mother kicked me out at a young age and we have not been in contact for 10 years. I don’t know who my father is and have made peace that I probably never will. I made some unwise life choices and became a teen mom. I had three children before turning 20. I was on drugs but decided that life wasn’t for my children or me and have been sober over 11 years from hard drugs like meth. There is much more but that’s for therapy. I am 41 now. 

I’m sharing all this because I’m seriously self-conscience of my past when it comes to dating and my fears were just confirmed.

I recently was dating a man from work and thought it was going cool. Until last Friday when he opened up and I thought that was the green light to open up too. I shared some of the above (not everything) and let him in my apartment for the first time ever. We didn’t do anything sexual and it felt good to finally have someone to trust. 

I thought all was good and was considering asking him if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, but all of a sudden he went cold like ice. He called once after that and wasn’t as talkative as usual. He stopped replying to my texts and hasn’t answered when I call, he always has picked up right away before or would call back within an hour. 

I feel like I scared him off by sharing too much. I had previously stopped dating before this and have been single for 6 years now. I don’t know if a man will be willing to fall in love with someone like me. I have never been in love or in a healthy relationship where the man I am with loves me back, they have all been abusive. I just want to know what good love feels like but then everyone wants something, right?

I’m fun to be around and like joking about myself and everything. I do have my 5 minutes of serious exchanges with others, I don’t criticize nor offer my opinion unless asked for. I’m also an empathetic fool that sometimes carries the weight of the world. From the 16 personalities, I’m an INF-J. Do not mistake my kindness with stupidity or being a pushover.

My problem is simple, but sometimes difficult for my daughter and myself. She is a beautiful 22 year old with an envious social life. Many of her girlfriends tend to stay over for many days. They are sweet, beautiful and pay too much attention to me and flirt with me in a way that I find uncomfortable. I brush them gently away, thanking them for the sweet compliments when my daughter is not in direct hearing distance. She loves being at home and I don’t want to jeopardize our father daughter relationship. Since her mother has departed, we emotionally help each other out. I just don’t want her friends to flirt with me anymore. I’m not looking for any relationship, had one that was 35 years younger than me and was very money hungry and loved teen boys. Learned my lesson. So, started dating women my age again, they were searching for financial stability and displayed no emotion whatsoever.

Now alone and very happy. Just don’t know how long I can handle that. Young girls don’t turn me on and don’t feel like teaching them the fine art of love.

I arrive @ home normally 2 hrs before the GF during the week.  For years the child decided she wanted to be a baker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have cleaned and cleaned up the mess for the last time.  I would tell my GF that it would be great it she could have her little baker try to do some cleanup but no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn&amp;#39;t bother the GF because like a jerk i cleaned it, still complained and untimely i was the bad guy because of complaining, personally i feel that both of them treated me with absolutely no respect all those years.  anyone??  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The in 2020 we both had the silent treatment from the young&amp;#39;in  for about 1.5 months because she wanted to run away with the daddy who was never available every.  he is now the hero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize it terribly had for the child and honestly my heart breaks for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the Toxic X i have not done any &amp;quot;parenting&amp;quot; because it was not my place and deferred it to the mom.,  who just ignored any of my gripes annoyances.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A manipulation game she loved was to always do a victim reversal .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by the 3rd time i complain about the mess (i brought to her attn:) and she did nothing to address it. Now I&amp;#39;m attacking her the GF!!  What?  its your kid the mess is your responsibility.  Im not talking about a little mess.  this is a full dishwasher full of mess that would just been left any ware, full kitchen wipe down a big disaster.  almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were in my shoes how would that make you feel??  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then before Easter 2020 my GF made up another fake issue with me as an excuse to leave for almost 2 weeks.  Well it was all set up because the 2 weeks was about the time her child would be at daddies during the initial covid shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I text her easter to say happy e and ask how she is.  We didn&amp;#39;t breakup she just left to her office well that what she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comes back is acting 100% against me.  and in conversation a slip of mouth comes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;well other people are interested in me&amp;quot;  my instant thought was shes with someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would u feel if that was said to U   ???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we were intimate about a month after but it was different than its been for 9 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets just say my car had a lot more room for some reason in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hadn&amp;#39;t been intimate in 5 months shouldn&amp;#39;t it be tighter for no use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well i pointed it would and she didn&amp;#39;t even respond.  hu cheating ya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also had very different/new intimate body positions ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No to mention always just wanting to go out and see her &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t have any before all of a sudden she has this massive social life and tells me i have been holding her from it.  never nerver she did anything she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think the changes are that she is cheating????

He lost his mother to cancer when he was a teenager and his father died suddenly 6 years ago. He's an only child and doesn't seem to have close friends. He only revealed a few days ago that he never had a relationship last longer than 4-5 months (that's when he suddenly feels ambivalent). He says that he really really likes me, wants to see what our lives are like in a year, has so much fun with me etc. We're otherwise very compatible and have the important things in common (re: marriage, kids, life goals, etc.). We haven't had any issues until recently due to this fear.

A disclaimer: I am in no way confused and not looking for advice, but rather needing to point on the behavior and challenging us to do a little better.  


When we get to the point we exchange personal phone numbers, I'm going to still need you to respect my personal time. Por ejemplo:  


* When I give you my personal number (or a Burner number, because I ain't no type of fool), this means that you will text me at an appropriate time of day. I'm steadily noticing a tend of new matches (and messages from those new matches) coming in between 5 am and 7 am in the morning. Now, I'm grown enough of a woman to understand why this occurs. I know what thoughts and desires run through a man's head when he first wakes. And, I realize what his testosterone is likely boiling as yawns, awakens, and picks up his phone to swipe on pretty faces. And, that's well and good.   
However, if we've chatted and I've given you my phone number to continue our chat off of the app, and you feel 6:00 am is a good time to text me good morning on my personal number and share exciting musings and conversation about our continued communication, that's gonna be a no from me dawg. I'm getting my last moments of sleep. Or, I'm roaming around the house in a zombie-like state and am in no mood to connect with you and your desirous ruminations

And, while some of us are able and comfortable to turn our phones completely off to avoid notifications, some of us have children or aging parents for which we must have access to communications coming in at all times. So, let's keep that texts for respectable texting times.  


* If I happen to be awake at 2am or 4am or 6am and on the app, that's MY TIME. My little green light means I am utilizing the app. If you see me online, say to yourself ""Hey! I have her personal phone number! Lemme hit her up!"" and text me ""I saw you were online. Hi!!!!"" you're infringing on MY PERSONAL TIME.   
If I am on the app, this means I want to be ON THE APP. This does not mean that I want to take my attention, time, or conversation away from the app that I am currently on to split my time between different software or devices to talk to you. I did not give you my number to have you look for and stalk my online time and attempt to dominate it. Realize I may very well be talking to other people and don't take my green app light as a green text light. You're welcome to text me, but respect that I may not respond until I am free or want to.
* &amp;#x200B;
* Finally, if you text me at 5 am or 6 am habitually before we are scheduled to meet, don't get angry, upset, or insulting when you don't understand why I cancel that meet. Your lack of personal boundaries in text alone shows me you will have issues with personal boundaries in a dating relationship.  


tl;dr - don't stalk me on the app and text me when I'm online. And, don't ever text me during early dawn hours before I'm even awake.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,44330,public,self,My Time is MY TIME,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mme8wz/my_time_is_my_time/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then she says she wants to take us out for lunch or dinner so she can meet me.

I tell not now maybe later....kind of not interested in meeting his ex....that kind of thing.

Couple months later and she is asking again to take us out. 

My split was horrible and I never want any of my SOs to deal with him, so I don't know if this is normal behavior or what.

Their split was friendly but she is toxic...heavy drinking and gambling. 

Its kinda creepy ...she has said if it makes me uncomfortable then she understands...but she keeps bringing it up.
