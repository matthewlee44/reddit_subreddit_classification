We talked for hours, had so much in common in terms of life and what we wanted to do, and even had similar music tastes. And to put the cherry on top she asked if she could kiss me before she left after the first date, and we made out after the 2nd date before she left.

But after she left last weekend she texted me that she enjoyed the dinner and had a great night and said maybe we can do something next week. I responded by telling her that we should totally do something next week and that I could cook her dinner again or we could go out to the mall and do some stuff there to spice things up.

I sent that text on Friday and she never responded to it which was a little odd to me, but I didn't really pay it any attention because of how well things were going. I didn't even fathom the possibility that she could be ghosting me. I sent her another text today (so 5 days later) asking her if she still wants to do something this weekend, and that I'm free Friday if she is. It's been hours since I sent that text and I'm doubtful that she's going to respond at all, because of how frequent she's responded to my texts before.

Why would somebody go ghost after seeming so interested in you and even asking to kiss you? There was not a second of awkwardness or anything, or any sign that she might be feeling indifferent. Like I would understand it if you made your intentions known that you wanted to be casual, but she came off as very ""I want to get to know YOU better specifically"". I'm just confused and kind of hurt if she does wind up ghosting me because we both really clicked together.

I went to a great university, work as a security engineer, have my own car and apartment. In my spare time I love playing guitar, going to concerts, working out, trying out new cocktail bars/restaurants, reading, and cooking. Although I'm a bit more on the introverted side, I can be socially outgoing and make friends with just about anyone. I'm laid back and easy to talk to, generally goofy but can still be taken seriously. I'm nice but not a pushover, and am generally direct about expressing what I want. Don't sugarcoat or beat around the bush in my conversations. And yes, I'm physically fit/get frequent haircuts/maintain my hygiene/etc. According to my guy friends (lol) I'm a good looking dude, and I can't think of anything else that could possibly improve my appearance.

  

I've been in a long term relationship before, haven't had issues with random hook-ups, but I'm looking for a serious relationship currently. Dating apps have been largely a waste of time. Despite getting a decent number of matches, most women don't respond to my messages, or we have a great conversation and they flake when I ask them out on dates. I've gone out on a few dates with women in their late 20's, but they made it clear they weren't looking for anything serious or were unsure about what they were looking for. There were a \*few\* women I felt like I had really great chemistry with, but they ghosted me after the first date. Really confusing especially when I thought the date went well.

  

I started going to meetups. Its mostly full of men, and they all hover near the handful amount of women that show up. I befriended a few and they mentioned that they generally avoid even activity based meetups because so many desperately single guys constantly hit them, when they're just trying to enjoy themselves. So I don't try to flirt with anyone at these events because I don't want to make them uncomfortable. Bars and clubs...well nobody is looking for a long term relationship there. Random social events in public places? Hard to come by given the pandemic.

  

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, or what I could do better. I have a good job, fulfilling hobbies, friends that I go out with all the time. I think I'm fairly interesting to talk to.

Now, my parents aren’t part of the KKK or anything, but they are quite ignorant about people who aren’t white. They are “All Lives Matter” people, think affirmative action is unfair, they have no sympathy for refugees from Latin America, they give money to missionaries in developing countries, etc. They aren’t Trump supporters, but they’re firmly Establishment Republican. I hope that communicates where they are with regards to racism. I have spoken with them a few times about their opinions, but they have remained unchanged. 

I’m sure that my parents would come to accept and love whoever I chose to date or marry, but I know it doesn’t feel good to be loved *despite* a part of your identity. I feel like if I dated a Black man, he’d have to be like Carlton from Fresh Prince for my parents to accept him as my partner immediately, and not *in spite of* his skin color. 

So, do I just avoid Black and Latino men entirely? If they make the first move, do I tell them that they’re very charming, but the circumstances aren’t right for us to be more than friends? Do I just bring it up on the first date?

So I’ve (23F) been seeing this guy (23M) for about two months now. We first met at a bar when I approached him (something I never do) and we vibed super well and we ended up hooking up that night (v nice). Ever since then we’ve been hanging out about once a week, and we usually end up making dinner together, playing games, or drinking with each other’s friends, and just recently we went on a very standard “date” date where we got dinner and drinks at a nice place and he paid for errything. 

Important to note that every time we see each other we have sex. Like it’s very much implied that it’s going to happen, and it’s always v good and we have super good chemistry and he’s shown a lot of interest in my needs in that regard. 

He’s super sweet/very genuine and we have fun together, but we’re definitely very different people in terms of work goals and how we interact with the world lol. We both are fun-loving/goofy types but he’s very carefree, spontaneous, high spirited, while I’m more grounded and do a lot of overthinking before acting. Because of this I feel like we could kind of balance each other out and learn from each other in light of these differences, but it could also definitely be challenging at times.

 We’ve never talked about what we are or where things stand though. He also isn’t much of a proficient texter, he’s very much a former flip phone owner and texting isn’t his strong suit which I don’t super mind. We mostly text to check in and/or make plans to see each other. 

The one downfall is that he def has some unhealthy habits with alcohol which is definitely concerning to me, and I know that could be a v slippery slope. My thing is I have feelings for him, and i would definitely feel some type of way if he was hooking up with someone else. However I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship, especially given the aforementioned habits. I kind of just like casually “dating” him if that’s what we’re doing? I’m planning to discuss our situation with him because I need more clarity on what he sees it as/wants and hopefully that can help me clear up where I see things going.

I'm 25/m, good looking, take care of myself, hobbies, friends, witty, loyal, intelligent, hardworking, have a good job, goals, good values....

Yet I can't seem to make something work romantically with someone. which is fine, I realize i'm not for everyone and that's okay. I'm just a little defeated and frustrated right now and I wanted to vent to people who may help me feel not so alone.

A year long relationship just ended a few months ago for me. It was hard, but necessary. All we ever did was fight, I'm convinced I was never what she really wanted anyway. A lot of her grievances with me were focused around, essentially, me not being what she wanted. ""my exes would do xyz and it was never a problem, what is wrong with you?"" boundary-less, I was on a pedestal at the same time, and she was also very chronically ill (which is fine!) but all these combinations ended up in a breakup.

Recently I met someone who I really liked, I swear she was everything I am looking for in a serious relationship PLUS all the things I ""wish"" for in a serious partner. Very cute, hard-worker, nurse, my age, same sense of humor, also a stoner, intelligent, introverted, in a very similar ""spot"" in life as me. wanted a serious relationship, and knew exactly what she wanted. I let myself fall into being infatuated with this woman, I was very excited about her and it has been legit years since I have felt like that. Almost like a middle school crush. Anyways, we've been talking for a couple weeks and we had our first date on Monday. I think it went really well, I could feel strong chemistry. we laughed, had drinks, shared our stories, hours went by and it felt like no time had passed. I walked her back to her car, we hugged and said goodnight, lets do it again sometime, etc. 

We've been texting since then and things were still going good, I brought up a second date. I planned a cute fun activity based date for us, was going to pick her up and get flowers. From what she said her previous relationships were with emotionally unavailable men, so I really wanted to show her what it's like to be treated ""right"". I wanted this woman, I wanted to get to know everything about her! 

Unfortunately, she did not feel the same about our first date. She mentioned she felt like she was the only one talking and didn't ""match well"" with my personality. I'm not sure which date she was on. she did a lot of talking, but I did ask all the questions to get to know her better and keep the conversation flowing naturally. I thought it was a 50/50 split of the amount of talking. I guess she didn't find me physically attractive? That's fine too. I realize I'm not for everyone and that's fine. not the first woman to reject me, and won't be the last. I wished her best on her search for what she is looking for and she did the same.

I just wish something would work. I would love to start building a life with someone. I guess I need to go back to focusing on building my life alone. But damn. I really wanted to spend my mid 20's with someone...get married, have kids, buy a house together. I know these are stressors and big changes, but fuck me I want it. At least let me start working towards it with someone that actually wants me for who I am and doesn't try to guilt trip me or shame me into being what they want.

But for some reason I just can't find anyone. In these years I met:

\-woman with the mentality ""you have to pay everything until I die"" so obviously no

\-woman that were totally ""into me"" that literally jumped on me, sleep with me, made plans, ecc and after 4-5 dates (it's always the same number) they ghost me. I mean, why? I understand if at the first date she's not convinced and ok, but after all of that I think it's really strange.

\-woman that are not exactly ""pretty"" that look at me like I was an homeless, saying immediately at the first date that are not interested. Not that I judge the appearance (I went out with them) but I can see in there eyes ""oh how this guy think to have a chance"". 

I really don't understand because my last girlfriend literally was participating at national beauty contests (again, not that I look for that but I'm trying to understand my ""position"" in the eyes of other people) and both my ex-girlfriend had a 5 years relationship with me so I'm not the worst character in the world I think.

But after them, nothing. Obviously now is even worse because my social circle is becoming smaller every year and even more important all my friends just do things between us (dinners at someone house, maybe a quick trip somewhere, ecc), nothing that involved meeting other people.

She texted me about hw a lot and i asked her a couple questions about her to try to further the convo but she always responded super slow, hour or 2, sometimes more. sometimes really quick responses though. Throughout the class I would catch her staring me a lot, like 5 or 6 times per class (1 hour long). One day she switched seats in class to sit next to me which was cool, but then when i sat next to her during the next class i felt this strange uncomfortable vibe and noticed that a lot of her friends (male and female) kept looking over at me in a weird way.  ​There was a party with some class members and I asked her if she was going, and she wasn't til she found out I was gonna go. I asked her to meet up beforehand but she said she couldn't, then texted me to ask what time I was going. She then texted me that she would see me soon, that she was on the way with a smiley face (hadn't used those before in text). At the party she started pointing out a few guys i had seen her with and explaining they were her ""best friends"". While we were talking at the party, she decided to leave but then texted me later that night to apologize for leaving early. 

I'm always too shy to ask anyone out in school cause I run into them all the time but I felt strong chemistry with her and a lot of signals so I asked her out. She said yes but then when we went to get food it got messed up because other class members tagged along and she kind of allowed it or at least tried to hide that were going together. It was too awkward for me to stop the others from coming along. At this event she still talked to me a lot but was slightly more distant than usual which I thought could be some immature thing where she's hiding her interest from her friends. After a couple days I asked her if she would be interested in going out again over the weekend. She replied after a day and a half saying it was a super busy weekend and she was sick now, but didn't suggest another time so I just wished her well and dropped it. 

I didn't see her for a few days but saw her in class 2 days ago. This time it was kind of a double thing where there was the class, but a group meeting with class members before it. I planned on feeling it out and just  acting like nothing happened.first of all, she came in dressed up 10x fancier than usual (usually very casual, almost sloppy but not really sloppy). I greeted her right off the bat just to avoid any potential awkwardness. After a few minutes she started asking me some questions and joking around with me. Throughout this meeting I caught her looking at me a few times as well. Then, during the class, I said a couple things to people that weren't even funny really and she started cracking up/repeating what I said. Then she literally stared at me for the entire hour, from every angle I was at including uncomfortable ones. Like we were sitting in the same row, but on other sides of the room, and her head was turned completely sideways toward me for almost 30 seconds. I looked over and smiled when we made eye contact and turned back and I could tell she kept looking. 

After class there was another get together that I heard rumors of so I asked our group about it over text. She was the one to reply and invite me to it. Then I guess no one followed through and it was cancelled and she texted me to let me know and sent some more smiley faces and stuff saying she'd keep me updated.

I felt as though she rejected me, or at least didnt appear to be reciprocating interest, but am I wrong? Is she just toying with me and seeing if I'll ask her again? I would consider asking her if she wants to hang out sometime when I see her in person if we're having a long conversation alone. But other than that I really don't feel like pursuing it any further cause it's making me feel like a creep to ask so many times. I don't like the idea of ""chasing"" someone, and don't really believe women want that anyways. It's creepy to me. I want people to know I can take no for an answer and still be friendly/not dramatic, but I also don't want to miss out because I really do like this girl, assuming she's not playing games with me. 

TL;DR I felt rejected but then the same girl stared at me even more than usual, was pretty friendly, and invited me to some group events again. I don't know how to proceed because she's making me do so much work (assuming shes interested) that I'm gonna feel too pushy ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161133,public,self,I felt rejected or at least not reciprocated but now I don't know what to do.

I have never seriously dated anyone. I've had anxiety issues ever since I came out of the wound. It's gotten better over the years. It's not completely debilitating, I can go to the doctor alone and hold a job (retail lol), but I am most definitely a socially awkward dude. It also doesn't help that I'm actually a decent-looking person. Women will occasionally show interest in me but I just ignore it. 

Why do I ignore it? After doing some deep self-reflection I think it's because I have convinced myself that I am not good boyfriend material. At least not at the moment.

I'm a depressed, socially awkward, 24-year-old retail worker with no degree that lives at home with his parents. If I wanted to move out I could but I'd STRUGGLE haha. I live in an expensive ass state.

Every now and then my parents will bring up dating to me and say things like...

""wHaT aBoUt HaiLeY? sHEs cUtE."" ""haVe yoU tRieD onLine DaTinG?""

and it bothers me. I usually do my best to steer the conversation in a different direction.

I honestly don't think I want to start dating someone until I have established myself a little more. Is that a reasonable thing to say? 

I recently began a new journey and I'm learning new skills that I hope to turn into a career one day. I don't have a degree so I'm having to get creative. Might start taking some specialized classes. I might be working crap jobs though for another two years.

This is where I question my whole ""no dating until I have a more established life"" thing. Two years is a long time. I worry about losing friends because I'll be single. Like they'll think I'm weird because I want to be single even if I have a reason. 

I just have a hard time thinking that anyone would want to date me in the current state I'm in. Like if my friends wanted to set me up how would that go haha. ""Here's my friend, he's a forklift driver with no degree and lives with his parents.""

I met him OLD (on Hinge) and am definitely interested in getting to know him better. However, he is now the second guy I've met up with that I met on a dating app that has *never* had a serious relationship (lasting 1+ years) *or* lived with anyone. What is up with that? 

28M said he was open to a relationship but hasn't met anyone that he likes enough (and there have been times in his life where dating was not a priority for him). While talking more, he indicated that he has dated a lot of women (both casually and exclusively) and my impression was that he was almost always the ""dumper"" in the situation, although I could be wrong, and ALWAYS in under a year. 

FWIW, w/o knowing much about his romantic history, I had a gut feeling that he might lean more towards the avoidant end of the spectrum (for those who are familiar with attachment styles). 

If someone has a pattern of losing interest when things become too intense or the need for commitment arises, I don't want to date that person. But w/o grilling this guy on his patterns of behavior in romantic relationships, which I have absolutely no desire to do/would be way too aggressive, the only way to find out more is to get to know him better over time. So here I am asking Reddit even though I know that no one can tell me what I want to know except for him. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Generally speaking, is this common (or perhaps only common on OLD)? Has anyone dated someone with a similar romantic history (good or bad)? Am I overthinking this or is it a legitimate concern/red flag?

He also seemed to despise the idea of marriage just because his engagement I guess was pretty bad.

I cut him off because I wanted something serious if I was going to be seeing someone. That and the fact that he didn’t see me as a serious partner really destroyed my self esteem. I was crying all the time and just didn’t feel like I was enough for anyone and would never be enough. 

Anyways a few months down the road I very much miss having him in my life. I really liked all the small things we had in common and how he treated me. Other than for the non commitment thing. (That crushed the small amount of self worth I had). 

Should I reach out to him? The way I ended things wasn’t the smoothest. I told him I wanted to cut contact completely. He reached out a week or two later and asked how so was doing he was just checking up. I told him to never contact me again and if he does I’ll block him.

3 weeks go by. finally i reach out asking if i can pick up my book. Shes baffled. Asks why. I said i hadnt seem her in nearly 2 months. Didnt think she was interested anymore.

I’m sure this has been asked in a similar way before, but I didn’t know exactly how to word it.

I work for a pretty large organization and there’s this girl that works on the same floor (but different department) that I have a pretty big crush on. We do know eachother and have talked before, but we’re on opposite sides of the floor. We run into eachother maybe once every other month at most. Plus, I think she works remote a few days a week, so that doesn’t help. From the interactions I’ve had with her she is warm, friendly, talkative, and pretty. As far as I know, she is single.

I am friends with her on Facebook and we follow eachother on Instagram. However, she barely posts. I think the last time she posted something was a picture of her cats in September. Even though she doesn’t post, she is online pretty much every day consistently.

My question is, seeing as how we barely see eachother and she barely posts on social media, how can I reach out to her without coming across as completely random and weird? I’d definitely want to take it easy and not rush into asking her out right off the bat, but how do I get a conversation started? She liked a picture of my cat I posted over the weekend. Is that a good starting point? 😹 I’m just at a loss of how to start.

General, funny, preferences, etc.

The topic of oral came up and we were being funny talking about sizes, smells, etc. It was all in good nature. Someone made a joke about how it’s only a matter of time before a girl gets cheated on if she doesn’t give head. Albeit a little crass, it was definitely just a joke and everybody laughed.

However she brought up “Would any of you leave someone if they didn’t want to give you head?” All the other guys in the group said no, but I said yes and I meant it. She then started asking me these scenarios like “would you leave even if it was because head grossed her out/what if she has trauma from it?” To which I still said yes.

I could tell she was starting to get a little heated and she said “it’s crazy to me that a sex act is a deal breaker.” And then started saying things like “oh you like anal Blakakke69? Well I don’t so we should stop seeing each other even though we really like each other because I don’t want to take it in the ass.” Sort of mocking my point of view.

To which I said “I would never go that deep into a relationship without figuring out what is off the table as far as sex goes so your point isn’t valid.”

I also said “What does it matter if the deal breaker is something you don’t agree with? It’s not yours to worry about. Some people only date tall, some people only date curvy, I only date someone who’s willing to give head. If they’re not willing to give it, I move along. Simple. I’m not saying they have to suck me off every day against their will. It just can’t be off the table. Why would I want to date someone who doesn’t want to do something I really enjoy sexually and vice versa? Also you’re not dating me so why are you getting mad?”

To which she responded “Then you should tell people that upfront on the first date.”

I retorted “If it comes up in a deal breaker convo I do tell them. You’re getting really heated over a hypothetical.”

She didn’t like that and just dropped it. She was kind of checked out for the rest of the convo.

Granted I probably could have handled that better, but come on.

It would be like if a girl loved pegging. If I’m not into it and it’s her favorite thing to do and she’s not willing to not do it, we see other people. It would be wrong for her to insist I do it for her even when I told her no, and it would be wrong for me to expect her to curb her kink just for me.

People have dating preferences. I don’t understand why I’m the bad guy for mine.

I would like to say that I was so insanely shocked at how many responses I got (over 200 wow!) and I read each and every one and really took what you all had to say to heart (especially the part about formatting paragraphs lol). 

So I met up with N and essentially told him everything. I told him how hurt I was by our whole situation (including our failed attempts at a relationship and his ongoing passive aggressive comments), how much I missed our friendship more than anything, and how it broke my heart to see how our relationship has devolved. I also explained to him how his actions were affecting me and my mental health and eventually the way I acted around him, and that I was sorry for the part I contributed to this by not speaking up sooner and for anything I may have done/said that hurt him.

As we were talking, I realized it really wasn't about romantic interest in him anymore for me but rather I just wanted to make peace with the past and get my friend back. I felt like it was a sin that two super compatible friends let their insecurities/inability to speak up ruin this friendship for the last few years.

Surprisingly, he was incredibly receptive!! He gave me the space and time and attention to vocalize what I needed to vocalize. He apologized profusely. He said sorry that he has been a horrible friend and taking out his issues on me, he said he is sorry for all the missed opportunities and time we wasted, and he said he is sorry that he vocalized his interest in me at a time that wasn't right for either of us. He also said he knew he messed up but that he does love and care about me. We ended on a positive note with a commitment to move forward as friends in a much more healthy manner - without tension, passive aggressiveness and resentment. I am happy with this resolution and feel like now that I have said everything I needed to say - I can finally move on.

I'm 27 and I've never been in a intimate relationship. 
Some brief history of attempts: 
 - [(my age) girl: story]
 - (20-22yo) Engineering Girl: I was an ECE major in college and she was one of like 3 girls in the program. She was also my only real friend in college. We met during a semester long group assignment. And after 1 more semester of classes with her. I fell in love. Not just attracted to, but deep care. The following semester (so ~9 months after we met, i was going to tell her how i felt, but who fixing some code on her computer, i saw texts from another guy. And was obviously distraught, and then later I told her how i felt about her because i thought maybe she would choose me. But she met the guy over the summer and said she really loved him). 

- (22-24yo) Liberal Arts girl: My last semester of college (while i was still kind of depressed about engineering girl), i met a girl in one of my language classes. And we instantly vibed. We had the same sense of humor and taste in music. She was like my dream girl. She kind of saved my life and pulled me out of depression. I really needed a friend and after we graduated she and I were both unemployed so we hung out a fair bit. I really wanted to date her but she was hooking up with another guy, and honestly i really didn't want to lose her as a friend so i didn't let her know that i was into her. Then she started teaching abroad and called me saying that she broke up with her boyfriend and started dating this other guy lmao. I told her i was happy for her and also how i felt about us. But she said, ""she was too caught up in that last relationship to notice"".

- (24-26yo) Downloaded the apps (terrible move): In 2+ years on the apps, I've averaged like 2 matches a month. Then i also started paying for them, but still 2 matches a month. Most of the time, I'll get ghosted immediately (as in no reply to the first message -which is not ""hey""or anything like that. I usually take my time to craft a thoughtful/cheeky message based on her bio/photos). I've so been stood up 3 times. Girls have cancelled plans on me a day before our date a few times. 2 dates i went on were actually great, and i thought we both got along really well. One i took candle making cause she was artsy, and the other a really fancy dinner. And at the end of dates we agreed for a second one. But then both times they backed out over text. Because ""personal"" things came up. I have gone on like 4 more dates but each of those either the person didn't look like their photos or I just didn't enjoy their company.  And i know reading this you might think I'm either picky or ugly. But I'm really not, and hopefully i don't sound like an ass. They are all great girls but i just wasn't as attracted to them so i didn't want to waste their time. And i think it would be emotionally manipulative to them. My only real standards on the app before getting to really know someone is: smiling, not conservative, and not obese. (Plz don't say I'm fat shaming. I'm not, i believe you can do whatever you want. But I'm not attracted to unhealthy lifestyles). 

 - (27) Therapist: started seeing a therapist to vent my frustrations with dating and help resolve my bitterness. She was great and got me to understand acceptance and gratitude along with Dr. K (healthy gamer, and Jordan Peterson - i know he's like excommunicated at this point but i think he's still a smart guy with a vast amount knowledge even if i don't agree with all of it). Anyways! After like 4 months of sessions, she told me she liked/loved me! And at first i was dumbstruck, but then i agreed to meet her IRL and she seemed super happy. But the next day she said it was unprofessional and she couldn't risk her job. I understood and said, i was willing to stop seeing her professionally so we could just hangout as friends and date. But then she literally moved to another state lmao. 

 - (27) Coworker: i had heard she broke up with her boyfriend who also worked at the company (but he quit later). And we hung out at some small gatherings with mutual coworker friends. I threw a party at my place, and went golfing with her. I was scared to risk anything because we worked together. But also thought she was cute and last weekend we went to a concert and i had the best night I'd had in a while. We laughed the whole night and she even said, ""you just made my night"". Some random dude at a bar were at also hit on her and she gave him her number but she said she thought he was gay lol. But at that time, i thought i should wait any longer to get to know her better. So at the end of the night, i shot my shot and asked if she was seeing someone and she said she was. RIP me lol.

The date went pretty much perfectly on my end. I was physically attracted to him (and that attraction just increased the more we spoke), and we just had a great connection: there was tons to talk about, banter, and he was incredibly sweet, attentive and respectful. I expected the date to only last about an hour max (we went for coffee), but it ended up lasting almost three hours, and only ended because I had to go to my mom’s for dinner. He texted me after the date saying it was nice to meet me and that he wants to see me again, and we arranged a second date for next Friday (he has an extremely busy job so unfortunately that was the soonest time he could do). We have been texting regularly every day since the date, and over half the time it’s him initiating the conversations.

However, in spite of all of this, I’m still not convinced that he’s actually attracted to me. The thing is, most of the time when I talk to guys on dating apps (before meeting, when it’s still online) they shower me with compliments, and those compliments are usually related to my appearance. However, this guy has only complimented me a small handful of times, and none of those compliments were related to my appearance. Also, during the date, he didn’t make eye contact with me often, he spent a lot of the time looking in the corner or down at his lap/feet. Surely if a guy is interested in a girl, he’ll be making intense eye contact with her? We did have a lot of jokey banter which could be interpreted as flirty, but that might just be how his sense of humour is. The only thing he did which was outright flirtatious (well according to my sister anyway, I’m still dubious) is that at one point we were talking about genetics in my families and I mentioned that my sister and brother and I all have different eye colours. He then asked me if I could lean closer so he could take a look at my eye colour. I was like “they’re super dark” and he was like “oh wow they are, but I read an article that says dark eyes are a sign of beauty”. But he wasn’t actually calling me beautiful, just making a general statement.

So yeah, to sum it up, I’m scared that he isn’t actually attracted to me but rather he just thinks I’m a cool and interesting person, and he only wants to meet up again because he views me as a potential new friend. Don’t get me wrong though, on the one hand I really appreciate the fact that he seems to actually like me as a person and care about what I have to say, but having that confirmation that he actually is attracted to me would be great too. At the end of the day, now matter how great our mental connection was, I’m dating to look for a partner, not a friend.

I’d like to add that due to many many years of rejection and a lack of attention from guys, I have very low self-esteem when it comes to my appearance (just take a quick scroll through my post history and you’ll know what I mean lmao). As a result of that I still struggle to be able to fathom that someone could actually find me attractive. So perhaps it’s possible that my insecurities are clouding my thoughts in this situation. But I would appreciate some honest opinions please! So far I really like this guy, and I’d like for it to go somewhere. I haven’t felt this intensely about someone in years.

One relationship lasted two years and I noticed he never brought his GF around as the plus-one to weddings, reunions or group trips. He didn't even mention her to us. He left his GF back home and the ""other girl"" would be attending these fun social trips with us. She lived in a different state, so she took a different flight from him in order to meet up.
