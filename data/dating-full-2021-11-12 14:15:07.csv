For the most part, I go out with men my own age/slightly older.

Over Halloween weekend, I met this guy in his 40s who was a doctor visiting my city. I really enjoyed his company and spending time with him, even if I ultimately thought he was too old for me to seriously date. We didn’t do anything physical, just kissed.

But because he was in another city, I kept communication lines open, because I thought he was fun to talk to. 

However, some weird stuff started to happen. On our date, he asked me if I had had lip filler (I do not) or breast implants (also no.) We were talking about plastic surgery, which is super common where he’s from, so I didn’t think anything of this.

After we kissed, he told me how surprised he was that I was a skilled kisser, because I apparently look very conservative and am too “smart” to be skilled at it. Weird, but he is from a different generation.

Then, he leaves, and we talk over message. He tells me he’s going on a date with a 23-year-old who wants a sugar daddy, and I was like WTF, weird, do whatever you want! He then goes on the date and tells me all about how dumb she is.

He sends me a photo of her, and she is super hot, but isn’t someone I feel jealous of, because we look super different. She is trashy hot?? I think 10/10 guys would fuck her, but I wouldn’t want to look like her? I’ve always had more of a girl next door look??

I don’t tell him this, just talk about something else. He tells me he’s breaking up with me. I say we weren’t in a relationship?? 

Then, I mention that I could never be a sugar baby. He tells me I’m too old for it. 

He said a lot of other negative things, like that I dress in a way that hides my body and I should play dumb more.

He MAINLY dates women his own age, also, based on his relationship history??? His last relationship was with someone much closer to his age than me?

Last week I worked as a graveyard worker with a friend of mine  who I worked with this summer at the same place. She started by asking me through text if we should apply this particular week since we had a week off from school (we’re not in the same class). 

So we applied and we both got the job. The week was fantastic, we kept great contact and we bonded like crazy. We both opened up to each other, had a lot of fun and almost always smiled and laughed when near each other. We teased each other and we both expressed that we wanted to get the same assignments so we could be near each other. We had some recurring inside jokes as well

On friday night, after our last work day, we kept texting through snapchat, and both of us seemed equally willing to start up a conversation. She even sent me some semi-revealing pictures. 

Day after, saturday, I asked if it would be okay if I asked her out some time, upon which she replied: ”Yes absolutely, I’ll get back to you when I’m free. Have a lot coming up”.

Sunday, I couldn’t hold it in and asked her if she is free the coming week. She replied ”hmm no sorry”. I texted back that we’ll be in touch when it works. 

Since then I haven’t heard from her at all, and during the school week there has been some very short instances when we have had eye contact, but nothing else. Although I noticed once that she was looking for me when she saw my friend group, then shied away when I saw her.

I have been thinking about this of course, and thought that I maybe took the first step a little too early, even though she seemed into it as well. Asking if she was free during the week when she had already told me she has a lot coming up was probably not a good idea. Other than that I can’t think of anything I might have done to cause this. 

I don’t think I can express how good of a time I had with her that week at work, and I have every reason to believe that the feeling is mutual, or at least that it was a couple of days ago. 

So my question is what do I do? I haven’t contacted her since sunday, since I thought it best to give it some time. It doesn’t seem wise to ask her if she’s free the next week, might come out as too needy I think. Should I maybe try to strike up a conversation, perhaps with an inside joke, ask her out again, or do you think she’s just lost interest?

I’ve done some deep research on previous reddit posts regarding this topic and I’ve done all the things people suggest, such as being openly flirty and light teasing, and actually expressing your interest. One thing I do notice is that I’m really not emotional and bad at opening up; so for example if someone is doing something that bothers me I won’t open up and communicate which can hinder a real connection.

I’ve asked 3 people to describe me and they all said a variation of: really chill, friendly, and nice.

I’m mildly successful, have my own business, know when to cut my losses with chicks and definitely don’t go overboard lovebombing them after first dates.

This monday everything seemed fine, we chatted a bit about an investment i was planning on making, and in the morning on tuesday i asked how she was doing. (she had a bit of a back injury a couple weeks back) tuesday goes by, wednesday goes by and no response. 

On wednesday evening i follow up on that question asking if everything is allright cuz she did't reply at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

She replies quite fast now, saying ""yeah, evering is fine, why do you ask""

I say that i havent heard from her in a while and find that weird.

now on friday evening as i write this, she still hasn't replied to that, while being online numerous times (I dont check that often cuz i don't wanne be that guy but i couldn't help myself)

So right now i'm thinking she started to ghost me, and as i am writing this i can see that my conclusion might be a bit fast, but it's never been like this before.

I’ve recently been forcing myself out of my comfort zone to get out more and interact with people. Slowly but surely I feel like I’m becoming somewhat normal. I think my anxiety is forever a part of me, but I’ve learned to give it the respect it requires meaning I’ve been taking the time to understand it and confront it. I’ve been figuring out how to identity when my thoughts are irrational which has been my biggest problem so far. All my anxious thoughts have been so prominent that even though I knew I had anxiety, I could never internalize the fact that my thoughts were in fact not representative of reality. As a result of my issues, I’ve had a hard time meeting people and opening up to them. My dating life has been completely empty for the last several years as a result. 

I’ve been toying with asking this girl out for the longest time, but I’ve been continually talking myself out of it. I’ve been really shy around her, so I felt like because I probably made a bad impression, there’s be no point in trying. I also didn’t know whether she was single or not, so of course I tell myself it’s not worth it to even ask her out. Then I tell myself she’s so gorgeous, so many other guys must be after her and she’s definitely not be into me if that were the case. She also lives in my building, so the last thing I’ve been telling myself is that if she’s not interested it will be awkward for her to have to see me around. While I don’t have any real signs she’s interested in me, I don’t care anymore. I’ve realized all of these things are ridiculous and irrational and I’m just holding myself back.

I finally feel like I have the confidence to do it, so I’m going to. I’m so excited. If I’m rejected it will definitely sting a bit because I’ve never really dated many people and haven’t ever really just asked some out like that. Despite that, I know taking the stride to push myself out of my comfort zone will be worth it even if I’m rejected.

I’m posting this for those who are in similar situations as me. Maybe I can inspire you a bit. I also would love to report back on how it goes, so this post will serve as a bit of an accountability mechanism.

)Ok so I know I probably don’t have much of a reason to know what I’m doing, I’m an 18 yo Man, and I’ve got problems. 

DISCLAIMER, this is mostly a romantic life, self induced drama

For context, there is college: I. Am. Miserable. Here. I’ve already come to accept that, and I’m in the process of transferring somewhere else. But I can’t handle people here. I’ve been angry and sad every night for the last week. With all of that in mind it’s become a waiting game until next semester…(spring 2022)

Now for the main event. The girl. Let’s call her S. 

I met S at one of the lowest points of my life. My grandparent, who was very close to me -being one of the only people in the world I could trust to vent to- had passed away two days before I graduated high school. I’ve never fully processed my emotions with their passing, yet. Oh well. 

S is…unlike any girl I’ve ever met before. We were coworkers at a summer camp we both worked at this summer. We get along very well, and clicked so quickly. We would constantly be near each other (when we weren’t watching kids because obviously campers first). We would roast each other in that playful way you do when you like someone. We would talk every day, and still do. We did that little thing you do when you like someone where you bump into each other “by accident” (this was not one sided, she would instigate and reciprocate, I’m not just some obsessive creep)

Now, me being the bumbling and depressed buffoon of a man I am, I asked her out back then, after maybe three weeks of this^. As I’ve said before in other posts about this, I wouldn’t be here if that went well. 

She said she couldn’t, and of course , for sake of privacy, I’m not going to go deep into why, but I will say that she said something along the lines of “I can’t handle a relationship right now because of [previous bad experience with a man]”. I didn’t really get super sad about this (probably due to the overshadowing sadness from my passed loved one). 

So I said okay. I apologized profusely and she said it’s all okay. She thanked me for being a gentleman about it rather than being an asshole. And so we went about the rest of the summer still very close to one another. Now, and the risk of sounding projecting, I want to say that I still felt an undertone of her giving out vibes of still liking me, of that makes any sense. 

Flash forward 160 something days into the present. We still talk every day, admittedly via social media because I live in an entirely different state for the time being. It’s on Snapchat, yes. I’m A teenager so I’m allowed to.  Leave me alone. -Sidebar: We use Snapchat because I asked her for her number and she told me the whole “can’t handle relationship” thing then, plus it’s nice to see her and send goofy videos to one another-. 

We’ve actually grown closer, and she’s opened up to me more about things that trouble her. We’ve had some very heartfelt conversations and know we have each other’s back. 

To say I still like her would be the understatement of the year….

*I need to clarify that I am by no means friends with her just to be more than friends, one day. Not the case. I genuinely think of her as one of the closest people in my life, who I can trust to talk to or be there for me (which I don’t have very many of because I’m one of those stoic country). *

Now. I’m moving back home (where she is) in two months. 

What do I do? I’ve asked Reddit about this before on different rslashes, and here’s what I’ve gathered from other individuals (for whom I am grateful of): I’ve heard both sides of the argument. About how I can and will be putting our current relationship at risk by confessing feelings. About how being straightforward is more valued. About how I should wait for her?

-One that stuck out to me was would I be happy if she got a boyfriend. Would I really be happy for her or jealous and upset? Could I handle watching another man (or woman, because such is today’s world) have her? The short answer is no, I wouldn’t, and I am known to spiral due to internalization of any problem, even though I would be happy for her that she found (someone else)to have be there for her-

I will say that since the passing of the summer, I’ve realized that I need to be more direct with people, since I didn’t say all I wanted to my grandparent. 

So, fellow users, what do you think? How should I go about things? Should I wait and let her come to me? Do I try again and potentially fuck up? 

Help me. Please. 

Thank you for reading this far. I hope this post finds you well and in a good place. Have a good day!

One time she decided to come close to my place and she made it feel like a favor. She is very nice as a person and really fun. She loves hanging out with me and would also want me to make a move or have sex (she didn't say it but she offered me to come to her place when I asked her for a 3rd date, we ended up just going for a walk and hanging out in the park).

I also may have f\*ck up in our first date when I suggested I pay for her cinema tickets, since I'm always the one paying for everything and I really don't like how she always assume I'm gonna pay and go sit or wait for me..

About 2 days ago I asked her to hang out again and she said that she is having dinner with her friends and that she is so busy this week and would like to postpone and that she is sorry about that. I told her to have fun but since then I didn't text her or anything. I'm guessing if she likes me and wanna hang out more she would reach out, but still no text.

We both got really drunk and she encouraged me to touch her when we were dancing. Since i got the green light i started to grab her ass and boobs and kiss her neck. When i tried to make out with her she didnt let me. This happened throughout the night and we went home pretty drunk and she kept telling me to stop fighting my feelings and to let go. I thought we would have sex that night but i passed out on the couch and she didnt see me there so she went to sleep. I didnt see her for two more days because i went away from home after that because of an already planned trip. After that when i met her she clearly hinted to me how good that night was but didnt acknowledge what happened. I couldn't stop thinking of her after that night out so in the end i just vomited out my feelings. She didnt seem to match the same feelings I have and kept on trying to push me into the friend zone but the crazy part is she still keeps sucking me into thinking that i am more than a friend at the same time because of her actions and words.

I’m an international student who moved to the US (Michigan to be precise) about two month ago for my PhD. Being single I decided to give dating apps a try.

Now the problem I have is even though I tell this people clearly on the first date that I would want a relationship( just as on my profile )it seems they are only interested in hooking up. From where I am coming from there’s really no such thing as casual sex. People will usually not have  sex with you if they don’t want a relationship with you. But from mu experience so far in the US and the things I’ve read so far on Reddit it seems things are very different here. I’m really tired of just hooking up. I really want a stable relationship.

She is smart, kind and really beautiful. I asked her out and she said she didn't feel the same way about me. This was back a few months ago!

We stayed in touch, met a few times and I feel I handled the rejection pretty maturely. I needed space which I got and I moved on. I also eventually moved to a different city. She's definitely still checks all my boxes. But I know that she's not special and I know that there definitely are a lot of girls out there like her (again something which I've started to accept only recently)! But thoughts of her do linger around, though I do agree they are less and less frequent. I know with time they'll cease all together. I've experienced this in the past and it does get better with time (insert scene from BoJack Horseman here)

However there are times when she texts me (asking how I'm doing, etc.) or replies to my stories on social media. It gets me thinking and I start dreaming (Oh the sweet realities from an alternate universe haha)! In the past I've handled this by completely shutting the person off from my life, absolutely zero contact. But I was younger back then. Given that I'm older and more mature now I want to handle it accordingly and differently. I don't feel the need to completely shut the person from my life. I have two questions here -

1. How do I approach it? But is there a way to make myself more mentally strong and robust? I want to stop spending my time thinking and dreaming! (This question is practical and constructive)
2. Why does she seem to care about me? I've been in her situation too and I make it a point to give a cold shoulder even if I do care about the person in question. I don't understand. Is it for attention? Or does she maybe have feelings too but can't accept them/is unsure/can't do anything about it?

-A match/messages screen that lets you keep better track of who you have met, her you have gotten a phone number or snap/IG from, and a place to make a note about what you thought of them. This might integrate more with other apps or your contacts. Or it might just be within the app to help you keep track of your experience over time, even after you unmatch or whatever.

-A way for you to rate users you meet based on how much they actually look like their pictures or not. And then it would help them in the algorithm if they truly look like their pictures, and hurt them in the algorithm or kick them off the platform altogether if they are massively deceptive with their pictures.

-I don’t know if this needs to be a new app, or could be integrated with an existing ones, but for people who are mostly just want to hook up, there should be a way to rate how good people are sexually. Maybe even give feedback or recommendations/reviews. E.g., “Jacob made me scream so loud I thought his neighbors were going to call the cops, but he just had too many red flags for me.”

-Similarly, for people who mostly want to have dates, I wish there was a way to rate how the other person was on a date in terms of being interesting, a good conversationalist, etc. “Jacob wasn’t physically attractive enough for me, but he was one of the most engaging guys I have ever been on a date with” or whatever.

People usually say I should wait for when I'm around 25 or something but it still doesn't change the fact that I feel very lonely  and I feel like almost every guy in my life just want to smash me and do not see me for me.

It's been happening since I was younger and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong . I'm naturally thin and curvy ,and I have a bigger chest so I understand that some guys will see me this way . But how do you get a guy to see beyond that? To value you ? 
I'm starting to hate my body and now whenever a guy talks to me I get paranoid and anxious- because most of the time it's just a physical thing and when I start talking about history or something it's like they run .
The journey from being a teenager to an adult has been hard for me . I feel like the odd one out.  I feel sometimes feel like if I don't sleep with a guy- I will lose a friend , a conversation, someone who was acting like they were interested before . And when I flat out say no some guys will get unbelievably angry at me . It has ruined my self esteem and made me a very anxious around guys because I don't feel safe or I'm on edge because I already know what's coming.
