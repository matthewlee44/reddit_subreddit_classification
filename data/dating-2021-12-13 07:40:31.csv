1,rfg7et,1639403580,I need women opinion on physique / attractiveness toward someone overweight losing weight/getting better,"So I always was the kind of guy with the mentality ""She's out of my league"" until I got with my ex which was imo out of my league, and I was overweight. Then friends started telling me that ""leagues"" aren't much of a thing as you get older. Anyways, fast forward to now, me being single not fully back on the dating life, but contemplating it. I've been grinding the gym and nutrition for the past 3 months getting in shape. I'm no where near done but sometimes I'm wondering if it's appealing for a women to get with someone that's working hard on improving themselves, to become the better version of themselves?

As a guy, I can say physique is important to a certain extent. We all want to be with someone we're physically attracted to. I know my question is kinda subjective, but still wondering. The biggest issue I have with physique right now is that dating nowdays, especially in a small town like mine, is mostly done through apps, and since the first thing you get to ""judge"" on apps is physique, well, yeah.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfg7et/i_need_women_opinion_on_physique_attractiveness/
2,rfggom,1639404337,Unmatched on bumble but good chats?,"Hey all

I was chatting to this girl on bumble, conversation going really well, even agreed to a date when we both could get around to it...  Chats were in depth and definitely seemed to be enthusiastic on both sides.

Then woke up and unmatched... Very surprised... Why does this happen? Look I know no one owes anyone anything in dating, but it's becoming very very disheartening, where your hopes go sky high then crash down... I'm guessing women can have the share of the market because there's probably more men on there, but literally when you struggle to get any dates at all in a year, I'm struggling with all of this... You can spend a lot of time investing in getting to know someone and it gets no where for seemminlgy no reason 

Id like to think I'm above average looks, hold a good conversation and have many interests...

On average we too 2 days to reply to each other, in her last message I was on day 3 where I was about to reply, but can't really see this being an issue.... 

What am I doing wrong if anything? Perhaps I need to try new things to meet women.... Its so depressing now... I'm starting cross fit soon, a hobby I like, so perhaps that will open doors to new people..

Sorry I know its a rant, but perhaps I'll get something positive from this....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfggom/unmatched_on_bumble_but_good_chats/

Now , I'm 22 male , and the range of girls is under 25 years old , I could think maybe that ,this is the trends for young people like me , and when they get older they understand what they are looking for . 
Nothing against the open relationship , but i think that it needs 2 great mature partners , a great responsibility,  and ability to deal with cheating and jealousy,  this is what most people,  expecially young people don't have , they don't have maturity to understand how could an open relationship go further ,  particularly if the things are going to be serious with marriage,  children and living together.

7,rfgs7y,1639405250,Me(27Male) her(21F) went to a date and this happened. I need help.,"So i saw this girl for the first time on my job,i sold her some things(i was wearing mask), i know her boss because he comes where i job to buy things too, so i asked him about her and about her phone number to him, he said he talked to her about me and her agreed to give me her phone number so her boss gave me her phone number.

 The next week she come over my job 3 days to buy things, she never did that so constantly(im working here since march). i sold things to her once of those 3 times she came here.(i was wearing mask again),  we were already texting each other by phone since the beggining of that week.

   The texting were few words but she always answered me fast, just twice i had to send her two messages before she replied me, the others she just replied in less than 1 minute. i was sending two messages by day during that week, so on friday i asked her if she would accept go out to meet me and just for having a conversation in person, she accepted it.

  So the day of the dating we went to another city with my car on a shopping, during the travel she asked and all the date she just asked me two things, if i was a new to the city and if i have a instagram,i sad yes to both, but i dont use instagram too much because im a person who are really off of social medias. So i talked a lot the whole dating, talking about myself, talking about some ideas i think, about why i dont like instagram and the most of social medias,asked some things about her,making some jokes,she seems being cool with me,but i was like doing all the job talking and trying to make her more confortable since the beggining and her was just there smiling and not asking anything to me unless that two first questions i mentioned.( we did all these things sitting on the lunch place of the shopping). I dont know she looked shy  because she barelly asked things to me, but few times she was interacting and laughing with the things i was talking.

  So after 1 hour she started to say she was having headaches, so i asked her if she wanted to go back home, she agreed, so i pick her to her house,during the travel i keep talking and showing concern about her headaches and we arrived to her house she get out of the car she gave me a smile and said bye so we ended up the date.

  The following week she changed her way on phone texting, she took too much time to answer me,like just once she answered me fast like before we went to the date, twice i have to send 3 messages before she texting me back. So i donst text her anymore since tuesday until friday when i asked her again if she would like to go to a date on a different place with a lot of nature, she said she couldnt because she was going to other city to visit her parents, so i said i was going to do other things to her and asked some questions about something else and she didnt replied me since saturday.

  What im thinking is that she lost interest in me because the place we went for a date she didnt liked, or she lost interest in me because she doesnt like my face at all because she just saw my real face without mask during our date or she doesnt like something i said on the date. And im wondering if her headaches were her lying to get rid of me hahahahahaha.

  I dont know if i try one last time to ask her to go on a date this weekend and if she say no i will stop trying to have something with her or i just stop it right now.

11,rfhjvl,1639407465,Is it the date worth going ?,"Hi, 
I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. It was a month ago when we matched. A month after he He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”. 

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ abc  bar in xyz location possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

I’m thinking whether it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes? I feel that it is. But I mean, I’m also shocked by the guys move as he was also just friendly with me always but would he invite me knowing all prior history if he was like really interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfhjvl/is_it_the_date_worth_going/
12,rfhmn4,1639407656,Did I ruin things between us or did he?,"Two years ago, I started talking to this guy on tinder. We had really good chemistry over text. He told me that I was really hot, and the cutest guy in town, and he was very attractive too, being a former model.

We went on a first date after a week or so of texting, going out for lunch, and it went well. He lived an hour away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd consider dating someone so soon after he got out of a two year relationship a few months before, but that there was something about me.

We made out and he held my hand for a bit as he drove me home. We made a plan for a second date and kept texting each other. He started going through some stuff, him and his family having to move unexpectedly and him trying to take out a loan to get a new house for his family, and I'd be there for him, sending encouraging texts.

He told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that no one else is as smart as me except for him, and that he might be my perfect match. I have difficulty socializing, so I've never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. No one's ever said stuff like that to me, and I was so happy to hear that this guy really likes me.

He said that he wanted to have sex on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. He said it had to be in his car, since his family was having to leave their house and I lived at home too and wasn't allowed to have potential romantic partners stay the night . And it also had to be unprotected. 

I told him that I was nervous to be penetrated since I'm a virgin, and  I wasn't sure how I felt about my first time being in a car, and he said that I just had to get over it. He eventually said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that is being in a relationship would be delayed until we had sex, because he wanted to know how good it would be. I was going to go through with it, but a few days later I thought that we wouldn't be sexually compatible, and we went our separate ways.

I've been having trouble moving on from him since it happened, going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who saw a future with me. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked if he really did like me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he said that he did really like me at first but that I ruined it.

I've been thinking about it recently and did I ruin it or did he?  It seems to me like he liked someone (me) enough to see himself spending his life with them, but it ended up not working out because he had to have unprotected sex on the second date to see if they'd be dating and wouldn't budge on that issue, even though the person he was obsessed with and falling for didn't want to do that. He said that I was pushing him away when we were initially talking, but it seems like he was pushing me away by not being able to go at a pace that I would be comfortable with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfhmn4/did_i_ruin_things_between_us_or_did_he/

Now that I'm out here navigating dating as an adult it seems like the terminology and stages I'm used to have completely shifted. 

I spent months thinking ""talking"" and ""the talking stage"" meant those few days or sometimes a week or two of chatting via text before the first meet so I was SO confused why people on social media were so upset about things ending during that stage. I just figured out people refer to dating as ""talking"" now. Like when they say talking stage they mean someone they are going on dates with but they just haven't had the exclusivity/relationship discussion yet. 

I hate this because I feel like calling dating ""talking"" is underplaying how serious and emotional dating can be. It definitely seems like some fuckboy came up with this terminology so that when he ghosted a girl he was dating he would underplay how serious it actually was by saying,  ""No we were just *talking*.""

we were together for 4 years, i ended things a year and a half ago due to lack of effort and passion from him. He was also jokingly using slurs with his friends while playing video games and it was something we fought about until he realized it was fucked up and essentially made him racist, he also used the word ""sand n****r"" once (not directed at me )but it really hurt me because i am middle eastern. He thought i was joking and it was still early in our relationship and i was young so i just ignored it. i also ended things because it was stressing me out to feel like i always had to fix something about him, and i did not want to be viewed as someone who was with a racist even though i believe he had no hate in his heart and was just immature as fuck. 

When i ended it, It was the most devestating thing because i still loved him tremendously. Fast forward to current day, not a day has gone by that i havent thought about him or stopped missing or loving him. last night i got drunk and finally text him an entire paragraph about wanting to try again and how i never stopped loving him. he text me back agreeing to meet for dinner this week, im cautious. The only thing im worried of is ive slept with 4 people since we broke up, i was in a really rough state of mind and was trying to move on but throught them all i couldnt stop thinking of him. Im also worried nothing has changed and im putting us both through another oncoming heartbreak. But i genuinely love him more than anything, and i dont think i will ever get over him.

but i do think i made a mistake, i should not have text him that even if i meant every word of it, i know he doesnt use slurs anymore but knowing that he did just makes me feel gross, like if my friends knew that it reflects so badly on me as well even though we fought about it and he stopped.

Then she went to her class, we then found each other and I proposed to help her with the things she was carrying but she smiled and said that she didnt needed help and she swiftly continued to her class. I also need to note that I lost hope for dating but I dont also like seeing people that sad, I just wanted to try for the last time, she seems to be sort of different from the others, but I dont really know how to continue because it became clear to me that she is an introvert.

31,rfjmwn,1639412981,What is considered breaking your virginity?,"Often times this gets brought up about a person's virginity. When it comes to breaking it, some people have different definitions. By technical terms, it only means sex. Some people think having ONS with a prostitute is all it takes to end it. Yet people associate this to having had a romantic relationship history.  But if you've been on dates but didn't have sex, does that even count? 

What is the verdict when it comes to breaking virginity? I'm sure this will get brought up a lot in your new dates.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfjmwn/what_is_considered_breaking_your_virginity/

A week ago, the place was very crowded and he ended up sitting at a spot in the bar close to me. There was an empty seat next to him, so I took it. He never looked up. 
I grabbed a napkin from the bar and drew a hangman game on it with “_ _y _o _ _y?” I handed him the napkin &amp; the pen. He looked up and smiled. He was even more gorgeous than I thought!!! 
He guessed the letters &amp; we giggled a bit and introduced ourselves. 

A couple of nights later, i see him but don’t make eye contact. He ended up abandoning his secret self at the bar &amp; coming up to talk to me. We hung out all night. He laughs about it &amp; tells me that if I had not done the hangman stunt, he would’ve never spoken to me.

He complimented me a lot and said he wanted to get to know me, even asked for my IG. Sadly at that point I was suffering my way out of a toxic relationship and when he wanted to kiss me I refused, even though I wanted it too but things weren't officially over with my ex yet and I couldn't. He asked me if I had a bf and I said things were complicated, he was confused but asked me for a last dance because shortly after I had to leave. This was in a different country where we both were on holiday so we haven't met since, eventually he unfollowed me and so did I. Shortly after I finally managed to shut things down with my ex and I wanted to spend some time on my own, but something in me just keeps telling me to find that guy. He gave me a vibe that I have never felt before with a guy, not even with my boyfriend. We just clicked, I can't describe it, but it just felt so right and I know that I screwed up. 
Recently a friend of mine who studies in his country asked me to visit and I was wondering whether I should text him to meet up. I feel that we had this special connection, and even though things might not get serious considering the geographical distance between us, I would really like to see him and talk to him again.

It started off pretty causal then we made it “official” a few months after dating. 

She wants to move to the next steps of a relationship (moving in together, spending holidays with each other’s families, etc) and I’m no where near ready for the next steps. 

I’m perfectly content with us hanging out 1-2x per week, spending holidays with our respective families, and i’m definitely not interested in moving in together. 

This has got her thinking/wondering if i’ll ever move to the next steps. 
We had a conversation about that very topic and all I could really say was “i’m not ready for any of that yet”. 

She wasn’t happy with that answer and now we both are worried we may be breaking up soon. (it was unspoken but mood in the air was different. like we both know the end result but no one said anything about it)

Honestly, I like how things are going now; casual. She wants more tho. 

but I’m afraid if we break up i’ll lose someone who genuinely wants to be with me. Because I know in 3 or 5 or 7 years I may be ready to settle down and i’ll be WISHING I had someone like her to settle down with. I’ll most likely be kicking myself because I let our relationship fall, all because I wasn’t ready. But I don’t want to move to the next steps if i’m not ready.

But I'm not feeling it quite as much as her. Intimacy is great but if we're not on the same page, it's mostly physical for me, and emotional for her. That means we're doing the same thing but in our minds it means something very different.

Everything has been perfect, we talk all day long and are enjoying getting to know each other. 

A day or so ago, we were talking playfully about who would be the first to admit they had fallen in love. It prompted me to tell him that I want to plan on moving to the state he lives in this up coming year (not with him, but find a place of my own), if things keep going well between us. 

His response was that we was surprised but “not against it”.  The conversation felt weird and so I back peddled and told him that it just seemed like a nice state to live in, but I still have other states I’m looking into moving to possibly as well (which isn’t a lie). 

I feel like I rushed things and said what I said too soon. He has trust issues because his previous girlfriends had cheated on him. His last girlfriend was also long distance, and when they finally moved in together she went crazy on him. 

I have nothing but good and honest intentions, and when I get excited about something I act impulsively. However since that conversation, he still has been texting me and snap chatting me.

When it comes to what I want out of life as a man, I want someone who can keep up with me. I have goals, desires, hustles, I am driven and I'm passionate about many things. I want someone to be a part of that journey with me. Not just someone who is ""there"".

You know, for example, and it's the best example that I can give, it's why professional wrestlers date primarily within the business. Their lives align, they are there together, they see each other all the time, their lives are just mixed and entangled in with one another.

Am I asking too much? Is this unreasonable?

I've seen stuff from women who say ""you never pay me enough attention"" and the guy is like ""I'm working all the time to provide for my family"". Yeah... I don't want that. I don't want that at all. I don't want the fact that I'm working to be the ""excuse"" for getting cheated on. Hence why I post above I would like someone who aligns with my life and we can do stuff and participate in things together.

Obviously, this doesn't apply to EVERYONE. Not everyone just goes and cheats because of ""so and so"" reason. But the fact that I've been cheated on before in the past, as I said above, it's something that worries me. I just turned 30. I'm in the stage of my life where I'd like to settle down, find someone to share my life with, start a family, etc etc.

But of course, in the back of my mind, I still feel like no matter what, somehow, someway, I'm going to get cheated on, no matter how hard I try to prevent that from happening.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfnou2/are_all_these_videos_that_im_watching_skewing_my/

He always holds my hand and hugs me and cuddles with me, we laugh a ton and have a lot of fun. I personally don’t date often, and when I have dated guys it always ends with one of us losing interest. I don’t really ever like a guy that much, but I really like this guy and see a bit of a future with him. Now, I know I’m making a big deal of nothing, but I have such bad anxiety over this for no reason. The only thing bothering me is he just doesn’t text back as much now and he has really short responses rather than our long conversations we had before our first few dates. I know this probably isn’t a big deal but I can’t shake the feeling that he is going to lose interest in me.

Went for drinks and held hands on the way home, we didn't even kiss till the third date. after a while I asked her what she was looking for and she told me she wasn't looking for anything serious, I didn't really care at that moment as I wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship either. 

Met her siblings and had a great time, then afterwards she never initiated contact again and would ignore me for days, even cancelled on a date but proposed to reschedule. After a while I suddenly really started liking her and decided to text her that this isn't going to work out as she's not looking for a relationship. 

I guess I learned my lesson, but I just can't ever see myself casually dating anymore. Also wonder if people who tell you they don't want a relationship ever change their minds afterwards?

Most of the profiles I'm seeing now don't include their job. One guy didn't mention his kid. Most people have blurbs that say basically nothing. What's up with that? Why don't you try to give women a sense of who you are? Which admittedly can be hard on dating apps, but I mean, you can put in a little effort, can't you?

We chatted for a few weeks and met up for coffee on a Sunday morning, and chatted for 1 and a half hours and by the end of it I was smitten. I couldn't wait till the next day and asked her out for a meeting ons the Monday and we went out again on the weekend and went minigolfing. I had loads of fun and i think she did as well, we were together for about 3-4 hrs and it was good.

The thing is she is a slow texter, usually a reply comes back once a day or so. The wait kills me, I text a few times, say 2-3 and then I feel I should wait for a response and not overwhelm her or come across needy or creepy or whatever. With Christmas coming I assume she is busy, and she said she had plans with family so I attribute it to that. What can I do to sort of not get so invested? To calm down and not over think things?

Like I think she's interested but then I get like a little sad if she doesn't respond, I kinda don't wanna feel like that if it makes sense? And I get it, I can hear myself saying don't overthink this just take it easy, but that's easier said than done...

84,rfqcja,1639430120,I met a guy from an app in person and a few things are bothering me. Should we continue seeing each other?,"Things seemed very promising in the beginning. We talked for a little over a month before meeting in person and that was due to me. I like to get to know someone a bit more and not just meet a total stranger the next day. He asked me out 3 times and I said no, 2 other times I said yes but didn't show up and he still talked to me. I assumed he must be very interested to still be talking to me. The date went just fine but a few things are still bothering me and I'm not sure if I'm making a big deal out of minor stuff. Another note, I've only been in 1 bad relationship that ended earlier this year and I didn't get any real dating or boyfriend experience out of that so I'm still in the dark.

Firstly I got into a car accident on the way to meet the guy. I called to let him know I'd probably be late. We eventually meet up and he never asked if I was okay or anything. He also saw the damage to the car himself (side note I was borrowing my dad's car while mine is being fixed). I just wanted him to know I wasn't making it up. He didn't offer to pay for my $4 drink either. No I don't need him to pay for me I just thought it was a better first impression for a first date and I know he's not struggling financially. He always works 10 hours overtime every week making time and a half and he just got a raise. He also never complimented me at all for the time we were there. I met one guy from an app prior to this and he said I looked nice and he liked how I did my hair so it was totally respectful, not creepy in any way. Also they made my drink wrong and he asked if I would tell them to change it. He didn't offer to do it for me. Again not a big deal but it would have made me see him really positively.

So the date ended when the cafe closed and I had to get back and explain the accident to my dad as it was his car. I told him when I got home and he never said anything about me getting there safely. I only noticed this bothered me because the guy who hit me texted me that he was glad I got home safe while the guy I was on a date with didn't.

I just feel like he doesn't display very much care for me then again idk how much I can expect from someone who's only known me a month and met me once. A couple other notes, I brought him this dessert I made (think the level of a banana nut bread) because we've talked about my love of cooking and baking. He seemed to like it and ate 2/3 of it while we were at the cafe. He's also a former mechanic and I assume could have helped me with the car damage because I was side swiped and the mirror was ripped clean off.

Anyways, I’ll give y’all the whole story. I recently moved very far away from home for a job. I do have some family (my brother goes to school down here and I have an aunt with younger cousins down as well) down here but other than that I don’t really know anyone except for people within my job. My brother was telling me how there was a girl from my class in high school who had also recently moved down here. I didn’t really think anything about it. I never really talked with her all that much in high school, i dated a friend within her friend group, I was friends with her brother and had a whole bunch of classes with her as well but other than I never really talked with her a whole lot. She was also a pretty quiet girl too. A solid reason as to why I never talked to her is due to the fact I had baaaaaad self esteem issues and thought she was waaaaay out of my league. 

About a week ago I decided to give hinge a try and wouldn’t you know guess who I stumbled upon. Yep that’s right. When I say her account I said you can’t make this shit up. Anyways I liked her photo and she was surprised to see my like. Long story short I end up getting her number and said fuck it and asked if she’d like to meet up for a bite to eat. In the back of my mind I thought for sure she’d say no or make an excuse as to why she can’t go but that did not happen!! She very enthusiastically texted that we should . I thought we’d do a casual lunch meet up or something of that nature but she said she’d prefer to go at night on a water front restaurant. 

I kinda know how I’m gonna tackle this “date” (my goal is to just have as much fun as possible). I just don’t know if I should treat it as a date or a meet up to catch up. I think I’m overthinking it and it is a date(why should she bother with saying what’s up on hinge as well as saying yes to get food. What do y’all think?

Ive had little romance in my life &amp; haven’t been intimate since high school - 18/19 y/o. I was rejected a lot when I was younger and felt like taking my life countless times, partially because of the rejections but also my low self esteem. When I was in my late 20’s, I began getting a lot of attention from women which was obviously mind boggling at first but that interest dropped after a few days. I’ve rejected countless of average-beautiful women and despite gaining weight, I still have women hit on me (mostly due to my assets). My parents are proud of my accomplishments but are furious with my disinterest in women, they literally asked me if I was gay the other day. I feel so attached to my work I genuinely don’t see other ways of happiness. You can call it selfishness but I’m finally happy for once and I don’t want to go back to my old self, I like the new me.

We have had a great connection but I feel like I shouldn’t message her first because I don’t want to seem desperate.

99,rfrpia,1639433676,Break in texting after communicating every day - need advice,"Hi There,

I (31M) have been on a couple of dates with (28F) after meeting on Bumble. Our last date was about a week ago. Since our first date she has seemed really into me, texting every day, following up, driving the conversation which I actually appreciate as a guy because a lot of the time I feel that burden falls to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's been out of town the last few days on a big group trip with some friends / classmates from grad school. The first couple of days things were as normal, she texted me multiple times a day, asks me questions, etc. Saturday night, she sends me a picture of herself before going out and I replied with a cutesy type comment about it and a joke about some people standing in the background. 

Since then I have had radio silence from her, rationally I'm just trying to leave her be since I know she's on a trip and doing things with friends. That said, the radio silence is out of character and making me anxious, I feel like she may have either hooked up with someone else on the trip or is trying to and doesn't want the distraction of texting me. 

Am I overreacting? She gets back tomorrow so I'm waiting until then to try again but I hate being a double-texter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfrpia/break_in_texting_after_communicating_every_day/
