I know it's a numbers game but I went on a date every week or two throughout 2021 and have had really poor luck. 

I have a good career, lots of hobbies, I'm in good shape, strong relationship with my family. I'm kind, caring, supportive, and honest. I like to think I'm the type of person that people want for a relationship, but I can rarely make it past the first date to be given the chance to show that.

I've tried going for walks, coffee, drinks at a bar, etc. I keep the conversation light and make sure we both are contributing to the conversation. There's usually the generic topics of COVID and what we do for work, but I'll try and move away from that and have more unique conversations. Many of the dates last for 2+ hours and there's lots of laughing throughout, but still ""I don't feel the right connection"".

There have been lots of dates where I didn't feel an immediate spark, but I recognize that it's just a first date and I would be willing to go on a second to learn more about the other person. But those feelings aren't reciprocated. It's like people need tinder to immediately turn into fire on the first date (no pun intended) otherwise sorry on to the next.

48,rtp9ci,1641061903,Am I overthinking or is something wrong?,"
So to start, I’m an early 20s male with no dating experience before this. I’ve been using dating apps for like 3 years and have never went on a date besides with this one girl (f22). We matched in late November and have went on 2 dates. The latest one the week before Christmas. One where I came out to her and one where she came out to me (hour distance). 

Anyway on the dates I thought they went good, especially the 2nd one. She kept cuddling with me and I had my first kiss and on the 2nd date more of the same and we made out. We held hands everywhere we walked and when we got in my car she still wanted to hold my hand and was like warming it up because it was cold. After the date we got to talking about name origins and one of mine meant gift from god and she told me that I was like a gift from god to her and that she thought I was making her life better by being in it and it made me happy, because I felt the same. And then she also told me a few days ago that she couldn’t believe that someone like me with good looks and good personality could ever like her. So like just throwing that in there to show you guys that I think/thought she was into me. 

We also block texted every day since we matched in late November and here’s where the problem has come in. She hasn’t texted me back in 2 days and tomorrow we’re supposed to hang out. She always returns my texts within a few hours mostly because they’re like long blocks of text so it takes a bit to type out, but never two days or even one. I’m a classic overthinker and as shameful as it is to admit, I’ve been feeling like shit while I wait for her to send me something back. I haven’t double texted yet, but I kind of want to even though it’s a huge no no according to everything I’ve seen. Am I just overthinking or should I send out a text to her? I just hate feeling like I’ve been put on the back burner. Another small thing I did notice was that she had unmatched me off the dating app, but this was like only 3 days after talking and before the dates and everything. But like I just can’t shake the idea she could have another guy lined up and I’m like the 2nd choice. Even though we talked every day and she’d tell me everything she did and we’d have super deep convos and everything. Like it seems implausible that she was talking to other guys, but I have no idea. I personally can’t even go on the apps anymore without thinking about her. Anyway, some advice would be nice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtp9ci/am_i_overthinking_or_is_something_wrong/

54,rtpm3r,1641062921,Do any other girls encounter a lot of guys that only want a girlfriend for sex?,"I met a guy on tinder and we had planned a date for new years at his house. If everything went well, the plan was for me to stay the weekend and go back Sunday. Only thing was that I lived an hour from him without a car but he said he had no problem picking me up and dropping me off.

I told him that I was hesitant about the date being at his home because most times when guys have dates at their homes they expect sex (at least in my experience). He reassured that theete was no pressure and that we wouldn't do anything I didn't want to do so I went ahead with the date.

At the end of the night when we were in bed cuddling things started turning to a more sexual direction than I was comfortable with. At first it was just making out (which I was cool with) but then he started to grope me so I pulled away and told I wasn't ready for that yet.

He then asked if I thought we were going to have sex at all this weekend and I said that I honestly didn't know and that I wanted things to be no pressure like he said cause I wasn't comfortable yet.

He then told he didn't realize how much he was going to dislike the drive to my house and said that if we didn't have sex that weekend that he couldn't see a relationship with me because he didn't want to make that drive for a relationship that was going to progress slowly in sexual terms. 

To me I interpreted this to mean that the drive to house would only be worth if I gave him sex, despite the fact he said he was looking for a serious relationship.

He ended paying for an uber for me back to my house last night and the experience left me feeling very uncomfortable and confused.

I often talk to guys on tinder who are like an hour from me and this is the second time something like this has happened irl but a lot of the guys I message also think they're owed sex if that have to make the drive. This is very frustrating cause I live in a small town with not many potential dates around so I have to go father out if a bigger pool of guys to talk to.

Do all guys feel this way?? I tell every guy I'm talking to that I'm looking for something serious and that I'm not into hookups and yet on FIRST DATES they always try to turn kisses (with again I'm okay with) to second/third base and then get upset/mad/disappointed when I don't want it. 

I'm at the point where I might start telling guys that I'm not interested in anything sexual at all for the first month of knowing them so I can weed out guys who only want a girlfriend mainly for sex. 

I get the sex is an important part of a relationship but the guys I meet up with always try to take thing 0-100 even though they claim they're looking or something serious. It's almost like sex is the foremost priority for them in relationships instead of trying to see if there's compatibility or an emotional connection.

67,rtq7gw,1641064596,Dead sex life caused by boyfriend’s porn addiction.,"my(24f) bf(31m) has a porn addiction and it’s killed our sex life.

I’m on mobile so please excuse formatting. 

We’ve been together 3.5 years and our sex life has basically died and i think it’s because of how much he watches porn. 
We used to fuck like rabbits when we first got together, about 1.5 years ago, our sex life took a turn and we haven’t really brought it back. 
I’ve voiced my concerns about the lack of intimacy multiple times, I have literally cried and begged him to fuck me more than once every 2-3 months. Even to just touch me more. Any time I try to initiate, I can’t get him hard and he doesn’t help me out. I can come out of the shower, completely naked, walk over to him and try to be sexy and he acknowledges my presence but never does anything about the tits that are in his face. 
I recently went on a trip to visit my best friend for a week. When I came back home, he was at work and I noticed his laptop in a different place than the usual spot. It was open and I picked it up to move it back to its spot and accidentally hit a key and the screen turned on and it was on Pornhub. I typically have no issue with porn but what I saw next changed my mind. 
I know I shouldn’t have done this next part but I was just curious. I looked at his history for the week I was gone. It was nothing but porn. Almost 10 videos a day. My heart sunk to my stomach. I then clicked on the different months to view the history, all porn. Almost everyday. For the last 6 months. 
At that point, I was so mad I was crying. I felt to unwanted, hurt, jealous and sick. He knows how I feel about porn. He used to wake me up from jacking off in bed next to me and I told him it was becoming a problem since it was every other night. He said it’s “not anything sensual, just helps him sleep”. I told him fucking his girlfriend before bed can help him sleep too but he said “imagine I was asking you for more sex. I’d look like a pig. I don’t think it’s fair of you to say that”. He doesn’t think there is an issue and always makes me feel guilty for wanting to have sex with him. His solution to the problem is for me to go find someone else to fuck if it’s “that big of a deal to me”. 
I really don’t want to stay with someone who would rather watch porn than have sex with me. It’s been messing with my mental health and self esteem. I’m not financially stable enough to live on my own or have anyone I can move in with so I don’t really know what my options are but I know I deserve better than this. 
I just don’t know how to talk to him about any of this without it turning into a big fight like it usually does and nothing getting resolved.

71,rtqhk1,1641065387,"Last minute date cancel, on NYE no less....","I have been talking to a guy since November 17th. He pursued me. To be honest, I actually didn't even respond to his second message and assumed this would be another match that fizzles. But he tried again, saying something sweet like ""I can't get your smile off my mind"". Annnnnnd I fell for it. Once we started messaging again, we would do it for hours on end, eventually all throughout the day every single goddamn day. He had a silver tongue in text too. I was smitten. Couldn't get him off my mind. Couldn't wait to meet him.

He was going through some career changes, so we planned our first date to be Sunday December 18th. He lives 2 hours away and I was gonna make the drive to him to see his studio, he's a music producer and I thought his job sounded fascinating and I wanted to meet him and see what he did and his studio. Well, the Friday evening before we were due to meet he cancels. His excuse seemed reasonable, and while I was bummed, he initiated the reschedule for NYE weekend. So I went with it.

We continued texting as usual. Then, I noticed when I would ask about logistics of our pending date, he would go radio silent. For like hours. He would excuse this by saying he forgot his phone, was busy, etc... But it felt off. I mean we would be in the middle of banter, I would ask, and then boom, no texts for like 8 hours.

But eventually we agreed upon meeting today. Again, me driving to him. I was starting to have my doubts because of what I stated above, and I just felt like suddenly he seemed for reserved.

Yesterday, we are texting back and forth as usual when I try to verify that we are indeed still on for today and my plan was to solidify a time. Again, abrupt discontinuation of texts for like 8 hours. Now, we are also FB friends and so as time went on when I was scrolling FB I would see periodically when he logged in and out of FB, yet he was still not responding. I texted again saying I was starting to feel a bit strung along, could he please let me know about our date.

He gets back to me at like 10pm last night. Saying he was ""away from his phone all day"" (nope, you've been on FB) and that he was feeling overwhelmed. Then again silence. So I say I'm sorry he's feeling overwhelmed, ask if it's about anything in particular.

He waits like another 30 to 45 minutes to tell me ""I need to pass on tomorrow"". 

And that's it. That's all I've heard from a dude that texted with me and flirted with me and led me on for over a month. He cancels our date on NYE at like 10 pm. 

WTF. I'm so over dating. I'm super bummed. I was really looking forward to meeting him. I really thought this could be something. And now I feel stupid that a man I never met, but felt a connection to, for whatever reason made a complete 180 and blew me off. What the hell is that even about?

To solve this, along with a friend, I created Social Dimension - a curated experience for two people to discover each other through activities revolving around deep questions coupled with fun games. The duration of the experience is anywhere between 45 to 90 minutes and can take place virtually or in person. When you book, we share separate guidebooks to you and your +1, consisting of detailed instructions for conducting the session.

We are attempting to create a platform that complements people in the journey of discovering each other seamlessly, making it hassle-free and a lot more fun.

80,rtr4o9,1641067210,My girlfriend and I just broke up,"I'm pretty hurt because what I thought was a minor issue turned into a huge one for her.

It felt like I was carrying most of the relationship and wasn't getting much back in return regarding emotional support and appreciation through verbal sentiment. I expressed this to her respectfully, and she told me that she couldn't provide this to me. The only times I got these words from her was when I asked how she felt about me/us; it didn't feel genuine because I needed to ask.

This became a real issue for me. I started to shut down, not putting forth much effort since I was upset at the whole situation. If someone I was dating brought up an issue to me that they were experiencing, I would try my best to change for them and make them happy if I had care and love for them.

But it seems like my girlfriend didn't care enough to put forth much effort to keep our relationship alive. I am beyond hurt because I thought that if you love someone, you would fight and make things work. I now know that this person was not right for me. Seeing as a minor issue could not be fixed, it would be hard to believe that we would be able to make it through actual problems down the line.

What I've learned from this whole situation is not to settle for less than you are worth, and if someone isn't providing something for you that you need in a relationship.. it may not be correct.

88,rtsh0y,1641070958,Advice for taking things slowly with my ex,"This is my first time in this situation, and I’m autistic as well, so I need some help. In July, my ex and I broke up after an almost two year relationship which involved us moving in together (her things are still here in our shared place) due to our relationship becoming toxic on my side after we went long distance for an internship.

Her internship has now ended, but she wants to take things slowly due to the events that unfolded and our relationship having become toxic, which is fine, but I don’t know how to navigate this naturally and move things forward given our past relationship and what currently ties us together. We were very close, lived together, I knew her family very well and even temporarily lived with them, and we had plans to get married and spend our lives together. We both have discussed rebuilding the life we had as our mutual goal, she’s working with me by leading things forward and is also very supportive, but the arrangement definitely feels weird even if it makes sense given everything that occurred in our past relationship. Her things are still here at our apartment and she does plan to return some day, although she wants to temporarily live with family and take things slowly while building up to all of that naturally over the course of the next few months. 

What can I do to not overthink this and be as natural as possible? I understand I should not discuss our relationship too much nor make her feel stressed or pressured, and just discuss our individual lives, but I have no real idea on what to say or what to do. She’s not comfortable with us meeting up or staying over yet, but wants to work towards that in the near future as well and is very firm on us working on our relationship and getting back together with a much stronger foundation, which we both want.

What would be some good advice that would help make her feel more comfortable, naturally move things forward and allow our future relationship to thrive for someone who doesn’t have this type of social experience?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtsh0y/advice_for_taking_things_slowly_with_my_ex/

94,rtsmz3,1641071416,How should I react when my bf calls me a liar ?,"My bf never believes me and keeps calling me a liar. For example if I say I like a game he says I’m lying I don’t like the game I only played it to be included. Or I say bro a lot because I’m kind of tomboyish. I grew up a real tomboy I used to like to play in the dirt and I didn’t like skirts and I always liked more male toys like robots, cars and Pokémon over barbies and brats and baby dolls. So to compensate I decided to work on my femininity  and I act and dress and look super feminine but at heart all my interests and hobbies and certain speech patterns are tomboyish. But he doesn’t believe me. He said Why’re you such a liar?

I constantly have to share my location, or show him my dms cause he thinks all women all lairs and he has to prevent me from cheating on him.

Other problems this guy was flirting with me very badly on a social video game. So I laughed at him cause I figured he was doing a skit possibly streaming to friends or making a video. I even heard him go do it to someone else in the lobby. But my bf thought I was actually interested and entertaining this guy that I don’t even know what he looks like or where he is cause I was laughing. I laugh at everything ! When I feel awkward and nervous, when I’m amused, when I’m happy and even when ppl try to embarrass me. It’s a defensive mechanism. It didn’t mean I was interested or entertaining. I even told this guy his flirting was bad, I laughed at him not with him, and I told him no I have a bf when he asked for my snap. I still got in trouble and my bf doesn’t believe or trust me. 

I told him you have to trust me sometimes and he said no. He said women are lairs you trust me and we’re good. I had no idea he was like that he treated me like an equal and girls around us nicely too.  He’ll also ignore some of my messages which I normally wouldn’t mind. If you don’t wanna respond to certain things fine. But if I do the same or don’t answer in as little as five minutes a lot of times he’ll get mad at me for ignoring him. Such a hypocrite. A big pet peeve of mine. 

I can guess the advice here would be to leave him from what I see from other posts. Maybe you’re right but I’m not at that point yet. Plz don’t just say leave him or call me dumb for staying.  I kept telling him to stop calling me a liar but he won’t do it and it’s pissing me off. I want to just not care what he thinks but I don’t want to just be a push over. I just want to know is there some way to gracefully shut him down or express my disgust when he calls me a liar, without being overly combative and setting him off ? My hope would be one day he just feels stupid for saying it and eventually stops.

We continued to cook for each other, I met all of her friends, we texted every day and night and continued too see each other about 3-4 times per week due to our busy schedules.
Today she told me that she couldn't continue our relationship due to the fact that she thinks I'm more involved in this relationship than her. What I'm trying to say is that I cought more feelings for her than she for me.
She likes the friendship part but she doesn't want the sexual part to continue. This has something to do with the fact that she lived with her past boyfriend for 5 years. She doesn't love him any longer but she is afraid of commitments I would say.
I told her that I couldn't do the friendship part without the sexual because I see her as much more and unfortunetly our breakup ended in tears and she told me that she wishes for us to stay in touch almost everyday regardless. I'm afraid I can't do that.
