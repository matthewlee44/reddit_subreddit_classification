When a guy who isn’t traditionally good looking is seen with a beautiful woman, the initial thought is that she is out of his ‘league’, which is a ludicrous statement when you think about it.

If someone is with another person, they are obviously ‘in their league’ because they have made the choice to be with them.

There isn’t a glass ceiling when it comes to attraction, where the most high quality women are only reserved for guys with certain good looks, money, or status. One should never interact with a beautiful woman with the belief that he is lucky to be dating her, having sex with her, or even being in her presence.

You have to view yourself as someone she is equally lucky to be around. Whether it’s your intelligence, skill, charm, unique insight, your drive, your humor, etc.—you have to always focus on what makes you a prize. She may be beautiful, but what else can she offer as person as well? You will always have something you can offer to enhance someone, but you have to believe it authentically and project it in how you act.

No matter what you do, there will always be a significant number of women that aren’t attracted to you. But never view this as a level-based system where you can’t achieve a certain height. This limiting belief will almost always lead to insecurity, neediness, and ultimately failure.

I always had hot girlfriends and when I used Tinder, I got matches and dates with attractive girls. Not only that, when I met 3-4 girls from social circle, clubs, etc at least one was highly attracted to me , that's how i got my gfs.  


I'm not model looking, I'm average height, average built but I look much better compared to 6 years ago (told by others) and I'm much more confident, successful (doing 7 figures on my own business, etc), but for some reason on Tinder I get a match every other day and with girls I wouldn't date... same thing happen in real life.  


For me this is a huge disconnect, everyone is telling you'll do much better as a man in your 30s because you'll be more complete as a man, which I'm sure I am, but I feel something changed with dating in the last years.

All this happened without me knowing until months down the line and we were still dating!!! I would meet with his family and friends too and they always had a weird vibe with me, other friends just stopped talking to me after awhile. I think it’s due to the University environment rumours run around quick.

After I found out he cheated he begged me to get back together with him to the point he would chase me on the street ( I refused to). He has sickle cell and the doctor said his life expectancy has reduced and I stated feeling bad so i told him we could be friends, but we would hook up a lot too. He told me he cut ties with the girl (his ex) when he was pursuing me so I didn’t think anything of it. 

Turns out he’s been telling everyone that I’m his sidechick and I’m evil and tried to destroy his relationship and he never broke up with his ex!?

I’ve been into this girl for a while (in school), I am a senior and she is one year younger, thus below me one class. We haven’t talked that much, but enough for me to fall in crazy love.

I’ve been working on confidence building for a while, and the results are very good. So I tought I will ask her out, cause why not. She said yes, and I have suggested a place and time over text, but because she is a really busy girl, she said no, but she also said she would meet sometime else. I was extremely hyped. But 1 day before the date she got sick, her friends told me she felt really bad, and she cancelled (it was very believable). We talked over text, I kept the convo going. She replied with long, “well written” paragraphs. Yesterday she told me she is better so I decided to give it another go, so I suggested a new place and time. She said no, because she was busy (she had school late afternoon), but this time she did NOT suggest a new place and time.

I am the only one initiating conversations, but face to face I always get this feeling that I have to act and be confident. She is holding eye contact super strong with me, and I am doing the same. She is always smiling at me when I talk / she talks, and her smile makes me super happy. Now, I told her to -tell me when she has some time to meet-. I am confident enough, but this time I have totally no clue what to do. And I get this doubt that she will not initiate (just like over text, the second time).

She had good reasons to cancel both times, so it’s not like an obvious reject, but second time she did not suggest a do-over. I want to keep up the confident flow, because the first time I felt, and I was without doubts about what I should do. And it went smooth (I have never felt this feeling until before).

My (28F) divorce process was over few months ago and to be honest I’m not looking forward to start dating again but it’s on the back of my mind. Constantly. I feel like I won’t be able to find a partner due to multiple issues I have and me wasting more and more time won’t help. Also being an overthinker doesn’t  help as well.
First of all, I literally have no previous dating experience. My ex husband was the first man I’ve even been with and we didn’t “date” since we were in a LDR for a long time and then decided to get married (do not recommend it btw). I’m an immigrant and obviously I obtained my green card via the marriage. While it has never been a problem I’m pretty sure every man would take it as red flag (as well as being divorced). Also my nationality (Russian) and stereotypes around it contribute to my concerns. 
So how could I overcome these insecurities and concerns? And how could I bring up once I start seeing someone? 

I think I need to add that my marriage was real and we were together for 7 years, married for 3. It just didn’t work out and we grew apart.

I declined and after one month, I declined a second time when he asked and let him know that I was over it and was moving on with my life.

He was LIVID. He spent the next couple months, (about 4 or 5), trying to get in contact with me and talk things out. I said no each time and blocked him on whatever email he made to contact me on.  After that, he wrote a long novel of a Facebook status he shared to many friends complaining that it wasn’t fair that I wouldn’t be nice to him (his wording, not mine).

This is very unusual for me (which I told him). He seems to be a very upfront person, no reason to tell stories or lie etc but before we met, he mentioned that he had no social media. I didn’t ask, we were having a general conversation and he brought it up.

We’ve since met again and spent the night together and had so much fun even when talking and sharing life stories. He seemed so genuinely pleased to see me, but I’ve since found that he does have an Instagram, which he specifically said he didn’t. It’s private but appears to be active. 

I’ve asked if he is just looking for a hook up and he said he was open to anything, but I don’t think I want even a casual thing with someone who lies. It feels like a red flag.

I've had some cool matches and a few good dates, and then some not so great matches and some rather awkward dates. The thing i've realised is you could be one swipe away from either a really cute match who you get along with well, a not so great match, or no match at all. Which makes it really addictive because you never know who you will meet on there. The thing I've realised with dating apps is sometimes luck will be on your side, sometimes it won't.   


What usually happens to me is I'll make an account on a dating app, feel great at the initial noob boost given where I get shown to more people and get more matches. If im lucky i might message a few matches who respond back to me and might probably get 1 or 2 matches in whom I move the conversation away from the dating app on social media or wherever(this has been happening way less this past year). But then two things happen:  
1) After a week it becomes difficult to even get a match or a even a new like on the app(becuase my noob boost expires). And that becomes a bit of an underwhelming feeling. I've realised this has nothing to do with looks, lots of people have told me they have the same issue that occurs after approximately a week.   
2) I'll start seeing some 'worser quality' profiles that are on the bottom of the swiping que, in higher proportion, and I start to tell myself that 'these apps are awful, time to delete them and focus on self-improvement and meeting people IRL'.  


After being off the apps for a week or two, I start developing so called  'withdrawal symptomns', and tell myself that by potentially going back I could meet that next cool someone(this feeling gets a lot stronger during lockdown where I'm stuck at home on my phone more often). And the dopamine rush kicks in and I reinstall the apps. And the cycle repeats itself  


At the start of the year(when covid restrictions were eased), I probably had a good 2-3 months away from dating apps. And I did put myself out there and actually managed to get a few dates with some women I met at bars/nightclubs and some social events. I promised myself that I wouldnt get back on the apps. But with covid resurfacing and everything else, I eventually succumbed to the internal pressure and got back on them. Now I'm going through this usual cycle again. I haven't been on the apps for 2 weeks now, but it feels so tempting to get back on them.

I’ve started branching out of my comfort zone and talking to more people when I’m going out. So far it’s not been too bad but I’ve noticed that I don’t really have a lot of things I can relate to with people. 

For example. One of my meetup groups went to a trivia night at a brewery two nights ago. It was pretty fun and everyone was talking. I’ve been to three meetups with these folks so I can safely say that they’re becoming my new friends. 

The problem is that it seems like almost all of them have a vast amount of topics and interests to talk about. Whereas I don’t really have any way of relating. The reason I bring this up is when one of the people started asking about 

“If you were a trivia topic. Which would you be?”

And some people said “Disney facts” or “music” or “marvel movies” etc.

Almost everyone had this thing about themselves that kinda defined them in very unique way. When they got to me I came up blank. Not because I was nervous. But because I legitimately didn’t have a topic that I could define myself by. 

I learned that night that I’m not really passionate about anything. I don’t have this swath of knowledge about any specific topic. I just like watching random shows that interest me in that moment, maybe finish the series. Maybe not. A lot of times i just kinda exist. Go to work, go home, cook a mediocre meal that’s good enough for me and just kinda do the bare minimum. I go to the gym but I’m not very passionate about anything.

All I said to them was that I’d probably be “random category?”

It made me realize that I might be struggling with dating because I might just be too boring. I don’t have anything to really add to conversation to make it interesting. 

Most of the groups were talking about interests and hobbies and my hobby is kinda nothing? Possibly trying hobbies but never finding anything that sticks. It sucks but I just like coasting and not really thinking to much about things and just kinda going with the flow and see what happens. 

It also sucks because most of the folks were talking about dating and some the dates they have coming up. They tried, a few weeks ago to set me up with this girl at a bar we were at but that didn’t work out and she never replied to my texts. Idk. Maybe I’m thinking too much into it but it seems everyone there is somehow better.

- You have to wait until the right woman shows up and you should not ""lose"" time dating and getting to know people!
- Your soulmate is somewhere out there and the circumstances will bring her to you!
- Your soulmate will accept you completely, you don't have to change yourself if the right person comes along!

--&gt; I caught myself laughing for half an hour!!😂


--&gt; Let me be completely honest with you (while I look you straight in the eyes)

- You FIND and ATTRACT the right person. There are no such things like ""she will come when the time is right"". This phrase was made up of fearful persons who do not take any kind of risks in their life, and they end up with the ""best option"", which most of the time is the only available woman in their social circle.

- Let's suppose the right woman pops out of nowhere into your life. HOW the hell are you going to recognize that she is the right one for you if you have near to ZERO EXPERIENCE with women and dating? 

How are you supposed to keep her in your life, if you don't have a clue about woman phycology and what guy women really want? 

And last but not least,

How a great woman will accept you if you don't know how to give her a good time, embrace her sexuality while having fun, and not boring dinner dates? You have to become a better version of yourself my friend.

--&gt; The only way to find your ideal partner is by getting out of your comfort zone and date many women so you have abundance, and real-life knowledge of what kind of partner you deserve and need. 

P.S 

Please stop believing in the mainstream Hollywood narrative of what real love is, and how a great partner looks like..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1001467,public,self,"""When the time is right, the right person will show up"" --&gt; The ugly truth.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pm9t6v/when_the_time_is_right_the_right_person_will_show/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Some of my friends - well, really just the close one or two - also make it a point to ""force"" me to try new things and at least attempt to be adventurous

""Whether I want VS. whether I should"" is usually the argument I have with myself AND my friends, which has me thinking I gaslight myself to not be present and put in an effort to enjoy myself?

Well anyways, my friend Kayla (all fake names) had me set up with one of her older brother's friends from high school. Quick background: me and Kayla met in Kindergarten when she spontaneously ran up to me, introduced herself AND BIT ME. As a kid, I was freaked out; as a teenager looking back, I liked her spunk; as a cynical adult, I now know how shitty both her and her brother's tastes in friends are lmao


But her older brother, at least 2 or 3 grades above us in our high school, was a mix of jock and nerd. He was a soccer captain and went on to be a finance/business bro in college. Always talking about investing in this or that or these


So not the greatest confidence in what I should expect on this date I want to cancel on, but feel very obligated to finally give in to (sometimes there's a silver lining to Kayla under the few feet of shade she prefers to throw at people)


Fast forward to that night, kept my dress-code super casual with jeans and a thrifty band t-shirt. I get there a teensy bit late, see him, and meet him at the bar before we got seated.

He had already finished a few beers while waiting. I was holding out for some hope before he admitted that...He looked the part in the investor/banker role I wrote for him already (this is where my judgment starts FYI): plain chinos/khakis that were dark and fitted, with a loosely buttoned shirt with an obnoxiously ""loud"" pattern on it that was also loose fitting and tight somehow (one of those finance bro fashion tropes)

For reasons based on his dress, interests, and the political beliefs he hinted at when getting to know each other, I think he fits the description of a guy named ""Tucker"". Again, fake name, but if you met him, you'd think ""Now that's definitely a Tucker!""

Already he is talking about craft beer and IPAs, while drinking an IPA, at a restaurant known for their IPAs, which he chose because of their IPA selection, and he works for......you guessed it....an IPA distribution start-up.

He gives off corporate vibes yet owns a start-up that benefits locally-owned breweries. Talks about investors, and how he almost started this venture as a joke that grew into something bigger...

Okay, not going to lie, I was jealous he's seen more of the world and traveled to not only different countries, but other CONTINENTS! Like the places I want to go to, logged down in my dream travel journal I started when I was a kid.....Budapest, Ecuador, Australia, like he went to Spain just to rave, but he still at least went to Spain.....

In fairness, I had checked out before I even got to the date, I use my attitude to hide my discontentment, insecurities, and anxiety usually. Maybe I'm not being fair to this guy, maybe he's done some good things and some really cool stuff in life, that I'm perhaps jealous of, and he describes having all this ""yet feeling empty inside still""

Surprisingly, I could relate

But that went out the window, after he very obviously got bored with making casual conversation about himself (never asking questions about me, not even why I wasn't drinking, or my job, etc.) and straight up asked ""so we're gonna smash, right? I had a good feeling about this place's vibe, well and their IPAs""

We weren't even halfway through our meal, and he's sure cocky it all went swimmingly

I restrained myself and basically asked him ""how well do you think this went?""

His facial expression made it seem like no one has ever hit him with that question. Just another dude tracking through life on their confidence alone

His response: ""my number is higher than yours""

Like on a scale of one to 10, he considered himself an Adonus and I was easy enough on the eyes for him (guess in his mind, people that don't ask him questions longer than 5 words are ""easy"" for him too....)

That had me hitting the figurative roof, and I stood up, told him to ""f*** off"" (I rightfully unrestrained myself there, in my opinion) and to get his head out of his a$$ if he thinks his toxic macho charm works on everyone, and left

He texted me a few minutes later to ask that if going back to his place on the first was out of the question and uncomfortable to do so as a woman, if he could meet me at my place

Like how do people perceive themselves to justify how they act like this?! My friends Kayla said Tucker told her and her brother I was obtuse and rude the whole time

And now I'm thinking my mood entering this event maybe caused it to play out so poorly. Who's gaslighting who???

(probably not using ""gaslight"" correctly, but I just feel like others' judgments has me questioning or invalidating my own intuitions, and separately I work mental gymnastics on my self to always have a bad time and always be judgy and feel like only my perceptions are valid, which objectively is not always true)

We are tutors at the same lecture, which just makes all the things more complicated from the start.  
When we first met alone, we didn't hug, as there is still a pandemic out there. But I started to really like her. So I did as much as possible during a time where both of us had exams at college: I wrote with her and always placed hints like ""you did not watch a single Marvel film? Lets watch them together"". And she liked that idea but we postponed that until we would both have written our exams. But her plans changed and she flew on holiday. After that we met with some other friends at the cinema, where she started to (finally) hug me. Only me, not the other boys around. I thought, we were on a good way, until I learned she would go on another spontanious family holiday. So no possibility of meeting with her alone again.

So far so good. I just received a Snap, that wasn't ment for me. It wasn't something ""bad"" and I still had hope but then she explained me the situation: On her first holiday she got closer with someone from another friend group and now they are dating. They are not in a relationship as far as I understood. But dating. And the fact that she just said it to me and even added ""I just like him, let's see what will happen with him"" totally ruins me for the rest of the weekend.

I’m (F) still entirely in love with my ex (M), as we’re still very close friends. I met my ex right after he got back from a deployment, he’s a soldier. While on deployment, he divorced his ex-wife. They have a daughter together. Now that you’ve got the back ground info: 
 3 days after he got home, we went on our first date and have been inseparable ever since. He broke up with me after about a month because he realized he’s in over his head with all the things he has to figure out after coming home that he didn’t want to drag another person into “his mess.” We’ve continued to have sex in this time frame but recently decided to call it good for awhile because it was affecting our actual friendship and we started to feel more like fuck buddies. Awhile after our break up, he did tell me that if I was single whenever he became ready to date again, he’d have no hesitation in being with me again. 
 He made absolutely sure during the actual breakup that I knew I did nothing wrong and there was nothing he didn’t love about me, he simply just needed to figure out his own issues, like that he hadn’t actually been alone since he was 15, relationship wise and living situation. 
Recently, one night that I was staying there, he had night terrors that made him sit up and start yelling at nothing while still asleep. I was asleep next to him and didn’t realize what was happening until it was over since it woke me up. 
 I call him every night after I get off work so I can have someone to talk to as I walk across my large work parking lot because it’s dark and I’m a pretty security-conscious person. Once I had gotten home around 10, he and I were both getting ready for bed, still on the phone. He has trouble expressing his emotions but he said “I’m afraid to sleep al-“ Before he could say the word “alone,” I had already told him I could be there in 30 minutes if he wanted me to be. He started stuttering, not wanting to make me drive there so late and tired but also wanting to not be alone. I changed my wording from, “I can be there,” to “I’m on my way.” I got there and I didn’t sleep that whole night. What sleep I did get was very light. I stayed alert to make sure I was there in case it happened again and he needed me. 
 There have been multiple events in the time that we’ve broke up that I’ve picked him up from the bar after a night out with his buddies or driven him somewhere, that afterwards he sincerely thanked me for doing that for him or just saying he was glad I was there, and he thanks me multiple times for the same event. 
 His ex-wife wasn’t a very nice lady, and I’ve made it a point to never raise my voice at him or block him during a disagreement. After he broke up with me, I smiled and laughed with him and told him it was totally okay and I’m glad he was choosing something he knew he needed and hugged him while we both cried. 
 He gets oddly supportive if he thinks I’m talking to someone new. He said, “it gives closure.” &amp; I’ve never actually been talking to someone else. I just let him think I was recently so he would stop being weird about it every time he I mentioned a male name he hadn’t heard before.

I live in Manhattan and matched with a guy on Bumble who lives over an hour away. We FT’d, it went well and he decided to drive over to the city. I gave him the address of a parking garage across the street but he found street parking right by my apartment.

We went out all night, got drunk, he came over, we hooked up and he left the next morning. He was incredibly respectful and we had awesome conversation. 

After breakfast, I walked him to his car (which had a very distinct out of state license plate). We kissed goodbye and we texted non-stop after. He started to love bomb me but I was Into it despite knowing it’s a red flag. 

2 days later we agree to see each other that night, no specific plan and then he disappeared. I go on a walk and see his car parked down my street. I check bumble and his radius says he is right there.I don’t do anything.  No text until 9:30pm asking to grab a drink at 10:30pm. I tell him my friend had an emergency and I was no longer around. I was freaked out. 

I was so confused. He was on my street for 6 hours and no text. I asked him why he wanted to see me so late and he said he was working on his phd paper all day and finally wrapped up late. I then said I thought I saw his car and he denied that it was his. I know it is his because of the unique plate and bumble radius but I let it go during the convo. 

He sent a good morning text the next day , we exchanged two texts and then he never responded to me. One week later on a Friday night - his car is parked directly in front of my apartment. 

I understand he’s on Bumble and can easily match with women while he’s in the city, but it seems too crazy he met a woman on my block. The second time I saw his car makes me feel like he is trying to get my attention or bait me.

The first time we met up, I didn’t have any romantic intentions, and I just wanted to make a new friend. However, for both of the times that we met, we spent a good 6ish hours together doing more things than we planned. And as I’ve been talking with her and getting to know her more, I’ve started to develop some romantic attraction towards her, especially after the last time I saw her.

Before we went home yesterday, I asked if she would be free next weekend because I was thinking of taking her to someplace that she’s been bringing up, and she said yes. Part of me is regretting asking it that way because I wish I specifically asked her on a date, and I’m worried I might be dragging this for too long. Is it too late for me to ask her on a date?

In fact, some of you may be in great relationships that started on these platforms. I'd been on a few dating platforms for the past couple years and through most of 2020 but have since deleted them (not because I'm in a relationship). I've thought about fundamental problems with this new reliance that is collectively changing each of our mindsets and behaviours towards relationships and other people, while the most popular platforms have increasingly gamified and monetized the concept of finding a partner.  


I'm sure most of the factors I've identified aren't going to be new to this subreddit or many of you, but I'd like to use this as a place to discuss realistic solutions and macro trends that could change the course of what I've observed.  


\*\*Mental Health &amp; Mindset\*\*  
This trend is taking away from individual feelings of self-worth due to the disposability that is implied when people you match with ghost, no-show, unmatch, verbally abuse, or treat you in some other less-than-humane way that is much less acceptable in the flesh. As primates that succeeded as a civilization thanks to social cooperation, we've been wired to perceive any rejection from others as a genuine risk to our existence.  


On the other hand, it also encourages one to think that there is always someone better just a swipe away, which reduces the chance that you'll invest any meaningful amount of time and effort to get to know someone.  


This is a trend that compounds over time in individuals. This is especially true when paired with other complementary trends like the rise of social media, which amplifies fear and has been demonstrably linked to increased rates of anxiety in young adults in recent years. Even without the compounding of negative social media influences, a number of online dating platforms have taken on elements of social media, including having ""feeds"", and are another source of notification bombardment.  


\*\*Conflict of Interest\*\*  
Online dating companies have a conflict of interest with the outcomes many of us would seek (IE: A healthy, long-term relationship) since they generate revenue and earnings based on selling more premium features to more users. They collect immense data on users and use this data to dangle carrots in the form of ""revealing matches"", greater visibility of your profile, and access to more information on other users. If they were truly invested in creating more connections, they wouldn't make you pay (in time or money) to see who already likes you.  


The gamification aspect may appear to be a more recent ""feature"", but I had read that a founding idea of Tinder was to make dating feel like a game. The same factors that can cause people to get addicted to gaming and spend countless hours on it apply here, too.  


Tinder and Hinge are owned by the publicly-traded Match Group while Bumble is now publicly-traded and both answer to shareholders first. This means that any metrics and guidance these companies provide to shareholders that accelerate user growth, maintain user retention, and generate more revenue per user than in previous quarters are likely going to contribute to corporate strategy.  


\*\*What is the alternative?\*\*  
Research has shown that the key ingredients for a healthy relationship are not having perfectly-aligned profile interests or data-driven algorithms, but instead long-term trust, rapport, and openness. These qualities are ones that are much more likely to be shared through interacting with your community on a regular basis, and being present when you are out, which is a big ask considering most people have their smartphones out when they're out of the house.   


In practice, this would look like saying hi to a stranger at your school/library/metro, volunteering with others for a good cause, joining a recreational sports league or simply having your awareness up and \*\*looking at other people\*\* as you walk around town.   


I've personally joined a couple of volunteer groups in my city in the last couple years, and while neither has resulted in any relationship, the people I volunteer with are great. I'm forced to interact with most of them monthly, and it creates a long-term trust between us that allows me to see a more holistic version of them, and not just a lifeless, two-dimensional caricature.  


\*\*Takeaway\*\*  
Being able to establish connections in person is something we have largely been unable to do during the COVID-19 pandemic, but coming out of it gives us all an opportunity to step back into much more genuine human-to-human interactions.  


Do you see a way that we can influence our local communities to be more conducive to creating opportunities to meet others?

It started with a FWB type of thing but things have changed into something more intimate and sweet. He slept with me last night and I asked him if he would stay tonight as well. He always tells me he’s busy with his sister and he’ll bring her out to dinner tonight and probably will stay at her home. I really want to believe it. Then I asked him if he would be free on Sunday but he told me he will be busy all day. In that moment I just got a little upset, mainly because I really wanted to spend more time with him and I started to have some flashbacks from my previous relationship (when he lied to me and was cheating on me with another girl). 
Once he noticed I was kinda annoyed he started to try to kiss and hug me but I just bounced back. Then he tried to have sex but he were saying from the past two hours he had to leave at 10:30 so I told him no because he had to leave (it was already almost 11:00). That seemed like he wanted to “make me a favor” by kissing me and having sex. 
I became cold and indirectly told him to leave. He did. Now I’m wondering whether I was an AH for being “rude” or my reactions was okay since my “suspects” and his “oh I’m too busy” behaviour.

I guess I wanna ask like, how do I give myself self-confidence. How do I determine or find my self worth? And how can I portray that to people?

I am a 32 M. I broke up with my ex last year after being in a relationship with her for almost 9 years. It was the hardest decision I ever made and made me go through the worst experience I had ever gone through in my life.

My confidence went down the drain.

All of my insecurities came to light.

I felt like the smallest person in the world.

I then remember using dating apps for the very first time after 4 months and it was the weirdest experience. I felt like I wasn't ready yet to start dating, but I felt like I took a necessary first step to at least meet new people.

After around 8 months is when I truly started to be really better. I then began dating again and felt a newfound confidence. However, in the country I was living in, I wasn't able to get the COVID-19 vaccine yet, so I didn't date much. I have OCD and so knowing that I didn't have the vaccine made me really worried that someone could get it from me, especially a family member.

So, I waited and then in July / early August, I got both Pfizer shots. Felt comfortable dating again and even got to know a few women close to my age, especially ones who were just visiting my hometown.

But then shows up a girl that kind of took my breath away. I met her on Tinder, we've been texting each other through WhatsApp and then we went on a date last Thursday. During the date, I felt myself really being pulled towards her and we even made out. And I felt a lightness about myself that I hadn't felt in a very long time. This wasn't the first time I made out with someone since my break up, but it was the first time that I felt something.

I'm trying to be as logical as I can be with dating. I'm not really that interested in committing myself to a long term relationship, especially since I'm really focused on my personal projects. And I enjoy getting to know people more. But when these type of emotions come to surface, I normally have difficulty dealing with it. Basically, I get excited when emotions like these start to show up and I've never been able to deal with them well. So I force myself to calm down and just do what I've always been doing.

But I hate it. I hate texting people when I'm like this. I hate the waiting. I hate that I can't text straight away (I do sometimes, but if I feel like she's not doing it too, I don't do it either). I hate that I'm not as confident about what I text. I hate everything about this. I basically become a little bit like Chandler in the first 4 seasons of Friends.

Even though this can be normal for many people, I think for me it has to do with my troubled self confidence and lack of emotional support I received (or didn't receive) during my childhood and teenage years. Only recently did I really start to think I'm good looking and a catch. And above all, I believe to be a smart and intelligent, yet naive person at times (which I like about myself). But because I love this feeling so much, and feel like I suddenly need it in my life (which is not true), I become a bit hung up on these emotions.

I know this is just a slight crush and the most likely scenario is this not amounting to anything, but I know I can still get carried away.

Although, I am happy that I at least had a date with her and got to have some sort of connection.

Anyways, I just needed to vent.

Maybe some women could tell me what's up here? Because I frankly don't understand it.

A year and a half ago I (M 28) met a woman online, and we quickly exchanged Snapchats and phone numbers. We met on a fetish website and mainly wanted to explore sexually together, but it turned into a closer friendship where we could talk about anything, and she felt comfortable sharing a lot of her struggles and private life matters with me, and so on. She is a single mom of one daughter. We met 5 times at my place with sleepovers and lots of intimacy. Then she suddenly blocked me and disappeared, and the whole thing lasted just two months. It hurt and confused me like hell, but then she reappeared on social media and we briefly would chat sometimes. She made some life decisions that I'm not going to go into here, but she lost her job due to DUI and had to deal with a lot of family issues too. I moved on, of course.

A year later she sends me an apology where she says she's sorry for everything and that she should have done this and that differently. She says she realized how much I ""meant for her"" and how good of an influence I was for her. She got her job back and seems more stable in her life now, but has told me she struggles mentally. I accepted her apology and asked her if she wants to come over to talk, the invitation is there. She then re-adds me on Snapchat. After this we occasionally talk on snapchat, and she sends me pictures and selfies for herself, but hasn't once followed up my invitation to actually met IRL. I've mentioned it like three times that she can come over if she wants to. The other day I said it again, and she replied ""maybe"". But then she keeps sending me videos and selfies of herself without ever addressing the invite or making any plans with me.

I recently got back together with an ex (broke up 3 years ago). Between this time, I had another boyfriend for about a year, and like most young couples, I had posted Instagram photos of him and us. We broke up, and I rekindled and caught up with my ex and we found that we still really care about eachother, and it’s worth a shot to see how things go. Recently, we were having a talk about “us”, and he asks me if I can “not post him on Instagram”. His reason for this is because it looks bad because I had a boyfriend before, and now posting about someone new ( if I posted about him). We’re both 21 years old, and in my opinion I think he’s being very unreasonable considering me posting him on Instagram is not , and was not on my radar. He says he likes his personal life to be personal and doesn’t think people need to know this kind of stuff. I can’t help but feel like he’s making me feel ashamed for having a boyfriend before him?

My(24F) fiancé(28M) and I have been together for almost 4 year and I love him very much. He’s very patient and understanding. Back in April I had a mental break and ended up saying some unfriendly things to him (I was tipsy). I was literally blocking him from using the bathroom. He had to physically move me (push me back a little) and every since then my mental health has kinda been up and down. I’ve accused him of being abusive, cheating and just recently gay. And I hate it. My fiancé has never once called me out my name or even cursed at me. 

When he had to move me back, I accused him of abuse and he was taken aback. 

I really have no evidence for the cheating accusations. I saw some black hair in the sink and there was a small blood stain on the sheets and I immediately thought the worse. I told him and he calmly said “babe, your hair is black. It’s probably yours. As far as the blood stain on the sheets I have no idea about that. You have a key to my apartment. I have nothing to hide”. 

As for the gay accusation. My mom’s last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past so subconsciously have a fear of “omg what if he’s secretly gay?”. My fiancé is unlike anyone else I’ve dated or grew up around. He’s calm, chill, gentle, soft etc. about 2 weeks ago I made a joke about one of my clients (I work with individuals with developmental disabilities). This particular client is flirtatious in a cute way and I told him, jokingly “she might try to take you from me” and he said, jokingly “babe just tell her I’m gay” and I immediately thought the worst. My fiancé works from home and he’s a homebody but he sometimes has the option to go into the office. Recently he and one of his work friends went out for drinks and to watch a game. My fiancé asked me if I wanted to come But I declined because I wanted him to enjoy himself. This week that same friend asked my fiancé if he wanted to go catch a game this weekend and my fiancé handed me his phone so he could show me the text message. Which I felt like was weird because it was like he was trying to be overly careful, does that make sense ? 

I’ve been open about my fears and he’s reassured me that I have nothing to worry about and he’s reminded me that I am not my mom and that I can trust him. It’s just the “what if’s” that get me. Like how can I get over these crazy intrusive thoughts?

I guess my question is do I have any reason/evidence to question anything or am I overthinking?

I have been very blessed with my looks, I often hear that I'm very attractive. I like to take care of myself when it comes to exercising, eating well, taking care of my skin and face. I put a lot of time into my hair, clothing and so on as well. So I have pretty much what anyone would want to have, and it sounds so silly to write this down, but I really want to share my experience and the dark side of it. Trust me, I really don't mean to brag.

For 1,5 years ago, I was dumped from a 6 year relationship. It was nothing special about the breakup, we just couldn't see eachother so much anymore due to Corona. The result of the breakup lead to going out a lot, and I was looking forward to it a lot. I really wanted to flirt, go home with someone and get an experience on how to date and so on. In the beginning it was pretty easy, I think the first time I went out after the breakup I actually followed a very attractive girl home. I was ""proud"" of it the day after, telling all my friends about it and they were hyped about it as well, since they thought she was very attractive. Then it went on like this, basically everytime I went out lead to me going home with someone. After about 3 months of doing this, the problems started to arrive.

&amp;#x200B;

When you do this with multiple women, some women will want to stay in touch and eventually see you again. In the beginning I saw no problem with this, I was down to meet up again. But then when I went out the next time, I found someone new I wanted to go home with, and so on. This lead to me just basically being nothing but a fuckboy. 

I realized that I started lying ALOT, I could basically say that I wanted to keep seing someone just so that we would have sex that one night. The day after just lead to me having to explain that I didn't want to keep seing this person because ""I wasn't ready for something"".. pure bullshit, I literally only wanted to have sex. So there is the first problem, I've become an extreme liar. 

The second problem that has occured is that I don't go home with women because I want to have a good time, I literally only do this to prove to myself that I'm capable of doing it. That I'm good enough to go home with this specific girl this specific night. I don't really care about the sex, I just want to ""accomplish"" something. The result of this is that I never really get close to any girl, I don't feel any true connection to girls like I used to, and it is all my fault.

So right now, I am a liar, I hurt people and I'm just cold. I don't feel anything for anyone, I just go on. And I can't really stop and I don't know why.

To sum it up, because this is just a fraction of everything. The reality of being able to get whoever I want is that I don't go out to hangout with my friends anymore. I just go out so that I can go home with someone, that is my only mission for the night.. kinda depressing isn't it? And when I manage to ""accomplish"" it, I don't even enjoy it, I only to it to prove to myself that I'm good enough. I lie all the time, and when I lie I hurt people.. I hurt girls I've promised things and I hurt girls when they find out that they weren't so special to me that I made them feel. This is a nightmare, I really want to stop and I dont' know how. If anyone can relate then please give me some advice. I look myself in the mirror and I see this attractive guy with the ugliest heart in the world. I have tried to date a lot the last year, and I've probably been on 15-20 dates, with extremely smart, competent and amazing women. Yet, I don't feel a thing. The result is that I can't find true connection with girls anymore, I only find myself hurting them.

I'm an incredibly introverted person, not socially awkward I'm actually pretty damn good at faking it but I get really bad social anxiety and talking to people out in the wild is difficult.

Add to this the recent issues with covid and it hasn't made the situation any easier.

I've had some moderate success over the lastv1p years or so with online dating but recently it's just not working out for me and I'd like to try getting out in the real world.

The last girl I asked for her number worked at a drive through through to I frequented and we chatted a bit back and forth for like... 3 months before I finally asked her. 

I don't go out often or do very many things in a public setting, being incredibly introverted, I don't don't to the gym as I prefer running on my own, so usually I only meet people when I'm out shopping or out with friends which means I usually only meet girls when they are working or out with THEIR friends, which I've been told are not great times to try and ask for a phone number but that's sort of the only time I meet people.

Now I don't mind building a rapport with someone before asking them out, but I'm at a point in my life where I live in a nice place, I've got a good job and I'd like to start dating more and I just don't even know where to start. Ideally I'd like to try asking them out before having talked for 3 months lol. Especially since sometimes you never know if you'll see them again anyway.

So where do you meet people, how do you go about asking people out? if I meet a girl at the checkout counter, we laugh a bit I think she's cute and want to ask for her number, what's the not-creepy way for a guy she just met to do that?

Turns out we communicate with eachother perfectly through online and in real life. On a 2nd meet she drank alcohol (i couldn't cause i was driving) and she got wasted, we hugged for few hours. 3rd meet was almost the same as 2nd but i dranked this time and we spend the entire night outside, chilling on a bike ramp in a park. We basically hugged even more. And after that situation i slowly started to develop some feelings for her. There was another 4th time where we spend some time together and also had a few drinks. And yea now things got badly for me. Tonight she went with her friends to a nightclub. That's her first visit. And i'm so bummed out cause i'm bit jealous that as it's almost normal in nightclubs that people tend to be sexual while dancing. So um.. yea. Also it's because i have massive insecurities such as being too much jealous of someone, i tend to fell in love quickly which is not a good perk to have, i also overthink even tho it got less of a problem now after few fails and heart breaks. I planned on a next hang out with her to ask her if she wants to kiss me or just date me. Yea so this is an insight of my situation. 

The real question is how do i fix my insecurities ? I don't wanna fail again and again and if i do, i'd rather not have hard feeling towards her just because she rejected me",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1001917,public,self,How to overcome my insecurities and fears ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmg1n8/how_to_overcome_my_insecurities_and_fears/,all_ads,6,,,,,
