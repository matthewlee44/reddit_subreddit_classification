I asked her on this date almost a month ago and she sounded excited but when I ask when she is free she asks if she can get back to me on it. We are both busy with school so it makes sense. Then we finally got a day decided (today) and a couple days before she said she might not be able to because of prior plans for this weekend (she is going away for the weekend and wanted to make sure all her work was done so she could enjoy it). I asked if she still wanted to go and she said shed get back to me again but I havent heard back.

So the question is: Do I ask her if she genuinely wants to go or if she is just trying to let me down easier somehow or ghost me?

9,qhwkmt,1635455047,She wasn't interested in a romantic relationship.,"So this girl I was seeing for 3 months had recently message me that she had a good time with me but didn‚Äôt feel in the right headspace for a romantic relationship right now. She's been kinda stressed the past couple of weeks, and I deserve someone who will communicate much more regularly than she could. She enjoyed spending time with me, she really did.  


Backstory, after our date a few weeks ago, I had texted her I had a good time and looked forward for the next one.  So a week goes by and I scheduled another date, 4 days go by and I still didn't hear back so I told her what we should do on the date, still nothing...the next day I asked if everything was ok and wasn't wanting to throw these 3 months away (I felt I was ghosted by now)  then another week goes by and I sent a meme which then she hits me with that.


I'm starting to think it's more of the lines that our third date I wasn't esculating and mainly treated her as a friend who didn't engage tention.  

She's someone I'm very interested in, but never flirted with her to make her feel sexy.  Any thoughts on whst I should say back for possible future dates.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhwkmt/she_wasnt_interested_in_a_romantic_relationship/
10,qhwmex,1635455198,Is it really true that you will only be successful on dating apps if you are literally the definition of perfect in every sense of the word?,"Obviously appearance matters when it comes to dating, but it seems like women are only looking for men who have every physical attractive feature in the book: facial hair (that doesn‚Äôt get shaven once every week or two and takes work to maintain), large muscles, being 6 feet tall (I‚Äôm all set in that department actually), good-looking hair (I don‚Äôt like the feeling of gel in my hair), having a 6-inch D (I‚Äôve never measured mine), and having a strong face.

Personality matters too, but you can‚Äôt measure personality online, and I still don‚Äôt even know what it means to ‚Äúhave a good personality.‚Äù What even are good personality traits that will attract others? I know confidence is one, but I still struggle with that. Being socially anxious or weird seems to be repulsive to women, but I still struggle with talking to people in real life. I rarely go out to places by myself, and I usually only go out if it‚Äôs with a small group of friends and I‚Äôm invited.

Women also want men who make 6 figures. Luckily I‚Äôm a man who has a job that does not pay minimum wage, and I will soon be working in a position where I will make close to $80k a year, but as long as I‚Äôm making a living that‚Äôs all that should matter. I hate how women are so entitled to this.

I don‚Äôt have a Master‚Äôs, but I have a Bachelor‚Äôs, so that‚Äôs another rule of 6 that I failed. I would like to date an educated woman, but I don‚Äôt want my education to be the only reason she‚Äôs dating me, and I don‚Äôt want to date a woman who barely has an education because I don‚Äôt want them to use me for the money I‚Äôm making.

So I failed almost all the rules of 6‚Äôs. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know how long my D is. I don‚Äôt have a 6-pack or large muscles (I‚Äôm a little overweight but I‚Äôm not obese), I won‚Äôt be making 6 figures even when I start my new job, and my Bachelor‚Äôs degree is a 4-year degree (although it took me 5 years due to personal decisions). I‚Äôm not sure how I would describe my personality. Additionally, I‚Äôm not outgoing, I would rather sit at home and play video games than go out unless it‚Äôs with friends, and I‚Äôm nervous about talking to people, regardless of their gender, in public. I have some hobbies but I don‚Äôt do them a whole lot and even then some of them aren‚Äôt really that social or they don‚Äôt appeal to people my age.

I have been told for the most part that I am a 5, but I was told by one male that I was a 9. Again, physical attraction is subjective, but if I can only go up to, say an 8, is it even worth going on dating apps if I will be judged against all the studs who have their life in order? (And I‚Äôm sorry if my use of the word ‚Äústuds‚Äù offended anyone)

If I go on dating apps and want results it seems as though I‚Äôm going to have to lower my standards and settle for whatever comes to me. I don‚Äôt want to do that again because it hurt the last person (I got into a short relationship with her even though I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her looks just so I could say I was in a relationship and I was desperate for attention and there was no one else at the time). It seems as though all the women I‚Äôm attracted to are out of my league. Swiping right on every single person won‚Äôt help because they will punish you for it. Eventually I‚Äôll be in debt because of all the dating apps I‚Äôd be paying for, all because I‚Äôm not perfect.

12,qhwsyw,1635455738,Invited a girl I know was into me out to the club. She never responded.,"So a year ago I started talking to this girl at work. We really hit it off and we began texting each other pretty often. She had a boyfriend at the time but it didn't stop her from flirting with me every time we worked together and over text, driving me home from work every shift, telling me I'm cute on multiple occasions, talking about me constantly to all her friends, and constantly telling me that we should go out for drinks or to the movies something.

Eventually she broke up with her boyfriend, and made it really clear to me that they had broken up (brought it up to me multiple times out of the blue). I didn't ask about her boyfriend or offer her any condolences (mostly because I didn't give a shit about her boyfriend), but later that night I asked her if she wanted to join my friend (she knew him too) and I at the club in a few days. She said she would if her new job doesn't schedule to work that day. So I told her to let me know.

About two days before we were supposed to go to the club I texted her letting her know we're going to pre-drink at my buddy's house first. She said cool and that she'll again let me know if she could go. The day we're supposed to go to the club arrives and I don't hear from her at all. I waited all day for her to text me and I didn't hear a word. 

About a week later I texted her about something unrelated and she apologized about the club, saying she forgot because she was busy with her new job, and that she still wanted to go out for drinks. So I ask her if she wanted to go out that weekend. She again says she'll check her schedule and that she'll let me know. I never hear from her. 

I asked my buddy about this and he says that she was into me, but I screwed up in two places. The first was for asking disinterested in why she broke up with her boyfriend, and that she probably expected me to offer to spend time with her. The second is that she was waiting for me to text her the day of the club asking her if she was coming. When I didn't text, she took it to mean I didn't really care about her.

14,qhx0kl,1635456387,Feeling insecure after rejection,"I've always been the one to ask a guy on the first date. I've never objected to being the one to initiate a romantic relationship because if it means I get to date a great guy, it's totally worth having to summon up the courage to ask them out. Ever since I've come to college, though, my confidence has been so shaken. I was in a long term relationship for over two years in high school, but we decided to split up before we left for school. In my first month in college, I fell pretty hard for a friend of mine from class. He was casually seeing someone at the time, but they split up a few weeks into school and about two weeks after that I asked him on a date. He said he'd rather be friends, and while it really stung, I was glad to have closure. So fine, whatever, I move on. I start hanging out with this other guy and grow to like him. I was getting better potential romantic vibes from him and after getting dinner together a few days ago and having a long talk about our romantic pasts, I ask him if he'd like to go on a date sometime. He also says no, that he'd rather be friends, and I've sort of been reeling since.

I'm just starting to feel so much less confident in myself. It seems like no guy is ever just interested in me first. I've never actually had a guy ask me out before; I've only ever been asked on a date in return after I'd already initiated multiple dates with that person. Even my last long-term boyfriend told me that he was not interested in me before I asked him out and it was my interest in him that made me appealing to him. I'm also just feeling really scared that I only managed to pull guys in high school due to the scarcity of people in my small town and now in college no one will be interested in me. I'm tired of being rejected and don't imagine I'll ask a guy out again anytime soon, but past precedent is telling me that if I don't ask, I have no hope. Damn man.

16,qhx6p4,1635456887,Men who immediately jump into sexual innuendos / men who pop up after months of 0 contact,"In the past year or so I‚Äôve been consistently hit with two scenarios. I‚Äôve noticed that most guys who I meet through work/other areas immediately start getting very touchy, flirtatious and making sexual innuendos, which I‚Äôm kind of uncomfortable with as I‚Äôm not looking for a relationship, or any intimacy. 

Out of curiosity, is this a sign that a guy doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgenuinely‚Äù like me? I get the sense that if you really liked a person outside of some superficial reason, you would do your best to keep them comfortable. You definitely wouldn‚Äôt jump in making directly sexual jokes etc, or maybe that‚Äôs down to personality? I‚Äôm very clearly uncomfortable in these situations, yet guys keep doing it...? 

The second situation is random guys from my university days - some of whom I haven‚Äôt spoken to in 2+ years - spontaneously popping up in my dms and making conversation. Sometimes it devolves pretty quickly into innuendos, other times it stays surface. I‚Äôve had several of these guys ask if I‚Äôm free to meet and they have gotten passive aggressive when I delay (this is my fault, I‚Äôm really non-confrontational so I tend to give very vague answers in hopes that they sense my disinterest and let up, which never happens). 

It‚Äôs weird because the vast majority of these guys, I didn‚Äôt even know that well. Maybe we‚Äôd chat once every few weeks in a lecture or something, and they would never seem particularly interested in me.

I give up. I just can't do it anymore. I'm single and I always will be, might as well accept that I've been forced out of the gene pool.

I don't want to talk to any of my friends because they always talk about how great their SOs are. I don't want to go out because I wind up being the odd wheel every time and no woman ever wants shit to do with me. My mother openly tells me that she feels like a failure because she has a son who's 6'5 and can't get a girl, and my family just gets mad if I bring it up.

It depresses the fuck out of me and eats me alive, but I feel like there's nothing I can do and everything I try gets me the same result. I just refuse to have any more hope, because I always get let down in the end.

So, I'm done. I accept the fact that I'm meant to be alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhyecn/after_34_years_of_failure_i_give_up/
27,qhyinr,1635461007,Do you ever feel guilty after a breakup?,"During my last relationship, I really just wanted to be myself and stand my ground. Be true to my values, but now that I look back I think I might've been manipulative or even toxic (something I hate in people). An example: I was in another country for my career, and I was a bit in a culture shock. I wanted to meet new people and asked for her permission to use Tinder, I said I'd put in my profile that I only intend to be friends, and even said if it's a problem for her I'd set the match settings to guys (I am a cis-gendered straight male, but looking back it seems kinda gay. I really wanted to just meet people from that new country.) 

She also had her flaws. She'd intentionally tried to make me jealous, wear provocative clothing to spark up a reaction from me, but from my previous experiences I've learned to keep calm and just let women have their freedom (with the exception of cheating, etc)

I feel so guilty and I hate it! I don't want to be with the person anymore, she's with someone else now and I've even wished her good luck with her new boyfriend and said goodbye because I didn't want things to end on a bad note like my previous experiences.

Met this women (23, me 29M) a month and a half ago. Had 7 dates, last date she slept over for the first time (we have had sex on a few occasions before though).

She was always available when i set a date and she was always super happy to see me (kissed me a lot, super sweet, etc...) I'm not much of a texter (so you know i don't over do it) but i make an effort and respond in a fairly acceptable time.

How ever last date we talk a bit and she told me she was werided out about a freind of mine who mentioned me to her. I didn't understand why and she said ""i dont know why it bothered me"" and i just told her ""he knows i have been seeing you as he was there the day we met but im not going around telling people you are my girl or anything"", she replyed ""i dont care about that, never mind"".Anyways we went back to other stuff but it seemed like something there kind of changed.

She was less affectionate the rest of the night and she was kind of quite to leave in the morning. She did how ever say she had a great time after, etc, etc... and at 1 am that same day (it was a saturday) she told me she was just thinking of me and had a nice idea for us to do next time we met"".

I proposed Tuesday to meet and she told me ""i'll let you know Sunday, but Tuesday came and went and nothing was brought up. I didn't push and made other plans."" During this week her answeres to my texts were 16 to 24 hours aparts. She wasn't cold cold but more than before and shorter answers.

She ended up saying ""work has been crazy, i dont have time for anything anymore"" ""have a lovely day &lt;3"" . I learn not to go crazy when women pull away a little so i just replied ""Better that than the alternative. Work pays off!"" ""hit me up when your schedual frees up ;)"" ""have a lovely day too"". TO what she wrote ""weekends are ok but week days will now be complicated"".

Do you guys ever think about what could‚Äôve been with someone you once liked very much. Like there was clearly something under the surface of both of your feelings, but you never got to know what it was and still think about them. Even after almost 3 years, all the flirting and the little moments and time together still reside in my brain, and I kick myself for not actually pursuing her or revealing how I felt, because im sure I would‚Äôve had a good outcome. I can still see now all the of those moments where you could just feel that fire and thee heat between you two. And sadly I can also see where my window began to close and the fire began to die out until it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me do to my inaction.

I was pretty much a virgin to any type of intimacy so I picked up on a lot of hints and flirting later than I wish but I could‚Äôve, but I could tell she had some feelings for me and that led me to develop feelings for her. But I was so unsure, not only of her feelings but of myself and my worth and capability. Not to mention that family life at home was kinda turbulent. So even though on the outside I held it together and looked like I had everything under control, inside I was about as messy and out of place as my room at the time.

63,qi1bju,1635470090,5 Star Advice for a Healthy Relationship,"I'm not active on this sub but I thought this was relevant information to help all relationships, no matter what relationship you find yourself in.

All of us do a certain something to express love to our partners; coincidentally these are also the things that make us feel loved.

We call these Love Languages, because they are how we speak love, and understand love. If you spoke english to someone who speaks russian, they wouldn't be able to understand you. Likewise, if they spoke russian back to you, you wouldnt be able to understand them. Our Love Languages work in exactly the same way, and your partner will not feel loved or appreciated unless you speak their Love Language. Visa-Versa, you wont feel loved and appreciated either so long as they dont speak YOUR Love Language.

There are five main Love Languages. All of these sound good and romantic, but usually only one or two will speak to you the most.

**1. Words of Affirmation**
Saying things like ""I love you"", ""You're so beatiful"", and ""You make me happy"". People who have Words of Affirmation as thier Love Language feel genuinely appreciated when their partners say nice things to them. They love it when you leave little notes around the house for them to find or send random texts of love and kindness to them while you're away.

**2. Recieving Gifts**
For people with this Love Language, a gift is a tangible symbol of your love for them. It does not have to be expensive. What they are looking for is a thoughtfulness behind the gift. Giving a gift to these kinds of people leaves a big impact on them, and makes them feel special and loved by showing that you are always thinking of them. When they see it, it will remind them of you as well.

**3. Quality Time**
Making eye contact, listening intently, and giving them all of your attention. People with this Love Language feel most accepted when you are engaged in spending time with them. You dont have to spend a lot of time with them, but when you make your time together count, it goes a long way.

**4. Acts of Service**
""Actions speak louder than words"" for people with this Love Language. Everyone has a busy life, so when you take time out of your day to help your partner with theirs, it shows that you really do care for them. Things like making them soup when their sick, volunteering to do the dishes after a meal, and picking up their dry cleaning are things you can do to show your affection.

**5. Physical Touch**
Being physically close to people with this Love Language makes them feel wanted and loved. Innocent, non-explicit things such as holding hands, giving hugs, and cuddling are some of the best ways to express your affection, as it shows them that you need them and accept them.

**How can I tell what my partner's Love Language is?**
Quite simply, pay attention to the things they do to show that they love if. If your partner is always trying to be helpful and ease your burden, then their Love Language is Acts of Service. If your partner often brings you gifts, that's a good sign that their Love Language is Receiving Gifts. A Love Language is both how someone shows their love AND how they receive love. Asking them about their Love Language is also a good way to find out, but be mindful of their behavior as well.

**A Word of Warning**
I cannot stress the importance of a person's Love Languag enough. Over time, neglecting their love language will make them feel unappreciated and rejected. I have seen many relationships end because they did not speak each other's love language, including my own. I learned a little late that Love Languages are as vital to a relationship as water is to a tree.

67,qi1whn,1635472083,I'm scared of women.,"Hello! Thank you for reading!

Some context, I am 23M, consider myself above average, pretty lonely, in college. 

I think I might be scared of women. From what I have observed and learned in online dating has subconsciously instilled this archetype of a college aged woman in my head that is at her physical peak, gets attention from guys anywhere, has a lot of success with online dating, and is a generally very well liked person. The issue is that often project these traits onto most somewhat-attractive women and in turn, makes me feel bad about myself as I struggle with the very same things, so why would I bother? It is a strange feeling because I actually consider myself a confident person.  While some of these traits may be true about women, it's not reflective on what that persons life is actually like and the issues that they face. Not to mention the doubt it causes me.

How can I fix this issue and stop being scared of women?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi1whn/im_scared_of_women/

Not a big deal since she doesn't have access to a vehicle yet. But we talk about plans of meeting up and having a good time. The problem is that she will read the message or snap and then not reply. Usually not a big deal as life happens or we forget to respond. But its to the point where I feel like she's no longer interested. The worst part is that we really had a lot in common and respected each other's boundaries. Finally someone I feel safe enough to open up to. I have sworn off dating before because I got tired of being ghosted or used. It's to the point where I wish they would just tell me if they're no longer interested.

75,qi2s2p,1635475069,Confused with first Tinder date,"I (M28) went out on our first date with this sweet girl (F29) one week back. She swiped me and we started texting like 5-10 texts per day for two weeks. I asked for her number to move the conversation to a proper app like whatsapp since I dont check the Tinder regularly and I dont want to be too slow with my replies. She said slow is fine so I said ok we will continue texting on Tinder itself untill she is comfortable. One day she asked if I want to meet her for a coffee. We decided on the time and place (still Tinder was the only channel of communication) .
This was my first ever Tinder date and Its been 4 years since I went out with someone on a first date. So I was really nervous and rambled like an idiot on random topics. However she was kind and patient throughout the whole date and even seemed interested in knowing me. She asked me questions about my culture , my country (I am a new immigrant) my views on topics like politics and climate change etc.
So everything seemed to be going well ,but towards the end she got quieter. When the waitress came for the bill she asked for separate bills. I insisted for paying the whole bill but she did not let me. We came outside of cafe and she said that she has to go home and do some reading. I walked her till her car. The conversation during the walk was cold. I got the hint that I blew it and I told her that I was nervous and apologized If I sounded weird. She said I did not sound weird . She gave me a hug and we parted our ways. At this point I was pretty sure that she is not interested anymore and I was expecting to get unmatched by her.
To test the waters though ,I texted her on Tinder that night that ""I had really good time"" and she replied the same. Then there was silence for two whole days without a peep and I started to go through the date in my mind to figure out what exactly went wrong. So I decided to ask her ""was there anything I said or did during the date which offended you because you got quite suddenly "". She replied that I did nothing wrong and there is no need to worry.I thanked her for clearing that up .I was relieved but still confused and did not expect to hear from her anymore. However the next day she replied over my message and asked how is everything with me. I would consider that a conversation starter. Now we are still talking on Tinder for 3-4 days but it seems like she is making sure not to send more than one message per day. I too am just replying the message accordingly .

Now I am really confused  about where I stand. Its been mixed signals after mixed signals. I liked her and would like to give it another shot. But I cant figure out whether she is interested or not. Honestly I would not have minded to be rejected by her or even ghosted/unmatched. Is she just being kind by keep talking to me (barely though) to soften the blow? Should I go ahead and ask for a second date since she is the one who asked me out first and might be expecting me to take the charge this time . But her being sending only one text per day is not making me confident enough to ask her out.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this situation.

TLDR: Went out with a girl on a decent first date. She did not ghosted/unmatched though gave signals of a failed date and now still talking with me however way less compared to she was talking before the date.

81,qi336b,1635476119,I (28F) finally met a guy (34M) I can see myself falling for... but he's moving overseas in 2 months. Do I continue dating him?,"Hi all, tia for your time and advice.

As the title says, I'm 28, have been single for 2 years after a near decade long relationship. I've dated, had flings, and a crush here or there but nothing to write home about since the breakup... until this week. 

Context about him:
Met a guy (34M) on hinge, we hit it off on the app beautifully and set up a first date straight away. A couple of days later we meet up for our socially distanced date where he reveals (among other things) that he's spent the last 10 years working on short projects as a civil engineer, travelling every 6 months or so to a new location. The last 4 years of that he was working for a non-profit, building schools for kids in Africa. When he talked about these projects he really sparked up, and I made a mental note that this guy's passion was that job and that he might want to go back to it in future. His last project there ended abruptly due to covid and he was forced to return to New Zealand with 2 days notice.

Emerging dillema:
Fast forward a few days we agree to meet for a second date (currently this date is supposed to happen tomorrow) but this morning he messaged me to let me know that he's been in contact with people overseas in the last few days and has been offered a job back in Africa. This will mean he leaves NZ around Christmas time... in less than 2 months.

This leaves me feeling super bummed out and torn... on one hand, this guy seems amazing and we have such awesome chemistry and I haven't felt like there was this much potential with anyone in this way ever... Also, moving to Africa in the future, if things were to progress, wouldn't be off the table for me, just not in 2 months time. Maybe in a year or so..

However, 2 months is a crazy short amount of time to get to know someone before they leave the country... Long enough for me to fall for him very hard and him for me... but is it enough time before he leaves for us to be able to know we want to keep a relationship going?

84,qi3h3x,1635477452,feeling confused after the first date,"so to give a very brief backstory: im 21M, only been in two (that i count) relationships, both long term. my most recent one was 4 years. im not a person that knows ""dating"" very well. most of the time when i ""dated"" someone, or went on a date, there was already a mutually confirmed attraction, and we were basically dating already. 

so i recently went on my first ""date"" post relationship about 2 weeks ago now. i thought it went great- she is someone that i knew previously because we worked together a few years ago and remained acquaintances throughout the years. so one of the things i noticed about her almost immediately is that she is a terrible texter. which is fine.. not everyone has the time or energy to respond all the time, especially to someone you just started talking to. also, she doesnt owe me shit. im well aware of this. 

so we have our first date, and i thought it went really well- i know i had fun, and she seemed engaged and she was very open, as was i and we talked for probably 6/7 hours. she made a few hinting comments like ""sounds like your mom and i would get a long"", and when i hugged her goodbye she did the thing where she looked back at me before turning the corner. at the end of the date, she invited me somewhere the next day with her friends, but i had to decline. we're both FT college students, and i was working until later that day, then had an exam due that same night. but i made sure to remind her i would definitely like to do something else sometime soon, if she wanted to. 

now that was about 2 weeks ago. so the next few days that followed after that date, conversation slowly fizzled out- but shes not a greater texter... like at all. with the way i was raised (with romcom movies and whatever) i was under the impression that i needed to at least attempt to make conversation maybe once a day, once every other day or at least every few days- to continue to remind her that im definitely interested. so i tried, but she was a little taken aback by it. she still responded and reciprocated, but a little confused as to why i brought up a conversation out of random. so a few days after the date, i asked if maybe she wanted to do something that week (last week) to which she responded that she had a lot of school work (some exams that week) and that she wouldnt be able to that week, but ""maybe next week"". 

so that put my worried heart to rest a little.  then the next week (this week) rolls around. in an effort to not look desperate, i waited a few nights to message her. i messaged her tuesday night asking if she was still down to hang out this week- its now thursday night and i have not had a response. like im trying to respect boundaries here and give her the benefit of the doubt, but i feel like this is getting a little ridiculous..? 

im feeling very discouraged and extremely confused because there was a lot leading me to believe that the date went really well and that i shouldnt be worried, but i kind of feel like im getting ghosted. she could just REALLY be that busy and i would totally get it. and if she doesnt want to do it again, i can totally handle rejection- its just being in limbo like this thats killing me. because i feel like its too early to call it quits and be like ""hey i really had fun but i feel like maybe you didnt feel the same way, can i ask what went wrong?"" but i feel like not getting a response for two full days is also not the best sign either. 

am i being ghosted, or am i overreacting?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi3h3x/feeling_confused_after_the_first_date/

I‚Äôm trying to work up the courage to ask him out myself..but he‚Äôs older, recently divorced. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs interested in dating and I‚Äôm finding it hard to navigate this. We run into each other semi regularly so I don‚Äôt want to make things awkward.

He said hi to me the other day with a huge smile on his face as he went inside his building. But the time before, I couldn‚Äôt get him to make eye contact with me. 

I‚Äôm so tongue tied around him everything exits my brain. I‚Äôm too old for a crush and I feel ridiculous.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi3rqb/ways_she_can_show_you_shes_interested/

87,qi40vo,1635479406,Do I initiate sex or hold out?,"I‚Äôve been seeing this new guy and things have seemingly been going really well. We both work during the week but we‚Äôve spent every weekend together since we‚Äôve met. Either partying with his roommates or going out on dates. I‚Äôm crashed at his place 4 times now (we‚Äôve been seeing each other for about a month). The problem is - we‚Äôve only kissed twice. I‚Äôve initiated both times. And nothing more than a peck. 

I‚Äôm a little confused because he continues to ask me to hang out and he really does seem to be in to me. We are physically affectionate otherwise (cuddling in bed, hand holding, etc) but I feel like we are at a stand-still sexually. I want to sleep with him. But I don‚Äôt know if I should initiate or wait for him to reciprocate more so that I don‚Äôt freak him out and potentially ruin a good thing. Also - part of me wants him to ‚Äúearn it‚Äù a little bit? I feel like I have already set a precedent by initiating so that it‚Äôs very clear that i‚Äôm interested and won‚Äôt reject him and I want to feel desired back. 

I was thinking of trying to initiate sex this weekend since we are hanging out together for Halloween. Should I? Or should I try to hold out to get a better feel for the situation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi40vo/do_i_initiate_sex_or_hold_out/

93,qi4h1r,1635481022,FWB for 6 years?,"Hi I‚Äôve (26F) been on and off with this FWB (26M) of mine for 6 years. We met at an ugly Christmas party in college when we were both 19, and we just continuously talk after that. We hung out for 2 months, he goes everywhere I go and I go wherever he goes. And one day he told me his best friend wanted to ask me out on a date and kinda has a crush on me. I rejected because I liked him, not his friend. 

Later on, I basically confessed my feelings for him in the car, and he told me  straight up I‚Äôm not his type. He said I‚Äôm too tall ( not an important reference: I‚Äôm 5ft8 ) and he‚Äôs into girls with a small chest and just basically shorter like a cute ‚Äúshorty‚Äù. I kindly accepted it and told him that that‚Äôs fine and I wish him the best and I‚Äôm happy to continue be friends with him. And than that‚Äôs the first night we had sex, we were both drunk and tipsy. 

I did regret it, since I‚Äôm a person who does get emotionally attached,  I cried and I decided to move on. I had other guy friends who give me advices on how to deal with him, but I quickly picked myself up and focused on my studies. He did keep on reaching out to me and long story short we both dated different people and in between we still have sex with each other within ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù.

And now we are both 26 years old and I just broke up with my ex boyfriend and he‚Äôs currently living with his girlfriend of 3 years. And guess what, he still tried to reach out to me and wanting to know when he can see me ,and he missed me, also told me he sees his gf as a little sister now( I rolled my eyes immediately). He basically texted me everyday on what he‚Äôs doing ,he really wanted to just hangout with me.

And I guess I‚Äôm just confused on how a guy can still be like this? Are some men born unable to settle with one person? Is it because he‚Äôs not mature enough?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi4h1r/fwb_for_6_years/

97,qi4ln5,1635481506,"I felt like I saw a ghost, but she was very much alive and real. And as pretty as I remember her.","I (M25) went through a breakup about 5 months ago. It affected me pretty heavily. It hurt me more than I thought a breakup would ever hurt me. I've been working really hard on myself, and I'm doing well. I feel like I have been experiencing a lot of growth. I probably went about a month without even thinking about my ex. 

That changed this past week. I woke up on Wednesday and she was really heavy on my mind. I'm not exactly sure why. She stayed on my mind all day yesterday and today. I decided to get out of the house and distract myself. I don't know what kind of sick joke the universe is playing on me this week, but when I went to the store today, I came almost face to face with my ex while I was at the register... I don't know if she noticed me but I pretended not to see her and left the building. Which was a mistake, I wish I had played it cool and said hello to her. 

Anyway, on my way home I was having deep, profound and sad thoughts about how someone who used to bring such warmth into my life could now leave me feeling so cold. I feel many of the same emotions I felt on the night that we broke up. Hopefully I'll be able to get some sleep and get back on my road to recovery. Any encouragement would be welcome. 

TL;DR - I ran into my ex today and it shook me to my core.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qi4ln5/i_felt_like_i_saw_a_ghost_but_she_was_very_much/

Naturally I was like yo, I gotta capitalize and see what‚Äôs up

She said oooouu and that she would definitely be down for that, after she did a few things in the morning and with a friend (which is totally cool to do u girl) but NOW IM STUCK

- IS SHE INTO ME?

Part of me thinks she knows it‚Äôs a date but what if she just thinks we are going out as a hangout- I guess that wouldn‚Äôt be so bad like maybe I should just take it for what it is?
