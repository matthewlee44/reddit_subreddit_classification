He found my socials and DMed me, and almost immediately asked for my Snapchat. I realize he probably does it with many girls.

We started talking, and we both acknowledged we were overseas. I understood this is just for fun to chat and get to know someone.

However, things turned out worse. He was very flirty, we vibed and having similar interests and such made it seem like we would be so compatible. He also teased me about stuff how he’d love to take me on a date and we actually planned our dream date together and mentioned it often to each other.

I started getting quite attached - whether he’s responded to me, what will he respond etc. He seemed very keen on getting to know me too.

Now - after a month of chatting, he suddenly got distant and left me on read after our last convo. He usually texts me goodmorning every day but not today. I’ve come in terms with this ending now. _I totally understand_ that this thing **cannot** lead anywhere bc of our distance, and it was supposed to be just a fun flirting experience and getting to know a foreign guy, but now I’m feeling sad and bit hurt.

Any advice how to move on and end this spiral of overthinking? How do I realize he’s probably not even the guy I created scenarios in my mind of?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqtdrm/how_do_i_get_over_a_guy_i_developed_a_crush_on/

Over text we seem to have great chemistry. We stay up to text frequently. He has told me it takes him a while to get comfortable with people (totally understandable) and that he has been ghosted before after several dates. 

The second date in person felt a bit weird. I felt like there was some disconnect compared to texting and there was some lull in the conversation. 

I had to cancel date three (supposed to be today). And suggested we do some virtual stuff (like watch something etc). He hasn't followed up, though we have been texting. I feel like I have to make all the plans and push the conversation but he has repeatedly told me he is interested and flirts, travels to see me etc.

It's confusing and feels just...incongruent, you either are attracted to me or you're not and it turns me off when a guy is too scared to show it!! If I don't get at least a hint that he is able to form a romantic connection (even a kiss on the cheek is good enough), then it will start to feel like we're ""just friends"" and it will be hard to picture him as a lover. 

Obviously if you notice she's rolling her eyes and closing herself off, don't make the move, but if she's friendly and looking at you often, then at least do something! Otherwise I feel like you're just friend zoning yourself (?). And there are ways to hint at it without actually making a ""move"" like complimenting the way she looks, at least making it clear that you are capable of pursuing a woman in a romantic/sexual way and are interested in her in that way. You could say, ""I love your hair""...""that shirt looks nice on you"", ""you have pretty eyes"". Doesn't have to be overly sexual, it could even be more romantic.

9,oquf5f,1627147901,Do tall/taller relationship-minded men have to be more careful that the women they match with or date want them for non-superficial reasons in relationships?,"This question could also be posed for “stereotypically attractive men” (defined jawline, big feet/hands, high metabolism, blue/green/light colored eyes, etc) which usually includes men at least 6 feet tall anyway but height seems to be coveted or even fetishized by women more than these other traits.
 
It is widely recognized and hotly debated that taller men are selected over their shorter brethren by women online and even irl and that shorter men have to compensate for not being tall by being successful in other parts of their lives at minimum to be considered. 
 
Does the superficial standards imposed by women over height worry or make taller men more cautious in who you select in a long term partner? Especially in instances where the woman is 5’3 or less and only wants men 6 ft and above to match with? Or has this thought never crossed your mind and you are just happy that women like you for whatever reason enough to talk to you?
 
I just thought this would be interesting to discuss and even thought this may be something that very attractive women have in common on some level with very tall attractive men because sometimes they complain about guys not having the right intentions when trying to date them.

When I reached out to her a few days ago and suggested my idea she couldn't do the day I suggested, but she did suggest an alternative day which I think is a good sign. 

I don't remember our communication patterns when we first started talking. But lately (maybe last 2 weeks) our contact has dialed down. 

She reaches out maybe every now and then now, versus when she would FaceTime me and text me first fairly often. We also used to have a really long streak on Snapchat but that got broken too. 

I made plans with her 3 days ago for next week. She doesn't leave me on read a lot, and at times if I'm busy and she sends me a message that doesn't warrant a response I won't reply either. 

She's still responsive, and she never gives 1 word replies or anything like that. She'll talk as if nothing changed, but the communication pattern change is obvious. I feel like our conversations end earlier and she will randomly not reply mid conversation. When this happens I'll go 1-2 days if no contact before reaching out again. 

I feel like I have been having to make the first move ever since our last date. She is responsive though and accepted my date plans I made 3 days ago. 

She's 20, and I'm 23. We have made out on every date so far and it's gotten pretty intense. Lip biting, shirt tugging, etc. she told me she isn't ready for sex so if it happens on this next date cool, I'm just going to go with the flow. 

I'm worried about the less contact. Yesterday I sent a mass snap to all my streaks/top friends last night including her and she opened it and didn't reply. Her and I had talked earlier in the day and I forgot to reply to her last message she sent me. I sent the mass snap late last night and she opened it this morning. 

I've never double texted or shown her any signs of neediness or anything like that. I'm just noticing this pattern/routine change.

14,oquzxr,1627149821,Who should text first?,"I'm in quite the dilemma. 

I \[F20\] have had a tinder account for some time now but I don't really go on dates with random people for personal reasons. A few weeks ago I stumbled upon someone \[M20\] who I used to know growing up.

We went to primary and middle school together and these years weren't the best for me. I was depressed, reserved and very insecure. I wanted to fit in every social circle but somehow that made me less likeable. We live in a small town so I knew people talked behind my back. The guy and I didn't have a great friendship as well - he never exactly bullied me, but he did insult, humiliate and make fun of me plenty of times. As to the girls he liked, I knew one of them - confident, outspoken, straight-up rude and my worst enemy growing up. That's why I was shocked he had a crush on me when we were 15. I knew about everything from my best friend, his cousin. He was always a bit mean and a lot immature.

Back then I was going through my first heartbreak, I loved a girl that didn't want me back, so I was trying to open my heart up for new possibilities. We started hanging out and he turned out to be a sweet, friendly person.That's when the problems started though. I was extra careful about pursuing a friendship with him. I believe in human kindness and he was the definition of my least favourite person - racist, homophobic, transphobic and the list just goes on. I was known as the big bad atheist-feminist-equality-preaching-bisexual-weird kid so there was a moral conflict. I didn't have the time to consider it though. He told my best friend that he no longer wants to try courting me because... I used to like a girl and he just couldn't accept that. I was disappointed and angry. As we finished middle school, we couldn't even talk without arguing. Safe to say, we were never even close to being friends.

Fast forward to now, I decided to swipe right on him to see if he did it as well. It was never meant to be serious, but we did end up matching. None of us texted the other. He followed me on instagram some time ago and he's usually one of the first ones to see my story, so I'm pretty sure he's interested again after 5 years. I'm curious as to what kind of a person he is today and if he grew out of his bigotry. I don't want to step into a serious relationship but I'd definitely like to get to know him better. I'm worried about texting him first though. I feel like he should be the one to reach out, after all sadness and embarassment I had to go through because of him. On the other hand, he might feel like he did his first step by following me, so he's the one waiting.

17,oqv71h,1627150480,Men vs. Women's Dating Expectations,"In no way, do I mean to offend anyone and thought this is just an interesting perspective and am wondering if it seems valid to anyone at all. Clearly, it doesn't apply to everyone.

I was considering that it's possible that heterosexual men have a slightly different perspective when it comes to dating due to the availability of women.

As we know, it seems women are spoilt for options so I think there is more of a sense of urgency on narrowing things down and not wanting to string people along. I think a lot of us want to figure out what is happening and label things pretty early because if it's not working out or leading somewhere we would like, then we want to cut our losses and move onto the next one since we usually can fairly easily. I find myself thinking, is it worth it to see where this goes and put other people on the back burner or stop dating at all while I explore this? How long should I put off dates with others for?

For men on the other hand, I feel like sometimes they have less choices and options so they can be more inclined to just ""see where something goes"" and spend like weeks or months figuring it out. It's not like they have a list of women they can be going out with so they'll just ride this wave and wait for the next one, if need be. Obviously this is a bit different if the woman is just absolutely terrible, but I've seen men pretty much settle for a woman as well just because that's pretty much the only one who's shown interest in a long time.

There's this customer who comes in-- really cute guy, tall, beard, a little pudgy/thick, just the way I like em'. He is 31. One of my friends is dating his younger brother and she suggested that I try talking to the older one. She said ""he's gorg, you're gorg, you should talk to him"", and she said he is very shy, quiet, comes from a good family in town, goes to work, comes home and goes in his room to watch TV or play video games. That sounds a lot like me lol, I thought we would have vibed over sharing similar interests, but we did not.. 

He came into the store yesterday and I thought in my head ""fuck it"". I told him that I think he is really cute, but I feel weird because he's this gorgeous guy and I'm just this dorky girl, and asked if he wanted to trade numbers. He asked for my phone at first, then he wrote his number on a piece of paper. I was ecstatic! Until I got off work and started texting him. He is SO dry and VERY short. I kept asking him questions trying to get to know him, he did not ask me any questions other than one; he asked me where do I stay, I told him I live at home with the parents. He lives with his mom and dad, too (so it's not like he can judge me for that). The whole time I texted him I felt like I was bothering him. I texted my friend and she assured me that he is interested and to just keep asking him questions. 🤨

I'm a virgin. I've tried to meet men in the past. Used dating apps. Met some at parties. I KNOW that not all men are creeps. But...I'll say I'm scarred by some experiences. Men I've gone on dates with have initiated kissing/making out and in many cases they'd escalate that to aggressive touching and make it clear they wanted sex. I'd politely tell them I really like them but I'd want to know them better before getting there. I didn't want to have sex on the first date. But they'd still try and persist. Even excessive fondling on the first date turns me off. I'd rather get to know a person and see if there's even potential for something long term before all that. But many men have been aggressive in pushing for fondling and sex. One guy even pleaded with me to let him touch me -after I said it wasn't okay with me-and when I apparently cringed he called me out on it. 

As a result, I'm now intimidated by simple things like kissing someone who isn't a boyfriend yet because so many times in the past it's led to this. But I know that this will inevitably get in the way of ever finding a relationship.

32,oqwkzx,1627155157,"So I think he ghosted, what went wrong?","Context: we’ve been texting since may, been on 1 date which went really well. He’s an extremely busy guy, first it was bc of uni then he was travelling for 3 weeks and just got back. I was waiting to see if he would ask me for a second date but it never happened so I decided to confront him bc he would literally text me everyday but never really opened up to me or asked me personal questions, yet kept sending me selfies and shirtless pictures, and flirting hardcore. I was like okay, let’s see where this goes, i’m not looking for anything serious either but why doesn’t he ask to meet even if he wants sex. So this is how it went:
(this is a rough translation, English isn’t our first language so maybe the meaning gets lost sometimes)

Me: are you free next week?
Him: i’m free from tuesday
Me: free to do what?
Him: well what were you asking it for?😉😁
Me: i was asking to see if you wanted to meet. We’ve been talking for a while now (almost 3 months to be exact) but I don’t see where this is going and what’s exactly happening here
Him: what’s happening is that ever since we’ve met I wasn’t in your city, but of course I’m down to meet you
Me: “down” isn’t good enough for me. Look, I think I’ve been very understanding, and didn’t have any expectations. Not even after our date, but since then a lot of time passed and I don’t understand what this is.
Him: well, to me it’s that I like you and I had a good time with you. I didn’t have any expectations either, I was thinking, let’s get to know each other and then we’ll see what happens.
Me: then let’s meet?😂 I don’t think things can progress any further if we keep doing this (only texting)

And then he ghosted. I would’ve been fine if he said he didn’t want to meet, this is way worse. But then why did he say he liked me and wanted to get to know me???",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oqwkzx/so_i_think_he_ghosted_what_went_wrong/

I understand that finding the perfect someone isn’t always easy, especially when all you have is a few pictures and prompts to go off of. But it’s not a game and it should be taken seriously. 

Just the other day I noticed someone I had been talking to unmatched me out of the blue. We had great conversation, loads of things in common and thought we would eventually go out on a date soon. But no, they even liked one of my last messages to them before unmatching… So confusing. 

If you’re not interested it’s okay, just communicate it and move on. It irks me so much when they ghosts or straight up unmatch. First of all, it’s disrespectful. Imagine if irl you were having a conversation with someone and all of a sudden they decided to walk away in the middle of it. That would be extremely confusing, let alone rude. 

What happened left me wondering if I did something wrong, especially when we seemed to hit it off. I would understand if the conversation was going nowhere, or if it was clear that the interest was one sided.

35,oqwsmd,1627155904,Want some input regarding this situation,"So, about 2 weeks ago, I met a girl on tinder. I started off with a relatively innocent message. Which in turn received a sort of joking, “you’re in trouble mister” sort of tone. This progressed into a sort of debate regarding the topic and it’s fun because I am kinda nerdy like that. This goes on for a bit, then I suggest that we go out to meet up sometime. She says that she thinks that’s a great idea. She gives me her Snapchat, and we continue our conversation over snap. This progresses into voice messages and we eventually end up calling each other (she initiates the transition of communication medium from snap texts, to voice messages, to eventually a call). We talk until about 6:30 in the morning and she has to leave for something like a vacation trip and we have spotty chats over this 1 week period. However, I assumed that she gets back, we would have a chance to call again since we had a great time chatting the first time and to get to know each other a bit better, but now she often times tells me she’s busy and apologizes for not being able to call. I am super confused with what I am supposed to think. She tells me that she is busy, and it is not me, but I find it sort of hard to believe. All my previous relationships sort of left me in a really bad spot (cheating, lack of effort, etc) so I am still learning to grasp my self worth (good improvements so far). I like the first impression, but I’m finding it hard to read the situation. I’ll elaborate if anything is confusing.

Um, what?! 

When I asked him if he is dating other women he's said ""no I am not. But if I'll be open to dating other women? I don't know atm"". 

I obviously ask him to explain, he's like that's all, no hidden meanings I just said what came to my mind. 

PS.We have discussed about past encounters and he is the guy who's into sexting and making moves and having sex. NOT once has he suggested anything remotely same to me, no flirtatious ""what are you wearing"" even.

60,oqze9g,1627164958,Can I save this friendship?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

We seemed to have hit it off completely, she has introduced me to her children and I thought we were heading in a good direction. Been feeling all the feels, pretty much head over heels. 

Fast fwd to today, a friend of mine sends me a snapshot of my girlfriend’s profile on a dating app. It states that she is single and she has uploaded selfies that were sent to me just a week ago. These are not old selfies as she’s wearing the gym clothes she bought that day and tried on to show me. Those photos made me happy, they were special because they were for me. 

I am absolutely gutted. I feel so sad. I don’t know what to think about any of this. She has made it clear that she is under a lot of stress and pressure with work and her children and really hasn’t been in the best headspace recently. I don’t know how to approach this.

My last relationship started when I was ending highschool and starting community college. It was with a family friend that I worked with that was 10 years older than me. He was very controlling and manipulative and told me I would never find anyone better than him, that would take care of me the way he did. My mom was very sick at the time and almost died. He would use the fact that my mom asked him to be there for me as a way to get me to stay with him. He would say ""I promised your mom I'd always be there for you."" It took me a year and a year to finally leave the relationship.

Fast forward another year and a half later my mom got a transplant and is doing great and I just got accepted to one of the best colleges in the country. I think it's time to start thinking about dating again, but I'm scared my last relationship was also my first.

71,or02we,1627167499,How do I approach a situation with an emotionally unavailable person who still cares?,"
I (18F) have had a connection with a guy (19M) since we were in high school. We used to talk and hang out and We had a connection that neither of us felt before, but he backed out because it wasn’t me, but his own internal conflict. He wouldn’t say why. We tried one more time a year later but he restated the same thing. We’ve felt the same thing for the last couple years, even though we’d talk and then not talk for months on end. Yesterday he decided to text me happy birthday after almost 2 years of not speaking. We caught up and had some really deep conversations and he finally expressed to me that he’s emotionally inconsistent, which I respect and understand because I too have some commitment issues that I struggle with. He told me he misses us and wants to keep in touch and I agreed to this. I’ve always worried about how he is from a distance so the fact that he said he actually felt happy that we were speaking was surprising to me. It’s the next day, and we haven’t talked yet.  I don’t want to reach out first because that’s what I used to do and it obviously wasn’t a good approach. Do I wait for him to make contact first because I don’t wanna disrespect him or potentially ruin anything. It’s been pretty complicated for the past 3 years, and I’m still really young so I wanna make it clear that I’m not in love or think HES the one or any of that. He’s a good one though and I’m making a decision to give this a chance but be a little emotionally detached because I refuse to get hurt again. 

Could someone please advise me on how I could approach this situation? It would be a little weird if we just randomly don’t talk again for a few years lol. For now I’m not making a first move to contact him today but I desperately need another opinion. This feels like a situationship lol

76,or0ujm,1627170430,Met a girl at the psych ward part 2. Have a nice read ;),"Follow up to ""Met a Girl in the psych ward"". More details than last time and filled in some blanks from my diary.

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and a lot of staff at a 24/7 facility. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. After maybe 2 weeks when I was a little more used to the place, one of the staff asked if I had seen this girl yet.

I had to admit that I haven't seen her. The nurse,my main contact, a Latina in her 50s said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when my contact introduced me to her. She was indeed pretty and seemed healthier than the other patients.

She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasnt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.

We watched a lot of Tv shows and talked. Our favorite show was catfish. I cant say exactly when we started flirting but it clicked right away. It started with her asking if I wanted a cup of tea and our hands briefly touched. We started doing this quite often. Her favorite was Vanilla and I preferred mint.

She started asking me a lot of very deep and direct questions. What I would do if I had all the money in the world, if I was the only person left in the world and so on. She was an extrovert and I was more of an introvert but with her, conversations were just easy. We could talk about anything for hours and we had a similar sense of humor.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.

We always sat at the same table during meals. Also some of the staff liked to join us. I remember how nervous I was when I asked her to play Mario Cart. I had no idea if she liked video games but she did and told me she used to play Skyrim. Her laughter when I touched her arm the first time after I lost. I fell in love with that laugh and it was one of the most memorable moments when I realized she was just as into me as I was into her.

She was also a good singer so we played sing star a few times. I wasn't the best but she enjoyed it a lot, and I appreciated her talent. And there was a painting room at the hospital. She was very good at painting. She went to arts school before she was hospitalized. And we often had group therapy sessions where we tried to paint something based on a theme.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasnt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.  I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated.

So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.  I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasnt ready and to be honest I wasnt really ready myself.

So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.  We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps.

And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors. They also became good friends.   Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drink and food

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I started visiting my sister quite often. My sister was often out of town too so I had the keys to her apartment. So I met my girlfriend (I would say), more and more often over the next months. Usually Friday-Sunday was the best I could do and we could go on 10 hour long dates.

It was still somewhat dysfunctional. She could have episodes where she didn't answer my texts for 7 days while lying in her bed crying all day. Dating me was stressful for her. It was stressful for me too but over time we came to understand each others illnesses better.

I visited her city this week. She was a little ill and hard to communicate with the first two days. But it got better and better. We have known each others for 4 years now and we haven't kissed.

We went buying some bubble tea. I touched her neck and massaged her for a few seconds. She asked me if I could give her a massage and I said ""maybe later"". I asked her to show me some dance moves and she did some bailey. She was a bailey dancer when she was younger.

I showed her some martial arts moves but it was mostly just an excuse to touch her. I had both my hands on her face and she did the same thing to me just to see if this trick of mine worked.  Then we walked for an hour or so trough a park. I have learned that I need to make her stop up every now and then and sit down or she will just get stressed and walk on forever.

After a little while I gave her that back massage she asked for earlier.  She got stressed out after a few minutes and wanted to walk again. So we walked a little more before sitting down under a tall tree. I laid down on the grass and asked her if she had heard this new version of the song ""Begging"".

So we laid there for a little while listening to my Spotify. Then I asked her if I could take a personality test on her to figure out what personality she was in Lucifer (a very good show btw). The test took about 10 minutes and she turned out to be an ENFP which was the Goddess of all creation. I on the other hand scored as an INFJ or Maze, Lucifers demon bartender.

I followed her home and we were about to part but I asked her how she was doing with her apartment so she invited me in to have a look. She showed me around her apartment and told me it was almost done. She just needed a kitchen.

We sat on her couch for half an hour or so and just relaxed. When I left, I expected that to be it for now but she told me that she needed to relax for a few hours and that maybe we could meet up later tonight.

2 hours or so later at around 9pm we met up again and went for a pretty long walk. It was still hot outside despite it getting late. We eventually got to a lake and she suggested we test the temperature. So we took our shoes off and sat there talking about reincarnation for a little while. A few fish and some ducks were swimming around and we were all alone.

She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim and I hesitated at first.  I told her that she had to go first. She hesitated as well and contemplated it for a good 10 minutes before she stripped off her clothes and jumped in.  I did the same thing.

It was the perfect moment to kiss her. I held her face and touched her lips. Behind us came a bunch of guys and she pulled away. A little ashamed we got out of the pond and we had no extra clothes.  The walk back was around an hour and we held hands a few times.

None of us were dressed for a bath really so we looked like two half drowned cats while walking back home. We were back at around midnight. It was getting dark outside and we were standing under the full moon.

I pulled her close with my hands on her waist. I then leaned in. She just smiled back at me. I went for the kiss and we kissed for maybe a minute. It was like the most natural thing in the world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or0ujm/met_a_girl_at_the_psych_ward_part_2_have_a_nice/

82,or1ool,1627173703,Confused and Conflicted,"Hey, everyone. I've never posted on this subreddit and never expected to right now since I haven't done any dating in so long. The situation with person I am seeing hit me like a brick wall out of nowhere and though it is absolutely amazing, it is really conflicting and I am not sure what to do about it.

I'm 19M and seeing 18F, and her and I are INCREDIBLY similar. We met at work two years prior, and for personal reasons on her end we didn't speak for the second year of that period. All is fine, and I am very understanding of personal situations. We reconnected and at this point we were both single! We met up and it was absolutely amazing. Of course, we met as friends and I didn't expect things to become romantic. We've always been very attracted to each other but we never really mentioned it (especially because before this we were both in other, less-than-healthy relationships; we were naive kids).

Now, she has told me a few times she doesn't know what she is looking for, and is still recovering from her recently-finished relationship (her ex is still being toxic and all that jazz, and I wish it were my place to help her with those things but I don't know him and it would be not a good idea to step in). I totally respect that and I care a lot about her as a friend whether or not things turn out to stay romantic between us. She means the world to me. On our second time meeting up (and we had been texting every day with each other, catching up like crazy), with a little flirting, we both confessed to having feelings for each other. Great! This made me feel amazing. I felt so happy that she felt the same.

The next week or so goes on and we begin flirting heavily, and we both can't keep our minds off of each other. Admittedly, I began to struggle with productivity because of how much I was thinking about her. Not my finest hour. Anyways, we saw each other a third time and this time it was at her place. I made a move and kissed her. That turned into a lot of released tension between us and it was great! Before the fact we had set both our boundaries on what was okay and what wasn't, because communication is VERY important to us. We went as far as we both were comfortable with (making out) and that was really fun! Obviously I won't get into the details of it, but we were now even more into each other. It also helps to know that we we're learning a LOT about each other on a deeper level. I find personality and someone's passions very attractive, so learning about her hobbies and aspirations has been absolutely amazing. She loves to listen to me talk about mine as well.

At this point we are doing things that couples do. We go on dates, we flirt all the time, we vent to each other when need be, we schedule a meet up right after finishing one, hold hands, kiss, etc. (basic new honeymoon-phase relationship stuff). We just saw each other today and by this point even though I tried as hard as I could not to, I've caught some serious feelings for her. From the day we confessed to each other I deleted dating apps and stopped entertaining anyone else romantically because I was so invested in this possibility. She even told me she wasn't interested in entertaining anyone else either. So we are even exclusive, to my knowledge! She told me she is worried about hurting me; she's still recovering and doesn't know what will happen if she is in a relationship so soon. I totally get that and support her wholeheartedly. Her feelings are hers and I want to be there for her no matter what she is feeling.

My biggest problem is this: I feel incredibly conflicted and confused with this situation. I've never done something like this and felt ""casual."" We cuddle, we kiss, we talk about deep things with each other, we are comfortable around each other, and the list goes on. We are practically the basic definition of a new couple. We see some aspects of dating a bit differently and that's okay, but I'm struggling not to feel a little melancholy about the situation. How do I get my mind off of her? How do I stop myself from getting too invested to the point of balancing my wants over her needs? Is this a normal way to feel? Am I being selfish by wishing she would want to be in a relationship? I know she wants to wait and I totally respect that and would 100% wait for her even if it takes a toll on me, but is it bad that I wish I didn't have to wait? And is it bad that I do small things for her like buy her her favourite candy when she's having a bad day and drop it off at her place?

And a side note, we are both super into plants and so I was at the store and saw these orchids that looked like her hair colour, and I instantly thought of her so I kind of impulse bought them for her and gave them to her today (she's been having a rough time as of late). She told me it was super sweet and she loves them but was that overkill? She told me it wasn't, but I don't want to be overbearing (and I feel like she might not want to tell me if it is, even though she seems just as keen as I do in perspective when she's not having a tough time).

I hope this isn't too long of a post, I just really need some guidance with this. I've been in a ton of relationships and this one feels a lot more comfortable and real. I feel totally out of my alley. Usually by now I see a major red flag, but with her I feel so confident and at peace? I don't know. She's amazing, and I just want to make her know she's special to me.

86,or2ae4,1627176056,Need advice,"This happen 3 months ago but still for some reason it still got in my mind and ego for the wrong reasons.


My main question is ladies have you ever stop wanting to have sex with a guy because he was nervous the 1st time you guys were together and did not perform at his 100%


Here is the situation, I'm gonna sumarize it in short sentences and paragraphs 

-met this girl on tinder on april, we saw each other 5 times 

-expect for the 1st date, all the others dates we saw each other on her house, she is 22 and lives alone 

-we had sex on the 4th date it could had happen the 3rd time but she was drunk that night, And I dont like having sex with drunk girls
-I remember since I met her I ask her what she was looking for in tinder and she said she was just bored and some friends of her told her she should join tinder that she was not looking for anything in particular.


-3rd time we saw each other was a little unexpected because we did not even plan to see each other that
night. She suddenly texted me late at night asking me to hang out with her in her house that she was out with her friends and that she was arriving soon to her house which it was true cause that night she posted some stories going out with her friends. 

-When I get to her house she was drunk laying in her couch.We started making out and went to her bed then outofnowhere she started saying opening up to me. She said the reason she lives alone is because her ex left her a couple months ago and he was the one that encourage her to go and move on together but later on he left and that she is still mad at him.That night she cooked me a meal, I even slept with her till the next morning when she had to go to work like we were boyfriend and girlfriend lol. 
-Then next day I went to her house again and we had sex.Not gonna lie the sex was not that good, we were both nervous specially me.I have anxiety and I get nervous when I'm with a new girl not all the time but sometimes I do. And this time I remember it took me a while to get hard while we were foreplaying  then I got hard but I struggle a lil bit to put the condom. 

-We tried a few positions I even finger her and eat her out, she did not gave me oral cause she wanted me to get tested 1st before she did that.But when she got on top of me for some reason my erection was gone.It was getting back up but I struggle to put the condom on and got frustrated.She said is all good I understand is not big deal.We watch tv and talk for a bit then she suggested for me to get tested so I had no problem with the condom anymore and so we could had sex raw and with no fear of catching anything. 


-Now me saying that she lost interest because of the bad sex is just me taking a guess here but I don't know I doubt it , because after we had sex she kept being as eager to see me and keep talking to me since the 1st day with the same amout of reciprocation even texting me 1st ,like there were no signs of a slow fade yet.Also the main sign that tells me it was the bad sex was because one day after we had sex I saw that she had uploaded a new picture on her tinder profile but I don't know. 


-3 days after we had sex I asked her through text what she was even looking for with me just out of curiosity and she said I answer you that in person.Then we saw each other again this time we made out but did not have sex because she had done laser on her vagina to erase hair forever ,which it was true. 

-Then she said she just got out of 3 year long relationship and is still pissed off at him which she told me before and she doesnt want to get on a new relationship while still thinking about him and doesnt wanna put me in that position and also because she is super busy with school and her job.But she does likes me and wants to continue seeing me she said she wanted to but was just not ready I said is perfect then I said to her whenever a female tells me that I always think is a form of rejection lol and she told me trust me is not that is just I'm not ready yet.She even deleted her tinder profile in front of me for some reason.


-Then we continue texting like we use to but a couple days after that she kept going distant like no longer initiating texts, then texts getting dry, sometimes leaving on read, sometimes being online and not even opening my messages, everytime I asked her to hangout keep saying she was busy.One time she texted me and told me the reason she was a lil distant with me was because according to her I was posting quotes on my stories that were directed to her and she was a lil mad about that but that she did wanted to keep seeing me that she was just super busy.


-I stopped texting her for a couple weeks ask her out again then the same answers I'm busy then I honestly got tired and a month ago confronted her about it, I ask her if she wanted to see me or not as she said back in april and she said 

-""I'm just not in a moment of meeting or talking to anybody you are a really handsome and great guy but I'm just too focus on my jobs and career now I don't want anything serious now even more after what I went through with my ex, of course we could keep talking but I dont have much time to see you"" I also ask her one last question, why did you did not wanted to sleep with me no more you were so eager to keep doing it? And she said I dont wanna have sex with anybody now. 

-This was a month ago, through all this time she kept watching all my stories litteraly always the 1st person that views my stories sometimes even reacts to them.She been posting some stories lately of some pot of flowers at her house which made me believe that the whole thing was a lie and she is dating someonelse or got back with her ex maybe Im overthinking, even tho I have go on other dates with other women I keep thinking about her.I wanna keep talking to her but I don't wanna fall in the friendzone category like just talking but not even seeing each othet in person. I have no problem going no contact is been a month since last time I speak to her.But she is very present on my stories.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or2ae4/need_advice/

89,or2igh,1627176982,Does anyone else ever find the person they’re dating to be… boring?,"I’ve been dating this guy for a few months and sometimes he just seems so clueless. He sent me a ridiculously long text about a dream he had, which I found bizarre cause I feel like no one cares about my dreams, I would never just text bomb someone about a dream I had. He also will text me and tell me random stuff throughout the day like “I think I’m gonna go buy a sandwich soon.” And I’m like…. Ok. What am I supposed to say to that? He’ll also go into great detail about work stuff but it’s all really mundane things. Like making schedules and writing emails. 

We have fun, it’s just sometimes he shares things that I really don’t understand. What am I supposed to say to these things? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just being an asshole? I feel like every guy I date gets to this point where they think I’m interested in every moment of their day and I’m like dude…. Your lunch is not that interesting, I really don’t care about your sandwich. I don’t think he’s endlessly boring it’s just sometimes I don’t want to talk to him cause he has nothing interesting to say. 

Is that just unavoidable in a relationship? I’m sure not everything I say is interesting, but I at least try to be aware if the person I’m talking to seems bored or intrigued. Am I just being a jerk?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or2igh/does_anyone_else_ever_find_the_person_theyre/
90,or2jmu,1627177118,My Boyfriend can’t stop taking Kratom,"So I (36) started dating this amazing guy (34) a year ago. I met him at my church and immediately was connected to him. He has now became my best friend. I was previously married 16 years in a very toxic marriage but we shared 5 kids ages (5-15) my Kids love him. When we first met he told me about his rocky past with being a addict. (Pain pills, meth and Heroin) he had been clean almost four years. I was great full for his honesty and didn’t think much past it because he showed no signs of that lifestyle. ( I’ve been around addicts my whole life) and we are so close and both of us chase after God daily. We are involved in church be do almost everything together. 
      Well 2 months ago, he came to me sobbing and told me that he had been taking Kratom for about a month. We talked about it and said that we would start a recovery program every week and get past it. I told him that he could talk to me and I would try to be understanding if he ever felt weak. Well after that I asked him periodically how he was feeling and he told me that he was doing fine. That he wasn’t having any issues. My gut told me differently.
So I went to our local convenience store and found out that not only was he still taking it but now three times as much. So I confronted him. After days of reading about it I knew it would be unfair to ask him to go cold turkey and also didn’t want to expose my kids to his behaviors-of him withdrawing. So I told him he had a choice, move back to his house or he had 10 days to wean and then cold turkey. (My kids left for their dads in 10 days for the summer) well.... it all went well. I didn’t leave his sight and we spent those days keeping bus, it was actually a good three-four days.
So Now...... everything has been great, we get along like little kids and so carefree. I left to Fla to visit my mother for 4 days and sure enough the day after I left he went and bought some Kratom. Not just once but twice a day, every day since I’ve been gone. The lady at the store called and told me. 
I am completely broken. I love him so much but I know I can’t bend my boundaries for me or my children. I haven’t confronted him yet. He has no clue I know. I go back home in a few days and I’m completely lost on how to handle this. I bought some Kratom drug tests weeks ago that he knows about. I’m going to ask him to take it. But not sure how to handle the conversation or situation from there. My heart aching and I feel as if I
 am mourning him already. 
Any advice or guidance would be so helpful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or2jmu/my_boyfriend_cant_stop_taking_kratom/
91,or2q0w,1627177850,An Indian long distance relationship.,"I have been started dating this amazing girl for almost 2 years now. We have been in a long distance relationship right from the beggining. I migrated to Canada for my future studies 2 years ago. We both live in the same building and were in the same school. We got closer and closer until we started catching feelings for each other. At first she was not that attractive or hot. She was actually 4 years younger than me and I actually never find people more than 3 years younger than me ‘Hot’. I liked her because she was kinda pretty, sang and danced really well, and was pretty much a great person to talk to. I loved our late night conversations the most. And towards my the end of my life back at home which is in india btw, we started meeting more often than ever, talking and laughing. I had actually dated her about 8 months before I left home. But that was a disaster because i jumped up on the opportunity and she said yes too quick. We had the worst relationship ever for a month and broke up. Ever since we remained freinds and got closer by the day eventually developing feelings for each other. This is was the time i said that we used to meetup a lot a we went for like an official date just because we both knew we liked each other. I proposed to her once again a month before leaving. She told me she loved me but is not interesting in dating for just a month and then breaking up. At that time we both did not have any interest towards long distance and so we both rejected that option. On the my last day, we met for the last time, said our goodbyes, and i hugged her for the first time which made my heart do a backflip. I had a connecting flight from Qatar to Montreal. So here i was waiting for my second flight. That is when she texts me. She confesses everything which I already knew. She said how much she loved me and that she will miss me a lot and that she wishes me best of luck. At that time i knew i was so in love with this girl. I kinda wished that she was also interested in long distance but when she said all this stuff, i kinda wanted a long distance with her because anything is better than nothing. I reached montreal the next day. For the next 3 days we texted like crazy, sending kisses and loves like we always do even though we are not dating. She is not really a call type of girl but those 3 days we video called almost every second of the day. I was literally falling for her every minute and i felt guilty of not able to make her mine when i had the chance. The next day, it happened. She gives me a hint about long distance. She tells how a lot of her freinds have done long distance and that she doesn’t think now that it will be a bad idea. I got excited when she said that. I immediately asked her. “ So do you think we pull off a long distance relationship?” She said yes. And then she asked me am I interested. I dint reply anything because i was too excited. She then asked me “Yes or no”. I asked her back “ Wait a minute. Are you proposing me?” She said yes. Tears filled my eyes as i was about to make one of the best decisions of my life . I said yes. And now for almost 2 years we have been in a very successful and romantic long distance relationship. Even though we are 25,000 miles away. Our hearts cannot be closer. We have already decided to spend the rest of our lives with each other. I know this is kinda early to truly decide whether this will last till marriage. But i dont know. I have never loved a girl with so much dedication and passion as i have loves this girl and i get as much love from her. And if we could do this in a long distance relationship. Im pretty sure we can in a normal one. Im planning to go visit india within 4 months and to see the love of my life again and spend a wonderful time with her. We have totally mastered the art of long distance even though there have been tough times. For example, now is actually a very tough time for us because her dad found out about this relationship and like any indian parent, he took away her phone and now we can only text each other via her laptop which she only uses while attending online classes. That time is when we text and if we are lucky, call also. And puberty really hit her. She turned from an average pretty girl to an absolutely hot goddess whose latest instagram pictures i admire everyday. Yea so thats it.

96,or34ua,1627179544,When is a FWB more than just a FWB?,"I've had FWB situations before, and they usually end up with one person being hurt or both people ending up in a relationship. I recently ended a relationship that started as FWB and I'm certain that I want to stay single. About a month ago I moved to a new town and met some new friends, then ended up in a FWB situation with one of these new friends. 

I told him I'm not ready for a relationship and he said the same, so it sounded like a perfect match, the comfort and pleasure without the commitment I guess, we both agreed to this. But recently things have gotten weird.

The last time I went over he told me I should leave a toothbrush. When I was about to leave I remembered that I left my necklace in his room, it would've taken me a second to run up the stairs to grab it but he told me to pick it up next time, it felt like he wanted me to leave things there. Another time he dressed me up in his clothes so we could meet up with our other friends after hooking up but idk it felt weird taking his things home with me after. 

It's starting to feel a little romantic, he whispers sweet things like ""I'm so happy you're here with me right now"" when we cuddle in bed, and he asks me to sleep on his side of the bed so when I'm not there he can smell my perfume as he sleeps. 

The thing that triggered my overthinking was when we were cuddling and he asked me to take a selfie of us because he wanted to remember this moment.

I know the best way to solve this would be to just ask him, so I did, and he told me he doesn't want a relationship at all, but his actions are saying otherwise (in my opinion anyway). 

An outsiders opinion would be much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or34ua/when_is_a_fwb_more_than_just_a_fwb/

In my time in these cities, everyone in my age range falls into one of three buckets - 1) young, drunk, and looking to jump; 2) married/LTR and completely off the market; or 3) dating extremely, extremely wealthy guys who you can’t compete with.

I’ve tried dating apps, I’ve tried meeting chicks at the bars, I’ve even joined some intramural teams, but it’s tough to find quality women who genuinely want to date. At times, I think I’m the problem because I’m a very outgoing and boisterous person who can be fairly polarizing to people.
