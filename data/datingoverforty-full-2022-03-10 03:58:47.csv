I am a mother of two young kids and this is the first time I have dated someone with kids other than my own.

My boyfriend, let's call him Rhys, was married to his ex for 17 years. They had a very amicable split and still invite each other to family birthdays. They share 2 biological kids and 1 kid from her previous marriage. 

He and I have been dating 4 months and I have met his ex twice. I really like her. I think she's a great person and we get along very well.  I'm about to go on a week trip with Rhys and their teenage son. Would it be weird to add her as a Facebook friend? I  have my Facebook highly guarded and people cannot see any posts/photos without being friends with me due to toxic family ties. I feel weird posting pictures with their son without her being able to see them. I think I would want to be ability to see photos of my kids on vacation if my ex were with someone.

What do you think? I should point out that I know, with 95% confidence, that Rhys would say to definitely add her and this is why I am not asking him. I want to hear back from other partners in similar situations. I definitely will ask for his opinion before adding her to respect their co-parenting relationship.

I didn’t really read the terms &amp; conditions of this sub. Who does beyond mods? I’m guess partial assembly was required and I didn’t read the fine print. Sorry, that’s on me.

I posted a screenshot of a text exchange where I expressed being insecure after 1 date to the woman I’m dating yet after a couple weeks total of actually connecting. She called me on it and said she still wanted to meet for a 2nd date. You guys gave good advice, told me how you would have moved on from me, &amp; that usual Reddit hard love we give one another at times.

Date #2 earlier with her (now yesterday Eastern Standard Time) was SO much fun. We had no idea the place she chose to eat out at had 10 comedians doing back to back 10 minute sets. So funny! Then, we got to talk more after the comedian performances ended. During the show, we both caressed and rubbed one another’s arms, legs, and back… reciprocally. We both agreed that there will definitely be a 3rd date! She’s even talked about wanting to show me around the area in the future. Totally cool vibe that we have together so far.

Long Story Short: we may all have our moments of insecurity while dating, especially early on, but we should always value and welcome communication and instead of living too much in our own heads as I was, just appreciate what actually is… whether what is are the beautiful and perhaps stressful/anxious moments within the dates themselves or the time between.

My prior relationship was emotionally abusive and I've also had several of these types in the past, so when I'm dating and meeting new females I'm super aware of my red flags and behaviors it needbto be checked

Since I live in a smaller City the dating scene so far has beem pretty grim, it's a college town so most of the single women are too young and very few single women my age. So the last 8 months trying to date and doing meet ups has been bad, to say the least, I actually gave up and took a break for 4 months until recently. Im good-looking for my age and a  little edgy, but respectful and looking for casual first without all the commitment stuff just see where it goes from there

So I meet this girl on Facebook dating and we met for a drink after texting and chatting for 3 to 4 days, which went very well. I don’t get my hopes up due to the experience I've already had here. We meet up, she's fantastic, she's beautiful no red flags she works full time, no kids, responsible and level headed so I was optimistic and maybe something will finally be positive 

When we were done at the restaurant she asked me if we could talk more in the car since the place was getting loud due to a folk band was playing music and I agreed. As soon as we get settled in her vehicle she blurts out ""Can I give you a blow job?"" and it literally knocked the wind out of me. I looked down and was looking for a response, and all that came out was ""ok""

So, we have been talking ever since and hooked up 2 times at my place and I don't know what the hell Is going on and I feel a little uneasy with the whole thing and when I tell her I'm just looking for casual and a get to know and see and she says that she's cool with that yet I'm getting the sense she wants more right now

So my question, is this a warning sign of bad things to come? I have put her through the PD detector and was done thoroughly, believe me I know when they are. Or am I overreacting and she just likes me and wanted to have sex with me from the jump?

I am 40. I was married for 10 years than got a divorce because of her cheating. Spent a few years going wild and working on me than settled down. In a relationship for 4 years but we broke it off because it just wasn’t working. Now I’m looking to date again but being 40 I’m just not sure if I have the time or energy with two teenagers and working 48 hours a week for a full time relationship. So sort of came up with this. 

Ok. Good stuff starts here. 

I was talking with a few coworkers about what I want out of a relationship and this is what we came up with.

I have free time two nights a week and every other weekend. But with working 3rd shift it’s harder yet. So what I sort of came up with is an idea of playing house. Basically having someone come over, I’ll cook dinner, we chat, clean up, then relax with a movie or tv and cuddling. If she wants something intimate, yes it would be her decision, she could initiate it say key phrase or whatever. Than cuddle, maybe nap. Than by 9ish pm I have to get ready for work so she’d leave than.

This would be happening two days a week. Than maybe every other weekend do a full Saturday to Sunday date. Doing whatever. 

Would this be something women would be interested in? Or is it to hard? 

I would be upfront about it. It would not be a dedicated relationship or anything like that. If it didn’t work than fine. Just looking for opinions before I try to make something like this happen.

Fundamentally we are incompatible. Shes super extroverted, a bit on the wild side, super spontaneous and changes directions in life like the wind. For example once she wanted to be a Stripper for a month just to try it out. She has moved several times since ive known her which is about 3 years now. Shes also a Workaholic. She has been described as ""Sparkly"" by two friends and tends to garner attention wherever we go and im more low key type that blends in.

We clashed over the same 2 or 3 issues in our relationship. After a few months i knew this wouldnt work but she insisted that we could make it work. Basically this consisted of me just accepting things and defaulting to whatever the situation was at least most times. I feel there was more that i didnt know about. For example she would not let me on her FB/Insta because she said it would just make me confused and possibly upset. I insisted that this possibly wouldnt work out and she said it could if i just accepted who she was and she could show me how to adapt to constant changes. One thing she said if she ever got her own place ( or moved in) she would have parties and people over all the time. I remember she said this I would grind my teeth. Part of the dynamic problem is a me problem I understand that and i think thats why i always gravitated towards certain types...

She hasnt really said much mostly small talk. Except one time where i said we never took the 3 puffs of weed together. She said shes afraid because she may go to wild and jump my bones or something to that effect. Although when ""we got back together"" ( ironically around this same time last year) this is how it started...

We chatted for weeks because I had an exam. I first wasn’t super keen on him, but he messaged again and again. He was never pushy or clingy and after I got through my exam and was less stressed, we kept talking properly and met. He is lovely.

I was very clear that I’m looking for something a bit substantial than casual sex. We had a great connection and I did sense that he liked me. The age gap doesn’t bother him. It did bother me, but I got over it as he seems mature. I look younger than my age. 

After the date he walked to my car and we kissed. He was trying to make out a bit, but I wasn’t up for it, so I diverted his hands and I didn’t engage in it. He didn’t push it, I dropped him to his train station. 

I felt very turned off on my way home. I had a mini accident, well, someone threw a bottle at my car while driving. I got very scared. 

He msgd to ask if I got home ok and then wished me good night. This is usually heartwarming and a great sign after a date. 

I never had this before but I just didn’t respond because I was so torn. I like him but the attempts to make out came too early. I was also very upset about the bottle incident. 

I did msg him in the morning and told him about the bottle. So he thought the bottle was the reason I didn’t respond to the night time msg (which was out of character from me). 

We did make flexible plans to meet after work today and he did ask if I want to go to his place. I said no. 

I really like him and told him even though we met on Tinder I’m not ready but happy to meet for a coffee and chat etc. He said ok and then I thought ok, he drops the ball here and now. Lost cause. 

Anyway to my biggest surprise he did msg me at night again, but not in the morning. I said good morning first (it was always him before as he has an early start and I wake up much later) and he immediately responded. 

I guess I just want to know if I could save this from ending so soon but divert it from casual sex so soon to something more substantial? I know we met on Tinder but I heard of successful relationships that started on Tinder.

I enjoy hanging out once in a while to do stuff and I definitely want to have sex but I don’t think I am ready to integrate lives with someone else. The Single guys I dated either have expectations that I have a minimum commitment of spending X number of hours with him and text him X amount of time or are busy multi dating , juggling multiple girls which is a no go for me. 
I don’t want to have one night stands and the fwb situation doesn’t work for me. ( usually they cannot exclusive) 
Recently I met a married guy, I know it’s sort of taboo but his situation suits me in that he is in a sexless relationship and is only in there for his kids . We can only meet once a week which suits me. He doesn’t sleep around because he doesn’t have the time to juggle more people. I don’t get shit from him. He is typically not the type of guy I would be in a relationship with ( not connect intellectually) but he is nice and is good company. 
I don’t really want to be a third party or be responsible for destroying someone else’s marriage but this situation does suit me well.

I know there are a lot of conversations about texting on here but often it relates to people wanting advice about specific scenarios.

If I’ve had a great date, I’ve always texted pretty much when I’ve got home or the next day to say ‘hey, I had a great date, let’s do it again’ - and I’ve often texted first (I’m f45).

But I was talking to a female friend (48) and she said she still believes the man should text first and she will never text first. Her theory is that it’s the only way to be sure he’s genuinely into you.

I’ve always asked people out and had some great relationships along the way and some great flings.

Of course, there have been rejections too…

Most of the men will communicate a few times back and forth.  Never ask me any questions and only talk about themselves.  Even then its a big SNORE.  

So I was very intrigued when a man asked if I wanted to play “the red flag game”.  We were to take turns sharing our red flags.  

First it is important to note he had a few things I considered at least pink flags on his profile.  Yet, I still liked him because I found him attractive.  

The first being a tattoo of a gun on his neck.   (I let this go because I am personally covered in tattoos, but the gun image was a little out of my comfort zone. Especially as it was drawn pointing to his chin. 
It was hard for me to look at the tattoo and not immediately think about suicide. 

Second, pictures of himself with beautiful women.  One picture is fine but almost all of his were him standing with a hot woman from his tattoo parlor.  I was not chose to look past this, again because I found him attractive.

Third, the marijuana symbol was clicked for yes.  Nothing against this but it is always something I discuss because I don’t smoke pot. 

The game began with what we thought were pink flags, then crimson, then red.  I figured why not, it was more what “felt like” discussion than anyone else had offered.  In the end this was not a quality discussion, more like a “sharing of information”.

His red flags were unlike anyone I have ever met before.  My jaw was continuously dropping to the floor.  I had a hard time competing! Lol.

I don’t know why we kept the conversation going, I guess we were both laughing and having fun.  We both agreed early on we were in no way compatible except for sex.  However, in the end we decided against even sex due to logistics and differences in environmental cleanliness. Meaning, his bed is not one I would ever sit on. 

I was thankful to get right to the nitty gritty rather than continue communication and have gradual surprises.

Here are just a few of the red flags.  

He wanted to go first with a pink flag.  He said, “I have ten children.”  

I texted, “jaw dropped…lol.” He is 38, I am 48.

Then he said, “wait for it….from five different women”.

(Crickets)

Part of the game is we could not comment we had to just take our turn.  After remembering the hell I went through with last boyfriend’s crazy ex wife and picturing this scenario with five exes….(oh hell no) I shared my less interesting pink flag.  

Here are just a few of his red flags.

addicted to pain meds for back pain 

believes antidepressants are a way for the government to control people (i am on antidepressant, i guess i am controlled, lol) 

a felon for disturbance with a gun (remembering neck tattoo of gun)

warrant out for his arrest in the state i live in (he lives just over state line from me)

no drivers license

he gets along with two of the exes and talks to one of the two daily, the other three hate him and make his life difficult. 

he believes in pizza gate, that the world is not round, there is no gravity, we have political differences, aliens are here, (he did not lump these together of course, but i see them as all a similar red flag) 

he used to sell drugs 

he has more of a police record than the one felony

Thats just a few.

After the game we discussed the flags.  I say discuss loosely because he never asked me even one question about any of my red flags.  Hell, he never asked me even one question about myself, my likes, dislikes or anything at all.  (Never a good sign and points to a personality disorder like narcissist or sociopath) 

After a while I asked him why he was not asking me any questions.  He said, “if i had a concern about any of your flags i would ask, don’t worry.  If I want to know something I will ask.”  In other words, its all about him. 

He totally missed the point.  (I can not stress enough how big of a bad sign it is for myself if the man or woman is not asking questions.  it could be the opposite and they ask a million questions and come off as agreeing to everything i say, feigning interest, also known as love bombing).  

Communication should be as reciprocal as possible. Asking questions about one another is   essential to me.  Yet, this is the most common thing lacking with OLD or even meeting a man in every day life that I have noticed. 

So essentially I listened to him get all his red flags off his chest, shared mine to what felt like communicating with a wall.  

The whole experience was bizarre.  However, I learned that my own colored flags may not be as terrible as I thought.   

I am considering taking this game and using it when I begin talking online with another man.  It was a great way to see if he had ability to show empathy, reflect, make insights into his own life choices and mine.  

Lets just say he failed miserably in every way at his own game, except for one thing…honesty.  If anything, he was incredibly honest.  

However, for all of these flags I imagine there are more distressing things not shared because as we know there always are.  I would never believe he is an honest person knowing everything he told me. 

We have messaged one another a few more times discussing dating sites and other pretty much pointless banter.  No hard feelings that we are not a match and we both move on.  

Do you think I dodged a bullet here? Lol!

And I got another boyfriend whom I’m physically attracted to, I can have a good conversation with and he has a decent job (an engineer). He was super nice and kind to me like my ex husband. I could feel that he cares for me. I didn’t like that he didn’t take initiative to take the relationship to the next level or be aggressive in his career. We broke up after 2.5 years. (We lived together for 2 years.. Honestly I can’t say if I could say yes if he proposed to me) 

I’m aggressive in my career and I am a goal oriented person. Always do something productive, which tires me out but I just keep myself productive otherwise I’ll feel useless and depressed. I don’t like that about myself. 

Looking back, besides my first boyfriend after my divorce, my ex husband and my last boyfriend was super nice to me for no reason. After breaking up with my first boyfriend, I realize that I’ll never meet anyone who cares about me like my ex husband did, then I met my second boyfriend but I still wasn’t happy. 

Now I know it’s me who has issues. I look at happy couples or families at a cafe and they make my heart warm and happy but I know I won’t be happy if that was my relationship or my family because I’m just not satisfied or content. I hate myself about it. I always look for what’s missing. I try to appreciate what I have but it’s difficult. 

Im not dating anyone because I know it doesn’t matter who it is, happiness won’t last 6 months and I’ll start seeing what isn’t going well.  

I wish I was a different person. One of those people who is content and happy… 

It’s easier to control my emotion when I’m being single because most of it is within my control. But when I’m with someone, it frustrates me due to the expectation. People tell me don’t expect much but it’s difficult to drop it. I had to break up with my last boyfriend because the expectation I have of him bothered me so much and it makes me say mean things that I don’t mean. I felt relieved after a break up.

Per Match group (they own tinder and a bunch of other dating app) policy, anybody with a reported history of violence will result in a ban across all the Match group apps. 

Thoughts?  

Looks like we're headed toward if you have any reported history of violence, you should be removed from the dating pool and just give up.  Dating is a privilege that only those with clean records (which is bs anyway, a clean record doesn't mean you haven't done anything bad).  I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with that.  So a person with one mistake is branded with the scarlet letter?  What if a victim had to fight their way out of a situation- now they've got an assault charge and the the perpetrator filled a restraining order?  And I don't like Match's policy- anybody can just report anything, no evidence and they're gone?

This one is different than the other two. We had fantastic chemistry right from the start. Things have been accelerating at a faster pace than I really want, and I'm trying to figure out whether or not this is something worth pursuing more intentionally. I posted last week on DO50 about going for a slow burn rather than an incendiary spark, but here I am again. The incendiary spark is winning, as I cut it off with the slow burn possibility this week. It was just moving too slowly, and I honestly think she was not that interested.

In the past when I've gone for the big spark, things have inevitably fizzled sometimes quickly and other times after a few years. I'm wondering if it's possible when things start out that way to put the brakes on and really try to get to know each other first so you can both make an informed decision?

You know what I’m talking about. The college crush that turns into a romantic interlude but then, like a contemporary Montaque who met his Capulet, he is stationed in Kosovo while you follow your dreams to a colder place and fill the plates of brides and grooms, politicians or a gander of 40 seniors, flocked with purple, meeting over tiramisu and hot spiced citrus Wassail to banter as cribbage, bridge, or mahjong came to life.  True he was betrothed to a family favorite, and after a night of “ I’ll never see him again”, I went on to pursue a chaotic path of adventure, poor choices, and traveling to a gypsy tune that pursued the nest impulsive move, which usually shadowed a self- serving heart breaker and he... married the woman of his parent’s dreamed, served in the army and raced after his dreams, which he embraced, to become a lawyer.

Twenty years later, I decide to look up old faces and reconnect with people who’ve impacted my life.  You see after dizzying turns, momentous risks, and unfathomable hardship, my immune system went berserk and entrusted me with a chapter of immobility, existential calamity and regret for the people I lived for, least of which, was me.   I research his name and decided to contact him on Facebook after seeing ‘single’ in most places. Yes, of course I went into PI mode to confirm his status.  Two decades ago, we danced the night away and then greeted a chilly sunrise with a commercially prepared breakfast.  What followed, put to rest any idea of romance.  You see, a waitress, soaked me with water, after an interrogation of what I was doing with her best friend’s fiancé, led to information that was politely omitted from our sleepless rendezvous.  Unfortunately, the date was over but the situation worsened. I went to pick up my belongings from his residence and when we arrived, his roommate was on the phone with his significant other.  The receiver was muted as my date took the call, and he turned to me and pleaded, “ Just say it, and it’s over.  I’ve wanted to get to know you since I saw you in class.  I’ll leave her if you want me too.”  Her cries where tiny hiccups that echoed from the earpiece.  His eyes reflected the despair thar crushed my heart. This would have been my first relationship, but her sobs and the immorality any romantic endeavor would truly stain my karmic receipt. I walked away.

Twenty years later, he’s in my view once again. It turns out the marriage lasted less than a year. He remarried a physician and 13 years later they’ve divorced.  They actually met online while he was deployed and a shotgun wedding followed.  He confessed he’s never forgotten me and said “ just think of how peaceful, how much easier the last 20 years would have been if things were different. “. He claimed his feelings were genuine and when we parted he felt like he made a huge mistake. He felt like something was missing.

Twenty years later, we talk every night and we are making plans to meet and then I realize something. It hits me hard and  each brick of self- awareness pummeled me into this abyss of doubt.  He’s a successful lawyer, is financial stable and plays sports with a local league. Me? I’m the girl who went to college for eight years, met the wrong person and birthed the right kid, am on the outskirts of financial ruin because let’s face it loans and disability don’t mix.  I’m here comparing our lives and I discover I’m who I never wanted to be, jobless, in debt and barely existing after the pandemic baptized every success with immense failure all because I now am a semi functioning, single mom with a debilitating chronic disease. And yes, it poured negativity and regret and pity before I did what I haven’t done before and ghosted him.  It was painful. It was awkward.  It felt ridiculous believing someone who’s not  wavered from academia, occupational demand or financial priority would like a misfit like me.  Of course, I left my invisible state and ask how his day went or how he’s feeling, even joke about the beauty of my state versus his but the connection hasn’t been the same.  Now I sit here wondering if I did the right thing in arriving at the impossibility of a couple like “us” and walking away before I got stung?

Twenty years ago, he could have been my first love.  I even joked we’ll wait another twenty to be sure we should reconnect and he said, “ come get me I’m tight here”. Twenty years ago, I feel like I made the mistake of not taking an absurd chance....and now 20 years later, I’ve done the same thing.

Background: Group of coworkers (equal percentage of male and female) often go out for happy hour. Over the years some have left the company. 
Recently all reconnected at the old happy hour spot. Good times. 
I (43W) asked one of the guys (49M) if he can assist me with a large store pickup order since he has a pickup truck.
Days before the order came we ended up chatting on the phone about relationship outlooks, retirement and finances etc. 
The order came in early and he immediately (aka same day) to pick it up and delivered it to my new home. He volunteered himself for a tour and commented how much how he loved my new home. He had never been to my home before (even the old one) since we are only hung out in a group  In other words...he lingered. Lingered is the only way to describe it.
After he left, my intuition told me that there was something happening. His smile, body language and his little DIY tips while touring my home. Could it be that he is looking at me as a prospect? Nah, it cannot me. I never considered...It is not possible. I told my intuition to shut up.
I texted him thanks after he left. He immediately answered suggesting I have a housewarming party.

It wasn’t a shock exactly except for the timing.   We went on vacation and had a great time for a week.  But, when we got back she said she realized that she didn’t want to complicate her life as much as I would have needed her to. (I still have two teenage girls every other week; and we had been planning to move in to her house this summer.)
 
I get that her feelings are valid, and these are legitimates reasons to split up.  We had been dating seven months, and on vacation I gave her a “promise ring”.  Which I think was the catalyst for her to take a hard look at our future.  
 
Since the breakup, I’ve been a mess.  Can’t eat, can’t sleep, no energy.   And while I am not in despair or in crisis…it feels like each day is more and more bleak. 
 
How do you find the will to move on?  How do you keep the Hope alive that one day, you can find a loving partner who won’t quit?
 
I was always an optimist about dating and love.  But when I found someone I know loves me, my life that I built before her (as she called) it, was a dealbreaker.  (I will say that I was the first man with kids she ever dated, so she didn’t know it was a dealbreaker until she did.). I feel hopeless for the first time in my life.  I’ve dated quite a bit and have had some bad breakups that have left me crying and filled with anxiety and despair.   I’m feeling none of that this time.  Just have lost Hope.

Now it's like he's avoiding me. Did I go too far? Is he now turned off? 

He offered me a casual fling a few months ago and now it seems like he's completely cooled off. I'm a fit woman.

We are in the same social circle and have felt pretty comfortable with each other from the start. We've also been taking it slow and not having an ""everyday"" type relationship, simply because we're both busy and not really sure that's what we want anyways. 

Last weekend we took our first road trip together to visit a national park near us for a long weekend. We were both really excited and expressed a lot of enthusiasm leading up to this trip together. 

Previously our conversation with each other had always been pretty even, in my estimation. We converse well on dates, and have a pretty steady even flow with how we talk when we spend time together. 

On the road trip we talked most of the three hour drive on the way up, but once we got up into the mountains and closer to the national park, I was more interested in paying attention to the scenery than talking. She seemed to be just as open at first, but also kept talking about things going on in her life while I drove. I paid attention as best I could, but I also interjected at times things like ""wow, look how pretty this is..."" 

Honestly, between driving, fatigue, and looking at the scenery, I wasn't too conscious of what was going in our conversation and what we were talking about. I just said ""yeah"" and ""uh huh"" a lot. She either didn't notice or didn't care, because she just kept talking... 

And it just kinda kept going like that all weekend...

Luckily we met up with some other friends and she spent a lot of time talking to them, but I also came to realize that they were getting rather annoyed with her too. She talked nonstop basically the whole weekend. 

I have introvert tendencies and need some time to myself to recharge. I was hoping I would be able to sneak these times to myself during the trip but it didn't happen quite enough. 

As a consequence, I was completely mentally exhausted for the drive home. And she talked the entire drive home too! All I said for the entire 3 hour drive was ""yeah,"" ""uh huh,"" and ""wow."" 

At one point I asked if we could listen to music, and she turned some on... and just kept talking. 

I was going crazy inside and at a completely loss for what to say because the only thing going through my mind at that point was to yell ""OMG, STOP! PLEASE STOP TALKING!!!!""

I'm curious to hear people thoughts on how to address this. How do you tell somebody that talks too much to stop? Or is that a primary incompatibility? 

Or am I the asshole here? I sorta know that I can't really keep up a conversation as well while driving, and I also get more introspective when out in nature. So maybe it's not a big deal? 

The other weird part was this felt like a new and different side of her. I hadn't noticed her to be an incessant talker ever before. Was it because we were on vacation? Or does she feel more comfortable with me now? 

I'd also be curious to hear thoughts on having a talk with her in the abstract or trying to address it in the moment next time it happens.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,69302,public,self,How to ask a person you're seeing to stop talking sometimes...
