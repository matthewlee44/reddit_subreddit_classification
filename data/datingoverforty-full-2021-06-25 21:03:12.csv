It's been a minute. \*waves hello\* 

Over the last couple of months the guy I was seeing before the pandemic (we ended up parting ways because it was hard to sustain at the time) reconnected over the past couple of months. There's a lot of friendship / warm vibes between us, which is nice. But one of the things that I've been reminded about is that we are pretty different in how we work with intimacy and affection.  

Me - I'd consider myself a sensual person who enjoys being spontaneous and going with the flow of energy. Holding hands, getting close in public with light kissing, cuddling, snuggling. If I'm into someone, I allow myself to express myself in this way. I also enjoy building chemistry. Kissing, making out, having sex, making love all come from that place of freedom and building chemistry. 

Him - He considers himself a sexual person. Which, is not surprising from a male perspective given the common driver of intimacy is sex. He has been open to me about having some rejection issues in the past (he's got ADHD and rejection sensitivity is a thing) and so I think he has a hard time going with the flow or allowing himself to let go. 

So here are some examples:

He came over to watch movies and he got cuddly and it was nice but then all of a sudden he just turns to me and says, ""I'm going to kiss you now."" I laughed like, okay? And we kissed but because he was so *prescriptive* about it, the chemistry moment was kind of lost in me. 

When we've held hands in public he's been shifty with holding my hand. So like if we aren't interlacing fingers he will readjust and make it a thing and I'm just like, dude... just let it be what it is. 

We went to have lunch together and we got in my car afterwards to talk and he (again) says, ""okay I'm going to kiss you now."" And this time I told him that when he does that it doesn't feel very spontaneous and makes me feel like, ""okay, I kiss you now"" (say it like a caveman). lol He made light of it, but he's told me that the way his brain works is says what he wants. Key phrase is: *what* ***he*** *wants and when* ***he*** *wants it* which I think is killing my vibe with being affectionate and initiating intimacy with him. 

The crazy thing is he makes such a big deal about seeing me when we can (we don't get a lot of time due to schedules) and that's sweet. But I find myself losing momentum.

I just can't move tf on, and I don't know why.  This was two months ago now.

Note: Each date was exactly one week apart.  She only gets 1 day off a week.

I went on three dates with a 27 year old woman from Hinge.  She's very proud of where she is in life (resident doctor), and I'm very unproud of where I am in mine (substitute teacher living at home with parents).  

Date 1: We meet at a coffee shop and she's extremely talkative and nice.  During the start of the convo she asks me ""So what do you do for work?""

I tell her I work at the HS.  That I have a class of fifteen kids, and my job is to get them caught up since they were failing distanced learning.  I've been with them in person for a good 5 months now.  (This is totally true, but in her mind she probably thought I was a real teacher when I'm just on payroll as a long term substitute.)

We chat more, and she talks about her job A LOT.  Very proud.  She then talked about how her 22 year old engineer brother just bought a house.  Right afterwards she asks about my parents, and if we talk / are on good terms.  I omissively dodge the question and say ""yeah we're on good terms.  We talk!""  (In reality I effing live with them, but I didn't volunteer that info.  I just sat there holding my lemonade in a puddle of shame with a 100 yard stare).

During the convo I could tell she liked me a lot, or at least the person she thought I was.  You know when you can just tell when someone likes you.  I sideways hug her goodbye and left.  It looks like she wanted to stay longer.

Date 2: Before this date anxiety started pouring in like rain.  She thanks I'm established and nestled in a career when I'm the exact opposite.  I was so nervous about how I'm going to clarify where I'm at.

We meet at a mountain lake one hour away.  She looks super excited to see me, and started talking up a storm.  She talks more than any human I've ever met in my life.

We go to the lake for a bit, and when we drove back she asked again about my parents.  I then came clean about living at home and working as a sub.  She looked authentically hurt (eyes bloodshot).  Then she looked kinda mad.  I tried damage controlling it by saying I have 2 semesters left of the credential program and what not, but it fell on dead ears.  This was actually the only time of the date where she didn't talk for more than 10 seconds.

We later get dinner at this place.  Convo is whatever, but she's still being friendly.  Afterwards I hug her goodbye, and she burries her face downwards deep into me definitely not wanting to be kissed (I didn't try).

I told her I really, really want to see her again.  She said ""yeah okay sure!""

Date 3: I have no effing idea why she agreed for a 3rd date, but here we are.  We meet at a coffee shop downtown.  She's in a horrible mood and looks super tired.  She doesn't giggle at my dumb jokes anymore, and she now looks at me with ""ick.""  She's still overall friendly, just... something's significantly different now.

We walk around downtown, and I hold her hand (her body language on all 3 dates was 100 percent closed off.  This was the only move I've made so far).  We sit on this bench, and she starts talking more about her job.

She then nonchalantly asks me what religion am I.  I said ""honestly, I'm not really too religious.  I liked going to Church as a kid, but I'm really unsure at this time in my life.""

She then tells me she's a non denominational Christian.  And talks about going to a religious undergrad.  Shortly after she said she has to go.

I walk her back to her car, and I blindly just ask if I can kiss her.  She says ""no!""  ""Have a good night.""

I later text asking for clarification and she says:

""Our differences in religion is probably too much since it's a big deal to me, and our personalities don't mesh well.  I enjoyed spending time with you, and do wish you the best!""

I wrote her a nice goodbye too.

My questions:

1) Is there something specific I did wrong that crashed that date?  In my brain I think if I would have just been honest on date 1, then we would have clicked and lived happily ever after.

I was such a huge nervous wreck going into that 2nd date.

2) Why can't I move on?  It's been 2 months and I think of her every single day.  It's like her face is haunting my sleep.

I get so tempted to text her asking for a second chance, but I never do (obviously I have to respect boundary).  I just feel sick about it.  Like I blew it.

I’m not the only grey person tonight!” There was some cutesy flirty jokes about how old we are- old enough to have fought in the second world war and the opium wars, back and forth. 

Long story short, one of the guys was a newbie climber like I am. At the end of evening, when they were on the way out, I asked newbie climber if he was interested in climbing with another newbie. He said yes, and I asked him for his number. He gave it to me. 

So I’m very out of date in this whole dating scene.  I just have a few questions that I could use some advice/opinion, especially from a male perspective. 

1) he didn’t ask me for my number. So does that mean he only gave me his number to be polite? 

2) should I bother texting him if he didn’t ask for my number? 

3) do guys give out fake numbers or they give out their numbers to be polite? 

4) if I decide to text him, when should I do it? In a couple of days? Within a week?

I am a first generation immigrant to a Western country and have been here almost a decade now. I consider myself to have 'integrated' well, my command of the English language being at par with any locally born and raised citizen.

Looking back, my life in the country of my birth was fairly conservative. Without getting into specifics, let's say it was a close-knit household but mainly conservative. Marriage was drilled into the psyche as something that should be coveted and a worthy goal to aim for. Dating and relationships were a frowned upon and if ever pursued were supposed to end in marriage fairly quickly. I spent my twenties pursuing higher education and up until my mid-thirties even if I gotten into a relationship I wouldn't have known the first thing to do. I was a virgin until my year 4 or 5 in my adoptive country (that means I was in my late 30s. I know how it sounds, but these are facts :-)). 

I'm not religious but I do think some 'excess baggage' from my earlier life dictates some conservative behaviour - for e.g. I would love children of my own but I am not mentally prepared to take on a prospective partner's children (sorry if this comes across as rude, I haven't been able to reason well with this point), and marriage. I am however of the belief that I should be spending long periods of time with a prospective partner - that involves staying together, physical intimacy, sex etc. before taking a bigger step. This is a departure from the conservative mindset.

I will preface anything that follows with the fact that I look middle-eastern (my ancestry goes way back) and my name will seem almost comically unpronounceable to a Western-bred individual :-)

**Relationships so far:**

My first real relationship was via OLD and lasted 9 months and after that a string of 3 short-lived relationships lasting 3-6 months again via OLD. The last one ended in mid-2019.

**Problems (as I see them):**

I started putting looking out more actively on OLD in late 2020 but haven't got much success. 

Some of the problematic aspects of being in my situation is (feel free to give advice on any):

1)  I get questions like ""Your profile says you want children. You're 43, what has stopped you?""

2)  Some OLD apps (locally) have canned rejection responses and I get them all the time, e.g.:

""I'm flattered, but you're not my type"".

   Replies like these are like a knife to the heart. I don't blame anyone for having preferences, but it makes me feel quite lost at sea. Obviously, I am not super young at this stage and my profile pics can be considered just about okay, but I don't see myself looking like anything other than what I am.

I can hear folks saying 'look for someone who is of your cultural background'. I get that, but that too, in my experience has proved to be tough. Many women who're themselves immigrants ask me (first thing in their chat - ""So, where are you from?"". The moment I say &lt;insert same country of origin here&gt;, I get instantly ghosted. It's almost like being radioactive enough to deserve no reply.

Please throw in any pointers/clues about this one!

3) My profile write-up may appear a bit 'serious'. For e.g. because of the fact that only drink seldomly (not for religious reasons, but because I have never been used to it), many 'fun' activities can be ruled out. I am more-or-less introverted, but can converse in social settings (quite well, I think). I have talked about stuff like this on my profile and I see that that can be boring for most people.

Regarding 2) - I agree in advance that pics can be improved with professional help

Regarding 3) - Write-up can be fixed, but how?

Anyone else, with similar life stories - I'd love to hear your approach.

If it helps you, great.  If not, just ignore as Reddit noise.

In our teenage years and early 20s, it was easier finding jobs.  Basically, if it paid minimum wage, that was fine.  And it didn't, for the most part, matter.  Between me and my friends, we had all kinds of odd jobs from fast food to working in banks.  I oversaw a parking lot for a day or two (and apparently did it badly according to a regular employee).  But now, in our forties, we won't just take any job.  We have (hopefully) certain expertise and skills and a certain pay range we're used to.  It can take time to find the next job.

With relationships, it's very similar.  20 years ago, I only cared if I found a woman attractive and if she was fun to hang out with.  I didn't know what my core beliefs were, didn't have specific life goals, didn't have kids or responsibilities (for the most part).  And just like finding a job can take time, it takes time to find a good relationship.

So all I'm trying to say is... give yourselves a break if you're not finding a good relationship quickly (I'm certainly not finding one yet).  Things are different now, but that's not necessarily bad.  We know who we are and what we want (hopefully, for the most part).  It takes time.

Back then you had to guess what people will become or how they'll turn out.  Now we know who the people are.... They have a career(or don't), they are great parents (or not), they haven't spent time in prison (or have).... We can see how they deal with real things and better predict how they will handle the future.   

Letting us see other people comes with the added bonus of knowing better who WE are.   This is the age when we are mostly past the point of figuring ourselves out.   We should be able to be ourselves and take pride in what we have accomplished or even what we are striving for.

One thing people talk about is ""baggage"", but I only see that as the stuff YOU CAN'T leave behind... Mentally/emotionally.   Kids or a former marriage aren't baggage, it's life.   I'd have more questions if I was dating someone who never married or never wanted kids.  

Vibrant stories come from experiences,  and something great I found when returning to the dating world is that people are more interesting (or you can tell fast if they just aren't interesting).  People have lived, good and bad, and you can learn and share more with people, even if it doesn't become anything.

Everything isn't perfect though.   The biggest problem I have is that people our age tend to have more commitments and be more rooted.    Being a parent takes work and careers/jobs can be more ingrained into our life.   I'm not going out at night, when I have to get to work the next day, and I will be attending my kid's events/games many nights, even on 50% I don't have them.

Also, there are likely a higher percentage of bad apples, overall.  There are plenty of good reasons to not be married, but also plenty of people who are not married for good reason.  This isn't to say ""all the good ones are married"".... Just that more really bad ones aren't.

Making one more positive point though....I think technology does make dating easier/better.  Even if you don't like OLD (i have had no major issues), it's possible to see people on social media and do a public background check, of sorts.  Even reading stuff on this subreddit has been very helpful to me... Having a forum like this.  Tech has its ups and downs, but overall I'd take it rather than leave it.

I don’t date people over 50s and dishonesty is no no for me. I met about 2-3 people who looked a few years older than his pictures but not this much discrepancy. 

I couldn’t confront him just in case… what if he’s really his claiming age and looks aged because of his rough life path?

I know the ""adult"" thing to do is just to have this conversation with my partner, and I fully intend to, but I guess I really need to sound this out before I take the plunge:

I've been seeing this amazing guy for nearly seven months. We have a great connection - emotionally &amp; psychically. We laugh a lot and have so much fun together. Even just sitting on the couch on a Saturday night is a blast. The sex is great. We've met each others friends, workmates, families. Spent weekends away together. There's even been a bit of talk about moving in together (he intimated that). He tells me that i'm beautiful; smart; funny; that he loves my company. We've yet to have an argument. I know, that sounds like a red flag, and we've had disagreements, but we just seem to work things out before things escalate. Basically everything is great except - no ""i love you"".

We're both a bit ""broken"". He has a string of failed relationships &amp; women walking out on him. My ex cheated. When we started dating, I made it clear that I wanted to take things slow. He's been so respectful of that &amp; I really feel like he's the first guy who has genuinely tried to get to know me. There was no pressure, the relationship just unfolded at a beautiful pace. We only see each other perhaps once or twice a week, but that's due to conflicting work schedules. 

I know that I love him and I guess that's why I've been feeling anxious lately. My ex never told me that he loved me. Not once in the 5 years that we were together. When I told him that I loved him, it was not reciprocated. In the end, i'm pretty sure he never really did love me. He just loved my company. So that's left me feeling really afraid of being vulnerable and letting this guy how I feel. 

There have been moments when I've felt the words have been on the tip of his tongue, when he's stared into my eyes, and smiled, just not saying a word. And he makes me FEEL loved all the time. But words mean so much to me and I can never be in a relationship again where I am not told that I am loved, so I need to hear it. I haven't told him the issues with my ex, so he has no idea of how much of a big deal it is for me to hear him tell me how he feels. 

My question is - do you think I should just ask him, straight up, if he loves me? Because I feel that if he doesn't love me now, he probably never will, and if that's the case, then I want to stop seeing him and save myself the pain. I can't go through that trauma again. 

How would you feel if a woman you had been dating for 7 months suddenly put you on the spot like that? We're coming up to our 7 month mark this weekend, so I was thinking of asking him how he felt about us; about me; and whether he sees me in his future or not.  I'm just not sure how to frame it, without putting him in a position where he feels obligated to say it, then not mean it, if that makes any sense? 

Any advice, insight, anecdotes would be appreciated. I'm tired of feeling anxious about this, so I want to have this conversation at the weekend. I'll update the post and let you know how it goes.

Anyway....she had the nerve to message my BF in FB and tell him that the kids like him and how he is good for me yadda yadda. Then-and this is what gets me-proceeds to tell him that my grandmother had a FWB/BF/'Travelling companion' for many years but she had her house and he had his. Its true but WTF? The more I think about it, it was a backhanded way of saying he can never move in with us. Not that we are even in that realm of discussion. 

He was a little confused,  but was polite to her. I said don't respond to her messages. 

My kids went through a horrible abuse situation with their father and I have custody.

Reading and participating here over the last month or so has helped me make the most of some time off from OLD.

I have been focusing on some fun new work projects and am heading into Week 4 of a Couch to 5K program. In 2 weeks I have an appointment for a new haircut and some highlights, and plan to get some good profile pics taken that week. 

Then I’m going back in. 

Last time around I paid for a month of Match and only lasted 2 weeks before I bailed. This time I am thinking about Bumble or Hinge. 

I’m a writer and tend to err on the side of wordiness when crafting a profile. What are your best strategies for “selling yourself” successfully in a profile when OLD? Have you sought professional help or posted here for feedback?

My photos are usually decent enough to get more attention than I am seeking. But mostly guys seem to ignore the profile and just swipe right on pretty. I want love and romance and definitely not casual sex, but I feel like that is the underlying hope of most every guy I have met.

So how do I express that in my profile? And what are your opinions on ideal length of words and essential topics to cover?

I met up with him this past Friday and he told me that he wants to be honest and only wants *Simple, Fun, and Enjoyable* so we are on the same page. His phone was getting constant Tinder notifications with that notorious Tinder *ding*. He said he sensed mistrust from me- that he trusts me and doesn’t care what I am doing on dating apps and in turn I should trust him and not get jealous over what he is doing. When I brought up our drop in communication he said that he doesn’t need constant communication and I was overthinking everything.



I came back here to read all of your advice again and it’s ok for me to not want to be *one* of his many. I don’t need to be the cool chick that goes with the flow to make him happy. There is no dating future in *Simple and Fun* and it’s ok to want to date a man who only wants to have sex with me. Not me and every other women he can get his hands on. It’s ok to ask for a situation where I feel safe and wanted. 



Thank you- Thank You my dear Fellow Redditors and Friends for your responses in the original post. Please know it made a difference for me to decide to move on from this connection that doesn’t make me feel good, disturbs my peace abs requires a good deal of self sacrifice. He was trying hard to make feel like I was wrong- I was overthinking- I should go with his flow. Big Love to you all 💕💕 Honestly I can’t Thank You all enough for jumping into the original post.

I’m 46 and I’m just exploring online dating for the first time EVER. After reading a lot of posts here and doing some research, I settled with Hinge. Mind you, I live in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the US. 

- initially, I set up my age preferences 6 years up and down. Well, guys my age MIA, I guess they are surfing younger waters, taken, or abducted by aliens. I guess my best bet would be to go up 24 years, I’m sure 70 years old would find me appetizing. On a serious note, I increased age up by 10 years, the profiles I saw were really depressing. Horrific pictures, two words profiles, nipple action in pictures😑

- Then just for the heck of it, I went 10 years down and to my dismay, the guys were sharp, incredible profiles, professional photos, I mean, is like the casting of The Bachelor on steroids! And those in their late 30s, with the facial hair, they look a little older and I was like, “ooooooooohhh ok, I’m not a cougar, I’m not a cougar, maybe just a little, noooo maybe not, stop it woman…never mind” back to original age settings 😅😂

- and I didn’t know that Trump was a deciding factor in the dating scene for an entire country. “Dealbreaker: if you voted for  Trump.” Really? Back in the day, I only found out about my husband’s political party association until the first election after we married. He did his thing, I did mine, who cares? Sometimes we had a 10 min argument, the rest of the time, we had better things to worry about. My dealbreaker is that you actually spent some energy typing that answer. 

- and I basically received just a handful of matches because my dealbreakers are no hard drugs, weed or young kids, and I’m agnostic but I’m open to at least 3 religious beliefs.

I’m going to stick around a few more days for entertainment, but now I feel why you guys are so frustrated. I see myself deleting the App soon. The goods news is that I’m not desperate.

Neither of us were really looking for a relationship and we dated casually for about 6 months before becoming exclusive.  It's a great relationship.  We just get along and have a great time together.  We generally spend 3-5 nights a week together (depending on our kids' schedules).  We plan to move in together in 2 years when his youngest goes off to college.  We expect to grow old together.

This weekend he brought up marriage (as in saying he wants to marry me).  I don't know how I feel about marriage.  After getting divorced, I never planned to remarry (but also never really expected to be in a LTR).  I am typically ""a glass half full"" kind of person and in choosing to get divorced, I wasn't looking for something better; I was just looking to get out.  My expectation was (based on observation, etc.) that it was unlikely I would ever be in a good serious relationship again.  Post divorce, I started dating without any expectation of a relationship (had just been looking to hook up).

I admit that I find a level of comfort in knowing he wants to marry me (at least in what it says about where he is).  However, although ""getting married"" may theoretically represent a level of commitment that living together may not, realistically after getting divorced, I realized that marriage is really no more permanent than living together.  Additionally, I feel that my marriage lasted far longer than it should have because of that legal document (and of course the kids).  

I'm an attorney, so I know all about the legal benefits, prenups, financial issues, etc.  What I am trying to understand is why the concept of marriage kind of scares me.  At some level I do find it to be an extremely romantic gesture but then I also have all of these negative emotions associated with it (which I know partly have to do with my first marriage but also I likely had before ever getting married the first time, for example I never wanted the big wedding or any of that).

Then he messaged me and said about meeting up. Said things like ""can't wait to meet you, etc"". Asked me what flowers I like. 

We pencilled in a day to go out (last Thursday) and he asked me what area was good for me. However, I never heard about an exact meeting place or a time. He said he's looking for work so he's maybe preoccupied with that. I'm just confused how he's gone from keen to \*not at all\*.

**UPDATE:** For those who didn't catch my update in my original post, the woman who was the subject of it reached out to me Friday afternoon to see if I was still free to meet her out Saturday night. I debated on saying I was no longer free, but I felt this was the time to have a heart to heart that had to happen in person. So Saturday night, we saw each other for the first time since May 15th. I can't recount the exact details and order in which things were said once I initiated discussion about what was going on with us, so I will just present the main details as bullet points:

* She said she had been in a ""funk"" over the last few weeks, and for the amount of time I've known her, she does tend to clam up and keep to herself when she has things troubling her. 
* I asked if there was anything I had done that had her pulling away, had I been smothering her? She said that has never been the case with me. She feels I give her adequate space.
* She is not ready to be in a relationship where we are meeting kids/families. I relayed I am not at the point either, and frankly, I enjoy having each other to ourselves. I told her, if anything, I need to get to know her better. I pointed out, I didn't even know what her favorite color is yet!
* I told her just us going for a one hour walk when I have my short, kid-free evenings during the week would be great as a date, especially since we both want to work on our cardio.
* She explained in her previous two relationships, she found she had prioritized the needs of the two men, and not given enough to her 2 kids. I told her I would never expect her to do that to me, nor would I allow it. Case in point, I drove the 25 minutes to meet her so she'd be just a few minutes from her home, where her 13.y.o daughter was home alone. She relayed how grateful she is that I consider that.
* She is scared to go to the next level, because her daughter is doing so much better since they moved in February, and she and her brother are going to be starting in a new school system in the fall. To spare the details, both her daughter and my son have spent time at inpatient care facilities in the last 2 years for SI behavior, so I am sympathetic to her situation.
* I found it interesting, but she did say her kids have encouraged her to try and meet a man.
* As far as how she feels about me, she says I check so many boxes for her, and she really appreciates all of the little things I do for her, whether it's been a little gift like a plant for Mother's Day, to the effort I make in handling the reservations for our dates.
* I repeated something to her I've said before: I keep finding when I meet someone new, at some point in the date, I am comparing them to her. I basically admitted (though I probably shouldn't have) I'm crazy about her, and meeting her has been one the top best things that's happened to me since I separated and divorced my ex-wife; I have hard time with picturing her not being a presence in my life.
* At one point, while I was in this stream of consciousness where I was eluding to the fact that we may have to go separate ways, I saw tears welling up in her eyes, and saw her start wiping them away. Right there, I made the decision that perhaps I'm not seeing things through her lens properly. I leaned in, and whispered to her not to cry, and put my arm around her. I softly told her, I'm not looking to walk away.
* I brought up about how clumsy, rushed, and how selfish of a lover I thought I was the first (and only) time we had sex, how I wish I could go back in time to early last month. Like the last time I told her this, she laughed it off, and told me the situation wasn't ideal, we had a time constraint, but agreed we both wanted it, and I should stop beating myself up. I told her I am looking forward to the time we can ""do it right"".
* Our night ended with a passionate goodnight kiss in my car. This felt different, the way she was touching my face, and the way she was holding my hands.
* Before going to bed, I sent a goodnight text for the first time in a long time, and reminded her she can always talk to me, and she replied to me I can do the same.

Its been 2 days, we've been having regular exchanges via text, nothing heavy, even initiation. We have not made plans yet for when I am kid-free in 2 weeks, and since she is introverted, I doubt she'll be one to initiate plans. Who knows though, perhaps this talk lifted a weight.

However, I am quite reserved unless I hit it off with someone; I’m happiest when I’m writing, reading, listening to music, watching movies, and making art/going to museums. In short, I’m not “fun” in the way that a lot of people on OLD seem be. Is it even likely that I would find someone else who shares my interests on OLD? I would prefer to meet people in person, and I do have a friend who I’m interested in spending more time with, but I get the feeling that he isn’t sure how to interact with me now that I’m going through this. 

I’m also in a place now where, although I would enjoy seeing someone a few times a week, I’m not looking for a traditional LTR. But I’m also not looking to have random hookups, either (although I think that can be fine for some people, I don’t think it would work for me).

I'm sort of seeing this lady, we've been on two dates and text daily.  There's a connection and we mutually agree on that.  I stopped with the apps after the first date, so I like her.  She slept over on the 2nd date.  

But we got into a conversation yesterday that has me wondering how to proceed.  

We share a lot of common values when it comes to politics, religion, attitudes about relationships and so forth.  But we diverge when it comes to vaccines, and we diverge strongly.  

I'm 100% for them and in most cases would not date an anti-vaxxer not just over that but because it often signals differences in other really important areas.  But like I said our values overlap for the most part.  

She however has never had a vaccine, nor have her kids (she lives in a small village and just tells the school ""I'll bring the certificates later.""  And she never does, and it works every year.  She lied to her co-workers about it and she works as a head chef and restaurant manager.  And she told me that she doesn't feel bad because she has the covid antibodies.  

I said, ""ok, I can live with that.  Did you get tested or something.""  She evaded the question twice and then admitted that no, she didn't get tested but that she ""knows her body and knows she has them.""  

This conversation was via texts and voice messages and in the last voice message I think she was almost crying, saying ""I respect other people's choices to get them and wish people would respect mine.""  

And now I feel kind of bad because while I wasn't rude or anything, my inquiries were very level-headed.  But I like her and feel bad that the conversation didn't end all that well.

For me, sex is important. I want pleasure at the center of a relationship, but that doesn't mean I dont want all the other good stuff that comes with a connection with someone. Yet, dating for a serious relationship seems to require putting sex lower down in priorities.

Its seems to require spending alot of time in activities that aren't sex related only to find that the relationship comes to an end once sex is introduced. Or it gets unnecessarily complicated and the games start.

I went into the relationship thinking like she is the one for me, it was so clear in my mind because I was so mesmerised by her love and care for me. It was so good to live in this fantasy.

But a month ago, I had a realisation that I cannot go the distance with the lady and I need to end this because her goals and values just wasn't complementing mine. To put it context, I am 40 and she is 38.

I so desperately wanted to settle and so desperately wanted to get married and it seems that was a possibility. She is a happy go lucky girl and that in itself is not a problem but overtime it became a problem for me.

Her everyday life revolves around netflix and sleeping. She likes to spend money and spend more than she can earn. Her usual response to anything would be I don't know and then doesn't care to find out. She complains alot about her job and gets anxiety attack and then she would not do anything but sleep for the entire weekend.

When she was awake and well, she was the best gf and the most caring but that is shortlived. When I hear about all her problems, I listened carefully and give her genuine advice on how to solve it. When I suggest anything I will have to tread carefully because she doesn't appreciated unsolicited advice. When we go anywhere should would be on average 1.5 hour late and Im basically sitting around waiting for her. And another time when she cooked dinner I waited 2.5 hours from 6 to 8.30pm. The reason that it was so late is because she was watching netflix and only remembered I was coming later. Lastly, nothing gets done because she is always too tired, or I can't be bothered doing it and I'll do it later.

For the longest time, I ignored the red flags and kept saying to myself she is going to get better as long as I stay by her side and encourage her alot. I was making a lot of excuses but I was also thinking how is this going to play out.

Then a couple of weeks ago, she showed me some engagement ring pictures and at first I thought it was pretty cool but I started thinking about it seriously. Everything I've had issues with started to pile up in my head. I started to see that if we were married then there is no way that she will be a contributing partner in the marriage. Life is hardwork and the only reason she looks ok now is because her mom and dad do everything for her (she lives at home) and she can't even manage herself properly. I am thinking then one day I will be the one to do everything for her and all she brings to the table is love. Don't get me wrong, love is great but in reality that is not going to sustain everyday. You need to pay the bills, stuff needs to be cleaned, the usual upkeep of life needs to be regulated or else how is love going to work?

I felt stuck and in my mind I could not accept it and make the compromise. I also hadn't given her the opportunity to discuss my concerns. Because in the last 6 months, her actions speak louder than words, her happy go lucky persona is set in her ways and it would be cruel of me and unkind of me to place my expectations on her. I knew right then and there that she was incompatible with me although the love was great.

I had to walk away, I had to break her heart. OMG...my own heart is breaking. I rather break the relationship now then kept on living the fantasy and get married and have so much burden that we call for a divorce lawyer.

What am I supposed to do with that?  Give me a little bit to work with.  

One of the photos shows her with a dog so I went with ""What's your dog's name?""  (lol, ffs)  Wonder how many other dudes have asked that.
