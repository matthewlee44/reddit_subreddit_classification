0,nv9l1y,1623173479,Sexual Frustration as a result of bad sex norms and emotional connections within ourselves,"I'm 26, so I was at a solid age for the climb and peak of the 4th wave feminist movement. It along with natural self-reflection led me down a path of self-correction when it came to my understandings about sex, and I feel like I learned a lot from it. 

Now a decade into the 4th wave, I feel like we are still in this weird place, because we readily established a solid list of ""don't do""'s but our list and understanding of positive sex norms is very weak beyond Enthusiastic Consent. 

All the relationships I have been in have had very weak sex lives. Either too little or too much, too emotional or not enough. A lot of the women I date come from conservative homes where virginity until marriage was held as a virtuous ideal, or they experienced a sexual assault at some point, or both. 

These things led these women to have unhealthy relationships with sex, in which inner contradictions were present they never knew how to deal with. They may develop sexual attraction and anxiety from sex simultaneaously and not know what to do about it. 

Or they may have used sex to ""not be alone"", or had someone use them for sex as well, leading them to develop unhealthy understandings of how sex ought to work in a relationship, assuming it ought not ""be that important"", and that it is something secondary or even tertiary to a healthy relationship. 

I agree sex isn't needed for a healthy relationship, as I have many of those, but it is needed for a healthy ***romantic*** relationship, and thus the problem arises. 

I'm not quite sure what level my libido is, but it almost never matches up with my partners'. I like to have sex 1-2 times a week, maybe 3, but honestly, I'm more likely to turn down a 3rd time than accept. Which I have had to do with the few women I've dated who used sex (and me) as a coping mechanism for something else, like equating sex as THE love affirming/self-affirming activity. 

My most recent ex used sex early on in the relationship to get me to like her, this she stated explicitly, but then later in our relationship revealed she didn't think it was that important and it ought not be for a healthy relationship. She also revealed she got anxiety from it, and this resulted in us having a dead bedroom at the end of our relationship. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Communicate, Communicate, Communicate."" 

This is why I am writing about this though, because communication is not enough. Simply telling someone what kind of life you want, or what kind of sex life you want, is not enough to heal all wounds because fundamentally theirs and our understandings, notions, and beliefs about sex are flawed. 

Sex is viewed as a vice. Some dirty, raunchy event that men love and sometimes women do to. Its a tool for power. For Pleasure. For Pain. For reliving trauma. For affirming yourself to yourself, and on and on. 

As a result, these inherent contradictions grow in the mind that results in bad understandings about what sex ought to be. Sex ought to be a romantic endeavor, one used to procreate but also bond with a partner and help establish trust and affection through an utterly unique mating ritual. 

Sex ought to be conducted frequently, a rate of your choosing, but a consistent reaffirmation of one's romantic interest ought to be sought after. 

Sex should be understood as a positive thing, conducted in moderation, and done with the utmost respect and honor. It might just be our oldest ritual, and to undergo it is to engage in something truly human. 

This escapes almost all my partners. It's almost never a tool for this, even the one's who fantasize about it being this romantic candle-lit rose petal event never actively engage in the event the way they say it ought to be engaged in because their fantasy is ill-conceived and naive. 

What is needed to remedy all of this is healthier sex norms, and self-reflection on your own preconceived notions of sex done ***not just to interpret what you view sex as but to fundamentally change what you believe about sex*** 

Too often, communication is merely an expression of an idea rather than a thorough study and evaluation of whether that idea is actually correct. Which is why I don't think it is actually enough to bring to create a healthy relationship. 

Better reasoning ability, comfort with being wrong, proper philosophical reflection, and so forth are the only things that can fix our understandings of sex and relationships in general.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv9l1y/sexual_frustration_as_a_result_of_bad_sex_norms/
1,nv9r81,1623173949,Counter post to looks for matter,"So, I do agree with you. However, I’ve literally been on so many dates with hot guys that were very boring and ugly ones that were mean. I think it’s just about who thinks you’re beautiful. Because to be real, I have a friend who dates some uglies but she body builds and thinks they are super hot. However, I’m fat and have gotten dates with a multitude of different guys. At the end of the day, it’s who you’re exposed to and who is interested in you. Don’t get it twisted though, looks do matter but to be real, if you have to look a certain way for someone to like you, it isn’t meant to be. You’re not going to be what they want if they have already rejected you. Also, when you meet someone you don’t know what their flavor is. Looks matter people! Personality matters!

8,nvabn5,1623175474,Decided to permanently quit using dating apps,"I’ve been using dating apps on and off since I was about 19 (I’ll actually be 24 tomorrow).  The same thing always happens: I’ll go on some okay dates, we talk for a little bit, and things fizzle out. Sometimes hookups occur, but I’m not crazy about hookup culture in general. One pattern I have noticed is a lack of transparency. I would typically have to ask the guy what they were looking for instead of them being honest with me from the beginning. I came to eventually find out that they were either emotionally unavailable or only looking for something casual. Or they were using me to rebound from a past relationship. Ghosting has also happened a couple times.

Of course, I’m partially to blame for letting these patterns repeat themselves. But after some growing and maturing, I’ve realized that dating apps are not for me. Dating the traditional way is extremely difficult but I’d rather wait for someone great to come along instead of giving into these toxic and repetitive cycles. Maybe there’s something wrong with me?

TBH your personality can be easily improved, I can say that with 100% assurance, I don't really believe in the bullshit of ""Pretty People have Crap Personality"". They don't, a Person who has Crap Personality is irrespective of his/ her looks. 

I have seen many Guys who have admitted how they weren't getting any dates when they were obese, they had bad skin, had bad teeth etc etc. But as soon as they hit the gym, followed some diet, got some teeth straightened or got a good cosmetic surgery, Women tended to go out with them.

And believe me guys a Glow Up is absolutely necessary, you can't restrict yourself in terms of looks, sometimes it's really stupid to see how an Obese Man/ Woman be expecting a Hot Woman/ Guy. But do y'all guys really believe that, those people would be getting dates from those Hot Guys/ Women?

I guess NOT, Personality can be easily developed, but if you firmly believe that you can still get some decent looking partner without you putting any efforts in Looks then it's highly impossible.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvakuz/saw_some_videos_on_glow_ups_and_i_beleive_that/

13,nvb42k,1623177616,How to look at the dating scene as a man,"So i saw alot of post of people that are complaining about the dating scene for men so I wrote down my own thoughts in a comment but i decided it's better as a post: 

&amp;#x200B;

Are men expendable? Yes

Can you make it so you are not expendable? Also yes

Men with average or below average looks (which is all subjective btw) think they have no chance in this age of dating and just accept it. This ofcourse is not a good mindset, first we need to realise that dating for men and women is largely different, this sounds obvious but is actually very important to understand. These dynamics go as followed:

Men have it more difficult in the way to initially get a women invested in them. But if they do get into her head the men have all the power. In other words, women screen you/test you in a way that makes sure you are a good man for them (looking at charisma, confidence, status and other factors.)

On the flip side, women have the power initially and it is their game to lose. They will pick what is in their opinion the best possible mate, you just gotta make it so you are that option. You do this by working on the things you can (go to the gym, have good hygiene, eat well, focus on your job/studies, work on posture, have hobbies that interest you and work on confidence etc.)

This ensures that you atleast tried everything to become the best option + all the things i mentioned above are things that will make your life better either way so it's a double win.

Understanding this makes the game more fun because the amount of effort you put in will all go to yourself which makes it amazing because you are improving and attracting a broader scale of women.

28,nvcleu,1623181573,Sexual exclusivity timing?,"I am coming to realize that sexual exclusivity is a hard boundary for me. I have no interest in sleeping with a guy who is actively pursuing other women.

At the same time, I understand that exclusivity is a type of commitment and from what I’ve seen on this sub and others regarding the typical timeline for exclusivity is that most people don’t want to have that commitment until they’ve been dating for several months (the most common timeline I’ve seen is not establishing exclusivity for 8-12 dates, so assuming you’re both working adults and see each other on the weekend, that’s 2-3 months)

I feel like all the choices are kind of bad choices. My choices seem to be:   
A) Have sex with someone without being exclusive, opening myself up to STDs and emotional attachment when he’s fucking other women;   
B) Don’t have sex with him until we’ve been dating for 2-3 months and we’re finally ready for commitment (which based on the comments I’ve read on this sub, is a dealbreaker and many men will move on if you don’t sleep with them within dates 3-5); or    
C) Bring up exclusivity SUPER early in the relationship and risk scaring him away or him thinking you’re love bombing/being needy


Is my sexual exclusivity boundary really that uncommon? I mean, it can’t be that uncommon, right?! The average # of lifetime sexual partners in the US is like 7, so if I slept with every guy I met on OLD who I got to a 3rd date with, I’d hit the lifetime average in a year 😅

34,nvddcl,1623183594,I am so confused.,"I am so confused.

I matched with a guy on bumble three weeks ago and we were consistently speaking for a few days and then randomly he stopped responding.

After a man stops responding I usually let it go but for this guy I felt inclined to continue speaking with him so I waited a week and then I messaged him. 

Afterwards he was more responsive and I asked him if he wanted to facetime. We spoke for hours and if it were up to me we would have continued speaking. During our conversation we settled on a date to go on a date.

However, when the date for our date arrives that afternoon he cancels on me. 

It was frustrating because I had said no to some plans with my friends to see this guy. And after he canceled he stopped replying so that evening I was walking around my neighborhood and I just called him and messaged him asking him if he wanted to join me on a walk if he was done with whatever he was doing.

He called me back and said he would pick me up. He comes and picks me up and takes me back to his apartment. Strangely, I wasn't afraid to go to this stranger's place. I have never gone back to a strangers apartment. We spoke for hours in his apartment and he confessed that the reason he stopped responding was because he didn't feel that I was looking into seriously dating. Which is silly but I brushed it off. 

We then got food and came back to my apartment where we continued to talk and make out. He left my home at 7am. He told he he was so tired that he requested half the day off. 

The following Tuesday and Wendesdays the same thing happened. We stayed together the whole night and we did not have sex. We did do other things but overall it was pretty tame. 

We had scheduled an official date for Friday and on Thursday  he said “I can't do tomorrow. I'm severely behind with my work now, and I still have to see family and my one friend. I did not expect to spend this much time with you these past 3 days. All nighters throw off my routine. And I told him it's okay, I understand. No response. It's been 5 days. 

When we were together everything was going so well and the chemistry was palpable, he even admitted to liking me and feeling nervous around me.

35,nvdgu2,1623183845,Seemed to be developing chemistry until rejection,"
I (21m) met this girl(20f) at my retail job. I went out of my way to introduce myself which is something i never do. We talked for a minute and went our separate ways for about a month. 

She started to sit across from me on my breaks. The break room is a pretty good size and usually not crowded so there is plenty of empty places to sit. The first two times she did this she would just sit there not on her phone or doing anything else really.  

I had seen her in the break room a couple of times before and she was always buried in her phone she was kinda in her own world. 

The 5 or so time she started doing this i started convo with her. I got to know her pretty well over the course of a few months but i am so shy and nervous that i didn’t make any moves. She seemed even more so than I was so that put me at ease. 

We would always talk about family, school, and generally about each other. She would always follow up on little details. We both started getting comfterbal with this snd did this just about every day. Usually going over our scheduled break time. 

One day she started talking about guys who liked her in the past but she didn’t like them for what ever reason. Struck me as odd and from here on out she started asking weekend plans and stuff like that. 

I finally asked for her number and she happily gave it to me. I texted her the next day. But every time she would text i would wait 10-20 minutes to respond to make it seem like i had things going on. I stoped the convo at various points for an hour sometimes two as i was very nervous and afraid she wouldn’t respond if i said something super boring. At around 7 or 8 I would just end the convo by not replying as i go to bed around this time. 

I would always text her the following afternoon, until the third day to which she didn’t respond. I assumed that she want interested but i convinced myself to ask her out anyways. 

She told me she didn’t think she could because she had a brother vulnerable to covid and hasn’t gone out/hung out with anyone and avoids going anywhere but work and home 

I took this as a rejection and told her if she didn’t want me to i wouldn’t talk to her anymore. The last think i would want is for her to be uncomfterbal. She told me not to do that as she really liked our relationship. I agreed and we didn’t text until i saw her at work next. 

Avoided her the whole day until she came and sat down on my break. She was more dressed up then normal and shot me a cute wave before she sat down. We talked for like an hour and a half. 

That night i texted her and told her i needed to get over my feelings for her and i needed space to do that. I told her she was my friend and i dint want to cut her off if she didn’t want me to. She said she understood and would respect it but then said something that sounded like her feelings were hurt. 

The next time i saw her she looked upset and i tried to apologize but she dint really want anything to do with me. How did i read this wrong

I’m not completely out of it yet, but I’ve accepted that it’s over and it wasn’t good to me. Still it left a void inside of me, I’m missing the company and the connection I’ve had with the person. I’ve dated two more people after the break-up: with one there was no chemistry and the other one didn’t want a relationship because he’s about to leave town. I’ve established a connection, had very deep meaningful talks and good sex with the second guy, but the moment he left I felt so sad, empty and alone. We’re gonna see each other again and stay friends even after he’ll leave town, but the fact that our talks got so intimate yet he didn’t want a relationship felt weirdly unbalanced to me. I know it’s not my fault, but I felt so unworthy and “less than”. I’m now trying to fill this void I have inside (that I created trying to fill the void I had from my ex!!) on dating apps, but I feel… exhausted. Do I need to just take some time off dating? I really don’t want to do that, because I didn’t date at all until my mid-20s and I’ve really learned a lot in the past few years.

40,nvdv4k,1623184835,Kinda lost,"So, I am kinda confused and need some opinions. 

I've met a guy on the 25 of April. We went on a first date. We spent 6 hours together and he wanted me to meet his best friend, which I did. He also wanted me to hang out with them but I had to leave as it was already a long date. 

3 days later he reacted with a funny emoji to my story on gram. I thought he’s not interested. 
After some opinions here, I messaged and suggested we meet if he's free. He responded within a minute and kept the conversation going even when I left him on read, he double texted. It was long weekend so he went away as he planned before. No problem. 

He came back and would occasionally message me. Specifically 5 days in a row before the second date. 3 weeks after the first date, we finally met. It was a good time spending. He said the gap was because he's very occupied (he's a lawyer but also has a second job). I messaged him when I got home. In the morning he said ""thanks dear 💞"". 

Again, it's been 18 days and no date is planned. He replied on my gram story and we had some long discussion on some political topic. He ended with ""so glad I've met you tho. You are a kind soul"". It was out of nowhere. 

I am so confused. I know it's too early to think of anything and definitely don't want to pressure him. I do think it's not just for sex as he doesn't reply to any selfies etc. Doesn’t say anything sexual. During the dates, he tries to impress me by showing the videos from his trips etc, he asks me many questions. He remembers every small detail I've said. He always replies within a minute or so. He also showed me a picture of his ex and he had 5 year long relationship but that was long time ago.
Also maybe it doesn't matter but he always calls me ""dear"". Im not sure what it is and kinda confused as I've never seen anyone like that. I don’t like texting everyday either but I mean 3 weeks is just a lot between the dates.

They want something but are afraid to say so they say the things that make them seem as “good”. I stayed true to myself and I wish women do the same so it’s possible not to get any misunderstanding. I even had a marriage proposal so I though the girl had agreed only then I would agree to move forward to the next level, so one day she just dropped that she cannot conceive, I took a liking to her so I told her that it’s gonna be fine, there’s adoption. What’s important is we go through everything together happiness and difficulties. 2 weeks later I emailed her asking how is she and all? She replies “ You make me miserable, I am getting married to what’shisname.” 
No answer from her nor her parents, it took a couple of hours to shake off the confusion. I would have understood if she said she had someone and the proposal was like forced by her parents. I would have taken the high road and called it off amicably.

50,nvf1fx,1623187733,Best to treat dating as an extension of your social life,"I think a lot of time we get so fixated on dating, dating, dating that we neglect to make a similar investment in our friendships as well. Of course, this doesn't apply to everybody but it's less common for people to flourish in one area or another while absolutely being at level 0 in the other because they both have something extremely important in common: human connection. 

Yes, in the grand scheme of things, a specific romantic partner is more important than any specific friend but these things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they actually help each other quite a bit, especially friendships -&gt; dating.

Think about the ways you meet new people to date. 

* Online dating, great for solo people but can be ineffective.
* Going out and meeting new guys/girls. It's really difficult or socially stressful to go out solo. 
* Meeting friends of friends, or other social introductions. You would need a wide social network to do so. 

Plus, do romantic relationships in and of themselves really fulfill us? 

When you have a wide network of friends and other relationships, going out and meeting new people, meeting people through their networks, having support and getting advice, and life after you finally find your partner become much more of a pleasant experience. At least in my opinion.

51,nvfdfw,1623188568,I [23F] stood up for myself for the first time and told him [24M] I deserve better than how he was treating me. Why does it still hurt so bad?,"I [23F] started seeing someone [24M]  who I developed feelings for. We met on a dating app, texted/snapped, and he asked me out the next week pretty soon. Early on, I had a series of horrible arguments with my abusive parents that led to a meltdown - he was there, listened, and supported me as I vented

Our first date was the best first date ever. It was 5 hours and only ended because the bar closed that Friday. We met up 1-2x the following weeks and time flew by. I saw a lot of green flags in him and felt a strong connection. I had broken up with someone last summer and this was the first time I felt like I truly clicked with them. At the beginning, he’d tell me how you need to believe in your own worth and how hardworking, amazing, smart and beautiful I am and how it’s really attractive that I apply myself both personally and professionally. And how I’ve got a great job starting soon and he believes in me.

He also would look me in the eyes and say “I really like you” multiple times by the second or third time we met up, seemed super eager to talk to me, said he was hoping he’d be lucky enough to get to see me again, and we’d talk all day until 1-2AM. I also admired his ambitions, work ethic, and just being around him felt amazing, even when he opened up about super personal topics. He did little things that also made it seem like he cared, was respectful, and a gentleman. He was also the first person I had felt comfortable and enjoyed giving and receiving physical affection/touch (having grown up with none). I eventually told him I felt the same way back. 

A month and a half in, he got sick and was busy for a week. He talked a lot less and didn’t seem like he had been. I understood and when we met up at the end of the week, I brought a small thing of flowers and wine to cheer him up. He said he had never had that given to him before and how it was sweet. I noticed that he was a lot less physically affectionate this time but chalked it to him being out of it. 

Over the next couple weeks, he continued to take a lot longer to reply and things seemed off. I eventually asked him and he clarified that he was not looking for any commitment and couldn’t have us getting into a schedule. He needed time to work on himself and protect himself from hurt as he had just ended a toxic long term relationship last year, and that it’s more him than me. In the beginning, we did talk about our expectations and he didn’t mention this, just that he wasn’t looking for anything serious. I agreed and said I was also just looking for casual dating because I felt like I’m in a place where I am ok being single. I was disappointed to find this out but respected it. He still said he’d love to talk and see each other and so did I. I stepped back and kept myself busy with other things. It temporarily felt better. 

Over the next couple weeks, that slowly wore off. When I brought up my birthday, I said I honestly just want to spend quality time with someone I want to be with. I asked him and he said for sure, but couldn’t confirm if he was available or not. I said it doesn’t have to be that specific day, it can be during the next week or two. He never replied. 

I did some more thinking and realized that he was putting almost no effort anymore. It was such a stark contrast and it felt like if I never ever brought up hanging out or messaged him first, he wouldn’t care. So I texted him saying that while this felt like a really special connection in the beginning, I feel like I’m just an afterthought now and I deserve better. And I’d rather rip the bandaid off than drag it out if this is how it was going to be from now on - unless he thought otherwise. But as much as I hoped things went back to how they were, it’s his life and his decisions. And I said good luck and that I wish good things for him. He never responded. 

It’s been 5 days and I am still hurting. I keep getting random crying spells. One minute I’ll be ok, the next l’m reminded of him or see his name on Snapchat and cry. I know I should block him but it hurts and part of me has hope.

I have a date tmrw..or hanging out, not sure what the term would be since that is what I asked him if he wanted to do. I’ve only been on one date in my life, didn’t go well in the end. We ended up having sex on the first date, ruined it all.

New guy comes along, we plan to get tacos tomorrow. Been talking for a month now. There’s obvious interest between us. We went to school together when we were younger but never socialized so this will be the first time we actually see each other.

Today he has been MIA. Not texting at all. Only an hour ago have we started communicating and even now we haven’t talked, he’s busy. We haven’t talked officially since Sunday. Obviously my anxiety was at an all time high. 

“Is he going to ghost me?” 
“Is he going to stand me up?”
“Maybe he isn’t interested anymore?”
“What if he just wants sex in the end and is just lying and saying all these great things to get his way into my pants?” ( he has not once made a sexual comment to me. Some flirting but nothing explicit) 

I need to cut this. I need to also stop going into situations with high expectations. I get a good feeling about him and I know he is interested. When I asked him if we were still on to hang out he replied with “we can” 
Again.. high anxiety. Overthinking over a small sentence. I’ve never had good relationships with the opposite sex, every encounter has ended in disappointment and bitterness. I’ve only dated once in high school, so not much experience there either. I’ve done my fair share of hookups but I’m ready for a serious relationship. 

Any advice on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated. I have never done this before, not even with my first date. So I don’t know why I am feeling so high strung.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvfhfo/how_to_overcome_insecurityoverthinking_before_a/

People celebrate a woman’s body. Mens bodies disgust everyone. Especially mine.

Then I became an atheist and thought that was pretty backwards. But it was realistic. Everyone hates my body. Everyone always has. No matter how much I take care of myself, no matter how much I work out, I disgust everybody. My penis in particular. Best that I keep it away from everyone. No one wants to have anything to do with my filth.

I'm 19F btw and I want a relationship but I've never had one

Anyway my bf has to...

\- be asexual bc I'm a sex-repulsed asexual and I cannot/will not have sex

\- like hot weather and want to live in the south (i like florida and arizona but i'm not picky) bc I cannot handle temperatures under 80 degrees and I've lived in the north my whole life and it's awful

\- be ok with having guinea pigs, cats, and lizards as pets and not be allergic to any of those animals bc those are the kinds of pets I want. I've always wanted a cat but a lot of family is allergic :(

\- not want a dog bc I've always had an irrational phobia of them which I've been working on my whole life, by now I like them from a distance and can hang out with them sometimes for short periods, but I would not want to live with one and have it always in my house

\- want to travel the world with me bc i want to travel the world and share that experience w my partner

\- be ok with not sharing a room bc I like having my own space. But we can still sleepover in each other's rooms and cuddle and stuff sometimes or even a lot if he wants

\- be a quiet person bc I'm a quiet person and I don't like loudness or talking too much, I want someone I can chill with

\- have similar enough political opinions, doesn't have to be exactly the same and I try to be open minded and learn from the other side but just enough that we're not fighting all the time

\- not want kids bc I don't want kids

\- not do drugs bc drugs are bad for your health (and are expensive) especially the ones you smoke (tobacco/weed) bc 2nd hand smoke (occasional alcohol is fine tho)

\- be sweet and understanding bc I want a man w a nice personality

\- be catholic bc I'm catholic and it's important to me that my partner shares my faith

Went on multiple dates with this girl and been seeing her since March. All of a sudden 2 weeks ago, she stopped replying to me and then bailed on going out for a dat and said she has a holiday this week.

I realised that she has blocked me from viewing her stories on Instagram but I can still see her posts and she hasn't unfollowed me. She did this after she had posted a pic of her family member who passed away a few years ago and probably saw that I viewed it. It's just weird because she let me see that post and then blocked me just before she's going on the trip.

If you want to go off the dictionary definition, I’m desperate. I want to be in a relationship, and experience that, and love and sex, and emotional intimacy with a woman so very badly but I can’t. No woman has wanted to be with me.

I mainly use apps as I know most women don’t want random guys to talk to them if they’re not attractive. No girl would want an ugly guy to just comes up to her to try to start a conversation. I have been introduced to friends by my girl friends, that always goes badly so it’s just too awkward and embarrassing to keep doing. I use 3 dating apps and I haven’t had any success. The last time I got a match was January. I’m essentially an ncel without the misogyny.

I don’t know how to not be desperate like this. Like, I can’t not be desperate unless someone else wants me. And no one else wants me so I’m stuck being desperate. And I know women don’t like desperate guys, which I can’t fix because women do want me because I’m desperate. It’s a catch-22.

Honestly the weight of being like this feels like it’s too much. I’m a 20 year older kiss less virgin. I’m such a fucking freak. My 15 year older brother has more experience with women than me. It’s so embarrassing and shameful. It honestly makes me want to Kim myself because I know that if I don’t figure this out soon, I’ll have missed learning how to date and no woman advice 23 would want to be with a guy like me. It makes me feel so hopeless and like I should kill my self.

Hope you're doing well!

Well I wanted to ask for some dating advice, like how can I start talking to girls. I never really had any experience in flirting in a person, I tried online dating but even then I am having a hard time starting a conversation.

I never go out except for some walking or to meet friends but we never go to partys or bars. So how can I meet new people, I work in a concert house so there is a possibility but even then I would never have time to look for someone special.

74,nvhmga,1623194701,I've accidentally developed a racial preference in dating. How do I avoid fetishizing?,"To be clear, I wouldn't ever exclude or avoid a particular race/ethnicity. I've had relationships with men from all over the planet and mainly care about how our personalities click. All of my LTRs have been with men of different ethnicities (latino, arab, native american etc.). Not because of preference, I just grew up in a very multicultural place.

But over the past couple years I've noticed that I'm mainly attracted to men from a particular race - actually a friend pointed it out to me and now I'm aware of it. This is mostly accidental. My most recent ex is mixed, white passing and changed his name to a white name to avoid racism - I didn't actually know his background until he told me on like our second date. But most of the men I've dated over the past few years have been from this ethnic group.

There are definitely certain physical traits that I prefer which occur frequently in this ethnic group - I love floofy hair, darker skin and thick eyebrows. But these traits occur in basically every race and I am still attracted to people from other ethnicities. 

I just worry that I'm fetishizing when I'm consistently dating men from the same part of the world. I don't think I am though. I like who they are as human beings, and don't view anyone I date as a walking stereotype. Though honestly the accents + sound of that language really does it for me. I just don't want to make any of my future partners uncomfortable I guess.

76,nvhzwv,1623195785,I went too fast and don't know what to think now.,"I \[25M\] broke up a long relationship 1.5 month ago and I'm to rebuild myself: I'm trying new sports, started therapy last week, restarted old hobbies and projects, finished my studies. I feel like I'm moving on and I'm feeling very well with myself. 

So I met this woman \[26F\] in my work and we started to chat just after I broke up by accident, due work reasons. I started to like her due her way to see things (she is very intelligent, supportive, positive and gorgeous) and, in the last week, I said I like her and that I want to do everything right to get her friendship and to get closer to her. She said I moved too quickly and that this is too quick for her. Some days before, however, I said I got a ""crush"" on her and she said very cool things (like she thinks I'm pretty and cool to talk with and that we should spend more time talking and meeting to know each other). Now I'm feeling guilty and stupid because I moved too quick. 

Basically she asked for space and time. She said she needs time to know me at her own pace (that is very slow, according to her). We talked later that day and things seemed ok. But in that weekend she asked for space (we didn't talk for 3 days) and, during the work, we talk for 10 minutes without text messages during the night (the conversations are fluid and pleasant). Today we talked again (I asked her to talk for some minutes and grab a coffee with me), she said something like ""I'm distancing to give time to things with calm and we should see this next week"". I said I'm reflecting and trying to move slow as well (during this time I'm always trying to respect her space, just asking questions about her day and how she is feeling). She said ""that's it, perfect"". 

My question is: did I screw up everything? Is she trying to get me out of her life or I still got a chance with her, just need to respect her time? What should I do now? I don't have too much experience with relationships and got confused with the situation.

78,nvi35n,1623196051,I (F 20’s) realized I’m still Snapchat friends with this person (M 20’s) I went on some dates with a few years back. Feeling conflicted about reaching out. *serious*,"We met initially through online dating back in 2014. He ended up getting deployed elsewhere for over 6 months, maintained a no pressure wholesome/flirty connection where we interacted a couple times a week, then he came back briefly, we went out once again. Then not too shortly after he was redeployed to Europe, where I think he’s still at now. 


He and I had more of an ebb and flow connection. It was never official or “serious,” but there was definitely potential. I felt like we were both at weird stages in our lives when we first met. After being redeployed, he saw over the years the dates/relationships I’ve had via social media, and no matter what he was in my corner, despite the distance and not talking everyday. 


In 2019 he un-added me from Instagram, buuut in all fairness I unfriended him first on Facebook, then later Instagram because I was moving on with a serious relationship at the time, and my partner at the time were both cleaning our following lists (not the best move.) I eventually broke up with this other person and became single again. 


After I thought I un-added everyone I had to un-add, turns out he and I are still Snapchat friends. The last time we spoke was in summer 2019, when he reached out to me and went as far as to tell me to fly out to Europe to visit him (as cute as that was, at the time I felt that was a bit much, so I flirted back and basically told him that’s not realistic for me at that time because of work and whatnot.) 


I can’t remember how we left off on the conversation, but apparently he sent the last message to me. I’m under the impression he unadded me after he started seeing someone else (I did some snooping and saw he became exclusive with someone else right around the time he unadded me from Instagram/stopped texting me.)


I no longer have his number, but am still on Snapchat. In my heart, I believe that life is too short to not say what you feel.

81,nvierd,1623197003,I feel like something’s wrong with me?,"At least I think. My therapist keeps telling me it’s all in my head but it’s hard to see that when reality is telling me differently. I’m 19M gay and hardly anyone is interested in me. I message guys at my school in my age range I get ignored, I hit up guys around my area in my age range, I also get ignored. Most guys that hit me up usually are 2-3x my age, overweight, and not really attractive to me. I don’t think I have high standards. I lost a lot of weight over quarantine and I’m continuing to bulk and tone this summer so I prefer a guy with similar toned/slim/muscular build as me. I don’t care about hair color or eyes, or height really as long as he’s not shorter than me. And I came from a pretty wealthy family so it would be nice to be with someone similar or have goals. I just like a guy that’s attractive and fit like me that’s kind, ambitious, and funny. 

Yet I keep attracting the opposite of what I like. I talked about this before on a different sub and they all said I had high standards and should lower them if I want to be with someone. But as someone that’s young, fit, and attractive, is wrong not to want the same thing in someone else? Nonetheless, I feel like there is something wrong with me if so many guys in my area are ignoring me on Grindr or aren’t matching with me on tinder. I’ve definitely compared my experience to my white gay friends and they don’t have the same issues. While they complain about guys or being single, the guys they go on dates with or hookup with ignored me, like pretty much everyone of them they’ve been with. And they all follow each other on Instagram too, I feel like there’s this exclusive gay network and you have to be white to be apart of it, frustrating. 

Anyways, I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Either I get ignored, told “sorry not my type,” or blocked (which is rare). And I feel like I can’t do anything else besides getting work done to my face yet (but even doctors I consulted with told me I was already pretty good looking and the work I want done would give minimal results :/ ). I’m focused on continuing to improve my body but I take really good care of my skin, teeth, and hair. I expect perfection in myself. But all of this is just for me to get ignored? I feel like I wasted time improving myself if guys still don’t like me. I hate to blame it on race because not everything is about race and I’m pretty lightskinned, but I can’t help notice how different my white peers have it vs me. Guys will have “looking for fit/slim/twink/twunk,” but will still tell me “sorry not my type.” I guess only white gays can be twinks idk. When I changed my tinder location to Europe and different cities  I matched with a couple models and very attractive guys I like, but back in the Midwest it’s just crickets.

In person, he says he really likes me. We have great physical chemistry (no sex yet, just making out) and have decent conversation. After each date says that he had a wonderful time and continues to want to see me in person. But the dates are always a week apart, on the weekends, and he doesn’t text me during the week. If I want to text with him, I have to initiate every time and he is the one who ends the convo (eg “going to bed now, have a good night”).

I’m trying to rein in the insecurity, but it’s making me feel like shit that he never initiates texting and tbh after not speaking to him for a full week, my interest starts to wane, only to be rekindled again when I see him in person. 

At this stage would it be too clingy for me to address the lack of texting? Say something like “Hey, I don’t feel like it’s enough to only interact with each other on the weekends.

But recently I had a discussion with my girlfriend about our relationship and I expressed that I feel like she doesn’t call/text me first or I’m the one putting in all the effort or she never asks me to hang out, I always make the plans it seems.

She pretty much said she doesn’t call or ask me to hang because “she’s afraid of bothering me” or she thinks I’m busy and doesn’t want to annoy me.

I got kind of frustrated because I’ve told her before how I love her and want to hear from here anytime of the day, and how she never can bother me. So that just seems like either an excuse or a weird coping mechanism to me.

And then from there I just asked her how she feels about me, her thoughts on our relationship, etc. but she literally shuts down. She can’t even try to express any thoughts or feelings about me/us into words.

I was able to explain what she means to me but for some reason she can’t seem to do that for me. I just want to be intimate/close with her and I thought we were intimate/close at this stage of our relationship.

So this hurt me because all I really want to hear is that she cares about me and all I really want assurance of is that she loves me like I love her.

I want to share things between us, because isn’t that the point of a relationship anyways?

Since we had that conversation it just feels like she became less engaged in talking to me and less interested in maintaining our relationship... so maybe this conversation made things worse or maybe she’s just having a bad week or something?

As of right now, I’m pretty emotionally hurt by all this and have thought this may be a sign to break up with her but I’m trying to find reasons to stay even though she hurt me bad.

TL;DR - Girlfriend won’t open up to me emotionally, I open up to her easily, relationship feels like it’s in jeopardy now. Need advice or insight on what to do next.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvj4t3/my_gf_23_f_of_1_year_cant_open_up_to_me_25_m_and/

As such, our relationship was very serious and “adult,” despite our age. We mutually decided to end things after I graduated high school because we were on different paths. I was about to start college on a full ride. He had dropped out of high school and got his GED and experienced a fluctuation in motivation. We agreed it wasn’t fair for either of us— but especially me— to have to support each other through a new, uncharted chapter. 

Despite ending the relationship, we still stayed in contact with one another because we considered each other family. This really came to a head in early 2020 when we really got honest about our relationship and mutually apologized for all of our shortcomings. We agreed we would also love and root for each other and that neither of us regretted the relationship. After this, we’d check in every few months to make sure the other was doing well. 

A few months ago, I got a call from his mom that he had passed away in his sleep. Because he had had COVID, he was not granted an autopsy. We do not know how he died. 

This entire thing has stirred up a whole mess of feelings in me. I am devastated for his family and the loss of potential. Selfishly, I am also devastated that I no longer have someone out there who, to this day, loved me endlessly. Besides my mom’s, his phone number is the only one I’d remember in an emergency. He was one of only a few people who would support me no matter what. Additionally, despite the fact that we broke up almost 3 years ago, I feel immense guilt when I think about dating someone else. I’ve played the tinder game while in college, but now whenever I go on it, I feel as if I’m being disloyal to my ex. Hoping this will pass with time, as all things do. 

Not sure if I’m venting or asking for advice. People who have lost their partners, how did you cope?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvj5r1/my_first_love_passed_away_how_do_i_move_on_with/
89,nvj7f9,1623199588,Sugar Mama..? That’s what he thought..,"So I’m leaving the DDs (f/45) and this nice looking tenderoni (M/33) is basically following me to my car.. I peep him peeping me but keep it moving. He makes his way and upon closer look he’s pretty damn fine so I’m single and activate “ the flirt”.  He’s a charmer and I just take it the compliments and flattery ( I smell the love bombing) but whatever keep it coming. I return the compliments and he says he would like to take me out.. tonight! At first I was like ummm.. no. I give him my number and we end up going out to the bar that night. He picked me up in his Mercedes.. I was like okkk. We really had a good time.. he introduced me to all his friends and was a real gentleman, paid for everything and I got pretty lit not overly but I was more than tipsy just not sloppy, the happy medium. We leave.. we park.. we grown.. he’s fine and I’m just as cute  .. so we bang it out.. it was good and I went to sleep satiated. He calls the next day .. wants to meet at the river for a day by the water.. and he actually comes through.. so I’m like okkk maybe.. we go back to my place.. bang it out again( and yes I practice safe sex) Yay, I wasn’t that drunk .. it was good! He’s calling me his woman.. saying all the right things.. calling me.. answering my calls.. but somethings off.. I’ve been here before. I find out he lives with his parents.. whatever but you not moving in with me.. the Mercedes is his moms.. yea but no.. Yesterday we’re on the phone and this guy has the nerve to say “baby one day next week I’m going to need to use your car to go to an appointment “ I laughed till I cried. That’s a hard NO. So looking back to the day we met.. he only approached me probably because of my car (2019 Mustang GT) she’s a pretty girl but nobody drives her except me. He thought I was so desperate for D that’d I’d just give him my keys. Little did he know.. I was getting my needs taken care of.. needless to say I haven’t heard from him since and that’s fine by me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvj7f9/sugar_mama_thats_what_he_thought/

91,nvjbr0,1623200011,Is she just playing with me or is she interested?,"
Was at dinner with a group of friends. There was 6 of us -a couple, a brother and sister and then me and this other girl. At the end of dinner we had the waiter split the check and he split it 3 ways so that all checks were even (not organized by order).

This girl (who was sitting across from me then joked that the waiter must think me and her are together).  Then she said “cheers boyfriend”.  A few minutes later when talking about my life plans with the group and a decision I had made(dropping out of grad school). She said “damn I wanted to marry rich”.

I’m not sure if she is teasing me and friendzoning me or if she has interest. We don’t know each other that well and just met a couple weeks ago. Although we have hung out a few times now as part of the same social group.

I'm a 5'4 man and a lot of women my height or taller aren't interested in my height, which I think is fair, but a lot of women shorter than me think i'm too short as well. The majority of them want men that are 5'10 and taller. Its strange because even the women under 5'1 usually do as well, I don't really get it. A few extremely short women even said to me that i'm not tall enough, but do you think that its because they are also insecure so they aren't confident enough to be with men that aren't tall?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvjpfm/why_arent_women_shorter_than_me_satisfied_with_my/
97,nvjpsc,1623201306,Open relarionship scary stuff,"Hi so i'm (genderfluid - bio female, 18) in a relationship with my boyfriend (male 19) and have been for 1 and half years. We met in college and have been through some of the worst with each other depression etc. He came out as bisexual recently and i told him he could sexually experiment with some guys if he feels like he needs to and he wanted to so we made him a tinder account and he got some matches.

He offered i could do the same with girls as i am pan, so i got tinder too but have barely used it as i just don't feel the need and i am bad at responding.

He has been on a few dates with a guy lets call S. S is super nice and is into everything he is. They occasionally call to play videogames and have gone to dinner and text all the time.
Here are my problems:
1. Im getting kinda insicure about it because recently he never responds to my texts and he has been away for a while and he has about £300 and is unemployed - he has taken S out to eat and is planning to see him soon, but won't go out with me because he needs to save.
2. He hasnt told S he is with me. The rule was they must know and it would be a sexual experiance. They havent even kissed, but they are getting so close and S doesn't know. I brought this up with my bf and he said he will just tell him he got a girlfriend over summer or something and that its open. I felt crushed it was just such a piss take to our whole relationship and i just felt so insignificant in that moment. I just feel like i cant even stop this because they are becoming so close and this isnt what i agreed to but i am so in love and want him to be happy.

Please can anyone help me or give me advice im so stuck right now.

TL;DR: my bi boyfriend is on tinder with my consent and is getting in way deep with a dude to the point i feel heartbroken and like he is more invested in him than he is with me. I have been with him for a year and a half and have no idea what to do to fix it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvjpsc/open_relarionship_scary_stuff/
98,nvjsgd,1623201527,Wth does hanging out involve?,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for a little advice. 
I met someone at a friends 21st the other day and we’ve been messaging a bit and they asked when I was going to invite them over. I messaged back and asked when they are free and we’ve organised a time, but I have fuck all dating experience. I have met this person several times so they aren’t a total stranger but I don’t know them very well. I’ve only ever gone out for a date, never had someone come over to my place so I’m not exactly sure what we’re supposed to do. 
Obviously sex is the first thing that comes to mind but I haven’t had sex before, which this person is aware of, so that probably won’t be happening. So my question is: what the hell are we supposed to do? How do you ‘hang out’ with someone you barely know without it being super awkward?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvjsgd/wth_does_hanging_out_involve/
