Another example is: She used to get on me about my weight, but I'm close to six feet and only 170ish. Lost about 10-12 pounds, and she comments ""you're looking nice, maybe add some more time to the treadmill."" (she has weight issues).

By contrast, when meeting people in person, my impression of them is like 99% formed by my gut feeling about them. With OLD, I have to decide what I'm looking for ahead of time, and sometimes I can't really articulate it to myself even though I'll know it when I find it. I have to be very much in my head, and I perceive that, intellectually, I don't know what I want. However, when encountering certain people IRL, I experience a gut reaction involving the body and emotions; I don't experience this when swiping through profiles. 

With OLD, I'll see a profile and think ""Oh, he *looks* like he should be interesting. Based on that I *should* swipe right on him,"" but all the while, I feel no excitement, no butterflies, no inspiration. I feel nothing.  I find that the things that make me fall for a person the most - intelligence, wit, charm, humor, friendliness - are not easily conveyed through a phone screen.

Therefore, I feel like dating apps are a lost cause for me because they don't enable me to see if a person has these qualities. I rely heavily on how I *feel* around a person and the sense I get from them, and dating apps seem to reduce people down to a series of data points.

So I thought everything was going great.

Next day I go to class say hi to her and the group she was in and get to class. Afterwards I left class first and was waiting for my friend and she just walks past me and says nothing. I thought maybe she was in a hurry or something so didn't make much of it. However, there were multiple times that she would just walk past me when we crossed paths. I know I could've talked first in those situations but I kind of wanted to see if she would do it. When we were in a group in between classes she would talk to other people but wouldn't talk to me and the only thing she ever said to me after I approached her was say sorry when she almost bumped into me once.

The thing is, after I approached her she kept glancing more and more and even started blatantly staring for like 3 seconds. I feel like I should go talk to her but maybe I'm missing something here. A friend of mine suggested she might have a boyfriend, but I don't know if that's true or not. Yesterday she glanced quite a bit at me again, but today didn't.

Ive had very few replies and the reolies i have had , have not been very leading in the sense of not opening up topics of conversation most lokely one line or two, ive made the effort but doesnt mske sny difference. Id liek to ask for some help.with the following

1  im not a photogenic person, im 6ft 2, heavy duty mechanic so broad shoulders, big arms and i would say strong. Im around 17st but had extensive health checks to prove i am fit for my job. 

Q - ive had remarks about my build, my chlothing, my job and wierldy how my hands have strong veins. What puts people off about this, some have said i look like a thug even though i dont. 

2 social media - im not one to post pics of myself on social media and have been bought up in and around the uk hotrod, classic car, american car scene and have always worked since i was 15. I have xtensive qualifications but apprently the feedback ive had is it is off putting because my job demands overtime and tooling expense which i get back. 

Q what does this mean and how can i be more convincing, my job doesnt make me, it gives me the means to enjoy my life, i work for a leading heavy duty machinery manufacturer?

3 Messaging- all the apps want guys to make the first moves, ive tried a cherky pick up line or tried a little bit of comedy and made no difference still dont get replies, mostly ignored?

Ive so tried asking someone about interests on their profiles and same results?

How can both examples of messaging still be ignored. 

Lastly, previous dating history, ive worked hard all my lifw, 2 apprenticeships completed, 5 years working for a dealership and now 8 months into a job that could help me move anywhere in the world, ladies specifically, why is such a concern or offputting if a guy like me has not yet had a girlfriend or relationship, i get the uncertainty but it doesnt mean im any less of a man than someone whos slept with the whole town?

I got back on Hinge recently and I matched with a nice young lady who is a journalist/has her own publication and has recently moved to my area by her self so she doesn’t know many people at all. From our conversation, it seems like she just mostly has time for work and that’s about it. We went on a date a few days ago where we met up at a pizza shop to chat and have a couple of slices. Our conversation went great, it was very natural and there weren’t any pauses in it so it flowed very nicely. Afterwords, she asked me to walk her to her car and when we got there, she mentioned that she would like to see me again and gave me her number. From my dating experience, I feel like everything went great. There were no awkward moments within the day and she asked to see me again and gave me her number without me even asking. I texted her the next day just to say hi and so she would have my number. She replied quickly, greeted me and mentioned she was getting some work done. She asked me if I had class that day which I did, but it was a couple of hours before I had to be there. I replied that I did and would be leaving in a couple hours and asked her if she was working on a new story or something. She didn’t message me back so after a few hours, I figured she might be buried in her work so I texted her letting her know to feel free to call or text me whenever she is done with her work if she was busy with it at the moment. She never replied to that text either. I will admit, I am a little confused at this point. Again, the date went great, she seemed to think it went great also but I ended up getting no reply after a text or two the following day after the date. I felt some of the best chemistry that I have in a while after this date so I was pretty excited to get to know her better and see where things go. I don’t want to mess things up or Alex this opportunity go by the wayside. That being said, I am a little confused/worried with her not replying to me after a message or two the other night.

I really like her tho things are not always perfect. We had a fight recently which involved jealousy bla bla bla.  


What I really want to talk about is hw sexually frustrating it is to me to be dating her. I have always been a person who really puts on the effort when it comes to sex. I will give head, I will finger her until I can't anymore and I will do her in whatever position she wants.  
On the other hand, she just does not do the same. I have not received a single full blowjob since I started going out with her. She feels like sucking my dick for 60 seconds is way too much of an effort and makes she want to puke. She won't give me handjobs because she claims she is ""too lazy for that"". If I want to fuck while standing she will even find an excuse for that, also claiming she is tired or lazy. Sex has become repetitive and we basically only fuck in the way she wants to.  


I have tried talking to her as patiently and as tenderly as possible and tried to explain that sex requires people to make an effort for the other. She scaled up the conversation to ""Well, I guess we won't work and this won't work out because I can't do those things for you, maybe we should break up"". I really didn't want to break up, but it feels like there is no other way around to it. When I tried saying I do everything for her sexually she responds with ""STOP RUBBING THAT IN MY FACE!""  


She is kind of childishly stubborn when it comes to relationship discussions.  


Thing is I really like her and am really afraid to hurt her. I also have made some great friends who are her friends and it pains me that everything could go to waste over the fact that she refuses to put my pleasure as a priority.  


Is there any way around this? I simply cannot keep going like this.   


I talked to a few people about this and I think I am going to break up, as much as that hurts me.

I (23M) just made it official last week with my girlfriend (20F). We’ve been seeing each other about a month and it’s been great. She’s an incredibly sweet and thoughtful woman and I feel truly blessed with how she treats me (I have some questions regarding this topic but I’ll make another post later). Yesterday we were making out and I found out she’s ticklish, so we were goofing around when she suddenly moved a bit away from me. She apologized because she said she was starting to sweat and apologized again because she said she should have worn shorts instead of jeans so she wouldn’t start sweating in the first place. Now I literally could not care less whether or not she was sweating. Honestly I’m one of those people who adores skin-to-skin contact (she is too) and I think it’s hot when I’m getting passionate with someone and we both start to get all hot and steamy. Her skin was barely moist. She apologized about four more times throughout the night and the next day, and every time she apologized I brushed it off and told her no worries.

I just don’t want her to feel embarrassed around me for natural things. How should I reinforce to her that I’m not grossed out by her sweating, or that I actually enjoy the feeling on her skin? I sense she’s got some underlying insecurities regarding her body but I need her to know that she’s perfect to me.

I've trying to improve my dating life for some time. I'm following most dating advice that I get online (grooming, gym, fashion and social activities). I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I can't seem to attract women. I try to approach women in public places (grocery shop, bus stop, cafe's and bar) and online (dating apps, height is mentions on bio), most of the time I'm rejected politely while other times it's not so polite. Needless to say I've never been in a relationship or been on a date. I'm trying to change that.

I'm not going to lie, I get depressed and lonely from time to time and long for a companion, I know this is bad and is seemed as desperate. Hence I try to fill up my time with camping, hiking and kayaking with my dog.

Any tips or advice by which I can improve my changes would be very helpful

Thank you.

Would you throw that all away because the physical attraction slowly is fading?

He hates the small liberal arts school we go to complains about how ""bad"" it is constantly,  and is planning on transferring to a party school in Florida. I respect his decision if this is going to make him happy, I want him to do what is best for his future. However, at the end of the day as much as I love him I CAN NOT see myself in a long distance relationship with someone who is going to go out to night clubs and constant parties in Florida. Of course I respect this choice but I can't see myself really being happy if I'm here and he is there. I just can't. Parties here aren't fun unless he is here or i'm single. Its NOT that I don't think he's worth it or anything, but like I would miss him and we would both worry about cheating if we are that far and cant see each other. 

However, the best thing I have ever learned in life is to put MYSELF first and love myself more. And I can't be happy if the guy I'm dating is out at Night clubs half way across the country. Sadly, we are young and you all know how things go...

Said exchanges would include flirting, as well.

This post might not contain anything new or useful but I hope it is fun.

About Me

 I am probably a 6.3-7.1 out of 10. I am well aware of the fact that I am not God's gift to women, or myself for that fact. I don't have any peculiar interests or achievements that would make me the talk of the town. In other words, I'm like pasta that you make during the weekday with store bought sauce. I gets the job done. I do have one degree and a decent job, I run just enough to fool people into thinking I am a cardio phenom. I buy books and then read their Wikipedia summaries to sound smart (I don't have time to read Moby Dick, I did try though).  I am 30 and my day is spent between work, study for grad school, and watching TV and sports. I use self depreciating humour to a self sabotaging extent, but I am confident in my limited capabilities. 

I am also under 6 feet so I play the dating game on hard mode!. It is tough, not going to lie but life would be meaningless if it was as easy as you mama! (Sorry, had to do it).

My Observations

So you are a guy and you are in your rookie OLD season. You have made a profile and you are ready to be knee deep in women. You start out thinking you are Steph Curry. You think you will score on every second or third shot, you can feel the connection instantly by looking at their profiles, it's right there and all they have to do is holla back. You have thought of all the things you will say, the memes and pick up lines are ready to go. You are just waiting for the proverbial bucket.

The ball hits the rim and bounces out...

The ball crashes the board and out of bounds...

You have now airballed that shot...

Your inbox is emptier than shelves at Walmart after Black Friday 

So now you become Russel Westbrook. You become a volume shooter, you are jacking up threes after threes after threes. It's all about taking chances hoping one goes in. You know it will, it has to. You have also figured out that you are not the only Russel Westbrook but a Russell Westbrook in an ocean of Russell Westbrooks. May the Lord have Mercy!

Now you try upping your profile picture game and your prompts. You dive deep into your life and try to find the all star weekend highlights to let everyone know that you may be a normal dude but you are also Batman.

Ultimately, no one can tell you how to be successful at this. People can only tell you what does not work. All the power to you, hope you find someone. Someone is out there looking for you. You just hope they are on the same planet or else it would be a while.

The profiles I come across

After spending eons (months) in the barren lands and rummaging through profiles of women, I have summarized the following of what women prefer. Maybe this helps one of you to achieve the dreams and then I can live vicariously through one of you.

Sense of humour

You know the saying ""If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything"". Yeah, it's not true. Having a sense of humour is good, having only a sense of humour is disaster. You need to be equal parts fun and funny; not just funny. Also women are big on this personality thing so make sure to develop one. I couldn't develop mine in time so now I use humour to fool people into thinking I'm cool, I am not. 

Sushi

I have no idea why but if sushi is your favourite food or the key to your heart then you, my friend, are in luck. I will eat sushi but have no strong feelings towards it, like pop songs on the radio. But for some reason, this sushi thing is a hit with the ladies. I don't get it but the heart wants what it wants.

Hiking

If you do not spend your Sunday mornings hiking then what in the hell are you doing. (I am personally sleeping in and then eating french toast for breakfast because I am a slob and Sundays are for ignoring everyone and watching sports in my single man life). So you need to start hiking, or say that you love hiking so much you want to marry it. You could be hiking instead of reading this profile.

Travelling

When someone asks me for travelling tips to Greece, I respond by saying ""I'd get an aeroplane ticket for starters"" and then laugh hilariously while feeling their cringe and hopelessness in me. Don't be me, travel when you can and where you can. Just casually name drop that restaurant you tried in a place or the food you have somewhere. You don't have to have a van life but visiting a few places in a year should be enough. Also take a few pictures while you are there. 


Closing remarks

Dating is not easy, it is hard. There is no formula for success but there are things that are guaranteed failures. You cannot force people to like you, you just have to be okay with yourself and find people who are too. You improve yourself each day and then someone will come along (or they won't, nobody knows).

She's never been in a relationship before so she doesnt really know what it's like to have a relationship, or to love someone. She also used to be someone who prefers to be alone, but nowadays she feels like having someone to connect with.

So unlike her I'm ready to have a relationship with her, because I really like her. And I feel like after 15 dates you know each other well enough make the next big 'decision', or just move on, but for some reason she is unsure. She also said that she wants to take things slow so that might be part of the reason, but I'm also wondering a bit if she's actually the relationship type of person or not, because sometimes she doesn't come across like she is. Even though she does want someone to be with in her life.

But yea I'm just a bit unsure about it all. I asked her last week again and that she was going to think about it but again I still haven't got an answer ams I'm kinda getting impatient.

I have never been on a date or anything even remotely close.

From what I see, the dating scene has become quite excruciating for men of all ages, and especially younger men. I personally am not looking to date to meet someone to complete me. Rather, I feel it will just simply add to my life. However, the common advice for men who cannot seem to meet anyone is to just ""let it happen,"" which seems to be very harmful advice. One has to actively put themselves out there to have success.

However, for many men, putting themselves out there for dating is quite a challenge. To give an example, I will use myself. I currently am in an online high school, so there is literally no one to meet. I never go anywhere, and even if I did, I would not want to cold-approach someone since I find it creepy to do (I also would not want to be cold-approached myself since I would only be out to get an errand done as fast as possible). I don't drink anything that isn't water, so that also leaves bars (if I were of age) and coffee shops/cafes out of the equation. All my hobbies are done at home, so I have no need for a group and therefore no way to meet someone over a common interest, with the exception of wrestling/martial arts (which is currently at a halt for now but I will be getting back into it when I turn 18 and have adult autonomy). However, wrestling is not a good environment to meet people and date whatsoever, so that is out of the question as well.

This leaves me and many men like me with only three options to meet people. Work, college, or via online dating. The ""do not cause trouble in a place where you must be on a regular basis"" advice has saved me in the past before, and I do not plan on making a work environment or college environment more difficult for me by adding meeting people to date into the equation. That leaves online dating, which seems to be rather of a meat market and a statistical disadvantage for men. Apparently men outnumber women on apps such as Tinder, which makes sense why men generally get fewer dates from such services. I am sure if women outnumbered men, women would be writing posts like this instead of men, so it is not a ""women vs. men"" thing but rather a simple numerical disadvantage that just happens to be.

Because of this, to make sure you succeed, you essentially need to compete with other men. This means looking like Brad Pitt (man or woman, who wouldn't fall for Brad Pitt?), having a good job, and having lots of money, which, for lots of men, is quite impossible no matter how much effort they have put into themselves. This means one must remain optimistic and just play the numbers game. If one is lucky, then they get to meet someone.

I do legitimately want to meet someone one day and form a long-term and intimate relationship, but I am starting to feel that those who are asexual or just not interested in relationships are the lucky ones. Even if one wins the numbers game, they must date, which entails lots of potential strife, heartbreak, financial losses, and either the best thing or worst thing that could happen to a man (depending on how you look at it) which is marriage. If you are very lucky and everything works out, then it seems to be one of the best things in the world. However, statistically speaking, in regards to how many men struggle to meet someone and how many men end up divorced, one most likely will not be that lucky. This means that your freedom for your personal life and your potential career could be heavily impeded. You may also experience near-irreparable emotional damage, and even worse, financial devastation as a result.

Dating seems to be a game that truly only the luckiest and most successful of men get to have happiness out of it. I am starting to feel maybe those who are born asexual are actually born the luckiest, as they would not have to deal with any of this.

We’ve been dating about a month and a half now and gone on five total dates. We haven’t defined the relationship yet but I’m planning on having that talk soon. When we are together he acts very boyfriend like, this past weekend we hung up posters together and he even made me coffee and breakfast after I spent the night. I haven’t heard from him since. 

He travels a lot during the week for work, almost 50 weeks out of the year he’s gone for at least 2 to 3 days at a time. The first couple of times we hung out, I went home and he texted me right after/the next day, and then I wouldn’t hear from him until the following weekend when he asked me out again. 

This last date we went on I initiated since I had not done that yet and I felt like it was my turn. It’s been three days since I spent the night (which I’ve done before) and I haven’t heard from him. He told me when I left the other day that he will let me know what this week looks like. I was there until 3pm in the afternoon, and we had spend all day cuddling and he made me breakfast. 

I reached out this morning and asked him how’s he been and if he’s traveling this week and I have not received a reply. Should I be worried? It’s been about 12 hours now. I know that he has a demanding job and maybe his 30+ age plays some sort of factor into how little he texts. But I suffer from anxiety and sometimes I overthink. We’re not quite a couple yet and I haven’t really expressed to him that our lack of communication between our dates bothers me. I plan on asking him about it the next time we’re in person. 

If he doesn’t reply to me by tomorrow, is that a red flag? In general, is his lack of communication between dates a bad sign? He has paid for every date and done all of the planning, even when I initiated. He is such a gentleman and he talks about all these things he wants to do with me and these places around our city he would like to take me. He even got my opinion on buying prints for his apartment. But then during the week, it’s mostly silence. He works in investment banking if that plays any sort of factor into all of this.

I’m 24M and haven’t had much success in the dating world. I think a lot of this is down to my inability to be authentic, which might be a deeper issue in itself, but if we’re sticking to dating, I have this self-imposed burden I place on myself of trying to approach the whole thing in a cool, smooth way, which I’ve noticed actually hinders me significantly. 

The problem I have here is that I can’t actually figure out what “myself” looks like. Since I have all these pre-conceived notions on how to go about seducing someone and getting them to go on a date with me, I end up focusing so much on this perceived path to success that I come across like the completely opposite of how I intend to. 

I guess my question is, what advice do you have on loosening up and just being more self-confident while also figuring out what the right approach is for me personally? 

I hope this is the right place to post this. I’ve tried online dating and it never really worked for me either. I’m at a bit of a stalemate and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t frustrating.

To summarize, I (F20) recently asked this guy (F22) out who goes to the same college as me. So far we've really hit it off, the first date went great and I went back to his place to hang out and spend the night but we didn't go as far as having sex. He was incredibly patient and wasn't expecting anything to happen, as even he said he doesn't normally do anything on the first date. We have a second date lined up and I told him I want to wait until the third and he doesn't have an issue with it. We text every day and anytime we cross paths at school he stops to hang out for a bit. I really do think he feels the same way I do.

The thing is, I'm used to having sex on the first date but I'm also used to guys leaving afterwards. This isn't always the case but I sometimes go out with guys that just aim to have sex at the end of the night and nothing more, without making their intentions clear. I actually like the guy I'm seeing and want to do things right, but a part of me is worried that he'll just distance himself after sex (and I have enough experience to know there's nothing wrong with the sex itself unless I just don't click with someone).

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30. Social anxiety is something I deal with but not that much of a contributing factor. Around a yr ago, I took a 6 month break from dating apps.

It was very amiable as breakups go. We both agreed that there were no hard feeling against each other, and she said I was a great guy, she was just too busy. 

The reason we broke up was because she was always too busy to spend time with me. She has activities five nights during the week and was out of town three of the last four weekends. Although I know that she is extremely busy (busier than any other high schooler I’ve ever met), I know that it’s often code for “I’m not interested, and she wasn’t making a huge effort to get together. She did enjoy talking to me, and hardly talked to anyone else at work. Although maybe she just wanted to be friends, idk. 

After thinking it through, I came to a conclusion. She was one of three things: way too busy for a relationship (but felt awkward about breaking up), not interested in a romantic relationship (but nervous about breaking up), or interested but taking me for granted. 

I decided that I didn’t want to be with someone that was any of those things, so I told her that I liked her but understood if she didn’t have time for a relationship or just wasn’t feeling it. She said that she thought I was a great guy but she really didn’t have the time for it right now. She said that she hoped there wouldn’t be any hard feelings, and I told her it was fine, I understood. I kept it together and talked to her for a little while about random stuff so she wouldn’t feel awkward about it. 

I went home and started feeling upset but felt a little better when I woke up this morning. I went to work feeling depressed but after a while I started feeling much better. Then, she came into work and I started feeling terrible again. I tried to avoid her for a while, but after a while she tried to talk to me a little. I thought if I talked to her much I might lose my composure, so I made a quick exit. 

I still like her, but I think my best course of action is to not talk to her or interact with her for a while. It will help me get over her quicker and allow me to move on. 

However, I was wondering if not talking and texting with her would potentially have the “no contact” effect, where she would eventually miss me enough to reach out in a few months when she has more time. Or would it not work because she would still be seeing me often enough to not have any intrigue or curiosity, even if I wasn’t talking to her? Either way, I will try and move on, although I would still be open if she initiates later on. Just please let me know if this is a possibility even if she sees me at work but doesn’t interact with me. I provided as much info as possible so I can get accurate advice.

I'm 27f, the man in question is 36. He is my boss. I'm relatively new to the job, and we casually started texting (he's not my direct boss and I only met him twice) he turned out to be a shy introvert who is also kinda cool. I liked him. He asked me out on a nice picnic date (I said yes but we still didnt go cuz I asked for some time)

Then I noticed in various instances during our text interactions, he used very oddly specific and unnecessary vocabulary that sound pretty creepy. 

For instance, I talked about being in Egypy last Summer, the conversation shifted to some other topic, then he re-responded to my text about in Egypy saying ""I really want to visit the pyramids. To go inside and shit, and go deep"" 
I thought that was very weird to say...

Today he initiated a text asking if I've seen the moon tonight. I said no what does it look like? He said ""well for one, it's huge, and it's red"" I thought that was weird too. 

And he sent me the song Poison by Alice Cooper.

So I went ahead and told him I'm gonna say him and myself the trouble, and told him that I do not do casual sex and wish to end whatever this is. 

He said this is not at all what he wanted, and apologised that I got it like that.

Currently in training with him and several others from the company. We went out to HH last Thursday as a group and it was very obvious that he likes me. Got my friend who works at same company to ask if he does like me and he said yes, but likes to keep work and relationships separate, which I understand. 

I asked the guy myself yesterday if he does like me. He said yes and also mentioned the work vs. relationship preference. He asked if I like him and then what happens from here on out. I said we could get drinks and he turns around and says it’s a date and that he’ll text me. His words, not mine! 

So I know it’s only Tuesday, but what is a reasonable amount of time for him to text me and lock down a day and time? It was very open ended. I am currently training next to him all day in person. If he ends up not texting me at all, should I just drop it or casually ask if a date is still on the table (too desperate?)?

He was staying true to keeping work and relationships separate until I said that I also liked him. The things that he said to me in front of a group at HH were not indicative of a person that likes that separation at all, so I’m confused. I’m afraid he’s having second thoughts and will just let the whole thing blow over. I do not want to push anything but would also like to know if there’s a plan for the weekend lol.

I've seen more unconditional kindness and feminine traits from my friends latin and white girlfriends then black women. 

I've mostly dated within my race  but they just seemed problematic and....just....not....feminine. some apparently never dated a black dude who had a 9-5, others were just about the bag and image, some were just there for a good time,some were just ""city girls"" with no personality whatsoever. Overly religious, to the point she can't talk to men, then there was the lawyer who thought it was cool to tell me her uncle was one of the biggest druglords in chicago....., the last one I dated lacked basic human decency. I gave her a sample of my cooking and she liked it a lot to the point she wanted the recipe. I said cool how about you cook something for me and we can trade. She said deal. This lady tried 3 times to finesse her way to getting the recipe without trying to do anything. She eventually made a ""cake"" but it tasted like it was store bought cake straight from the freezer.🤣. My mistake was trying to give her another shot but I quickly learned it was a mistake as she started to show disdain toward black men because they only want her for sex. I backed out and told her to try betterhelp to workout her issues. 

Most of these ladies had degrees but im not sure if that matters at all. I've told my white,latin,indian,Indian, ask friends and it's one of several reasons why they don't date black women. 

I haven't really been focusing on dating lately especially black women, but wanted to get this out here and see what people think. Not trying to run my life through a lady. I have my own life and goals I need to do. Just trying to figure out how I can find someone that can tag along and can actually be supportive.

I've really tried very hard to make myself meet all of those expectations but I still find myself repeatedly being left on read, or friend-zoned out of nowhere even after flirting thinking they are interested. Which has made me think okay am I being too friendly or do I need to tone down my personality even after reducing it already? But then when I meet them I don't want to feel like I am playing a character. If I don't play that character and act as my comfortable self I can see them actively tuning out and becoming more so disinterested (all I really do when being myself is ask them questions that lead into some pretty cool convos and of course make them laugh whenever the opportunity arises). I never try to pull the whole I am a ""nice guy bullshit I did this so you do this nonsense"" because people are people and why even bother trying to control someone like that. ""Let it be as it will be"" or some other similar horseshit.

Rarely once in a blue moon after about 23ish left on reads, I will actually set up a nice little date with someone...

So the last date I went on I must have completely misread the entire vibe over text because 5 mins after I picked her up she called her boyfriend she was getting eloped to and broke up with him then she talked shit about her ex, then she told me all about her baby daddy and asked me if I could drop her off at her baby daddy's house (60 mins in the opposite direction of my house). All I did through the entire interaction was ask her questions and encouraged her to do what she thought was best but please know I did not drive her that far because that was just out of the question.

So yeah dating has been pretty soul-crushing and I have no idea why people have 0 interest after talking to me. The only red flags I can think of is I text back fast, and I do also sometimes double text if I am excited about the discussion.

I've been single for 10 years. Maybe three dates and that time. No sex, nothing. I'm part of the reason being I used to weigh about 430 lb up until maybe about 2 years ago. I've lost about a good 200 of that. I really really struggle with dating. I still don't find myself attractive at all and I feel like a lot of the people that I would ask out. I don't even try because I just assume the answer is going to be a nose. I don't really even say anything or a lot of women will just give me a look just like  disdain or just like discst and and I feel like they  see me as a creep. And I just let it go there. I haven't asked any women out  since getting  a bit skinnier except through dating apps which I'm about to give up on because I also don't get matches. I don't get the people I choose either  only git the people that want to match with me is not the other way around. But I still match with them but they turn out to be kind of crazy or  a catfish. Nah I'm not saying I'm the most handsome person cuz I'm not but I think misrepresenting yourself online is not the best thing I never have once in 10 years been matched with the person that I chose to be matched with this is beating my confidence into the ground I'm getting to the point now in my life where it sucks to be by yourself. All the freaking time All my friends are in. Families are committed. Relationships have careers. I have a job. It's not the best. I make a decent salary. I have a car I can cook for myself. Cleaning for myself. I bake on paper. I seem like I should be okay but yet I get no attention from women. I guess my question is where am I messing up? How can I move on to the next step even with just online dating? If anyone hasn't answer that'd be nice",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164307,public,self,29m single for 10 years,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tkijs6/29m_single_for_10_years/,no_ads,0,,,,,,
