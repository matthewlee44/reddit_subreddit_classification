The following I am about to say may be difficult.

My issues have taken over my life. I have never been able to cope. I am only recently coming to the realization that I have lived life wrong. In many ways, I blame my parents for sheltering me for far too long.

Growing up, I had only focused on school, work, and employment. As a result, I now live comfortably and set. I make good money, I can buy whatever with little to worry, I have no debt, etc. However, I am not happy. I never realized it until 2 years ago when I met my first GF online. (The relationship failed after 2 years. We never even got to meet due to covid and her government denying non-citizens to visit.)

For years I had avoided relationships. You could say I was traumatized from a young age by my own parents improper handling of me telling them how I was in love with someone. I was so hurt by how they reacted that I avoided relationships at all cost. From High School and thru college. It was deemed ""unnecessary"" or a ""distraction"".

I have finally opened up about my problems and now it feels like its way too late. I have been so sheltered that knowing that finding out someone has previously been in a relationship makes my head spin. I can't consider dating someone that hasn't gone through ""the works"". 

I now have an OCD where I feel like a person that has had sex with someone else shares the DNA of that person forever. I also went through something called ""Retroactive Jealousy OCD"". This is how my thoughts work. Imagine each person being their own flavor of drink. Every drink is unique. Imagine taking a drop of one drink and it drips in the other drink. That drink is now contaminated. Its not like you can filter out or undo or clean the contents of that other drink. That is what it feel like mentally. People say its all in my head. But if that is true, why do we have STDs? Its not even the STDs that worry me. Its the fluids in general.

So I am 28, never kissed a girl, let alone been with one overnight. Now its all I want. To be with someone and to feel loved. Except I will not find someone that has never been ""contaminated"". Women that fit that category are most likely women from High School and early college days. All probably have done A to Z and have children by now.

Casual relationships, Hookups, and all those things were unheard of for me. I didn't even learn what it meant until a few years ago. But now these thoughts and my disgust stops me from being able to open my opportunities or from turning women away. I don't know what to do. I feel disgusted with today's society. I have always felt that people didn't do such things until after they got married. I always thought it was uncommon. How many times do birds find a mate in their lifetime?

I suffer from depression due to the loneliness and hopelessness. I feel like I am too late. I am getting older. I don't feel like I will find someone that will fit my wants. I don't know how to change my mindset. I don't know what to do.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1007575,public,nsfw,28 Forever Alone and With Issues,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pogxec/28_forever_alone_and_with_issues/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,

We're both in our late 30s and had a ton in common. We had matched and chatted on a dating app and turned out we had a ton of mutual friends and acquaintances. We had fun together, genuinely enjoyed each others company and the sex was amazing. We both kind of fell very hard and very fast for one another.

A little background information, she has 2 very young kids, I've never had a child and she is the first single mom I have ever dated. When we very first started dating she told me that it was going to take someone very special for her to have another kid. I didn't really press the matter since I felt it was way too soon to have that discussion but I did tell her that I had hoped to be a father one day and felt like I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't. I was upfront and from my perspective I felt like she was going to see if I was that ""someone very special"" but we kind of shelved that issue for another day.

About 2 weeks later I was texting and mentioned something about ""when I have children"" and she replied ""don't you mean if""? I figured it was time to just be upfront with her. I told her that I did want to have a biological child, that I was super excited at the prospect of being a stepdad but that I really did want at least one child that came from me, that I wanted to share that kind of bond with a woman. I feel theres a level of intimacy that comes from sharing a child and I want that with whoever my wife would be.

We almost broke up over it but I guess she talked to her mother about this issue she changed her mind because the very next day after we almost break up she tells me she'd have children with me she even goes so far as whispering in my ear: ""I want to have your babies"" while we're having sex. She texts me the next day saying things like: ""I can't wait to have your smart babies"" and ""they're going to be beautiful"".

I found this to be kind of a red flag to be honest, we literally almost broke up the day before over this and the next day she's saying this to me in bed. Idk why I ignored it but I guess I felt like she meant it. I felt like she was genuine and I really felt safe and comfortable with her. She keeps telling me during sex how much she can't wait to be pregnant with my baby and texting me similar things. This is the first time a woman has ever expressed wanting to do this with me and it honestly is making me fall for her more. I'm on cloud 9 because I feel like I've finally met my person.

We continue dating and we plan this weekend together at her place, which includes us going to a wedding on that Sunday evening. Her kids are at their fathers house most of the weekend, but he needs her to watch them for a few hours on Sunday and she thinks it's a perfect time for me to meet them. I'm very apprehensive about meeting her children because I really felt like it was too soon, but this wasn't the first time she was pressuring me to meet them and I kinda gave in. I figured that it would need to happen eventually and I really felt like things were serious after all so I felt like this was really going to happen, so I agreed to meet her kids. 

Come Sunday I meet the kids and their honestly adorable. Apparently their dad really isn't present with them and they took to me right away. We played and had fun and the youngest one even cuddled up to me on the couch and fell asleep. Honestly, I had fallen for this woman, and her kids were great and I thought this couldn't be any more perfect. She loves me, wants to be with me, she wants to build a life with me, trusts me with her kids and wants to have a child with me. I'm really happy and thinking about how things have finally turned around for me. I was already in love with her and it wasn't hard to fall for the kids either. I was excited to think that I'd finally be what I'd always wanted to be, a good husband and father. 

We have a blast for the short time we have and then its time to drop them back off at their dad's and go to the wedding. On the way to the wedding she's driving and grabs her phone to text her friend, while driving, swerves and we almost go into the ditch at 70mph. I ask her to please not text while she's driving and she gets PISSED. We have our first fight. Its not to bad, it stays civil and we didn't yell at each other. She's mad because she doesn't like people telling her what to do but I said I wasn't going to apologize because I do not think asking someone to take my safety seriously is unreasonable or anything to be sorry for. I'm a paramedic and I explain to her that I've seen first hand what distracted driving does to people and the death I've seen. I won't apologize for asking someone to take safety seriously, especially after the things I have seen. 

The rest of the evening goes pretty well and we seem to have fun, but then on the way back to pick up her kids she starts telling me about how she's sad because she wants to go to grad school and she feels like she's never going to reach that goal because all she's going to be doing is having babies. She tells me how she wanted to go a few years ago but couldn't because of her husband (yeah their divorce isn't finalized yet but they've been separated over a year) wanted to have kids, then bailed on her and never helped with the newborn care. She says that she feels like she doesn't have control over her body and that she's just going to be a baby factory for the men she's with and I'm just sitting there listening and when she's done all I say is: ""If thats what you truly want then you should have just said that"". She doesn't really say anything and all I say is: ""I feel like I'm never going to get to be a dad.""

We pick up her boys from their dad's place and drive back to hers. I have school (I'm transitioning into nursing) the next day and she has work so I go home. In the morning we talk on the phone and her tone is different and she starts telling me that things she was fine with before she's all the sudden not fine with, for example me watching porn. She told me she didn't care in the beginning if I did and now she's telling me that she wants me to only go to her for sexual gratification and starts laying down all these strict rules. It honestly felt like she was trying to get me to break up with her but I agreed and we get off the phone but the more I think about it the more I'm bothered by all of this. So I call her that evening and I tell her that I don't want her to have to change the direction she wants her life to go in and that I think we have fundamental differences in what we want and its not fair for us to stay together. Its civil and I feel amicable. Then today I text her just to ask how she's doing and she's just PISSED off at me. She tells me she's mad that I met her kids and then broke up with her the next day (mind you she pressured me into meeting them), but then admits 2 texts later that shes was actually trying to break up with me that morning but didn't because I agreed to her new boundaries. She says that she feels like I tricked her into thinking I'd be fine with just being a step dad (which I made very clear I wanted to have a biological child and she said she wanted to have my babys and repeatedly said it during sex A LOT) and she's mad she spent the morning on the phone with me and then broke up with her that evening. 

There were a ton of other red flags outside of the whole children issue that aren't really relevant but everything just added up and I wanted to get out because I felt like dragging it out would be worse than just getting it over with now. Especially for her boys. 

I feel really terrible about all of this but I can't help but think that honestly I was the one who was being tricked. She told me she wanted to have more children with me and then confesses that she doesn't really want to AFTER I meet her kids. I feel like she was just trying to get me to meet her kids so I'd love them and say being a stepdad was enough. I feel like she was just trying to find a man to be a father to her kids because he exhusband is so uninvolved with the kids and she's overwhelmed by working fulltime and caring for young kids. I feel like she manipulated me but I still feel terrible about all of this. I honestly don't think I'll ever try to date a single mother ever again. 

I've learned that there really can be no compromise on the children issue. If you aren't on the same page from the beginning never trust that the other person has changed their mind. Its a hard full stop and there is no way to work around it.

We drafted up a plan we're excited about to fly her out to me like Dec 28th and have New Years in the city I'm in now, and then do the cross country road trip, and then hang out in my new city I'm living in and then go back to where she is a few hours away from my new city, and just basically have a little move in trial run until I start my job and head back down to my new town at the end of January.

But I was lookin on quora and google and it seems that much time together can be detrimental to a relationship potentially.

We clicked, and became instant friends in such short span I work there so we decided to maybe, hangout this weekend if time allows. We haven't made ANY plans besides ""maybe this weekend"".

Here is the issue, my girlfriend of 2 years. She is sweet an amazing but if she doesn't like something in slightest, she hates it and if she likes it, she just loves to insane levels, so it's either 0 or a 100 emotion wise and it wasn't like that when I met her.

I have came after work today, and since I know her well and didn't want to make it seem like I'm hiding anything from her, since it's also includes another female I just told her ""Hey im going to hangout with my coworker this weekend, she has ADHD too and we gonna prolly get something to eat and imma be back by 8 or so(I get off at 6 so barely 2 hours of being away from my gf)"".

She freaked out, she started saying stuff such as that I'm doing this because she isn't enough for me(I lived through pandemic with her, 24/7 for the past 2 years.), that I'm trying to replace, upgrade etc. She mentioned that I can ""do what I want with her"" so I assume sex, so she thinks I want to cheat on her.

Few months ago we were at the party and then her crush came to the same party and in the HS they had a thing together. I didn't care about it after she explained why she got all nervous all of the sudden, but litteraly day after she asked me if I would be ok if she hangs out with him someday. I asked her if that would be just him and her or more people and she said just him and her and I told her I wouldn't mind as long as I meet him and he doesn't give me any reason not to trust him. Like I mentioned before, I trust my gf so I would need to know him and what kind of person he is now(she hasn't seen him for the past 2 years.) She agreed and told me she was asking it theoretically to see what I say and we never brought it up until today.



In my head it seems hella messed up that she blatantly told me I cannot be friends with a coworker just because it's a female. I tried explaining to her that I would love them both to meet each other, and my coworker knows that I'm in a relationship.

For the past 3 months or so financially we were tight and that was stressing both of us out but it would go to that point where she would yell at me, tell me she doesn't love me, she hates me, she changed her mind on proposal and marriage(she lost proposal ring too), and weekly changes mind about her feelings towards me.
It's tough for me, so I just was happy to find this person that has same issues as me ADHD wise that I could relate to, but im unable to due to this whole situation with my gf.

What are my options besides breaking up?(we have a lease that isn't due until december July 2022).She mentioned that even me saying that I want to hangout with someone else breaks her heart and she doesn't know how to feel about this.
I had about 2,3 friends before I met her but they were very very close to me but now I have 0 friends.
Right now she locked herself in the room, refusing to communicate to me while I'm in the living room on the couch.

There was this girlF(20) I M(21) really liked and I done a lot  of things for her and she give good signals for asking for a relationship but in the end she done me so dirty 

Here’s the things we done and the signals 

1. I always check on her mental health because she opened about her depression to me and said I’m  only person she ever told this to and  even told me about her suicidal thoughts 

2. Always use to walk her home at night after studying together 

3. When she was broke I bought her food and never asked for the money back because her parents don’t give her money (it was only two times) 

4. She always comes to me and be like guy a said this about me you don’t think it’s true.  E.g a guy called her stupid once so she’s always looking for my reassurance 

5. I always involve her when she get left out because she’s shy 

6. She always downplays her self because of lack of confidence and I always uplift her 

7. She would say flirty stuff like I’m only the girl that can make you listen to juice wrld because what we have is special 

8. Then one time a Romantic song comes on and she whispers to me the lyrics could describe us in the future 

9. Always looking at me weirdly when I’m talking about girls 

10. We went to the beach together and took photos and everyone say we look like boyfriend and girlfriend in the photo


I was finally going to ask her out on a date I invited her on a walk and at the end I was going to ask her out on a date. 

She rejected my walk invite 

Went home and spoke to my friend on the phone and he said he just spoke to the girl on the phone and she told him there was this guy I use to like a lot romantically and I don’t like him anymore. She told him if you can guess the guy I will tell you if it’s right or wrong. He says my name and she straight away says no and puts up a wired face expression and then she’s like don’t get me wrong I like the guy but he’s so annoying at times and a overreactor I could never ever date him. 

I don’t understand why she lead me on just to trash my name. I’m actually really upset about this 

It’s not necessarily about the fact she wouldn’t date me it’s the way she completely throw my name under the bus she attacked my character as well after me always being there for her 

Then yesterday I say bye to my friend at the train Station as soon as I see this girl I leave the station I want nothing to do with her and then she sends a text saying we didn’t get to say hi to each other 😢. I just left her on open

I’m a 19 year old male. When I was 17 I fell in love for the first time. Real love like in the movies. I met her on my first day working at the zoo near my house, and immediately we were both just completely infatuated by each other. We talked and became best friends pretty much all summer, but we were always very obviously flirty with each other. We’d go out to get ice cream almost every night. We’d never get any, just sit in the parking lot and talk for hours and hours. She was a few years older than me (20 to be exact), so she was hesitant about becoming anything more than friends, even though she obviously really wanted to. After months of us being flirty and touchy and staying up all night talking we finally kissed and began the “talking stage”, and a few months after that we started dating. We dated for almost a year, and we’re “together” for probably 14-15 months. We hung out almost every day. The only problem was that she was very controlling, but I never even noticed it because I was so incredibly obsessed with her as she was with me. During the time we were dating I dropped almost all of my friends, didn’t see any of them for months. She would freak out and cry any time I would go out with friends, especially if their were other girls there(literally like if it was a big group and a few girls were also there, or even if I was with a friend and his girlfriend). She basically didn’t allow me any friends,she would even be upset if a girl I knew texted me just to be like “hey in having a party and everyone’s coming”. But for a while I saw nothing wrong because I loved her so much. Eventually thst all caught up to us, and with me leaving for college lingering over us we ended up breaking up. But it wasn’t any regular breakup. She was so convinced I cheated on her or was trying to cheat on her with literally no reasoning, she didnt trust me at all. After almost a full year of dating, my first real girlfriend, and forsure my first love. While I was a work one day (this is the next summer so we worked at different places) she just sent me a paragraph about how I was a terrible person and I never loved her and all things like that, said we were over, and blocked me on everything. I mean everything: Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, phone number, etc. I had no way to reach out. Literally none, she was a very introverted person, one of the reasons she would never meet my friends. So she had few friends, and the ones she did have weren’t very close, so I couldn’t reach out to them to get her to talk to me. Just like that, I never spoke to her again, I read that last hateful message after a year of falling in love, and I was never able to speak to her again. I took it very hard, understandably, but I felt “over it” after around 3 months. 
Well now it’s almost a year and a half after we broke up. 
I barely ever think about her, but every once in a while( a couple times a month) she pops into my head. I’ve had relationships with other girls, but they all went sour after a short period of time. It was never because I was thinking of her or anything like that. But any time I would start to like a girl, it would fizzle away fast, even once I had her, just a few days later I would want nothing to do with them. Not in a mean way, like I wish it didn’t happen but I just couldn’t see myself with them. I hated all PDA, even just small touches, I could barely even talk to them and I can’t figure out why. It’s happened multiple times. I’ve also just lost a lot of interest in relationships all together. I still feel a sex drive in myself, but it passes quick and then I don’t even think about anything like that. I don’t understand what is going on with me. 

It’s been almost a year and a half. I don’t think about her often at all. Could this be a closure thing? Should I try and reach out to her for closure?

Men, no matter what age, tend to want to date a woman who is in her early 20's. Women in their 20's want to date a man only a few years older max. BUT, when women reach 30, they desire men up to 45 years old. At 40, they will desire men up to 60+ years old. 

Which basically means, if you are a 35-year-old or a 40-year-old or a 50-year-old man, and on and on, 70, 80, 90, 110...your brain, chemistry, core make up wants to date a girl who is 20-28 or so, in a perfect world 20-22. But, those girls are plain disgusted at the idea mostly. If you are 42 (like me), only a small minority of 20 somethings are hopping on this bus, but when they hit 30, studies say they're all about this. But, my brain (and studies) say, ""no thank you, I am trying to stay below 30."" 

I suspect, generally, that most women want to be taken care of. Feminism can fight many things but it can't fight basic human nature in the end. This makes sense, as studies tend to show having a master's degree as a man makes you way more desirable to a woman, and men tend to want a woman to max out at a bachelor's degree. Women think an older man can care for them better, emotionally and financially. But, also, I think most would agree (and again, studies show) that women, on average, peak physically in their 20's, while men peak in their 40's. That makes sense w the data that says a 30-year-old woman is happy to date a max up to 45 yrs old. Women in their 20's don't count in the peak area, as they only want dudes a few years older max, so they are the anomaly. I wonder why that is? They are at their peak physically, so would they not date men who are at their peak as well?  Is it being new to the world, as it were, that causes them to think 40 yr old dudes are grody? Interesting stuff. I would assume a lot of this has to do with fertility as well. Women need to be physically peaking at an earlier age for the fact that they lose fertility after 30 in a very deep dive curve (plus, a woman has only so many eggs at birth)...and men can keep producing sperm cells until they die. Women lose around 90% of their available eggs by age 30.

Personally, my preference at 42 is late 20's. A lot of that is based on, I have never been married and do not want to marry a woman who has been married, and I do not want to date a girl who has kids, which is more likely after 30. Also, at 42, maybe I am alone, but I rarely look at a woman in her 30's and think, ""oh wow, she's gorgeous."" Again, goes back to the studies that show women peak physically in their early 20's.  
   
Also, it's an unfair double standard, but culturally I think we see a woman who is 40 or close to it and never married, and we say, ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?"" Whereas, a man can remain unmarried for nearly ever, and we don't judge him in the same way. To be fair, it makes sense scientifically- women are the choosers and men are the pursuers. A woman has a much higher probability of bagging a dude for marriage at an earlier age due to the fact that they have the pick of the litter (average looking women and above) and have around 4,000 times as many options at any given time than your average dude.

i’ve been wanting to get back into dating as of recently so trying to give everyone who asks me out a fair chance, i’ve been talking to this guy for a week or so and we have a whole date night planned - he’s quite attractive and honestly i’ve been so excited to get dressed up and have fun regardless of the date outcome.

we ended up getting into the topic of the dark web and he told me he’d spent $200 on a fake covid passport (!!!!!) as he doesn’t want to put anything in his body that he doesn’t need, but didn’t want to miss out on festivals and techno events. 

i am very much pro-vaccine, but not going to get too political on here. i completely understand people’s anxiety surroundingthe vaccine as i was an absolute nervous wreck before i got mine, but i still went through with it to protect myself and others. i don’t agree with anti-vaxxers especially when it’s blatantly obvious they haven’t formed their own intelligent opinion on the matter and it’s clear they’ve got all of their information from facebook conspiracy theorists. anyway, i digress. 

i just think it’s such a stupid amount of money to spend on something that’s so pointless - like bro just go and get your free vaccines i don’t understand 😭 i honestly feel like i’d be going against my morals and values going on this date with him - but he’s already booked and paid for everything so i don’t know what to do. please give a girl some advice",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1008258,public,self,date with an anti-vaxxer,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/poowop/date_with_an_antivaxxer/,all_ads,6,,,

Maybe we both make assumptions. 

Often I meet them thru social media or dating app. I always know how to talk to girls on text and how to flirt with them - they almost always want to go on a date with me.

Now I do not want to come across arrogant but I'm pretty attractive. I'm 6""2+ , blonde and in a very athletic shape because I've been doing gymnastics and swiming since I was little. 

I've no baldness, straight teeth, know how to dress, and no facial anomalies like funky ear shape or what so ever. 

Yet, girls I date, would rarely say something nice to me. And there must be something to say at least...

But allright - no biggy. 

On social media I am also never showing off my body - certainly no topless posts, and I've absolutely no narcistic or superficial traits. I can easily be with a girl that looks average and love her to death.

Besides my physical appearance (and again, I'm not anything better than anyone) - I'm also intelligent, know a lot about culture, art, music, history, and I've a serious job. 

But ok! You still can be this and that, if you're a dick, no girl wants you. Now here's the thing - I'm always showing much interest, asking the girl many questions about her work, education, family, lifestyle, what's important in relationships etc. I'm always respectful and authentic.

If we go out for lunch or drinks, I pay. I ask if she wants to drink something else, check if she's ok, etc. Before we say goodbye, if I liked the date, I always tell in person that I liked the date and wish to meet again (no specific date of course) - and I'm always getting a positive reply like ""sure, let's keep in touch"". 

But then, often they aren't showing much interest and I'm not sure if they are waiting for me to make a move or don't want to meet me again. Also with this last girl I met.

I'm not going to push. I need a green light from them i.e. asking me how I am, how was my day, or give me any kind of reason to propose another date. When I'm not getting that, it turns me off and I won't follow up with them.

Then, this particular girl then suddenly replied to my Instagram story (she didn't need to?) with a "" ;) "" emoji. I asked how she is doing and she asked ""how are you"" ? Sounds good to me.

So the next day I asked her if she would like to hang out with my in the evening - to only get a reply that she's having diner with her friends and thus ""can't meet tonight"". 

But no counter proposal, or something like ""I'd have liked to, but \_\_\_"".

This is the moment I stop. I won't even reply to her anymore or wish her a good diner.

I have him very much; however, he is different from most guys I’ve dated (in a good way). He’s patient, gentle, soft etc, but still enjoyed football games, sports and things like that. 

Recently he said something that kinda made me overthink. Now just for reference and background, my mom’s last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past and she’s told me in great detail about that marriage. I am still close to my stepfather and he doesn’t know that I know what went down. Now to get to the question! I work with individuals with developmental disabilities and one of my clients is super flirtatious in a cute way. So I jokingly said “gotta be careful she might try to take you from me” and he jokingly said “babe just tell her I’m gay”. Obviously because of what I’ve experienced in my mom’s marriage I automatically thought the worst and began overthinking. 

This made me think of other instances (and I’m probably overthinking these as well). So when we 1st started dating he went on a trip out of town with a group of college friends, there were guys and girls on this trip, they rented a Airbnb! when he got back I asked him where they stayed and he told me that they all stayed at the Airbnb. He said he and one of his college buddies shared a room and slept in the same bed. This was like our 1st year of dating so I didn’t think anything of it tbh. 

Another thing is when my mom first met him she asked me “is he ok?” Basically asking if he was gay. And I laughed at her, crazy enough she’s now IN LOVE with him. Like she legit loves him as her own and calls him all the time and it’s super sweet the relationship they’ve formed but now it’s like all those thoughts are coming back. 

Sexually, we have no problem. I have been holding out until marriage but we do engaged in other sexual activities and when we do he almost always initiates it. He grabs a handful of my boob every night before he sleeps. 

I guess my question is, should I be concerned?

Typing that makes it sound a little crazy but we all have standards and expectations of the people we want in our lives so don’t judge me lol. 

My guy needs to be a romantic, a gentlemen, someone who will go out of their way to put others first. I’m a 21 year old female and I’m not ashamed to say I’ve had a lot of sexual partners, and out of all those sexual partners I’ve only ever had a few genuine connections. Out of those few I only ever received flowers from 3 men. It genuinely made me happy and to me its a perfect gift. To me is shows that you were thinking of me and wanted to do something nice for me. Lately the guys I’ve hung around, are not like that. Most of them just think about themselves and are seriously selfish people. Meanwhile I’m out here offering to cook you food, make sure you have everything you need. My love language is acts of service no doubt, I love showing the people I love that I care about them. I don’t ever want them to doubt that. Im not at all trying to gloat but I’m a very giving person I will go all out, buy you things, spoil your ass essentially. I’ve yet to meet another person to do any of those things for me. Are there guys out there who even do this? If so where the hell are you hiding. 

I’m not just saying it has to be monetary things, it’s the little things that win my heart. For example when I was talking to this guy, I mentioned to him that I wasn’t feeling good and I was on my period and cramping really bad. He came to my house after he got out of work with roses, a heating pad (that I still have lol) and soup from my favorite restaurant. For some people that might not be saying much but it was a surprise and so sweet. 

Being this way has it perks, but then it also has its downfalls too. For example for Valentine’s Day I got my boyfriend at the time, some gifts, searched for days for the perfect items and when it was time to exchange gifts I’ll all he got me was a bag of candy. I was so disappointed, I find myself disappointed a lot with people, they don’t put half as much effort into me as I would do for them. Now maybe I have my head up my ass and please tell me if I do but I don’t think I’m crazy here. Is it normal to be around someone who doesn’t do anything nice for you? I just want to meet someone who would want to show me that they care for me in the same capacity. Maybe the reality is none of those guys wanted to give any of those things to me, I wasn’t the person they would do that for.

This summer I developed a full-on crush on him but he has a girlfriend so I thought ""nevermind, maybe another time if he's ever single again.""

He still remained sweet all the other times I saw him, but this one moment where he said that about her made me realize he might not be so nice. Do you also think it's a clear red flag?

I ask that you give me grace and are kind in the comments as this has been super hard for me.

I am dating this man who has been super sweet, kind, loving etc. But for some reason I can’t shake off some of the things about his past. To give you some context, he’s way more experienced than I am and it’s hard for me to comprehend some of the things he did (i.e way more people he’s dated, FWBs - which I’ve never had as I am more of a long term person, etc) I understand the past is the past, but I’m not sure why it hurts me so much. I shouldn’t have necessarily asked for the nitty gritty details, but I did and now I can’t take that image off of my head. Beinf a more long term dater, I often times find it hard to be intimate and vulnerable at that level and for me it’s hard to understand how he gave that aspect of himself so easily to absolute strangers. 

Another thing is, idk why it bothers me that he follows a lot of NSFW womxn accounts on social media. He justified it saying he was single or only casually seeing people before for a couple years. He did unfollow them, but it just makes me feel a little whack. I know I need to work on myself and it’s on me but please be kind haha, I’m trying. 

Any advice or words of wisdom to get past this? I feel like I’m fighting this internal conflict all alone and it’s been so hard. I know everyone makes different life choices but I can’t help but feel a little sad / scared / anxious about the future. I’ve also spoken to him about this quite a few times and he’s been patient.

So I began to talk to this guy who is best friends with MY best friends boyfriend, I have known of him for a year and we didn’t really get to talking till July. Well on our first date he took me to get lunch and then we ended up having sex at his place. For me, I wasn’t expecting it at all and it was kind of under the influence so I wasn’t going to beat myself up too much about it. Next thing you know it’s not until after that he tells me he doesn’t know what his intentions are and that he doesn’t want to lead me on too much (first red flag: why would you tell someone this AFTER having sex?)

Then his energy completely switches and doesn’t really put much effort into talking or seeing me but tbh I didn’t really care much. We hooked up twice after and the third time something happened that made me uncomfortable and sort of called it off (involves blood) I did like him and talking to him and we had chemistry so over time I did care a little 

Well, my best friend told me this past weekend that her bf told her that the guy was taking Viagra EVERYTIME before we linked “just in case”, when I explicitly remember being on Facetime with him and him going “Yeah i wasn’t expecting that at all!!!” And she doesn’t want me to tell him that I know he was taking the pills but tbh it pisses me off because I didn’t have the intentions of JUST having sex. Now we barely talk at all and I went off on him (didn’t tell him that I know about his pills) when I was drunk over text and yeah :) Am I tripping for no reason?

We spoke on call once during this period. We would talk about anything and everything under the sun and while I had developed feelings for him, I never made that known to him because he had moved cities just around the time we matched. 

There used to be times where we would go by without texting for a couple of weeks but then we would fall right into the loop once one of us initiated again. 

Cut short to August '21, I went back on a dating app because I got frustrated with this not amounting to anything. Met a guy, agreed on going on a date but the same day, my guy, texted again and I told him about how I have a date in a couple of hours but I like him and I don't want to pull through with this date. He confessed that he liked me back and asked me out on a virtual date. 

That virtual date still hasn't taken place to date, he stood me up once (which was justifiable, not getting into it). For the first two weeks after this confession, it was going too well but then he stopped calling back and started being a bit aloof. I suffer from anxiety and before he could call it off, I did it myself. But I couldn't bear the fact that I gave up this quickly after more than a year of waiting and I told him that and we both decided to give it a shot again. But since then, things haven't been going too well, he still stays aloof and keeps telling me that he's going to call/video call/text but he never does. I have told him time and again that if he's not willing to try then he should just me know that but he keeps saying he is interested, while I think he's not. My friend, who lives in the same city as him, also found him active on a dating app. I want to know what's going on and end it but I don't know if I should ask him for closure because at this point I'm finding myself to be desperate, trying too hard and looking like a massive fool.
