Values matter and manifest in behavior. So, going beyond the fantasy shopping list so often demanded by personals, only a few behaviors seem to matter: Healthy, happy,  optimistic, and openly honest.

If you are, like me, healthy, happy, optimistic, and openly honest, I would very much enjoy a leisurely coffee with you.

 ""should I reach out""?  

""that's really rude""

""now I'm annoyed, maybe I don't want to meet them""

There is a backstory to this that may sway your opinion.

Before my last military deployment I knew where I was going and what I was going to be doing was going to be extremely dangerous.  I didn't want to have my wedding ring taken as a war trophy if I got blown to bits or caught a serious case of ""the deads.""

At the end of the second, I was honestly hoping for a romantic encounter and instead she just gave me a peck on the cheek and wished me good night. I was disappointed but figured that was rejection, and had resigned myself that it was going to be difficult for me to find what I was looking for and that having an initial dating experience was good for me.

She messaged me back in a few days asking me to go on a third date. I was confused about this. I wouldn't expect someone who was looking for casual sex partners to spend too much time having multiple dates before having sex. I questioned her if she was actually attracted to me or not. What followed is the strangest/disturbing interaction I have ever had, however my experiences in dating were from 27 years prior. 

She texted that she was attracted to me, but she wasn't the type of girl to jump into bed with someone before 5 dates. I responded that it sounds like she was looking for more of a serious relationship, and not something casual that we had communicated about. She came back that people just say casual but they really want a real relationship, and that I was boyfriend/husband material and not hookup material. I felt like I had been honest but she had misrepresented what she was actually looking for. I politely said that we were looking for different things and wished her well going forward.

She didn't take that well. She then proceeded to send me angry insulting texts. Almost every 5 minutes. For the next 24 hours. Until I finally blocked her number and blocked her on all my OLD profiles. I didn't block her immediately as I was almost fascinated by how she didn't stop, and I kinda wanted to see how long it would go. I wasn't responding, just reading everything. This can't be normal, right?

My late husband always said he'd do me the courtesy to die and leave me young enough to date again. (There was *a bit* of an age gap.). Well I suppose he was right...

Anyhow. I'm told a lot of people see being a widow/widower as a deal breaker, and I'm wondering why.

Sure, I loved my husband. But things weren't that good that I'd be looking for a stand in. Nor were they bad, so don't expect me to never talk about him again. Heck, we had some riotously funny discussions about his dating life from way before we even met, so previous partners are probably something that would come up in conversationeventually...

Let's face it, at (nearly) 40 there is bound to have been a life before meeting a new partner. Why not share the good bits?

So, when I eventually get into dating, I plan to maybe not advertise but certainly not hide the fact that I'm a widow. If people can't handle it, then I suppose better to know upfront...

On the other hand, maybe the 100lb dog is more of an issue :-p

We went out and I left town a few days later for a planned trip. The whole time I was gone, we were texting and he said he couldn't wait for me to get home so we could get together again. I felt the same way, so I rolled with it. Three dates in the next week after I get back, and on date #4 we end up back at his place. Great sex! Yay! The NEXT day, he's weird - not responding to texts like before, etc. Now, I know he has a very hectic job so I don't think anything about it at first. It has now been a week, and it's more of the same. After one great night together. I can't figure this guy out. I'm not looking for anything serious, but our dates were fun and easy and I just really enjoyed spending time with him. Now I have no idea where I stand, and we have barely talked since.

Met a man age 50 on a dating app. Seemed like a normal dad with older children. Older than me! Yay! We had one date. He came across totally normal. We had been texting all normal like before the date. I was excited because Hell Yes! Normal!!

Found out that he has been sending cash, lingerie and gifts to women in their early 20’s he has met on the internet. Same age as his oldest daughter. I discovered this as he sent me screenshots of his texting with them. Which also mentioned how he had more dates than he could handle and also how fun it was getting physical with said dates. Um- Hello?? Why on God’s green earth would he send this to me? To brag about paying off random chick’s credit cards and buying flooring for them? You commissioned erotic artists to sketch them? I get it! You have a good job!

He sent me a screenshot that had my photo and told his sugar baby I was double her age. I get it! You think you pull in young chicks!

Also found out he has his very own Onlyfans page. Mmmmmmm- ok Sex Freaky. I get it! You lost weight and now random peeps pay to sneak a peek at your package. Most dudes just post a shirtless bathroom selfie of their brand new post divorce chest on Bumble. 

Oh wait. He is not divorced yet. Going through said divorce. I get it! You can’t find a good therapist and now I get to hear all about it. Every Day. And I mean All About It. I believe you btw- I don’t need screenshots from the lawyers. 

*For the love of all things holy* - it hasn’t been even a week since our first date on Saturday. It’s been 3 days y’all. It’s like he said let’s make day 3 all sorts of Magic and I will just sh!t on this woman all my private business.

This was already after previously asking me if I was talking to or dating any other women (which I wasn't).  I don't know my number but was on the modest side and said 5.  

The convo then turns to ""what we are"", meaning casual, exclusive, etc.  My goal is LTR and I like this woman, so I said I wish to be exclusive.  She then confesses she has a date the next night with a diff man and felt a stronger connection to him because they've spoke on the phone more than us.  I spent the next 3 mins telling her we aren't exclusive yet so I understood but I thought we had a good connection and would obviously prefer her to not go and was willing to establish exclusivity that night.

We parted ways and she called me an hour later saying I didn't seem right and claimed she told me she did not have a stronger connection with this other guy but with me and that she must've been nervous and misspoke or I didn't hear her correctly.  I am 100% sure she said the other guy as I wouldn't have spent the following 3 mins saying what I did and I think she would've caught this.  

The next night she was totally silent and only replied to me later in the evening (9pm) after saying she took her kids to volleyball and didn't reply earlier because they don't allow phones in the gym.

This seems odd to me.  If she already planned on taking her kids to the volleyball, how would she have been seeing the other man?  Do they really disallow phones in a gym?  This seems like she was seeing the other guy and didn't reply until the date was over.

My questions are simple.  First, does she sound believable?  Second, if not, should I care since we aren't exclusive yet?  I guess my issue is the potential lies after being asked if I was chatting with or seeing other women.  Seems like she was ensuring I was focusing on her when she wasn't focusing on me.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,47112,public,self,,,Seek input on date 3 convo,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n5f06c/seek_input_on_date_3_convo/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,

1. We met on that trash site Badoo back in Jan or Feb
2. He gave me a fake name called Alex
3. By our 2nd date he moved to a new place as ""single"" guy to a 2 bedroom  flat, which should have been a red flag and him hiding his phone when I was around
4. He never said he was married oland denied having had kids, and that he got divorced 6 years back
5. He coerced me into getting physical with him which I regret wholeheartedly!
Anyway I never had much with him and emotionally I dont feel nothing for him, I could only sweetly apologise to his wife and tell her everything that had gone on and we had a good talk by phone and text too, and now she is the one left in pieces with this nightmare, she said he is unintelligent and just after sex and with her even she doesn't want nothing with him.

There are way tooo many men in London not 80% up front honest and truthful and just on the sly to get their d*cks satisfied.

This has now left me with guilt and I'm so naive as I was lonely at the time.

I have just started seeing another man recently we met on FB who is so lovely, But he had to travel home last week for 3 weeks to see his little daughter and spend time with her; now I'm thinking if his identity is 100% and can I trust him now but I know we are just relatively new together so I'm trying not to be that mad possessive hysterical woman as I wish him happiness and fun on his trip and I'm not his wife and just a recent girlfriend, so who am I to start accusing just because of something someone else has done  in my past that doesn't directly affect me now.

I'm just left with some many horrible experiences its leaving me vulnerable and fearful now and it's why I'm having commitment issues and just jumping on to OLD when I feel fearful is not how I want to be anymore with seeing one person after another,  but for my very new guy I'm trying to be honest, i have deleted my dating apps and im just prayingg that I can be in a normal situation and we be happy as normal when he is back home here again.

My previous experience with OLD was twenty some years ago when I met the woman I am now divorcing. We're still friends and the divorce is amicable so I would consider my OLD experience pretty positive overall. 

So I created my profile and got some likes almost immediately. That resulted in one date which was fun but isn't going to lead to anything.  Now the likes have mostly dried up. Not sure if that is because all the potentially interested women have liked me already and I didn't reciprocate or because I rewrote my profile and it is not as appealing. 

In any case, I find I am in a position where I need to be more proactive and I am struggling with that. I've liked a few women but really have no idea how to break the ice with a message. It seems that the women I am physically attracted to have relatively basic profiles so there is no obvious topic to mention other than their appearance or proximity, both of which feel like they would be creepy.  So my question is, if there is only physical attraction to go by,  what sort of message would be appropriate to break the ice to find out if there is a deeper connection? 

Because that probably makes me sound shallow, I should clarify that I am pretty nerdy but also really into physical fitness. I'm not looking for a model, just someone who takes care of themselves and ideally has some nerdy tendencies as well. The two seem to be mutually exclusive, aside from the one woman with whom I had my only date.

You have to read it to see how stupid I was. Thank you to those who gave me some excellent advice. 

Turns out my gut and intuition don't usually fail. Found out 3 weeks ago - after 6 months - that he was playing games with me and multiple women at the same time for the entirety of our time together. He had at least 3 women thinking they were also in a ""relationship"" with him - one is even married, he was cheating both emotionally and physically. I am hurt, in disbelief that a man can be this evil, and a little mad and disgusted at myself for being played, believing all his lies, and ignoring red flags. 

He broke down and cried when I found out and broke up with him. Told me he loved me but he's broken and lost his way, to give him time to go to therapy and find out why he's like that. How do cheaters have so much time and energy? He stilled called me every day and night, saw me almost every weekend, told me how he wants to build a future with me, and planned future vacations and trips together.  I don't know if I was with a narcissist, sociopath, BPD, or just a serial cheater. Everything was a lie!

Anyway, I've learned many lessons and I'm taking the time to heal myself and check the boundaries I have in place to be more discerning and aware in the future. I aim to be gracious in all I do, so I forgave him for the deception, genuinely wished him the best of luck, and went NC.

She explained that it was nothing I had done, and I re-explained the reasons why I had delayed introducing her to my daughter (scared of getting hurt again after my divorce 2 years ago).  Due to us both having kids it created a period of 9 days where we were unable to see each other in person because we hadn't introduced each other to our kids yet.

We had a good talk but I still didn't understand why she wanted to finish it other than her saying she didn't feel it like I did.  I told her that I didn't expect her to say she loved me back and this isn't a reason to end the relationship.

We then kissed, cuddled for about 30 minutes and were very close to having sex.  She said maybe she needs more time and then we both stated that we are just coming into the 9 day period where we don't see each other and her feelings start to drop.  We carried on kissing and hugging.

After talking some more I asked her to tell me that she doesn't want me in her life and she couldn't.  After talking more I just asked her to tell me that this isn't what she wants and she just replied with 'Sorry'.

After that we said our goodbyes for what I assume is the last time.  I'm so confused!!! Is she confused???

I took a lot of the advice on here that said I should be the one to initiate anything or to push things forward/put myself out there.

I told him that I would like to work on building a solid friendship and possibly down the line if it feels right, to maybe try dating again. We talked about it a decent amount but to sum up what he said: 
he definitely wants to see me in person and while he still has strong feelings for me, he doesn’t know if he thinks we should date in the future. He also that he would not say that it’s a 100% no, just that right now he doesn’t know. He would also like to build a friendship and “take things one day at a time”.

He also said in therapy he is learning to not answer questions he doesn’t have the answers to, and I really respect that. 

I guess the advice I’m asking for is, does it sound like if I am patient and can earn back his trust in us, do I stand a chance at getting back together?

I chose Bumble b/c I thought it was a little more woman-centric but I guess not.

At one point she also said she was developing feelings, and also that she really liked me.  But she's very guarded.

I've been feeling really down and sad about her saying she isn't ready for a relationship (despite saying she really likes me and apparently had feelings for me), and also now that she seems to have ghosted me.

She had added me on Facebook not too long ago, and she is still listed as a Facebook friend - so I'm not sure what that means as far as a friendship with her.  Might there be any reason to believe she would still want to communicate with me in the future?

A few hours ago, i just felt this pressure on my heart. I sit down and start to cry. It went for a while, and then came back, and came back. Felt more naked and naked for every tear and every small sense of trembling. Like my soul was an onion skin.

There was a sense of void, of something to miss, anguish, almost like i´m just a prisoner of time, like the past and the future are connected by emotional inertia. 

There was a sad and miserable simmetry between the fear of fall in love and possible abandonment. Standing still and being stuck in a cage of fear and regret. Not letting my heart go into being in love with someone special, when that´s what i want the most.

But there´s also other things:

I am afraid that i*´m not going to be enough*, with all these dating checklists.

I´m not an alpha. I just know in my heart that i´m just a normal guy. I´ve been always insecure. Studied Psychology, did Sports but prefer books, like to cook, things like that. It doesn´t help that i´m 6´3 and i´m black. There´s a set of expectations that i don´t fit.

And makes me afraid. I am afraid that my *openess with emotions and feelings* can be perceived as *weakness or vulnerability* for a women in their 40s.

He has his kids half the time. It’s been three dates, and we’ve really hit it off!

He makes reservations ahead of time and secures the date, texts throughout the day every day, and treats me with care and respect.

He recently had to cancel our next date because of a change in childcare (expected).

I’m used to more time when dating than once a week, and if it stays that way until we are more serious, I’m currently deciding if I am interested in that.

In the meantime, I’m also curious; If he’s only seeing me once a week, even though it’s all that’s available (hypothetically) until I can be more in kids life, what has your experience been? Do you lose interest more easily? If you can’t do more day/weekend dates with more than dinner/sleepover, does it get boring? I’m wondering how things can progress to that more serious point if dates are less frequent and have less variety than I’m used to.

I appreciate your perspective!

It was sudden and unexpected, I never saw it coming. So I find myself having to explore the minefield of online dating again.

Thinking over my last relationship, I'm sure I did make some mistakes. However, in ""advertising"" myself online I find myself in a quandary as I don't know if I should ever mention  the fact that I have BPD and fibromyalgia.

I'm not the greatest looking guy and certainly not rolling around in cash from a good career. But I genuinely believe that I have excellent qualities. I'm strictly monogamous, I'm witty, people find me personable in general.

But, I'm anxious that the fact that I have mental health issues and the fact that I am opposed to children really limits my options. Im not sure if wading in the dating pool is a good idea for me.
