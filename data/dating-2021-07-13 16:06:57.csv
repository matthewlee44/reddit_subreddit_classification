0,ojp3jo,1626210698,Does he see me as a second option?,"I dated someone for several months during lockdown that I met on an app and I was hopeful that it would lead to a relationship, I was honest about my intentions from the jump only for him to tell me that he doesn't think he's ready for a relationship anymore and that he has time to date but not be in a relationship.He then hit me with the classic line that he was never locked in with the intention of finding a relationship, he just wanted to see where things go with me. He said since things are opening in our country that he wouldn't know what social life would look like for him so he doesn't want a relationship anymore. He said he doesn't know when he'll be ready for one either. This all shocked me, because we spoke about what we're looking for for several months, we went on various dates, and we spoke daily. He told me many times he wanted a relationship. I told him I'm looking for more commitment and maybe we can remain friends and he said he was disappointed but understood (yet he wasted my time!). 

We have maintained sporadic contact since then (April), and on Sunday I reached out to him platonically and asked if he wanted to meet at a park sometime soon as friends. He informed me that he had been dating someone for 2 months, so he doesn't think we should meet right now because it would complicate things, and that he's not ""ready"" to see me again even as friends despite the fact that he's flirted with me multiple times since we decided to remain friends. I told him I won't reach out anymore because I don't want to intrude anything, and he told me I'm not intruding anything and to reach out anytime I want and that he'll reach out. After that, I didn't reply and unfollowed him on instagram and deleted his number.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojp3jo/does_he_see_me_as_a_second_option/

2,ojp7gl,1626211011,Do I Have A Chance Or Am I Overthinking It?,"Ok so I met this girl at my job earlier. I work at a pretty laid back minimum wage fastfood joint, just to give some important details. I was working with said girl and someone was training me on how to take orders and I made a silly mistake and they thought it was pretty funny. When I made eye contact with the girl she was on the ground picking something up and her face mask was off. She smiled at me and it was one of those teeth displaying smiles. 

Later that day she randomly just sat on the ground and said something about being tired. I wasn't paying too much attention but then she said she needed my help. She wanted me to take her hand and help her get up. She wasn't injured or anything and could have easily gotten up on her own. I took her hand and she kind of stayed on the ground..Kind of like she wanted to make it harder for me to get her up off the ground. This led to me holding her hand a bit longer than usual. 

Another time she was walking past me and she kind of rubbed her hands against me as I was walking by. Then a couple of time when we made eye contact she held her gaze and continued to look me in the eyes.  I am talking longer than a few seconds and I looked down everytime. 

I am sorry if I sound stupid guys but I was hoping these were cues. Girls have flirted with me and asked me out a lot before and told me they liked me. Fortunately receiving attention from girls has been something I encountered since Middle School. I havent dated in a while and I am currently tracking on a self improvement journey( Get in better shape, take care if mental health..etc) Sorry if this kind if dumb or annoying...I guess I just want some other opinions.

4,ojpbae,1626211325,Ladies of reddit - Please help me edit my profile. I think this constitutes dating advice.,"This sub is for dating advice, yes?  I'm creating a profile on a popular dating site but I want someone to proof read it and give me some feedback.  I literally have no females I know that I would trust to ask, so why not ask reddit anonymously?  I hope this won't be deleted.  It might because it will likely get flagged as self promotion.  Or that I'm attempting to get dates.  Well, I'm really not.  Not here anyway.  Some might also see it in bad taste, but whatever, I want some feedback, please.   Here goes:   

&gt; Hey, thanks for visiting my profile.  Let me show you around …   
&gt;  
&gt; Ah, here we have my “about me” section:  I have a great sense of humor.  I’ve been told I should be a stand up comedian.  I’m fairly educated.  Intelligent.  A generous lover.  Athletic.  Romantic.  Goofy.  Caring. Honest.  Affectionate.  Hard working.  Creative.  Loyal.  And several other adjectives that are mainly positive.  I enjoy playing sports (volleyball, tennis), kayaking, biking (both mountain and non-mountain types), skiing (on both forms of water), hiking, walking my dogs, photography, motorcycling, and auto racing.  
&gt;   
&gt; If you glance this way, you’ll find my “what I’m looking for in a woman” section:  You like men -- that seems pertinent.  Intelligent with a broad sense of humor (eg:  you found the previous joke funny).  Very affectionate.  Relatively fit.  Honest. Kind.  You love kids and animals.  You’re outgoing but enjoy the occasional lazy day on the couch.  Enjoy cooking together.  You’re very caring, and also possess several other positive traits that I’m unable to think of at this precise moment.  You like physical activities (both sexual and non-sexual).  
&gt;   
&gt; I call this section my “current situation”:  I’m a professional software engineer.  I have two children, ages 14 and 9, that I share 50-50 custody with my ex, swapping every other week.  I also love animals and currently have two dogs.  I’m a semi-responsible homeowner (look, I’ll get to it eventually, I swear).   
&gt;  
&gt; So that’s it.  I hope you enjoyed the tour.  If you feel this is something you enjoyed, please feel free to submit a “Like” to me and I’ll do my best to get back to you asap.

I think she has lots of great qualities, shes very tidy, she dresses well, we have some common interests, but there are a few things I am unsure are a big deal or not. 

For one, she isn't a very social person and keeps to herself a lot, she has a few friends but they are all out of country. 

The second part is it doesn't feel like there is a whole lot of chemistry there, I feel like I am having a lot of friend-like conversations. We've made out once which was nice but there is still lack luster flirting in person.

And lastly, I am beginning to feel like I am not even ready for a relationship. I haven't been particularly happy on my own for a while. These are things I am working on but I don't want to derail any of it.

It's only been a week and a half and I feel like she is set on me for now but my anxiety level is definitely up. I like her and I see some positives she could bring into my life, shes inspired me to work on few life things I have let go. A part of it is me already being unhappy and the other part are some things missing for me.

I ""dated"" a guy (27M) for nearly a year. We texted every single day and had a really good bond. We got along well, were compatible in multiple ways, and we both agreed that we would take things slow since we both had gotten out of relationships a few months prior, but were building up to something official once things with the universe calmed down (aka when we could comfortably go out without the fear of catching a potentiallydeadly virus).

 We met up at restaurants when possible or did some sort of other socially distanced activity. We went on day trips together to the beach and the mountains. We also talked on the phone every couple of weeks or so or played games online. I would bring up the topic of DTR and he insisted it would happen once the pandemic was at least over-ish. 

During this time, he claimed his roommate did NOT want people over. Not as suspicious because again, pandemic. But once their weekly game nights were back in person, guess who still claimed his roommate didn't like random people over?

Basically lines were blurred and I think the excuses he gave for me not meeting his friends seemed a lot more valid because we were in a padenmic. I brought the topic up again of DTR, and he said ""what does official even mean anymore"" and claimed that maybe in the future and more time, this would become something. 

Well by that time I saw red and told him if he wanted a friends with benefits situation then he should have said so from the beginning. He claims he never thought it was and didn't know how to describe this. I told him bluntly that if he didn't know by now if he thought I was worth it to have me in his life, then it was over and to not reach out unless he wanted something beyond a convenient way to pass time. As others have said before me, it's tempting to want him back in my life, but realistically, I'm just anticipating the more likely scenario of him just never responding again. 

When we were together he DID make me happy and comfortable. But I know that ultimately doesn't mean shit in regards to long-term potential. What are some things I should strongly consider or look put for if he claims he does want a relationship with me after some time?

I am recently single  and am trying to stay away from dating apps if I can.  Before now I mostly met women through friends or activities, however coming out of Covid most of my friends have settled down and are having kids (I am 34).  This leaves me kind of on an island trying to find a partner. 

I have volunteered to work at the animal shelter (this interests me anyways as I love dogs).   My other interests volunteering would probably be habitat for humanity and food bank.

17,ojqeb8,1626214619,I think dating is just not for me,"It's the weirdest thing. I'm very rarely interested in people dating wise. Most women do nothing for me romantically and when I'm on dating apps I swipe left on objectively hot women because I can just see that they're not my type. But I'm not even sure what my type is

I know I can feel romantic attraction. I've felt it before. And I know I can be interested in women from the start. But it's just so rare

To add to that, that's just the first step. I have to be interested and attracted, but they have to be interested and attracted too, and we have to live close to each other, and we have to align on the fact that I don't want kids, ever, and we have to be compatible and a good match. It feels like the odds of all this happening are incredibly minimal

Even when I'm close, something always happens. I met a very cute girl recently. On a dating app, nonetheless. Only the 3rd woman I've considered a dating prospect this year (the first 2 I asked out, one said no, the other wasn't interested but didn't have the guts to just say no and wasted both of our time). She asked me on a date. Then 3 days later tells me she's talking with her ex again and we haven't talked since.

18,ojqnwu,1626215444,Am I being over cautious? Should I set high standards or go with the flow,"So I’m a 23F and this guy is a 30M, who is very youthful may I add. We’re from a bigger city but are currently both in nursing school in a small town.

So the story is, we see each other all the time on campus but never got the chance to speak to one another, we always just made eye contact. He also tutored me via zoom once but we didn’t talk personally it was all about school. But recently, we ran into each other on campus and got to actually talk face to face.

We had a casual conversation for a good while which led to him asking if I liked this cultural food dish (were of the same cultural background) I said yes and he asked if he could get my number because he cooks it on the weekend and I could come by his place to have some with him.

The problem is I usually prefer a guy to ask me out someone where other than his place for a first meet up. I don’t want to be overly cautious about this though because my instinct doesn’t tell me that he’s being sly but I wanted to get some advice just to be sure. I’m not looking to hook up and want to be taken seriously by men, but I don’t want to come off forceful when he could just be trying to get to know me better? Does it seem like he just want to be causal with me? I wish he would’ve asked to go to lunch with me. The gesture seems sweet but I don’t know

TLDR; me and a guy have been crushing on each other from a distance. We finally talk to one another and he asks if I want to come over so he could cook for me and takes my number. I’m not sure if I should accept this because I would rather be taken out to the park, restaurant, etc. Is he trying to set something up to be casual? Wouldn’t a guy rather take a girl out on a date?

19,ojqsls,1626215845,"Men, don’t ever be insecure or judgemental about your girlfriend's past.","There are three simple but quick and easy fixes to this problem.

Fix 1. Dump her and find a girl you would be comfortable dating or marrying so you're not wasting each other's time.

Fix 2. Sleep with as many woman as you can so you can feel you're on the same level and don’t develop FOMO

Fix 3. Keep dating her while becoming more insecure and jealous while you worry that she will cheat on you at some point


I HIGHLY recommend option 1.  It saves everyone time and allows both parties to move on to someone more compatible.  I’m also speaking from personal experience as I’ve done the same.  I just wanted to provide more options because I’m aware everyone is different and I wanted to provide different options.  Anyways, I hope this helped in the slightest or any way.

I've made people realize they're no longer attracted to men. I've made people realize that they thought they were ready for a relationship but they actually aren't.

I'm not the type of person that throws around the word love easily. I say it to my parents and my grandparents, but I wouldn't say it to a friend or anyone like that. I'm just noticing lately that there's this small awkward pause when we have to say goodbye now like we're both deciding on what to say. I have to mentally make sure I'm not just casually saying ""I love you"" because it does feel like it might come out naturally.
I don't know, but maybe he's also feeling like we should be saying it now because I feel a little awkwardness from him at our goodbyes now too.


I don't want to just say it because it's ""time"" to say it though. I want to make sure I actually love him before I say those words. How do you know you actually love someone though? When do you know you're ready to say it to your significant other?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojrznu/saying_i_love_you_to_him_how_do_i_go_about_it_how/
34,ojs0bv,1626219776,"Should it always be ""effortless"" with the right person?","(30M) My relationship just ended with a girl I've been seeing for a few months. Things seemed promising. We had a lot of great dates, and there was a connection there, but occasionally some of our dates would start with a sort of tension. We always broke through the tension, though, and the dates would end well.

When we had our conversation about calling it off, this ""tension"" issue came up as the main reason we weren't progressing. We both couldn't put our finger on where it was coming from.

If you are with the right person, should every interaction feel effortless? 

Also, how do you go about analyzing this type of situation to figure out if it's purely an issue of incompatibility or more to do with a personal flaw of your own that, if improved, would have made the difference?

A bit heartbroken but trying to learn from the experience.

36,ojs8g3,1626220539,Ended a situationship and regret it,"I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2 months. We met on Hinge, but he liked me before I moved about a 5 hour drive away. When we matched, we decided to do a FaceTime date anyway and really hit it off, and continued to FaceTime for hours multiple times per week. We’ve shared a lot with each other and gotten really close.

I started to have some doubts that he was maybe a little phony, but it’s really hard to tell over FT. He also reminds me of an ex of mine and I worry that maybe I’m just projecting. My best friend joined a FT with us to say hi and said the same thing upon first impression. I’m still trying to feel that out.

I frequent the city he lives in even though I moved, and I also don’t feel like driving is such a big deal, especially given the time we have dedicated to talking and how I thought we both were feeling, but he’s been really dodgy about meeting up. The first time, he was busy moving and “adjusting” to post covid responsibilities with work and extra curriculars. I told him I felt very weird about him making it so difficult, but we ended up talking it out. Basically, he was hesitant to initiate a long distance relationship.

I took a 2 week vacation and was flying back into his city to meet some friends, so he suggested we meet up. I tried texting him a few times while I was on vacation to give him updates, and he seemed a bit like he was withdrawing. I have an anxious attachment style, so this kind of made me spiral. We’ve discussed extensively being open and honest if anything changes, and I could tell he wasn’t being honest. I tried to confirm our meeting, and he said “after giving it some thought, I don’t think it’s the best idea for us to meet this weekend. It’s not the right time” and made a bunch of excuses for his lack of communication, like that he’s trying to focus on “being present in the lives of the people around him”.

This made me really upset and again given the time we’ve offered to each other, I don’t really understand the issue with meeting up. Catfish is out of the question - we’ve done full body FTs and he frequently posts on Instagram so I know he looks exactly how I think he does. 

In my dating history, I’ve had many long drawn out situationship “breakups” when someone’s feelings changed and I just had a feeling that was coming on, so my knee jerk reaction was to break it off.

My insecurity and anxious attachment style is what brought this on. After the first time when he was weird about making the effort to meet up, I was anxious he would bail, so I asked if he still wanted to. When he started withdrawing communication and not engaging when I reached out for support, my anxious attachment style kicked in. I felt like we have a well established friendship at this point and his behavior was a complete 180.

I think it’s too late to convince him to still meet up this week, but I regret cutting it off completely without communicating what was bothering me and opening up about some other factors in my life that were causing that. We’ve both communicated how much we care about each other, so it really hurt my feelings when he started withdrawing communication and affection. Even as just a friendship, I think this is a relationship I really wanted to foster and continue, but I’m really hurt by his change in communication style and BS excuses about that. 

If I was the one to say I don’t think we should continue talking, is there any way to resolve this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojs8g3/ended_a_situationship_and_regret_it/

We don’t call or video chat, just message. I have an iPhone so it tells me how much time I spend on the app daily, weekly, etc. And lately it’s only been less than 20 minutes a day. I feel like this isn’t enough communication for a relationship to work out. I want more time with him. He works full time and has his kid over sometimes, but even on his days off he will not respond to messages for 12+ hours at a time.

I mentioned to him that I’m feeling neglected and would like more attention from him, but it’s like he doesn’t care and just tells me he’s emotionally drained. I’m not trying to make his life more difficult by just asking for attention, but I feel I deserve at least a bit of undivided attention..

Am I asking too much? Should I just drop it and accept my measly 20 random minutes a day of communication? (Never consecutive, this is 20 minutes total over the course of a day, a message here and a message there)

I was born and raised in a large American city; my parents are immigrants and while I'm still proud of and connected to my ethnicity, it's no surprise that I feel American more than anything. Being Asian, specifically being an Asian woman with stereotypical Asian features (im small/short, thin, dark hair, dark almond shaped eyes) has definitely affected the way some men perceive me.

I've had my fair share of uncomfortable comments from men, but the ones regarding my race weird me out the most, regardless of whether they were meant to be harmful or they were innocent. I don't think there is anything wrong with racial or physical preferences, I can't control what I'm attracted to and don't expect anyone else to. But whenever I hear a guy tell me he likes Asian girls, there's always a part of me that wonders if its purely because of the way they look (which is fine) or if it's because the stereotypes revolving Asian women (think that one scene in Full Metal Jacket lol)

I don't think my race has hindered my love life at all and I've never had trouble with men in general, the purpose of this post isn't to complain or feel sorry for myself because I don't. I want to hear your honest thoughts about how you view Asian women; if you're attracted to them, why? is it purely because you like their features or is it because you, on some level, whether its conscious or not, see them as what they are stereotyped as?

But here’s the problem, she is a friend of my ex girlfriend. I know what people will say… “it doesn’t matter, you shouldn’t let that keep you back.” Well they’re in the same sorority and my ex is the president. My ex recently followed me on Reddit on my main account and I saw posts of her accusing me of sexual assault (which I know isn’t true). The last thing I would want is to ask this girl out, only for her to be told I’m some objectifying pervert and have my chances ruined. One part of me is like, fuck it it’s just one girl and another part doesnt want to reach out because I don’t want to be looked at as if I’m a piece of shit, because I know I’m not.

I try not to be annoying or anything like that but I’m starting to lose faith in our relationship and in her.
I just feel like I’m just the only one in this relationship, and like she’s not interested in me at all even though she says she is.

64,ojuk90,1626228647,My girlfriend vanished from the face of the Earth,"This one is quite complex. At least I think so. She has Schizophrenia and I realize I haven't really discussed with her exactly what happens when she becomes totally unavailable. I asked to meet her this weekend. She told me she wanted to but that she was maybe going on a cabin trip with her family.  


We left it at that and I went to her city on Friday after she left me on read the day before. Nothing unusual there. She sucks at texting so while I didn't really expect to hear from her, I sent her a message on Saturday just to make sure she wasn't in town.  


I went out with a friend of mine on Saturday and she told me the girl I was seeing seemed cute (they met two weeks ago). It was a nice night out and I really appreciated that a real person could give me some emotional support and encouraging words like that I should\`t sit around and wait for her too much.  


Then Sunday came around and she haven't read my message yet. She seems to be offline in all social media. She doesn't use social media that much but this time she is just gone.  


By 3 days I started to get a little worried as to what is going on. She disappears sometimes when she is with family because it stresses her out and she dont have the energy to be on her phone. Or she may be having an episode.  


There is also the possibility that she is actually ghosting me but I find it odd that she would do it now of all times after knowing me for 4 years.  


Its been 5 days now. Either she has lost her phone or having an episode. Or she is too anxious to reach out. If and hopefully when she returns from the dead I have to have a really serious talk with her about this.   


She cant just leave me in the dark like this.

I would consider myself a fairly attractive individual. However, before junior year of college, I had extremely low confidence and I was too scared to put myself out there. I also didn't take care of myself and didn't look good as I do now. I used to get bullied from k-12 for being ugly

Starting junior year of college, I started having drunk hookups, but never dating. Senior year, I gained a lot weight due to personal problems and lost confidence. I started grad school right after I finished undergrad, lost all the weight, and became more confident. 

In grad school, I started talking to someone I knew from undergrad who I had a crush on, but then the pandemic happened and we became friends instead. I then finished grad school in late 2020.

Now that the pandemic is somewhat calming down, I'm deciding to put myself out there on dating apps. I matched with someone I found really attractive, but I can't help but be terrified. Every time I text him, I get scared and mute the entire tinder app before I work up the courage to text him again 💀

If I'm this terrified on Tinder, I can only imagine what I'd be like on a date. How do y'all work through these anxieties? What do you even talk about on Tinder? How do you flirt?

I'm 30/m and I feel like I've exhausted every option for meeting women people in person (night life, campus clubs, social media/meetup events, generally meeting people when out and about, meeting people through friends &amp; family, dating apps \[lol\], all of these across 5 states over the past decade)

Despite all of my attempts to keep things in the ""get-to-know-you"" &amp; slow intro stages of courtship it always becomes intimate within the first 1-5 dates even when I attempt to set expectations and be upfront with my intentions. 

Not against intercourse or affection at all, I just feel like the dating scene has been on fast forward for years. I've lived in big cities like DC, NYC, Orlando over the years so it could just be the culture associated with metropolitan areas that I've been experiencing.

This probably comes off as horribly naive and judgmental towards men, and I don’t mean it that way. I am well aware that men are just as capable of love as women are. I’ve never doubted the motives of guys in relationships with other girls.

89,ojwya0,1626237517,How long should I wait before pursuing another relationship?,"
Hello all! I recently got out of a year-long relationship [17F and 18M]. Towards the end he really just didn’t seem to care about me much anymore, and I experienced so much emotional turmoil staying in the relationship. I called it off about three weeks ago, and it was very difficult for me for the first week or so, because it happened right as I was moving out on my own. However, once I got accommodated in my new space and saw my friends more often, I felt much, much better, very quickly. Quite honestly I think I got most of my tears out during the relationship, and didn’t have very many left once it was over. He was my first love, and will always be special to me, but I don’t miss being with him anymore. 

With that being said: I recently went out to dinner with two friends, one of which I had only known through social media. After dinner we all went to my apartment as the weather got bad. We really hit it off, he (from social media) and I, and my other friend ended up leaving early, so we got to spend the evening getting to know each other better. It was almost electric. He was interesting, fun, and extremely respectful. We ended up hanging out several more times, and we really do “click” in a special way. We are both musicians so we have connected through playing together, and we have both met the other’s parents, which went well. We have kissed, and told one another that the feelings are mutual, but have not rushed into putting a label on anything. I really, really like him, and I can definitely envision myself being with him in the future. We have had similar experiences with ex-lovers, and it was strangely comforting to open up to him, and to have him open up to me. 

So, my question is: Is it really so bad to just move on? I know it has not been long since my breakup, and I certainly don’t want to “rebound”, but it seems this incredible person has just fallen into my lap, with no effort on my end. The people around me are at odds about me staying single for longer versus not lingering and just moving on.

I thought about the reality of things when it comes to height. Tupac 5'9, Jason Statham 5'10, Da Baby 5'8, Bruno Mars 5'5, Nelly 5'8, The Weeknd 5'8, Kanye West 5'8 these are guys who still as of right now that have been or currently are very popular amongst the ladies

I added Tupac because even to this day, in death, he's still the man when it comes to the ladies, when he was alive he  was that guy, and even now he's still considered a fantasy for a ton of women.

I asked my friends just from these names if they were regular guys in their twenties today on dating apps, would they have the same success with women, they said yes, without the fame, money, status and popularity, I told them i don't think so, what do you guys think?

Because my argument is that success and status raises a man's value to women, let's take every woman dating apps that said 6ft and up, and if you're short don't swipe, and put them in a room with the weeknd, they would not have the same attitude.

I have a trauma I’ve worked through from my childhood and even from a few years ago. I also struggle with body dysmorphia. I’ve avoided dating and relationships because of my mental health, and how I look. I tried losing weight in the past and despite having success with it it did nothing for me mentally. I learned that I must work through my trauma and mental health first before fixing how I look. 

This aside I do wish to be in a safe, secure relationship with a partner that accepts all of me and never gets tired of me. I’ve struggled through a lot but I think it would be incredible and grounding to have a partner who cares about me, and for me to have someone to care about in a special way. 

My attachment style is Disorganized/ Fearful &amp; Avoidant, the rarest but I know it’s the most difficult to work with.

94,ojxp2h,1626240579,"Nice Guys, Bad Boys, and meaningless labels.","I always find it funny to hear Red Pill and Blue Pill types argue over what personality type is the key to unlocking women's affection and intimatacy.

""Just respect women, listen to their problems, buy gifts, etc"" or ""Treat em like crap, ignore them, insult them the love that dude"". 

In reality, and at least in my anecdotal experience. Personality (which for most people is easily interchangeable and adaptable when needed), is the probably the least important trait in dating, at least for long term.

Your personality (whether good or bad) means nothing if you don't provide intrisic value to your partner and the relationship. Whether that's value in terms of how physically attractive they find you, or your wealth and financial status. Those things are hard to change, personality is not, which is why it doesn't matter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojxp2h/nice_guys_bad_boys_and_meaningless_labels/
95,ojxspu,1626241017,Do you think couples who constantly post about their relationship aren't that happy together?,"Obviously I am not talking about people who post from time to time, like every few weeks or months. But to give you an example, there is this person that basically half the time I click on their story their partner is tagged in there. Sometimes it's even cringy as they post about how much they love each other and many emojis. And that erson posts lots of stories. They can have 3 stories in a row that day just about their relationship.

I personally think like 2 people who are happy together don't feel the need to constantly show everyone how much they love each other and how happy they are together. It's like they have something  to prove when they constantly post about it. And don't get me wrong, I have nothing against couple posts, it's just that it's cringy and weird when people post too much about it in my opinion.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojxspu/do_you_think_couples_who_constantly_post_about/
96,ojxt9c,1626241079,Asking a family friend out on a date?,"My family has known another family for 20+ years. I'm 23 and she's 21. I want to ask her out on a date, but since our families our so close, it just seems weird and awkward. I think she likes me, she really sort of does give hints, but maybe I'm just imagining it? And if she says no, it will be weird where I would even want to stop going over to them to avoid the awkwardness. 

Am I overthinking? This would be the first girl I date and I'm not really good at this...

97,ojy264,1626242185,"In the context of dating, when is the best time to mention that you have a uvula piercing?","Hey everyone,

My friend (38M) broke up with his girlfriend somewhat recently and is in the process of going into a bit of a daredevil phase. Most notably, he has plans to get a uvula piercing pretty soon (if you're not familiar, it's getting the flap of skin in your throat pierced).

He doesn't have the piercing yet, but he's wondering - when is the best time to bring it up during a date? Should it be brought up as soon as possible, in a very direct manner, or would it be more fun/playful to yawn and ""accidentally"" show it off?

In addition, would a uvula piercing in and of itself be a dealbreaker in the context of dating/relationships?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojy264/in_the_context_of_dating_when_is_the_best_time_to/

99,ojybjk,1626243325,Third date,"So, met this guy and already went on three dates in a span of 5 days. I would say the first two were great. We literally closed the restaurant down and the next turned into a 6-hour date. He then texted me to see a movie with him. After this third date, he didn't try anything. Not that I was expecting hanky panky, but at least a peck(?) He texts me to say good night and he had a good time. He also told me to call him to hang out in a couple of days. Is it possible that he's shy? I should say we're both 39 and he knows I'm separated with 2 kids. He is single. Am I being friend zoned?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojybjk/third_date/
