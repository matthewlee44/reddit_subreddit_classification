""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.""

I feel like that describes my dating life. I've been single for 2.5 years now and, while I have learned to be content with being single, I'm frustrated that I can't seem to get anyone to stick around for a long term relationship.

I get plenty of dates and don't have much trouble getting laid. Sometimes people will stick around for several dates (like a month or two) and I've ended up in a few FWB situations. But anytime I try to move things towards a relationship, women dip out. I just can't figure out why that keeps happening or what I'm doing wrong.

I'm a 32M and, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think I'm a pretty good catch.

* I have a great career and making pretty decent money.
* I've done some kind of impressive things, such has having published books.
* I'm not super handsome, but I think I'm pretty decent looking.
* I'm not ripped, but I'm not in bad shape either. I also have tons of tattoos, which the women I date say that they think are sexy.
* I have a clean, tidy, decorated apartment.
* I have a lovable dog.
* I have a newish, nice car.
* I have hobbies and friends (though I don't spend as much time with friends as I would like).
* I *think* I'm good-natured and have a good sense of humor.
* I *think* I treat women well.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong or why I'm not ""enough."" Am I attracting the wrong kinds of people? How do I figure out if I am? If there is something I should do differently, how do I figure out what that is?

I'm stuck in life. I want a relationship first. I believe it will give me strength and motivation to work on my career. 

Idk what's good about me or how I will attract a woman.

I don't have too high requirements , i'm ready to compromise. 

I have this urgency to find relationship because i'm nearing late twenties. After 30, my hair will start balding, i'll lose libido. Also,  it's very lonely and sexually frustrating without a partner. I don't want to go to a prostitute because of lot of reasons but primarily becoz I don't think my future partner would like such a history of mine. And I wouldn't be able to lie to someone about my past if I really love her.

Also, my career path and family situation is highly confusing. I need a wife's guidance in that.  Because I am not sure what's the right way for me to earn money.  If I know my partner's desires, lifestyle, financial situation,  etc, I can tailor my path accordingly for her. 

Because I have no personal desire for money,  except to provide for the girl I love. Nothing materialistic excites me. Cars, foreign vacations, jewellery etc don't excite me. I don't care where I live, what I wear,  what my status/respect in society is. 

And if i'm unable to earn money in future and my savings finish, i might not have strength to continue anymore. I'll of course try my best to find a career,  but sometimes,  even high efforts don't yield results. So, i'll just ask her to find another partner for herself,  leave her some money as a compensation for the inconvenience I caused to her and exit from her life.  I'll of course tell her all this in initial stage only,  well before she gets too emotionally invested. I don't want to break anyone's heart.

I believe in doing things for my loved one. I want to maintain my fitness and put in effort to please her sexually.  I want to make her feel loved emotionally and logically try to understand her life issues and empathize with how she feels.

I'm a college dropout.  I won't get a job easily,  most require a graduation degree.

And i'm not motivated to,  until I find a relationship. It's like I need support of a partner to give me the drive and reason.

Can't poor people marry? And i'm not hard fixed on marriage/kids. Even medium term relationships would do.

Right now, since past 6 months,  my whole day goes into messaging people on reddit.


I am alright looking.  (6/10 ) in looks.
I'm tall, fit.

should I attract someone on basis of my looks or words?  Should I show my pic right in beginning or after talking for a while? 

I really want to be loved and I have a lot of love to give. I have zero relationship experience. 

I have almost 99k $ savings (inherited )

And I'll receive a lot more hopefully someday... around 500k - 1 million $.

I don't have a job or degree

How should I present my profile?

Sorry to bore you but I'm new to experiences like this (homeschool gang!) and would really love some personalized advice for my situation.

So I'm a Junior at a completely new school within a completely new city. Not really ideal for social situations but, fuck it, right? So school started last week on Wednesday and pretty quickly I hit it off with this one girl. She's also new to the school so I guess we have some things in common which makes bonding easier. Anyways, I just made small talk with her one day in 7th period when we had a fire drill, and I noticed she was walking right next to me to the football field so we just started chatting. It was honestly shocking to me how well we got along together so quickly, we both seem to be at the same wavelength, y'know? So anyways for the rest of the period we were just blabbering to each other. About our favorite shows, things we hate, what our old schools were like, etc. And we kept talking after the bell rang when we were walking to our cars. She offered to give me her socials so we could keep in touch, which felt awesome.

During the weekend we talked a lot, mainly about a show I told her to watch. But something really interesting also happened. Okay, so the class we share, our 7th period, is an AP elective. Its pretty study intensive and not at all a requirement for graduation. She mentioned that she had already planned to switch classes because she didn't want to study that much. Now obviously I was pretty bummed that the only friend I had made wasn't going to be in one of my classes anymore, but even more obviously, I didn't want to let her know that, so I just messaged her back something to the effect of, ""Well that's a bummer, you're pretty crazy, it'll be scary not being able to keep an eye on you."" She stopped reply to my messages for about 10 minutes and messaged me back, ""Actually I'm gonna keep the class, me and my mom are going to buy supplies."" Just want it to be known that at that moment I felt like the coolest fucking dude on planet Earth.

So, fast forward to yesterday and today, we both sit together alone on the top floor of one of the most secluded building in our school, I've given her like 4 show recommendations, all of which she's written down in her phone so she knows to watch them when she's done with the one I currently told her to watch, when someone took her seat next to me (no seating charts yet) she got a chair from somewhere else and sat next to me anyways, she offered to show me around the city whenever I'm free. And above all that I've just noticed she seems to go out of her way to run into me.

Don't get me wrong, I understand completely that I'm not only overreacting, but overanalyzing everything to fit a narrative I really, really want to be true. I get that most likely she's just lonely, like me, and is really thrilled to have found a friend. But despite all that, I'd still love some outside opinions on this. Personally I'd be fine with just being friends, but its always good to know what your options are.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,960313,public,self,Does she(15f) like me(16m)?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6bg32/does_she15f_like_me16m/,all_ads,6,,,

i've experienced crushes and felt shy around attractive people like regular teenagers do, so i never felt like there was anything wrong. it was only up until recently i had realized that there was an issue with how i reacted to when the tables turned and people began making advances with me/having crushes on me/etc.

this happened with both audiences: people i've had crushes on and people i don't have crushes on. though, usually, i would just play the flirting off as a joke with the people who i don't feel anything towards romantically

i can totally imagine myself in a relationship with specific people and i initially WANT to make advances with them, but these feelings halt immediately the moment they show signs of genuine interest.

the feeling is hard to describe; there's like a pit in my stomach, and a feeling of ""oh wow if i date them this'll be my life now, everything's gonna change"" and a little bit of ""wow, thats stupid of them to say that"". the thought about people flirting with me- and even looking back at what people have said to me- doesn't provoke any strong feelings like that at all, it really only effects me when i'm currently in the moment. this is probably why it's so hard for me to type out.

i don't know if it's worth noting, but i tend to show interest in people who show toxic traits (possessiveness, jealousy, aggressiveness, etc.) and pick them over people who are genuine and sweet. i'll also mention only have one (ironically my first ""actual"" relationship) relationship that evolved into a mess of unhealthy behaviors. did that experience ruin these future feelings that i have? maybe i have trouble with blurring the lines of sexual 'wants' with my romantic 'needs'?

i don't get it, i'm genuinely lost. is it rooted in insecurity? am i simply just not as interested in the person as i thought i was? am i overthinking? is this some kind of response, maybe a learned behavior? i don't need a direct answer, i just need a little pointer to lead me into the right direction.

We have been regularly going out once a week, we enjoyed each other's company, calling each other every other day, intimacy but I was delaying sex till I see what kind of a guy he is and since I'm conservative little bit.

Lately he started not texting regularly, so I opened up and asked him if this is normal that we don't chat for 4+ days. He said he is like this usually and he should've be better in communication.

Last month, I belive I was the active person who is initiating conversations and text, although he is interacting with me always, but if I don't text for 2 days, he won't initiate anything. I asked him that I'm not happy with this communication and we should know where things are etc. He said I'm not in love with you yet and I don't know when I will be. I told him I'm not yet as well but if we don't talk, how we will go to next level and I told him I'm more than ok to have a break from each other! He said its not about break.
Next morning, he texted me good morning and I replied and then nothing after that.

Since then, it's been about 10 days we never had any communication. He keeps liking my social media picture and watch my stories but never texted/called me. 

I thought I'm being too much by trying to call him/text him everyday and I wanted effort from him as well 

We don't have any friends in common. He has been with the company for a year post covid and I work next building but there is a chance we may run to each other since we r in the same department a d have same job.

I'm a professional 37F with good career, family, friends, highly educated and good life. The only thing is he (42m) never been married and I was! I also have 1 child (12m) from previous marriage. Is this a problem for him? The first day he asked me if I'm single, he knew I have commitment with a kid a d he said we will spend weekend together and he is very interested in me! So I didnt hide anything from him!

What is your advice? I'm not into this century dating and I dont wanna gobout with 10 guys every month just to get attention. I want 1 person's intention and to settle if they are the right person.

I don’t even know how we got to be friends on social media and I texted him unknowing that he had a girlfriend and we talked about everything and connected on a deeper level. I haven’t felt this way about anyone. I know it sounds cliché but it’s like wave of emotions i go through whenever I see his texts on my screen, and by talking to him I got to know he’s a really good human being and I helped him with his sadness, and by while trying him to console him about his emotions about family/school I fell in love with him. He is exactly what I have always wanted in someone. We speak different languages yet we connect like magnets. He makes me feel so good about myself and he said that I make him better everyday. Our dreams match and I can be vulnerable to him, and he can be vulnerable to me. I feel like I love him wholeheartedly. 

His personality, his voice, the language he speaks that I don’t understand, his kindness, his everything. I don’t know how to write about this feeling, it’s not like i don’t have any friends or family who doesn’t care about me that’s why i jumped into the first chance i got, it really is not like that. I have people who care about me deeply and I have bestfriends. I like to go to parties and I’m used to having fun. And about my dating life, people are confessing to me everyday, but I don't connect with them like I did with him. I sent him my badly written poetries and some good ones and he sent me his poetries and the stories he had written. He shared my poetries publicly and he loved them and shared his deepest feelings about people around him. 
We share the same dream and we plan what might happen if we could ever meet and I confidently said that we would but things would be much different and we both know it. 
The connection we have is something more than friendship, he compliments me and I him, and he cares about me and my health.  And I care about him so much that it makes me sick to my stomach. I want to touch him and be touched by him everyday. And I’m demi sexual, I don’t feel anything unless I have a deep bond with someone. When he sleeps I feel some kind of peace knowing he’s asleep and when I wake up randomly in the middle of the night because of my insomnia he’s always there for me. 

I stalked his profile and found out that he has a girlfriend, whom he never mentioned and even after knowing that i didn’t ask him anything (gosh, I feel so embarrassed) 
I felt maybe it would ruin the bond we have? 
Or maybe I felt he just sees me as a friend but my gut feeling tells me that he doesn’t, as does his subtle texts and everything. I always hated cheating but is it cheating? I don’t know, and I feel like this is so unfair. Why does he need to be so far away from me and why do I feel this way? And I couldn’t have met with him until the next 4 or 5 years after I’m done with my undergrad. I don’t expect him to be with me honestly, long distance won’t work, it’s obvious. 
How do I move on? He’s my support system, we share a lot of things, I don't want to stop talking to him, he’s making me a better person and for him I want to be a better person, he brings so much to my life. 

I love how cute he is, how cute his texts are, how beautiful everything between us is. 
I don’t know what to do, i really don’t 
This is my first post here so it might be a little messy but I’m desperate for advice and support. 
And I’m really sorry if I’m doing something morally wrong but I can’t imagine losing him, imagining him not being there for me, even if it’s virtual makes me anxious. And I can’t go to therapy because I don’t want to upset my parents, they’ll worry so much about me. And I have a lot on my plate right now, with my A levels exams in January and extracurricular activities but I love him. Why am I being like this?

But I still try to talk about it with friends in some vain attempt to figure out my problems. The issue is that everytime I do, they just talk past me and never listen. In the end I just feel more hopeless AND then get the sense that they respect me less for showing some kind of vulnerability. 

Case in point. In a conversation I had yesterday, I said that I have issues asking women out. My friend took this as an opportunity to wax about how I had to ask women out because they naturally don't have the ability and men do. I responded that that seems kind of funny since I have never felt naturally confident around women , so either he's wrong or I am special. And if I am special , I need some different or new kind of approach. He then just repeated that ""all"" I had to do was go do it. 

I then proposed the idea of asking out random women to practice and get better at it, and he said to NEVER do this because it isn't the right way and it is sociopathic. He proposed finding female friends to ask out . But he later told me not wait too long or they would assume I am not emotionally strong and lose interest. I then said that this was my original problem, that I have issues asking women out. 

And it is like this for EVERY conversation with EVERY person I have. I think people just assume I have some kind of innate level of confidence because I'm male. OR they think I can change my fears and emotions sheerly through force of will. OR they think my dating woes will just magically sort themselves out since ""I haven't found the right woman yet."", as if my 9 years of being single serve in no way to indicate that there is a problem I have. 

I think the worst part of this is that no one just lets me be single either. If I say I am 34 and single its always, ""Well you should have figured this out by now."" or ""What are you doing?"". That is how I get into these frustrating conversations in the first palce. I actually accepted I would be single a long time ago, especially after trying to take the, ""You'll find someone when you least expect it."" kind of advice. I'm not the happiest but it isn't so bad, especially since I get to do everything on my terms. But no one will accept me for this. Or they assume that I am like this because I want to be which I am not. I get a lot of ""How can you be single if you are empathetic, kind, and aren't resentful towards women?"". Its like, if I knew this, I wouldn't be single.  

Every time this happens, I just want to tell people about myself less. It is abundantly clear that no one understands me. So I find myself being less vulnerable and cutting myself off from people. It feels like I can't be who I really am and have people accept me. And I am getting lonlier as a result. I don't even care about getting a girlfriend. All I want is for people to actually listen and see me for who I am.

My wife had her first brain surgery for an AVM (anterior-venous malformation, a mass of dangerous and potentially eruptive blood vessels) a year after I met her. I stuck with her through it, and she was in chronic pain for 10 years. The AVM had eventually grown back and she had a second brain surgery, this amplified her chronic pain by a lot. I still stuck with her but it has been insanely rough.

To deal with the constant chronic pain, we were informed about ketamine as a treatment. If she could be relieved of at least 50% of the pain, she could do other things like go to the dentist and be social comfortably. 

Turns out the ketamine treatment was a life changing mistake. The doctor insisted to go with double the dose in half of the time to accommodate her condition and agoraphobia. In short, she had been given too much too quickly, and it poisoned her and burned her brain and memory, causing a lot of cognitive damage and even visual distortion.

She does have some memory of things, but she doesn’t recognize me like she once had. She’s explained to me how I feel to her, and that I’m like a stranger she doesn’t know yet. She wants to know me again, she likes me, but I basically have to start over with dating. It’s tricky because (and I must admit) it is difficult to not think of her as the person I knew before. She’s not entirely that person anymore so I need to get to know her again as she is.

So, the idea is to date and woo her all over again. I actually have too little experience in doing so, she was my second girlfriend I’ve ever had, and we liked each other in the beginning so much that it came so naturally. We don’t have much money, and she can’t leave the house.

So I pose to you, any advice, tips, or ideas? However creative, whatever you have is greatly appreciated.

The girl said she would follow my friend so that I could get her Instagram and it never really happened until recently, so I just found her on Instagram anyways and followed her, but she never followed me back so I thought was that.

I end up getting called to this job again, I see this girl and we’re cordial, but I just felt super awkward bc I thought I got rejected. Well my female friend told me that they were talking about me and she said I was cool and funny, and even asked my age.

She comes up to me during my shift today and says that she didn’t mean to ignore me (she told me she doesn’t check her requests that often) and that she followed me back. She then started trying to make small talk but I was just sort of mumbling and was too anxious, and she just asked me when I was working again and that she would see me tomorrow. 

I just feel so dumb for acting like a shy little kid but I just couldn’t help it bc in my head I though she just ignored me, and I thought she wasn’t interested and I’m not sure if she’s just being nice now. I hate awkward situations like this and I felt my flight or fight response kicking in and I usually don’t get nervous taking to girls, but when I have a crush I turn into a second grader. 

I was wondering if I should just leave it at that or what I should do? I feel like it’s too awkward for me now but at least I know I’m not repulsive and she didn’t mean to do that.

I (F24) met this guy (M25) a few weeks ago and we really hit it off! I have never felt more comfortable with a man before in my life. He's tall (6'2 which is great because I'm tall for a woman 5'10), educated, kind, funny, a little geeky but I find it charming.

He's also Nigerian, which is not a problem at all for me, I am a Black woman too. The issue is, the conversion rate on Nigerian money and USD is horrendous, and he told me last night that we can't hang out anymore because he wants to take a few weeks to make money and pay for college things. His classes start at the end of August, and the reason why he's in America is to receive an American degree.

I am not a materialistic woman at all. I do make a decent amount of money considering I'm a recent undergraduate myself and I am planning on going back to school for my masters. I also like to invest in nice things, like my tiny Coach bag and expensive perfumes (these are my splurge items tbh, but most of my wardrobe is from thrifts shops, small Black-owned businesses, and occasionally Zara). But now I think that has intimidated him and he's pulled back.

Last night he texts a long text telling me that he's a first-born son of an African family. Back home (he was in the medical field in Nigeria) he's used to being a provider and in America, everything is overwhelmingly expensive. He wants to take some time to find work and sort out his finances, which, of course, I want him to be financially stable. But on every date, he has INSISTED on paying for everything, even the smallest things like coffee. I am more than capable to pay for dates but he's stubborn and says it's a ""blow to his ego.""

The last thing he texted was that he still wanted to see me at his place, meaning he wants to have sex. We have not had sex and I wasn't planning on it until I was his official girlfriend. We've both had sex before with other people, or one-night stands, but I really wanted to ""do it right"" this time and take it slow with this guy because I can see a long future with him. Should I have sex with him while on break? Or should I just wait a few uncertain weeks and risk him moving on?

We have been texting a ton and have played video games a couple times. We also have discussed hanging out. I can’t tell if she just thinks of us as friends or wants more.

I see this almost TOO often for me not to want to read into it, is this the new “I like someone who is funny/makes me laugh” where it’s just a generic catch-all kind of statement?

We had, for what I thought was good conversation via dating app with seemingly similar interests, and he was the one who brought it off the app and made the plans/place to meet up. I was pretty nervous, but we meet and have some drinks and have good conversation - for which we talk about a wide variety of topics, including family, what I look for in a guy, and that I have only been in one long-term relationship and that he is divorced. I did react to that but ultimately, told him I don't really care about it. I give him my number and the day after, I text him, as I had a good time, don't really care for playing the waiting game and ultimately, wanted a second date to get to know him even more. He asks ""hey, how is your day so far?"" type question for which I respond with a meme (lmao). Since sending that, haven't received a text back and a couple of days later, I send him another message to check in - no response. We both have jobs that keep up relatively busy so while I don't expect quick responses, I expect some type of message along the lines of ""I don't see this going anywhere"" to be polite. it's been almost a week since we met up and about 4 days since I followed up.

Studied IT at university and I never had any girls in my class. So I havent had the chance to even get some sort of friendship with a girl. 

All my friends seem to be finding and getting into relationships. Guys that I wouldn't believe would get into a relationship, Like I don't get it, are women not interested in me, even though I'm not as geeky as you think, I exercise every day, keep myself maintained and try to keep myself looking good, Im a goal driven individual, I go to nightclubs every few weeks, due to covid it's been alot of sitting around lol.

I'm on tinder and as soon as I say what I studied I never hear from them again. It's like they are not interested in smart, goal driven men. Or am I missing the point. 

Women of reddit, what am I doing wrong and what should I do to find someone that has the same passions as me.
