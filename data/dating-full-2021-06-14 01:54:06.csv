He snapped a picture of himself doing the pose requested by the app, and within seconds, it verified the profile as being real. I'm not sure how these apps manage to carry out verifications, but our guess is that is as long as you do the pose and vaguely resemble the person in the picture (in this case, my friend had dark hair and facial hair like the guy in his pictures.)

This makes me wonder how many other fake verified profiles are out there, and what the exact requirements are in their process, because if it's just a matter of doing the pose and being a guy or a woman, that's a huge issue.

Before my brother passed, I started to actually like him, and finally revealed my feelings to him after my brother’s funeral (not the best time emotionally). When I told him then, he said if we were to ever get together he would end up marrying me. Since then, we’ve both been in long-term relationships, but still always had each other in mind (we’ve talked about this). It was difficult to say the least. 
Fast forward to now, we’re actually able to be together, and our emotional and physical connection is something I’ve never experienced before. 
Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? I’m just so nervous that this is something that could fizzle out because of the intense  feelings during the “honeymoon stage”, although I know this is something more powerful than that.

Both relationships were amazing in the beginning. Texting and spending time together frequently, cooking together, going on adventures, envisioning our futures intertwined with each other's, everything that couples do during the honeymoon stage. Unfortunately, things fizzled out slowly after moving too quickly. I am well aware of my tendency to choose people who I am not compatible with, but it was still heartbreaking to go through the breakups. I'm not going to say that it was my fault or their fault. My exes and I simply fell out of love. 

Ex 1 texted me a few weeks after I broke up with him, completely out of the blue. They apologized to me, saying that they wished things ended differently, hoped we could be friends, and that I deserve better. It really sucked hearing that because I realized how much I idealized the relationship and how they realized they couldn't fulfill my needs, no matter how much I wanted them to. It seemed like they were trying to escape blame and pose as the ""good guy."" I know they had good intentions and they really cared, but it still hurt to hear. 

Ex 2 told me I deserved better as we were breaking up. They realized that they were leading me on and didn't realize it until a few days before the breakup. It felt one-sided, and that made the breakup hurt more than the previous one. For days after, I couldn't find the motivation to get out of bed or eat or go to work. Then, I felt an intense anger after realizing that the only reason they were saying was because they didn't want to take accountability for the lies they told. They wanted me to think that they were doing me a favor by allowing me to find someone better. In retrospect, I'm glad that we broke up, but I still feel pangs of anger because they couldn't have handled that more poorly.

While I haven't been in the dating scene for years, I've been forcing myself to talk to new people over the past couple of months, so I feel I have the ability to more than hold a conversation with her in person, should there be any awkward silences. 

I'm going to be picking her up, and we'll head to the arcade followed by a nice meal. Any tips would be appreciated!

* Do I buy her flowers/chocolate and give them to her when I pick her up? 
* What topics are best avoided during dates?
* Any questions to have on reserve should there be any awkwardly long silences?
* How much physical contact is okay? i.e. arm touches, hand holding etc.

Came into her work and talked for a while effortlessly and just felt super natural. Only left once another customer came and couldn't stay any longer. Today was when we had planned for a date and I texted this morning to confirm. She didn't reply till way later in the day and pretty much avoided the question and just said she had to work the next day. I replied just saying it was fine and that I'd let her give me a date she could go rather than me checking in every fucking day like a lost dog **(Didn't phrase it like that)**.

Guess I don't really know where to go from here. Normally at this point id just throw in the towel cause I've never liked chasing after girls that are like this. But for context I've went on quite a few dates that have technically went well. Like the date was planned to just be a short dinner and we'd end up talking for 5 hours.

Went on a date with a woman from hinge, we called a few times before and decided to go to a science museum. It was great and the woman was nice but I can’t tell if she was interested in a second date or not. 

We didn’t kiss since we both had masks on for most of the time and I was in two minds to touch due to corona since I wasn’t sure of her position but she did talk and ask all the standard dating questions about family and what we do and randomly she asked my salary lol cos we were talking about life and careers and we did laugh a lot too. 

I did compliment her on her outfit and paid for a drink after. 

I’ve sent a message after saying thanks for good time etc and asking when she’s free to go again? But not sure if I fucked up or not since I didn’t make a physical move

We hadn't seen each other for 2 years until I added Thursdays to my shifts. But now the times we do see each other are great. We get on so well with each other. We talk, we laugh, we joke around, we both give eye contact as we walk past each other and heads turned to each other while she walks past me. But we don't stay next to each other the entire 4 hours we see each other, because it's a workplace and don't want other co-workers clocking on that something it going on with me and her. But we do spend majority of time together only in work though. I have never seen her outside work.

I can tell she is interested in me because she always comes towards me when I am in a different part of the store. For example, I walk away from her for a bit to do something else and in a few minutes she comes back to me. In my workplace, all the managers are lenient so she tells the manager ""I'm going to chill with him (my name) for a bit"", and they don't care. So she actively wants to spend time with me. She also asked ""have I got a girlfriend?"". I read online that a girl asks that if they are interested. She also talks about her more private areas of her body to me, even though I'm not her boyfriend. 

I haven't asked for her number yet because I have only just started to see her again after 2 years apart.

When would the ideal time be to ask for her number? 

Where would I go with her if we do go out for the first time?

Would I just play it cool on the first date and no actual physical contact such as holding hands, kissing etc?

He was very polite and respectful man. As a medical student we experience too many sexual abuse from the male doctor students they treat us like we’re “hunt”. But not him. I never heard a single rumor about him trust me he’s a decent guy. (Ps;Between conversations he give messages about he’s a long relationship person)

Mostly I acted him to notice me and he invited me to have a drink..

Because of the pandemic situation we had to drink in one of ours houses so I went to his house. 

We had such a great time we talked and laughed a lot. I never had such a great time since months and he was still respectful to my personal space.

After sun’s up I left his house because I have a dog in my house. 

That morning he texted me this “you’ve gone.”
I tell him about my dog and noticed that he’s a little bit cold to me.
And I asked “do you have regrets?” He said “this was early because of the alcohol” just this and I asked more and he only texted “that’s it”

I said “I asked you this last night and you said it was okay “
He said he doesn’t remember and apologized for hurting me. I said that I thought he wanted to spend more time with me, he answered yes we can but I feel odd.

He said it’s not a loss it was joyful conversation and he apologized again

He made it very obvious he was into me and he took my number and texted me the next day. I had come to this party with another guy who I had been kissing infront of him.(I'm giving these small pointers incase it helps) Anyways he texted me the next day and we started speaking from there. I soon learnt he's not into texting cause our chats would only consist of 'Hey' but he'd regularly call me up and video call me to see me. 

Now some more pointers -

This dude is not on any social media at all. And when I asked why he wouldn't really answer me.

He has never even tasted a sip of alcohol in his life but loves to party.

He is very rich and also very very hardworking and focused.

Like he's told me he goes without eating because his work comes first sometimes.

He never told me his correct age ever (kinda sus again) but I'm assuming because I'm much younger he didn't want to scare me away (22, he's 30)

He is very very into fitness, now I can't help but wonder if he's recently had some crazy heartbreak, how can someone be this motivated lol and not into social media, not into texting. ( I don't mean to sound shallow)

I don't really know anything deep about him

There's a lockdown going on here for all the time I've known him. Now, he started really pursuing me, by that I mean Calling me \*every single day\* I decided not to put too much of my focus though on this guy because to some extent he would still act only like a booty call (call me really late at night) we'd not talk about anything dirty so I just assumed he was actually busy thru the day. He would genuinely just call to see how I am.

I would be very interested whenever he called but wouldn't go too out of my way to answer his calls, call back etc etc

Now I felt sick during this time and he would call me up every single day, video call me to see how I am, even send me food at home. After I was better he made a plan to hang out and said he'd been waiting to meet me. He was genuinely such a nice dude and was very encouraging and caring towards me.

Keep in mind, this was a very light friendship I still don't know anything deep about him and he doesn't know stuff about me either. When I'd ask he'd give me general answers so I decided to keep it that way too. And I was actually fine with it cause the friendship was so light and it was a great vibe so the fact that we didn't know much about each other didn't bother me.

We were friends with benefits though and would hook up every time we met. 

He started sneaking me into his house so that I could spend the night with him on weekends, he introduced me to his cousin, he would force me to hang with his friends every weekend (I wouldn't go to meet his friends because due to the age gap I didn't want it to appear that I was his toy or something) so I'd decline but hang separately with him later and he'd be fine with it assuming I'm just awkward or something. The most we've gone is three days without speaking and he'd immediately call and ask why? What's up? Is everything okay with me? 

He told me recently hes genuinely fond of me and likes hanging with me. Also hes very mind game free, like hes not one of those dudes who play mind games and act toxic.He also mentioned he's happy to not have sex and just do other stuff even just cuddle because hes banged enough girls, he said this after i mentioned i was a virgin.

Trust me he really made an effort here. And soon even I started reciprocating and would make sure he knew I enjoyed his company. 

We met this weekend, he sneaked me into his house for the night (he lives with his parents) we hooked up, I went home in the morning, he texted me as usual in the evening saying Hey. I continued with something lighthearted to which he didn't respond. I texted him the next day he said he's out of town, I asked him when did he go, he archived my message and never opened it. I assumed he's crazy busy. I texted him on the weekend asking if he's alright. He just said he had been working like crazy due to lockdown being opened again. Which I found to be a valid excuse since it did open the very next day after we hung out last. just whats weird is we never went even a single weekend without speaking, even if he was busy, he'd just call to check in. I texted him back with something sweet, he just saw my message on Sunday early morning at 6 which I found a bit sus because he gets up late af only gets up early if hes out partying or like If i was staying over to hook up with him, he never responded ( I didn't think much of it since he would never really text, only call) I then called him at night because it had been a week since we properly spoke, he answered we had a quick one minute call which is crazy since we always talk longer. He said he's okay, everythings fine, he went on his quick out of town trip, hes back and work is fine (I thought he had not been responding because work was v hectic and this whole time he was out of town) I asked him where had he been to which he said, here only. :/ and then he said let's hang soon (which I felt he didn't really mean but only said so that I calm down, don't question him and would cut the call soon)

I literally cannot help but wonder wtf happened. It makes me only think that he had an ex who's now come back into his life.

Because it's absolutely crazy just the previous weekend he legit forced me to hang out with him and spend the night, fast forward to the next day and he's stopped pursuing me. Literally wtf could be the reason why? He doesn't text or call now and it's been a week. I cannot help but overthink this, I know I should just move on and I will

I dont want to sit and think its because i didnt make enough efforts, also he knew i was kinda shy so wouldn't take it personally

But I really appreciate if anyone could help me get clarity on this situation. How could something just change in a day

It only makes sense if he was using me to get over a girl and shes back now, right?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: A guy really pursuing me for 2.5 months, we have a FWB relationship. It's very light hearted nothing too heavy.

But fuckkkkk. 5 days away. I feel like im gonna be out of shit to actually talk about on the actual date (assuming this all goes to plan of course and she actually shows).

I'm likely overthinking this and I know it. I mean, I got this far just being cordial and funny... but I guess I'm worried about overcommunicating then?

So what are your thoughts? One random, personal-type get to know ya question per day?

We shared similar interests, goals and dreams.

It took about six months for our first big argument, after which she didn't talk to me for almost a week but we made up and she seemed genuinely upset about the whole thing and was very apologetic. I'll spare the details of every point in the relationship but it felt to me that as time went on, she became less and less willing to admit fault and slowly, everything that went wrong between us was because of something I did. The fights weren't constant. Things would be fine for months and then it would explode and, like a fool, I'd go into damage control and try to fix things. She never wanted to talk about what caused the fights, either. She'd just blow off steam for however long it took her to get over it and then it would go back to normal. This part I was never comfortable with as I like hashing out my problems with people and we never once did. 

COVID turned out to be our tipping point. I was laid off on April 1 of last year while she was fortunate enough to keep working. I also got lucky and got my unemployment filed in time to avoid any gaps in my income so I wasn't stressed about money in the slightest. I was also happy because she seemed non-plussed about the virus and we got to spend more time together. Then one day, in early May, she accused me of being resentful of the fact that she was still employed while I was laid off and in that moment, everything I had been willing to overlook in her vanished. Even now my blood boils just thinking about it. I told her that I am not the resentful type and replied with ""That's not what I've observed."" I told her that it was probably the most cutting and hurtful thing I've ever heard somebody say to me, to which she replied something along the lines of ""I call it like I see it."" I cut it off right then and stewed in my own anger. We briefly reconnected at my instigation (again, as a fool) in September but the snide and cutting comments resumed not long after. Once I started to really stand up for myself, she broke it off and we have not spoken since. 

I do believe that this relationship was abusive but it's hard for me to be sure because I'm still a bit sore from it and it doesn't check all the boxes. She was fine with me hanging out with my friends, she LOVED my parents and for the most part, was very easygoing. Two big red flags that might explain her behavior was something she mentioned to me when she confessed she believed she might be bipolar. I knew she suffered from pretty severe depression so bipolar disorder might explain the rest. The other was the fact that her father was emotionally abusive to her as a child so I think that really set her up for treating others that way. I think it also played a huge part in her unwillingness to sit down and discuss our problems like adults.

So I met a women through a male friend of mine at a party. We were left alone, I made some conversation and we surprisingly hit things off pretty well.I got her number and then we proceeded to talk, things were going well. 

The following weekend, myself, her, our mutual friend and a couple others all went out for drinks and once again it really seemed as though she was into me! Later that night we went to a club and we were dancing intimately and ended up kissing a few times. Things were really good! 

However, the following weekend I noticed her and our mutual friend are a little close. He was lifting her up, tickling her and stuff! And I just don't know whether it's that friendship level close or they are both hiding feelings for each other. On top of that, she went extremely cold and distant toward me that weekend and it just threw me off completely.

I even asked him before, is there something between them both and he just never responded (very suspicious).

Also, when me and this friend were doing something with some other females, he told me not to mention it to her. I can understand why but this was also weird.

Ultimately, I think there is something between them and maybe she was using me to make him jealous. On the other hand, I was hoping maybe she was just feeling shy because we hit off intensely in the club.

I'm literally clutching at straws here because I really like her but I just need someone else to share their opinions, so I know my line of thinking isn't wrong.

TLDR: I think a woman I met through my friend maybe using me to make him jealous, how can I be sure?

I come to you with some questions about a recent situation from my dating life.

So last week, I ended up meeting this guy randomly while me and my flatmate were on our way home. He was with his friends and we all
got along together but me and this guy ended up hitting it off so we exchanged numbers.

We went on a date which ended up quite okay as we talked about plenty of stuff - he seemed really careful and attentive. At the end he kissed me and held my hand during the entire walk home. The second date... well.. I ended up at his place. (He was very nice and sweet when we met as well - holding my hand and kissing me in public). However, things didn’t go _that_ well as we had sex quite a couple of times but everything ended very quickly from his side (less than 30s). It didn’t bother me at all as I still had a nice time and I made it clear for him as well.

Ever since then though, he’s been kind of avoiding me and I think I just needed the opinion of other people regarding this:

1. If you simply want to have a one night stand with someone, isn’t it much easier to let them know about this upfront?

2. Is there such a thing as sleeping with someone too soon? (I don’t really agree with this as if something is there, why resist the emotions&amp;chemistry? Also if someone likes you, that shouldn’t really count in a negative way?)

3. Could it be that maybe he was a lil bit embarrassed about what happened?

I think what bothers me is the fact that I don’t really understand why is he acting the way he does.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838025,public,nsfw,Why is it sometimes so hard for people to communicate what they want from you,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nznvh0/why_is_it_sometimes_so_hard_for_people_to/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,

I want the titles and the commitment but he doesn't. He told me this plainly in the beginning. I thought I could change his mind and I couldn't. It all feels so real right now and I'm crying writing this. It is sobering to say the least. I know that what I did was the best thing for the both of us. It took me a while but I've finally accepted it, despite how much I care and have feelings for him.

Some things that are becoming very clear to me. 1) I wasn't happy. 2) If someone tells you they aren't looking for a relationship. As literal as it sounds, believe them. In the end you are setting yourself up to get hurt based on the rare chance that you could be together. 3) I was being selfish. We obviously didn't want the same things for our future and me wanting more than he could give me was wrong. 4) The hurt you feel at the end of it is not worth it. I know that I will feel better with time but i was careless with my heart and my precious time and I have no one to blame but myself. 5) I let myself down. Out of all the options I had, I chose the man that didn't want me instead of the one that did. I know that this type of masochism stems from my traumatic childhood, but going forward my decisions have to have my best interest at heart.

I'll keep this short and sweet.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for two months exclusively and have been talking for around 5 months in total.

When me and my boyfriend first started talking, (we never met in person first, I Dm'ed him on Instagram) I was casually seeing my ex that I broke up with a month prior, (was a short, not even 2 month long relationship, guy was very manipulative, so I left him) But 2 weeks after the breakup he like made me feel really shitty about it and I wasn't in a great place and idk we started hooking up a few times. This happened while I was first texting my boyfriend I am dating now, who treats me amazingly. But as soon as I went on my first date with my boyfriend, I could see an amazing future that I wanted to pursue with him. So I told my ex that I just wanted to be friends with him so he wouldn't freak out on me (he's one of those guys) this guy could not understand that we weren't together, (kept saying I love you to me and stuff) so about a week before me and my boyfriend got into a relationship, I blocked him completely because he was flipping out over me not hanging out with him anymore.

Anyways, in our first week of dating, my boyfriend told me that he had been talking to other people during the time we had been seeing each other, he never hung out with other people, but he flirted in a sexual manner with some girls, he then asked me if I had done the same, which he said he would have understood because we had no commitment to each other. But I told him that there was nobody else I was talking to, this is true after our first date, but before that, while we were texting for around a month, I was seeing my ex. This happened up until around a week before me and my boyfriends first date.

I have lied about it for the two months we have been dating because I don't want to hurt him, He askes me about it sometimes so I think he suspects something, I thought that if I had told him at the time, he would think that I was just sleeping around with a bunch of people, which is something I don't ever do, ( I haven't even slept with that many people). But now I feel like I have to stick with the lie as it's been dragging on for two months, and I feel guilty. I am completely committed to him, and all this happened before our first date even, but i feel like I should have just been honest from the start.

My boyfriend values honesty quite a bit, and is honestly too honest, he will tell me the truth over almost anything. I don't think he takes lying very well, as he was in an ex relationship where he was lied to almost every single day and was cheated on.

Am I in the wrong here? should I come clean?

So basically in the beginning of May, my gf began feeling depressed.  At first it was only affecting her a little,  but throughout the month it became worse. We had been best friends for 2 years prior to dating.  We started dating in December of 2020. Anyway,  I did try to improve her situation and depression but it didn't work and only sorta drained and brought me down as well. But with her, ever since I've met her, we had always been able to work things out with communication and just talking things out. Any small bump in the road, we always talked it out. That's what I've always done. And so towards the end of may, when things were at it's worse, I just wanted to do what I've always done, which is to use communication to talk things out. 

Because I know communication in relationships is very important. And so during the span of a week, I'd ask her often if she could make more time for us to talk, because she had kinda been more distant because of the depression.  And I'm not an expert on depression,  I didn't know how exactly it affects you or what all symptoms it brings on. I really didn't.  And so I sorta asked a lot if she could make more time for us to talk, because I genuinely thought that any problem can be made better with communication. And looking back, because she was dealing with depression,  it made her wanna be alone more than usual,  and just kinda deal with things on her own. And just made her need space.  But I was really thinking that space was the wrong thing to do, and that just talking things out was the solution.  Looking back I see that I was wrong. Communication is important,  but it cant solve all problems.  And during that week, I did kinda get upset that she wouldn't make more time for us to talk and communicate our feelings and figure out a solution. It made me feel like she wasn't putting in the effort to try and just communicate and solve the issue. Looking back I was wrong for thinking that. I was overwhelmed with a lot myself and not thinking clearly. 

And I guess basically my constant asking her to make more time for us triggered something from her past. Basically Years ago she had a boyfriend who was super terrible.  He abused her physically,  emotionally,  verbally etc. He was super controlling and did terrible things to her. And apparently one of the things he use to do was to tell her she needs to make more time for him and that ""she never makes time for him"" and just stuff like that. And because of me saying I'd like for her to make more time for us to communicate,  it reminded her of him and what she went through. And it just brought back those memories. And she told me afterwards that she needs to take some time to herself.  She made it clear that she still loves me and that we will continue the relationship where we left off when shes ready. 

But I just feel terrible.  I never intended to remind her of her abusive controlling ex. I genuinely just thought that talking things out and using communication was the best solution. Looking back I know I was wrong for thinking that communication can solve all problems,  especially depression. I'm nothing like her ex, I genuinely love her, I care about her. And I have nothing but love for her.  I've never abused her in any way. And I just wanna know what things I need to be doing to make sure this never happens again.  I have never been with someone who's had traumatic things that have happened in their past. Or someone who's dealing with depression. I want to be the best boyfriend possible.

We will call her A.

""Introduced"" through a colleague (B) of mine that thought we should meet. Colleague had dinner with A a few weeks back which is where B name dropped me. Later that week B gave me A's number and told me to call her.

Played a bit of phone tag that weekend (Memorial Day weekend), but we did have a nice 30-45 minute phone conversation which ended in us starting to lose service so we parted ways. I reached back out to her a few days later to see if we could set something up, but she was going away for the weekend. Texted her a few days after her trip, mentioned wanting to get together, she said she would like to but her dog is going through some medical issues right now so outside of work she spends most of her time at her mom's spending time with her dog. Understandable. She did mention she would like to chat in the mean time and hopefully next week (now this week) her dog is a bit more independent and she will have more free time.

I have not heard from A since Thursday night, in which I ""left her on read"". Her last text wasn't really anything to respond to and it was getting late, so I just went to bed. I have not reached out to her since, but I was kind of hoping I'd have heard from her this time instead. Her responses have always been enthusiastic and long and when I asked about her trip, she sent me pictures from it unsolicited, so she *seems* interested. The other side of things is she has not once initiated conversation, and outside of our first phone conversation she really hasn't inquired about me much. Our conversation has flowed well, but she hasn't done any real ""getting to know me"". I understand text isn't the place for this, but we haven't even had a first date yet...I feel like you'd ask a *couple* questions at least. Also, she is definitely someone that is busy. I stay busy too, but come on...30 minutes for coffee shouldn't be *that* much of a burden on someone's schedule.

So I really struggle with dating because i am sexualized so much. I know some of it is just how some men are but I have a shapely body and think that plays a role too.

It’s hard for me to find men that are reserved/modest in nature. I don’t enjoy suggestive flirting (being called freaky, sexy, bad girl, naughty, etc) at all but almost all the men I meet do that and it makes me repulsed. 

I have met 2 men in my life who were not like that with me and I hope to find more like that because I just wish I could be with one of them.

I met both of those guys on Tinder but that app is a literal cesspool and there must be a better way. 

So, how do I attract men who are modest/reserved/prude. I’m considering veiling myself as that’s a symbol of modesty, but I also don’t want to represent Islam when I’m not Muslim. I try to wear less form fitting clothes but I can’t help that I have a body in everything I wear anyways. 

I’ve also considered going for gray/demisexual guys but I really just want modesty.

If you have any tips on how to find, identify, and attract these types, please share.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838120,public,self,How to be less sexy or find a modest man?,0,[],0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzpfmw/how_to_be_less_sexy_or_find_a_modest_man/,all_ads,6,,,,,
