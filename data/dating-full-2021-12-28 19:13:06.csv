The guy (m20) she's currently crushing on usually takes about week to respond to her messages.  When he does, it's a very VERY long message back so it does seem like he's genuinely interested? He says his job requires him to work very long hours a day, nearly 7 days a week. They met through a niche hobby a couple months back and clicked at an out of state convention. They haven't seen eachother since then. His long response times do bother her but don't seem to be a deal breaker for her.. she does vent her frustrations about it to me. I have not met this guy before so I don't know what he's like, other than what she's told me. They've both admitted to having feelings for one another.

It does seem a little fishy imo as I would imagine someone would at least have a few minutes here or there to acknowledge a text at least? Personally I work 50-60 hour weeks and still manage to text people back daily.. The age gap is another little bit of a red flag for me too as I know a lot changes between 20 and 25.

1. Use clear pictures. I think this is SO IMPORTANT. Do not use blurry pictures. It's an instant no-no.

2. Smile. Make sure you're smiling in the first picture and your face is properly visible. Also, ditch the shades. It's so annoying to see dudes with shades on in the first picture itself. We want to see you, your face, your smile. 

3. Focus on solo pictures. If you want to keep pictures with your friends, then put them last. It's a pain to go through a huge group picture just to find you.

4. Take your time to fill up the bio. Make sure you highlight your best assets, it could be your puns, sense of adventure or music taste.

5. Post pictures of you doing things that you love. It's honestly really sexy to see someone do something they're passionate about. So definitely do add a picture of you playing a sport/playing the guitar/etc 

I know dating apps are considered to be mostly superficial, but if you make your profile genuine, you might just find the person you're looking for. For me and I do believe I'm a relatively attractive girl, looks just aren't enough to impress me. You might be looking like a fucking model, but if your bio is dry, it's an instant left swipe. I prefer someone with good education, a good sense of humor, someone with passions and hobbies - basically a great personality!

We call a lot, video through phone etc. 

So to the matter at hand, Yesterday we were playing a game together and she sent me a snap about the concert she was going to in 2022. Which is super cool... But then I looked at how many concert she's going to. Literally on 3 days right after each other she was going to Shawn Mendes which was not the only thing. Also about 2-3 times to Justin Bieber, But she wasn't sure if she was going the third time. I asked out of curiosity how much that costed. 

It costed her over 2000 euro's and told me she emptied her savings account for it... My mind was blown. To empty an account for such a stupid thing was just mindblowning. However I could get past it and it was fine, She was now saving and wasn't thinking about spending more.

Now today, A friend of mine is doing a charity event for kids with cancer.. I support this friend quite a lot since he's doing so much with his community and everything. So I proceed to donate a 100 euro's, Which is a lot of money. I took it from the cut that I put aside every month and was like ''What's 100 euro's less for one month'' My friend was happy, I was happy and I felt just great. I was not doing it for the praise I wanted to tip my friend anomyous. My friend knew it was me since I literally said it to him but other than that nobody knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her and she responded with: Now that's a STUPID way to spend your money. Atleast I spend it on myself and have fun with it.... Which just kinda threw me off... Now she's angry and told me that I wasn't allowed to judge her spending...

Doing this has completely changed my dating life. I know go into dates fully understanding of a future where this person will want you completely out of their lives for good, and will see you as an annoyance at best

I’ve started seeing someone who is not nearly as attractive or has as many hobbies/ambitions/athleticism as anyone I’ve dated before, but I know that I would have zero problem walking away forever if they do, because I can easily find someone who doesn’t have much going on.

It’s made me much more relaxed. To regard everyone as completely temporary, and only dating people who I know are not so special that I couldn’t find someone to replace them easily, means I have had zero incidents that I used to get in the past: absolute agony for over a year where I can’t function properly and jeopardize my work and my friendships, while pining after the one who got away.

I highly recommend doing this, especially if you are a man because I have noticed that it’s usually men who struggle getting over people all women usually move on very quickly.

I have no previous relationship or dating experience and a very low self esteem that most guys take advantage of.

I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin, go to the gym, but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny


He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.

I'm getting cold feet and want out from this. I don't know what to do I'm freaking out, since I've flirted with him before he is probably thinking of me as an easy hook up. How do I backtrack without coming off as an idiot? I just want to be loved and treated good, not seen as a sexual conquest.

Our first conversation was great, he asked about my childhood and personal things but after that He  would really only want to sext and flirt . 
He also didn’t talk on the phone much, when I would call it would go to his work voice mail ( I guess he used his work phone as his personal?). 
I never knew where he stayed, when I came he offered to get us a hotel because his place was “under construction “? 
He told me that if he was going to be taking me on dates ( which he hasn’t done yet) and having sex with me I couldn’t talk to other guys even if we weren’t in a relationship… he kinda spazzed out on this convo and said if I talked to other guys then to leave him alone ( this was about 1 mo into us talking).
He also said he needed me to get on birth control because he had no interest in using condoms( which I did, dumb I know).
And finally we’ve been talking for about 3 months and we only met up once , he cancelled on me last minute when he was passing by my place TWICE, has never took me on a date and never made any direct effort to drive the 1.5 hours to see me…
We have only been talking for like 3 months but it moved fast initially and the arguments we have been in lately made things kind of slow down in terms of relationship advancements so I’m not 100% blaming him for not taking me on a date yet….
I know he works a lot and I understand that but 
Because of his inconsistency with communication, we’ve argued a lot and I’ve been called crazy multiple times but I feel like I’m being gaslighted. He says he’s mine, he wants us to work and is so interested in me but when I  try to get him to communicate at least once a day he’ll say I need to chill bc we aren’t even together yet…
This is all kind of sketchy to me.

I’m (26F) pretty new to dating after a LTR broke down earlier in the year, it was a very unexpected break up for me. 

Back in September I met someone on Tinder (25M) who I just clicked with. All that typical kind of stuff, non-stop messaging, going on dates, enjoying getting to know each other thing that felt amazing. I thought I was doing it all right, being open about my past (was cheated on by a previous partner), how I was feeling at all stages and where my head was at, I was also standing my own ground and saying what I felt comfortable with for the first time really in a relationship. This guy seemed to take it all in his stride, pushed for us to get serious, really had me trusting him and thinking we were going somewhere. He seemed to have his life pretty together and this is important to me (I’m a homeowner, career focused and looking for someone in a similar place). He even paid for us to go away for a night together. He was proper boyfriend material. 

Anyways, I found out about 2 weeks ago he was two-timing, and there was possibly a third woman as well. I was shocked and disappointed but I’m better off without that. But now, I’m totally at a loss of how to ever be vulnerable with a man again, like how do you ever trust people again after that? Especially after it took me a lot of courage to be open and honest with this guy after my last two serious relationships ended in me being very hurt. 

Guess I’m scared I’m gonna end up that woman who never finds anyone because they’re shut off and cold. I totally understand that now, but I want to find someone eventually to share my life with. How did you all deal with trust issues and come out the better for bad experiences?

The question is then either: is that okay, or how should I interpret what they did or said?

First off, abuse of any kind is never okay, and anyone who abuses someone that they’re supposed to love isn’t worthy of that relationship. If this sub can help someone with a kind and loving reality check that gets them out of a bad or dangerous situation, that’s wonderful. 

If your partner is doing something that you don’t like, the simple answer is almost always that you must communicate with them and decide together whether they stop doing that, or you learn to tolerate it in the name of love (which has been shown to happen in many successful and happy relationships), or you amicably split up. 

Same goes for communications issues. What if my love interest doesn’t text me back in three days or three weeks? Well, you have to ask them. Make the implicit explicit. If your relationship (or you) can’t handle something like “hey, I kind of feel like you’re not that interested in talking to me or spending time together when I don’t hear from you for days” then you’re probably not in a good place for a relationship. 

I feel like many come to this sub looking for validation that they or their SO is or isn’t following a set of rules. There are essentially no rules. It’d be nice if we all conformed to protocols that were well understood and documented. We’d know when to ask that cute girl out at the store. We’d know when the cute guy really wanted our number or whatever. The content and timing of a text or a kiss wouldn’t be mysterious. That certainty doesn’t exist. We have, at best, some imperfect notions from our own culture and family. Those are almost always misaligned with others’ backgrounds.

I’m a 21 y/o guy who goes to a university for nursing school. Through this program I have met many cool people that I can call my friends! I have a study group now that consists of 3 other girls. This is just because this program consists of 90% woman. I will give the three girls names: Emily, Arabella, and Kaitlyn. To give a background, I am good friends with all of these girls. We’re all close now as we have been going through the hardships of nursing school together, so we see each other and study together almost everyday. We all are friends so we also hangout outside of school too. We go to the lake together, stay at the lake house on the weekend sometimes, and go out and hangout together. Moving forward, Emily has a boyfriend of 5 years. Kaitlyn has a husband. Im good friends with her husband as I was a groomsman in his wedding. Arabella has a boyfriend of one year. I like Arabella. She’s super sweet, she’s gorgeous, smart, and fun to be around. The problem is that she’s got a  boyfriend and I want to respect that. Well I know the two other girls boyfriends’ and I see them often. However, Ive only seen Arabella’s boyfriend around a few times which is weird because that means they don’t see each other that much. He also goes to the same college as us and plays golf and spends a lot of his time hunting and hanging w his friends (which is good). When Arabella talks about him it’s never bad or anything so I don’t reckon they have serious relationship troubles. The problem is that she can be flirty with me. And to be honest I agg it on because I like her. Now she’s not flirty to the point where it’s cheating or anything. She could just think of us as really good friends. BUT we went on a road trip together for a week. It was all three of the girls. kaitlyn and Emily brought their men but arabella didn’t bring hers. He was supposedly busy and also i was thinking he doesn’t really know us so he may feel a bit awkward to come too. Well anyways, we all had a good time. It was cold outside and it was snowing so I got a hot chocolate from a nearby shop. She didn’t get any but I said that could could have as much as she wants of mine. So we shared the hot cocoa. Nothing serious. It was just two friends sharing some hot chocolate when it’s cold outside. The car ride back is what confused me. We all took the van back. Arabella and I sat in the very back together. It wasn’t intentional or anything to sit together. it wasn’t the most comfortable in the back but we actually got some time to talk to each other alone (sort of). I mean there was five other people in the car but i feel like we don’t get the chance often to just talk amongst ourselves because we’re always together as a group. So we connected a little bit. Anyways, we’re in the very back of a van that has three rows. We’re talking every once in a while. We may joke with each other some. Idk why we did this but we showed each other who we Snapchat and explained who they are and why we snap them lol. We later watched the titanic on her laptop and shared her AirPods. Thennn when we got tired and tried to find a comfy spot to sleep. It was hard because we were in the back of the van. But we improvised lol. We would take turns where i would sit by the window sitting straight up like how you’d normally sit in a car. She then laid her head on my lap with a pillow with her legs reaching out to the other half of the seat that no one was on. Then we’d switch off where I was the one laying down (with my head on her lap). Also, while we were watching titanic I had a pillow and i was trying to find a good spot to put it for my own comfort and she said I could lay it on her upper arm. So then I rested my head on her while watching titanic for a bit. We also Snapchat. Usually everyday or every other day. Sometimes they’re boring conversations or just streaks. Sometimes they’re not. For example, she likes the marvel movies. I haven’t watched a lot of them so I said that we should watch Dr strange together. I told her to come over and watch it. She said that when she gets back in town that she will. The problem is that she has a boyfriend so I don’t know that I’d actually let her come over tbh. She’s a good girl. She’s never had sex or anything either so it’s not like she wants to come over to just do that. She wants to wait for marriage. It just confuses me because usually a really pretty girl like this would reject you if she has a boyfriend with no problem. However she is not. Truthfully, her boyfriend is a lot less attractive then her. He still seems like a nice guy though so it’s not like that matters. Also, he’s not around that much. I’m wondering if she likes me or if it’s more that I’m a fun cute guy to her that she can sort of platonically flirt with while her boyfriend is away to fill some sort of need for her. The truth is that I don’t want to break them up so she could be with me because what if she ended up doing the same thing with me?? Best case scenario is that she simply didn’t want to be with him anymore and later on Arabella and I got closer and then one day dated. I just don’t understand how she feels truthfully. It seems like she’s interested but she may just like the attention. Also she could possibly just be a flirty girl. Idk. I’m here for all of the advice. What do you think?🤍 also, please know that my intention isn’t to hurt anyone which is why I am asking for advice. I just am around her often and it is hard to be around her without catching feelings, especially when she’s a little flirty with me, so I’ve gotta do something.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141971,public,self,Does she like me even though she has a boyfriend?

I am not a woman who can't speak my mind - I have a voice and I know how to use it - but this happened so fast I didn't have time to even react! He was wearing so much cologne I can still taste it after a peck and a 3 hour time elapse! Men (and women), this isn't what women (and men) want! I don't need, nor want, a kiss on the first meet!

He had the food he liked in his bio which I liked as well so I messaged him about it. He then invited me to meet up that night. Which was a bit worrisome, I just met this guy and I know nothing about him. Even meeting up in an open place is a bit scary. (This is partly anxiety and just being safe)

So eventually he agrees to play some Minecraft and video chat. Which it went great, it melted all my anxieties away. This was when he mentioned he doesn’t really use social media and doesn’t really like to text much, he would rather be with someone irl. Which I like! I don’t use socially media as much as the average 19 year old, but I do like texting People through the day! It makes me feel as if I’m apart of it. He’s been pretty good at replying, just taking about him day or plans and well as mine.

I normally get a big sad when people don’t reply very fast, and I feel a bit discouraged. Because I try to reply as soon as I see the message (I definitely an going to work on this insecurity) 

We had our first date yesterday, and I think it went pretty well, we were both tired thought, I just got back from a trip and he’s been busy with family and friends. When we left he said he wanted to grab dinner sometime soon and we hugged.

Afterwards I messaged home saying I had a good time and told him when I was able to meet for dinner. He said he had a nice time as well and that any of the dates I mentioned would work. I told him to just let me know what works best for him.

It’s been a few hours and we haven’t message since. To me this feels like he d didn’t have a good time, 

would he say he wanted to get dinner and hug me if it didn’t go well?

How can I feel more secure when I don’t get a text back for a few hours?

At some point during the date again, he tried to pull me and kiss me again which I resisted and he said ""ah at the end?"" And I didn't really respond. Then at the end, I went to kiss him on the cheek and he forcefully pulled my lips again. I pushed him away and he said ""don't you want to kiss me?"" And I said I don't like to rush things.

I started talking to this guy a few weeks ago (on bumble 😆) and we definitely have a lot of common interests.. it’s all small talk right now but he seems cool. I definitely would like to continue getting to know him. 

He messaged me on bumble right before the holidays and must have noticed that I’m out of town. He messaged me this: 

“So you’re in NY, how long till your back in SC?  And are you having fun up there?” 

There’s more texts but that was his latest message to me and it got me thinking if he was starting to gain interest and he’s working on asking me on a date…? Or he’s just making small talk..? 

I messaged him back and I’m not sure if I’m sounding interested in him especially when I mentioned my trip/length. 

“I’m so jealous. How much time did you spend in Aspen and Breckenridge? That must be really difficult for you but I’m glad you can still enjoy your hobbies! I agree with that justification lol
(We are both into snowboarding and he told me he might have an issue w/his knee.. that’s why I said all that) 

And this was my response to his NY text:

I didn’t have any romantic feelings left for him so I was actually able to have casual sex with him quite easy. 
He has now admitted 3 seperate times he has feelings for me, he can’t stop thinking about me and he wants to commit to our relationship. 2/3 of those times I felt I wasn’t ready and told him.

The 3rd time he admitted he liked me was more recent and I told him I needed time to develop my romantic feelings for him again. We hung out a couple days ago and I’ve found I felt a spark of that come back so now I want to give this a chance but I think because I didn’t mention anything I may have ruined it?
