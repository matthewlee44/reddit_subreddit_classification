I’ve seen women do it, be never heard of any of my guy friends searching for anything other than serious or causal relationships. 

A little background, I’m a 37 year old guy with no kids and a professional career that’s actually wanting to get married and start a family. What I mean by this is I’m not looking to just marry the next person I meet after three dates, but rather I’m going into the dating pool looking for my future wife (especially since I have a habit of attracting young 21-27ish party girls, a fact that befuddles my friends and I as I don’t hang out with them, have shared common interest, or actively engage with younger girls in my social circles). And most importantly, I’m not trying to just shack up or have a g/f for the next 5-6 years to ease any commitment nerves like many of my friends. I’m genuinely ready for a partner in life. 

Where I grew up (down south) it’s not uncommon for women to come out of HS ready for marriage and kids, but here outside the south, in the big cities the women are way more independent, educated, and less needy for a husband. Which I dig but seems to make them more skittish like they think you want to tie them down or something.

While marriage and a family is something I want, I’m worried it may scare off any potential matches that just assume if a guys ready for marriage that he has weird intentions like he’s just trying to marry anyone and not actually putting in the effort to date and get to know each other first. 

I absolutely want to date, have meaningful and tough conversations, share my dreams and goals with someone, and see if we’re a good match. I just don’t want to get locked into a 5 year “dating” scenario or keep coming across women that aren’t looking for marriage and kids like me.

Looking for outside perspective on this situation with a man I’ve been dating the last 6 months. Due to lockdown and work commitments we actually met twice for coffee dates earlier in the year and decided to keep in touch and did some phone calls while one of us had work commitments away. We got on well and recently as we are both in the same place - we have met up a handful of times and began properly dating and had become intimate the last few weeks. 

We’ve been taking it slow and both been fine about the pace so far. Both of us were just trying to get to know each other and we spoke briefly about future plans to go on a trip away. 
I’ve let him take the lead as it’s my personal way of knowing that he is committed to the connection. I always reciprocate and put in effort but I feel it’s been him asking to see me etc mostly. 
Recently we’ve both been ill and had a bit of time apart due to this. 
We went on a date at the weekend after around a week apart and things turned sour. 
I began to suspect he was slower at replying to my messages and it’s just a change from what I’ve experienced with him. He’s usually very reliable and responsive and I kinda got the impression naturally from his effort I was a priority. During his time off work sick I just felt this change and may be paranoid but I had a feeling he may be talking to someone else. 
We went on a date after this and he was so different. He wasn’t initiating any touch which is unusual and he seemed generally a bit bored on the date. I asked him what was wrong and eventually he came out with that he wasn’t sure it was working out but initially he maintained he was keeping his distance after me being off sick and didn’t want to catch anything. 
I was shocked because there had been no indication of this at all. I tried to be gracious about it but I explained that it’s a shock and more hurtful that I had to poke and and prod to get this. 
He then went on to explain about him being emotionally unavailable due to family issues etc. The thing is it just felt like he couldn’t get out quick enough. It wasn’t up for discussion and I felt very like he was in a bit of a rush. 

Years ago at university, I had a situation that rings similar. I was dating a guy who out of the blue did this and it turned out he was dating someone else in my course and wasn’t honest . He also couldn’t seem to get out quick enough.

Just wondering if anyone can provide an outsiders view to this. I’m doing ok and I don’t want someone in my life who doesn’t want to be there but it’s all very upsetting and has left me feeling more closed off.

I casually dated a girl for about 1-2 months that I fell hard for, and just realized I may have fucked it up due to my own emotional immaturity/insecurities. She kind of ghosted me, but I think it may have been because I was an asshole rather than her losing interest/seeing someone else.

The story:

Went on an incredible first date with this girl I used to go to school with. We hung out for 7 hours (planned on like 1-2), incredible spark, no awkward silences. A couple days later I set up a second date, a real one at this outdoor movie theater since she's really into indie film. It ended up raining that day, so she invited me over to her house to watch a movie instead (I have roommates so her place is better). Had sex, spent the night, cuddled and pillow-talked for hours, and in the morning she texts me literally 1 minute after I leave and we text for most of the day.

On the first date I had mentioned that I was going to have to go to Paris for 2 weeks or so at some point way later in the summer to do some work move my stuff out of my apartment there (not worth explaining why). The morning after I left her house after staying over, I get notice that I'll actually be leaving for Paris in 3 days, for an indeterminate length of time (1-2 months). I'm a bit shellshocked, and that night after texting with her all day I tell her that I really enjoyed our time together but I have to go to Paris, and I'll be back in 1-2 months. I don't mention seeing her again before I leave. She takes a while to respond to this text after responding quickly all day, and says she wants to see me before I leave. I set up a date with her for the day before I leave (to get drinks at this cute bar by her house). She cancels last minute, saying she's really sorry but she had to take care of an emergency repair at her apartment. I'm a bit pissed and don't respond to this last text. The next morning she sends a longer text saying she's really sorry and she really likes spending time with me and doesn't want me to hate her for cancelling. I text her back that it's OK, I really like spending time with her too, and that she should keep in touch while I'm in Paris, and that I'll see her when I'm back. She doesn't respond to this text, and being the idiot I am, I feel as though she lost interest and don't contact her at all while I'm in Paris, she doesn't contact me either.

While I was gone, I was lonely so I stalked her twitter a little bit (she doesn't know I know her username). I find out two important things from some of her past tweets:

1. She has abandonment issues that she's working on in therapy – so me leaving for Paris without notice probably really threw her for a loop
2. She was on her period the night she cancelled on me, and has some insecurities around sex and her period – so this could explain the cancellation

I end up only being in Paris for 3 weeks. During this time I somehow get it into my head that this girl doesn't want a relationship with me, and only something casual (because she didn't keep in contact while I was away). Regardless, I'm head over heels for this girl so I'm just trying to take what I can get at this point and try not to be too clingy. From this point on, I don't ask her out on any proper dates, only to go over to her house, hang out/smoke some weed, and watch a movie (which is what we did the last time she invited me over after our date was rained out). I text her a few days after I get back, saying we should hang out. We do – smoke some weed, watch a movie, have sex, cuddle and pillow talk for hours, and I leave in the morning after a great night. I text her later that day that I had a great night and want to see her again, she says the same. I leave it at that and neither of us text for a few days. I ask her to hang out again, she says yes, a couple hours before she asks what I want to do. I say let's smoke on your roof and watch the sunset. We do that, have sex, cuddle and pillow-talk for hours, and I leave in the morning. She texts me a meme a minute after I leave in the morning, and I respond with ""lmfaoooo"", a bit of a conversation ender...and we don't text after that for a few days. I then ask her how the new season of a show she'd told me about had been (""really good! not as good as the first season though!"") and then ask her to hang out and watch it.

No response. For 3 weeks. As she's posting stories of herself out with her friends on instagram and snapchat. So clearly I think I got ghosted, feel like shit about myself for a while and have no idea why it happened.

A few days ago I'm walking around downtown (Boston) and I get a text from her saying ""I think I just saw you on \[redacted\] street"". We catch up and banter for a bit over text, when I say to her ""so what's up?"" (basically meaning ""why did you ghost me"")? She says she's been having some rough mental health problems and said ""that's why I've been distant"". Me, still hurting from being ghosted, kind of blows her off. I say that I can't talk right now since I'm out with friends, but that she's a really sweet girl and it'll all work out for her...but that we should definitely hang out soon. She responds that ""yeah we should hang out soon"". I don't respond to that text, and two days later I text her back ""what are you doing tomorrow night?""

No response.

I really let that one get away. Do you think I might be right that she stopped responding since I was being an asshole rather than her losing interest in me? Should I text her again and apologize?

I thought about it from her perspective, and if she had left me for Paris like that, came back and stopped asking me on real dates, stopped texting as much, and then after telling her about my mental health issues I blew them off and basically said ""wanna have sex?"", I would probably be a bit pissed/confused too. Maybe she ghosted me mid-conversation the first time because she was hoping I'd say something more than ""lets hang out and watch \[redacted\]"".

Fuck.

After the first, we were so totally into each other. He asked to meet up again in the same weekend- I stupidly went and it was a sort of an awkward 2nd date. Was missing the spark of the first. Should I be running for the hills because of these things?:

1. Constantly texting me good morning and good night, encourages me to text him while he’s at work. And then we’ve had multiple night texting conversations. 
2. Before he even met me, sent me this long answer to why he swiped right on my dating profile. Told me I looked like I have a “child-like wonder” and that I remind him of Robin Williams- always trying to make others happy but I’m not myself. Keep in mind this is based off a texting convo and my dating app profile.
3. Already saying negative things about some family, like how he can’t stand his younger brother’s wife and she’s “testing his patience.” When I asked why, he said he’d give an example later.
4. Not that this is a huge dealbreaker, but he is a Joe Rogan fan because he recently went to a show. Seemed very reluctant to mention as well, because he seemed to think this would turn me off (it kind of has).
5. His profile said he is Christian, moderate… which, after thinking about longer, are not really my views. I am an agnostic liberal. But we’ve never talked about these things.
6. When I asked if my personality matched what he thought after meeting, he said pretty much but that I was more shy than he previously thought.
7. He deleted his dating app profile after a week of talking to me. He didn’t mention this and I haven’t asked, but I can see it on my end.
8. Found a way to slyly ask if I’m open to hooking up when he comes over. Which led me to stupidly tell him I’m a virgin, and I would have more questions before I could really respond to that- he was quick to tell me that was definitely not a dealbreaker after I asked him if it was.
9. Wants to meet up way more frequently than I do and seems bummed I can’t hang out as much.
10. Already talking about how our Sundays would look together after asking me what my typical Sunday is.

I agreed for him to come over tomorrow but already, I am going to switch it up so that we meet somewhere else. If I even want to see him- because I’m really having doubts.

I got ready and at 10pm he told me their colleagues organized a goodbye party for him (he is supposed to leave the job). He didn't apologize nor rescheduled. He also hid his IG stories from me just to make them visibile after 24hrs.
This was the 2nd time he stood me up and I snapped - I asked if he was playing with me and that it was unfair for me.
He ghosted me.

Today, a week later from the fact, I reached out to make amends - he disrespected me but I wanted to own up to my reaction. He just said ""I accept your apologies"" and didn't say anything else. I thanked him and that's all.

I feel like he stringed me along since the start, I now know he didn't care and he wasn't really interested. I got mad because I didn't deserve to be treated like that. 
He made me feel like I was imagining everything and my reaction was inappropriate.

I was in my other aunts house who overheard everything and after i gave her a brief explanation, my other aunt agreed that is not how things work and even joked how i had a mother in law without the wife.

So I have met this girl thru my mother. One of her coworker wanted me to meet her daughter because she didn’t know anyone in my city since she was here for couple months working remotely before her employer wanted back in office ( she lives in a different city). Now she moves around a lot so she wasn’t always in town ( she has many friends around different cities so she would visit them every other weekend), and in fact we went out a total of 4 times.

Her mother would joke around with my mother saying that we would be a good match etc. Let’s say the both of our mothers set us up somehow or would like to see us together potentially. 

During our hangouts we had a lot of fun, I really like her personality etc. We would also text quite often while she was in town even when we couldn’t go out etc. She would ask me a lot of question and keep conversation going. Now every relationship needs to start from somewhere at some point. Clearly we had to get to know each other so honestly I didn’t expect anything more than a friendship to start with.

When we went out she was nice and responsive and asked me a lot of questions etc. But Some of her behavior or questions were confusing to me. We shared our food all the time( literally she would taste my ice cream or wanted a slice of pizza etc) , she took a pic of me without me knowing about it and we took pictures together etc. She wanted to know if I used online dating ( and we talked about our bad experiences etc), she copied some of my behavior sometime, made promises of traveling together next year and told me to come and see her when she moves back to her city etc. Personally all of this is not a sign that she could like me more than a friend, but some of her behavior was more than just a normal friend would do. 


Now to the part where I messed it up. Last time we went out we drank quite a bit so both of us were not in perfect condition. We started to hold hands at the table ( I made the move but she didn’t pull her hand out of the way ), and we walked with our arms tucked on the way back to the car ( I made the move again but she didn’t reject or move the arm out of the way ). When we were about to say goodbye, I don’t know why she wanted me to kiss her pinky ( I think sort of a promise to see ourselves again even if she was about to move) and I said NO, but can I kiss you instead ( I think the alcohol kicked in there), and she said no. It was awkward afterwards but we still hugged, and she texted me after she got back home and also the following morning. 

I think the situation was wrong for many reasons,and it felt rushed to make a move like this ( too soon), but I also didn’t believe I had many more opportunities ( who knows when I am gonna see her again, probably in a month or two), so I tried and failed miserably. How do I go from here? I don’t know if am in the friend zone already or it was too soon?

I see all the stress people go through in relationships if it turns bad, the hold that love and sexual attraction has on people had always been ridiculous to me. People will do anything for love nowadays and even risk humiliation only to get rejected. Is it even worth it at that point? Why should someone go through that just for the chance they might experience love? It never made sense to me and probably never will. Ever since I've stopped caring about my relationship status or how ""lonely"" I am my head has been much more clear.

Talking about our lives, discussions on random things, sharing of memes, songs, movies, shows, and books are the usual conversation points. In the past few months, we have come really close to each other.

I know that I feel strongly for him and want to ask him out. But after talking to my friends and overthinking the whole thing on my own, I don't know what to do. Should I tell him?

I've been dating since the 6th grade, my only irl relationship was with a girl that got bullied for multiple reasons yet I still felt something for her. I made a love poem since I wasn't good expressing my feelings out loud, she said yes the day I gave it to her, and by months time I left her through text because I found out she didn't care about me. After that I've been dating online exclusively—not by choice as I've had crushes on quite a few women at school and they never felt the same way—and all those relationships were horrible. 

The only good relationship I had was with a boy, the only boy I've dated in my life and that only ended because I felt an attraction just towards women, and another girl that ended because I eventually felt something for my other girl friend. I had the worst relationship ever in 2019 with a girl that I thought was the one and in a year that was supposed to be the year everything in my life changed.. neither of those turned out to be true. 

After another short relationship (2 weeks) after that, I took a 2 year break from relationships, in that time I liked someone for 6 months and nothing came from that either, constant arguing that I didn't initiate (and she even admitted and apologized for this later on so I'm not pretending I did nothing wrong or anything like that), and then about 2 months ago I dated someone who apparently had liked me for a while, also said they were moving here soon, thought I had finally found the one and this was the first girl in a while that came to me and I didn't find on my own—but then they left a month later because they had been dealing with paranoia and it got worse. Of course that's not a problem, it was good while it lasted and we still talk now, but it was still frustrating to finally take time off and have my next relationship end so soon—even more frustrating that I saw a tweet from them hoping that they hope a certain someone will like them even though they just left me.

Long story short, my history with relationships just is downright awful, and I don't know what more I can do. Every single relationship I've had, with the exception of the 2 good ones that I said ended because of my sexuality or just feeling something for someone else, hasn't been my fault. I've been cheated on, lead on, played with, lied to, etc. On top of that, I just have the worst time trying to even find people talking to. I have one irl friend who doesn't live in the city anymore, the rest are online. For multiple reasons I'm not able to meet people in the outside world atm, but even when I was in school I was treated like shit, and specifically with the girls I did like they didn't like me back—the only one who did, well, I already said how that disaster went.

I'm only 19, sure I have a lot of time to find the one, but it's still frustrating. I've tried dating apps, tried messaging people on social media, obviously when I was in school or able to go outside I had crushes on people and met girls, nothing is working and it upsets me. I may not have a lot of self-esteem but I know I'm an amazing person. If I could finally find the one and finally find a relationship that lasts more than 6 months (my longest was 5 and most others range from a couple of weeks to 1-2 months) I know it'll be amazing. Yet I still haven't found it, and I've lost faith that I ever will because of my current and past luck, not just with finding a girlfriend but with making new friends too—I just made a friend months ago that I thought would be there long term with how we talked, and they've already stopped talking to me but still post everyday. It just makes me feel even worse about myself, I already have low self-esteem, I'm a trans woman and not on estrogen which isn't helping my chances, I just don't know what to do. 

I'm sure people will suggest to take a break, and not that I don't think that's not a smart thing, I did take one already (more so because I gave up on relationships at that point and not because I thought it was something I needed), but I just really would like a relationship. I can't even meet girls, so I just want to know how to expand my reach if that's even possible, because I've done everything imo. I'm just really sad about this.

A few months back  I underwent a major surgery for a tumour and I disappeared from social media. An old high-school friend reached out to me and we talked every week. Last month he asked me out and he went on our first date on Friday. We held hands and kissed a lot. 


We then spent the whole weekend together at a hotel. All I can say is that we clicked from the moment we met. I wasn't afraid of showing him affection and being intimate with him. He's patient and very caring. We were  open about our likes, dislikes, sex and just our lives in general. We solved our misunderstandings peacefully, we split dinner bills and we both tried to learn each other's hobbies.

Every guy wants to pick up a model. After all, models are some of the most attractive women on planet earth. But many are afraid to do so because these kinds of women are “out of their league” to many guys. Hopefully this post shows guys that models are just like other girls; they are human just like all of us.

This girl was easily one of the most attractive girls I have ever approached and number closed.

Around early March or so I was out doing daygame around downtown Chicago. I had approached a few girls at this point but all of them were polite rejections. While I was on Michigan Ave I see this extremely attractive girl standing outside of a store with her mom. Of course, I immediately approach her and said to her that she looked interesting and I had to say hi to her. She immediately responds positively and introduces herself. She was giving me solid eye contact, asking me questions, etc. We start talking about interesting topics such as fashion and school. She tells me she’s a model (I could kind of tell given her fashion sense) and I tell her she definitely has the look for it. She bursts into laughter. She told me she from Cuba visiting Chicago that weekend to see her brother. Towards the end of the conversation I ask her out for coffee and she says yes and asks me for my number. I tell her to give me her number though as giving her mine would more likely lead to a flake. We then set up plans and parted ways. We then went on a date the next day, and it was awesome.

MORAL OF THE STORY:

TREAT ATTRACTIVE WOMEN LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE: A lot of guys try to impress these kinds of women by bragging about how cool their life is, how cool of a guy they are, etc. Really all you need to do is just treat them like a normal human being, like they’re on the same level as you. Attractive women are less likely to get approached in a normal way, so doing so will make you stand out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,946312,public,self,How I picked up a professional model,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1d1sw/how_i_picked_up_a_professional_model/,all_ads,6,,,

Anyway, fast forward to now. I work at a completely different company and we’ve texted randomly to keep in touch, but never saw each other again. Now we matched on bumble! I’m still interested in him, but wondering if he just matched with me because we know each other and wants to see what I’ll do? Or if he is actually interested? I mean he’s had my number this whole time, and he’s known I switched companies?! I messaged him “hey I think I know you 😉” and he waited to message me back until he had like 30 mins left.

Their primary issue is due to not understanding the difference between communicating information and communicating emotions.

Attraction (either generic or romantic) is not created by what you logically say but instead by what you emotionally convey.

Some of the most important information, such as if a person seems honest and trustworthy, is primarily communicated via the emotions felt during the interaction.

The same is true about attractive traits such as confidence and high self-esteem.

**You cannot logically convince someone to like you**.

In addition, technical people often get stuck in their own heads and over analyze every little thing in an interaction.

The act of trying to process and interpret every piece of information takes you out of the present moment, making it even more difficult to communicate authentically on an emotional level.

While we all know that attraction is a very complex combination of many different factors, there is a thing I notice throuout my dates and relationship. Namely that's very big Part of me being attracted to a person is how much they like me. Which sounds kinda weird ""i am attracted to persons whom feel attraction towards me"". The 'special' this is that it occurs to me that it plays a very large role in my attraction building. 

But I think there are a few interesting things to talk about here :
* **Do you know/experience this?**
* is it just the special attention that makes you like the person more and also find them more attractive?
* Sadly if I think about it rational it's kinda... Well worying because I could see the potential ""Insecurity"" ""validation seeking"" psychical analytic side. I do not rly think I am insecure but I would love to get your opinion of this topic.

An example of how this could manifest is for example that if I (m/19) see a girl that I am not especially attracted to or even notice things that I do not rly like or find unattractive like wearing to much makeup (to much for me/my attraction, wear as much as you want ❤️). But then somewhen this girl aproaches me or takes to me in a way that I notice her being interested or attracted to me and I suddenly ""response"" (in an emotionalsense not saying it) by being attracted to her too or at least more that bevore, even to a degree that I would go:tbh I dont care about the makeup.

Maybe I am just weird, would love to hear your pov.

27 y/o active military dude, fell for a former Marine. She rocks my fuckin' socks, stole my heart while on my leave in Ohio during the month I was there to see my family. Mind you I'm in Canada's Army, but am a dual-citizen of both the U.S. and Canada. Been serving on 3 years. Born/raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Mom, Dad, and brother are all in Ohio, near where I met this woman.

Plan:
Passionate, dedicated dude set on continuing my career in a similar position in the U.S. to not only pursue happiness in my own life, but to fulfill my love interest. 

Conflict:
Seems like a stretch to start once more in the country I built myself on, leaving my life I started here in Canada. I know that from my experience in both countries, the U.S. is where I will always have a home and know that I am free, more so than anywhere else. I only have the opportunity I'm leaving here, which is to try out for a rather cool position in a special place within the army. The Marine isn't keen on coming to Canada, so I am considering my options in meeting halfway in a satisfying compromise.
