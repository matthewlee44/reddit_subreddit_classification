2,pjs2qt,1631036870,Can we stop pretending like appearance isn’t by far the most important factor in dating?,"Like honestly. If we are all genuine about this we all know it’s true.

Now this isn’t to say that personality and all that other shit isn’t important. You of course can’t keep a girlfriend with just a pretty face, but you can’t even get a girlfriend without said pretty face.

Good looking assholes get laid, find short term girlfriends, get dates, get the interest of multiple women at a time easily.

Ugly guy with a heart of gold? Despite being objectively better to be around and more than likely a better partner, he will struggle so much to get a single date.

Now I’m not claiming to be said ugly guy with a heart of gold, but I’m not terrible. I’m unfortunately the “I love you, you’re just like a brother to me guy” and “I wish I could find a boyfriend like you” and even worse “You are going to make some girl super happy one day, when you find one that’ll overlook your appearance”. Girls love me as a person, they just find me unattractive.

Fucking sucks man. It’s heartbreaking. I do my best with the shitshow I was given. I try to dress well, I groom and maintain myself obsessively, I workout until I’m nauseous 4 times a week. Trust me it helps, I feel a lot more confident and I’ve met a lot of people after I started going to the gym and trying to make myself look as best as possible, but like after now 3 years and still trying with girls I have no luck. 

If I was a guy that was good looking and an asshole I would still at least get laid which is miles beyond anything I’ve done. Like in 21 and I haven’t even gone on a single date which is kinda pathetic.

So can we just stop.

I get it. It’s nice to hear that me being ugly isn’t the cause of my failures with women, but in most of my cases at least it has been. It’s just not realistic to tell a person, “Your looks aren’t holding you back at all, it’s your personality” because (even if their personality does need serious working on, which admittedly we all can work on improving ourselves on the inside) it’s mostly his appearance.

P.S. I know a lot of people are going to jump to tell me that I’m desperate or that I hate women or some other BS to explain why I’m single, I’m not. This is also a problem I have with this sub, if a guy is frustrated he’s automatically whiny, low self esteem and a misogynist.

When he broke up with me a month ago, I was absolutely devastated and shellshocked. I was quick to blame him for everything that had transpired over the course of our time together, needing to find the worst parts of him to justify how he could make such a harsh decision when I loved him so dearly.

(I am not interested in pursuing anyone new atm).

But, after some self-reflection, I have begun to notice there was a lot of truth to his words when he pointed to the toxic patterns I exhibited during our relationship that I wasn't even aware of. I have an anxious attachment style, and ADHD, so I often overthink/spiral like it's an olympic sport. I allowed myself to hyper focus on my own insecurities and I would project them onto him in the form of rigid expectations, discounting his own boundaries and perspectives on things. I was so consumed by the fear that he wasn't taking me seriously (according to my own checklist of specific gestures that would prove to me he wanted to be with me) then would react poorly when he didn't adhere to every one of my expectation. Naturally, this placed a ton of pressure on him to go beyond his own boundaries to soothe my anxieties and would tire him out with the constant need for reassurance. I know partners should be supportive, but I placed too much responsibility on him being my source of happiness, instead of being happy myself exempt from placing that burden on him. He had his own fair reasons for doing things, and I should've respected that more. I should've had as much faith in his good intentions as he did for mine....

With all this being said, many may think I am being foolish to think it would be a good idea to try again, or that this relationship has been too damaged to reassess things

However- I have a strong belief that I know what I need to work and that I can be the improved, wholly happy human being/partner that he deserves and that I always intended to be for him. There's so much left we can do, I know we can be happier than ever. **He said that if I took the time to focus on myself and my own happiness and worked on my problems (he'd do the same), that he'd be more than open to consider getting back together.** I don't want to put a timeline on things, but I want to reach out when I feel ready. Any advice for how I can go about this? Much appreciated xo

6,pjsbto,1631037650,Asking a guy I rejected for his friend’s number?,"An outgoing guy in my building was being friendly and offered me some food as I walked by the grill area. We got to talking, nothing flirty, and he asked for my number which I gave him bc it seemed harmless. I don’t find him attractive but am open to getting to know people and making new friends. He then texted me a cheesy pickup line about how he had fallen for me which was awkward and I never replied. I’ve since then seen him around at the gym and the pool and we’ll talk in a friendly way so nothing too awk and he’s older anyways so I’m sure no hard feelings. The other day, I saw him and a friend at the pool. After talking to him his friend came up and started talking me up for a bit - definitely seemed a bit flirty. I actually thought he was kind of cute and interesting enough to get to know more but for some reason I didn’t ask for his info before they left! So my question here is: is it okay if I ask the first guy for his friend’s IG or number? I didn’t outright reject the guy and do feel bad for ignoring his pickup line, but it seems like it shouldn’t be a big deal since it was such a casual interaction and there was never a pretense of dating like there would be if I had met him through an online dating app. Curious to hear opinions on this!

7,pjsdl0,1631037795,What is going on?,"Hi Reddit. I am hoping to get an objective, outsider perspective on my current situation.

I (M23) work with a part time colleague (F24). She is exactly my type, emotionally and physically. Anyway, a few weeks ago she was aligned to my team for two days. During the day, everyone was saying that we should both go out, which we both laughed off. During the day I asked for her employee number for a document, to which she gave light flirting, ""My employee number or my actual number"". I took her home the second evening and asked for her number. She gave me the task of finding her on social media, again with light teasing. I did find her and we did start speaking.

Her replies where slow, I mean really slow. Eventually I got her number. For three weeks, she went on holiday to a different part of the country. I got bored of the long delays and decided to just delete her of Snapchat, but did retain her number.

After 4 weeks of not speaking, she text me out of the blue. She asked for some security codes for the building. I thought this was pretty random as she has worked there three year. I asked her if she wanted to get a catch up drink, but stated she was in work the following day or she would have. The next day, I asked her if she was available early week. She stated Monday. I asked her if she wanted to get a meal to which she stated she would like to.

Yesterday, we went for the meal and the conversation was great. Two and a half hours in the restaurant. We spoke about past experiences with dating (to which she has had no good ones!). She told me the reason for being delayed was because a co-worker told her not to give everything away too fast (SO I ASSUME SHE HAS TOLD THIS CO-WORKER SHE LIKES ME?) I took her home and she was in no rush to get out of my car. I asked her if we would go on a other date, to which she teased ""if you are lucky"". We texted a little later night. This morning she thanked me again for the meal. I told her she was welcome and we can do it again if she likes. This was almost 10 hours ago, and I have had no reply.

8,pjsln5,1631038471,"I need help, I'm lost with this girl","Hello everyone,  

Small overview of my situation: I went abroad to study this semester, I arrived less than a week ago. Once there, I met a student on the bus that goes to the same school as me and who comes from the same city in my home country. The feeling goes well, we spend the 2 hours of the bus together to discuss, very good feeling  

The next two days, we eat together, we visit the campus, we walk, we visit the city. Once again the feeling is going very well, a bond is created little by little, laughs, eyes contacts, I gradually install physical contacts. She responds quickly to messages, reminds me of herself, sends photos on private jokes, suggests and accepts that we see each other, etc.  In short, I really appreciate this girl, even more for her personality than for her physique.  

So it's been a few days that I know her, we start to approach more personal themes, our families etc but I have the impression of having lost foot. I went to a party last night, where I had too much drink, and I sent her some voice messages, like ""tomorrow noon we can eat together that would make me pleased"", she tells me that she will keep me updated the next day etc and I ended up with the worst, a drunken voice message saying something like ""good night kisses sweet dreams"" I was wasted.

Today, no news for lunch, nothing, I just send her a message at the end of the afternoon to tell her that I was ambushed again in a party that starts very early, she answers me that she too started early today (when she was supposed to start her classes ??), then I tell her that the plan for the locals I'm having a night out with is to take me to a bar because ""I'm going to get all the girls there "", which is true, that's really their plan haha. Trying to make her jealous, probably a mistake, and she just replied 2 laughing emojis  

Did I make an absolutely fatal mistake somewhere? Can I still hope to seduce this girl I've known for almost a week? What must I do now ?  thanks a lot for your help !",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjsln5/i_need_help_im_lost_with_this_girl/

We have unique dreams that we found out are common to each other. I really want this to work out for us! We have hung out a few times and I am pretty sure he likes me back.

We did swap books about our faiths and talk about it a lot. We are keeping open minds to talking about our beliefs together. He keeps bringing the topic up.

He was never super talkative over text, often taking days to respond, but after the gig we spent the night together. It was very touchy-feely, and we talked a lot about our lives. He was super polite and respectful, i really felt like we connected and that’s hes into me. I’m meant to see him again very soon to see another gig, but he’s still taken a very long time to reply to messages - around 1-2 days. And so there hasn’t been much opportunity to decipher how he’s feeling. I’m worried he thinks this is casual, but I’m looking for something more.

38,pjvx8d,1631048606,"(25M) never dated before, had 7 dates over past 2 months","I am a 25 year old guy with aspergers. I am a virgin, and prior to this year I had never kissed or dated anybody or even tried to. I have lived a rather unconventional life, I grew up poor and was relentlessly bullied at school for aspergers etc so I dropped out and proceeded to teach myself via homeschooling for 5 years. I did well enough at it that I received a scholarship for college. I commuted from home for college and then law school, I finished top of my class from an economics degree and then a law degree so I never had much of a social life at uni, but I was friendly with people and occassionally still chat online to a few people I went there with. After problems in interviews I was eventually able to secure my dream job, and have since moved out to a new city with my own apartment, and I now make considerably more money than my parents ever have combined. Currently I'm applying for scholarships to go to Harvard or Yale for a masters and I've been told that I'm a very realistic chance at getting one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the year, just after moving out I started tinder and bumble hoping to get over the virgin issue and try to start leading a normal life with sexual relationships etc but never really got anywhere and deleted them. Over the course of this year I made friends with some people from work and had better pictures naturally taken etc. One night about 3 months ago, at the behest of a drunk girl friend of mine from work I started back up on the apps: first bumble and then tinder and hinge. As before, I never really went anywhere on bumble or tinder, but for whatever reason, I get quite a few matches on hinge. Over the last 2ish months I have gone on 7 dates with 4 different girls from hinge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first girl was 26F1 - she was a very cute and lovely person. We went out on a coffee date for 45 minutes and instantly clicked. Subsequently we went out on two dinner dates and a date playing mini-golf. After the fourth date (second dinner date), she drove me home and then initiated a french kiss. I interpret this as a sign that she's expecting me to escalate things so I invite her inside. She responds by saying that she's not quite ready for that and has an early day at work the next day and then we organize another date after another kiss. She texts me a few days later with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hey NAME! Hope you had a good weekend, I'm so sorry I've been absent, I've been trying to sort out my own head... I'm sure you could probably tell on Thursday that I was a bit nervous and uncomfortable, and I've been a bit stressed ever since. I think if I'm being honest, I'm not ready to date anyone yet, having come out of a long term relationship recently. That is a cop out and really unfair on you, but I don't know hwhat else to say. I think I need a bit more time, and maybe a break from the dating scene for a little while. I really am so sorry and I hope you understand...

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards I go on three more dates:

&amp;#x200B;

25F - she was very attractive but had clear and visible quite severe mental health issues, kept talking about mutiliated corpses and things of that nature

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

23F - pretty clearly not a good fit from the start I would say

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

26F2 - I went out on a date with 26F2 on Sunday for coffee. I quite liked her, she was stunningly attractive and we seemed to have a good conversation for about 40 minutes before the cafe kicked us out because they had a lunch reservation. She then invites me to go on a walk where proceed to chat for about 20 minutes. At the end she initiates a hug with me and tells me to message her. I do later that afternoon and she responds earlier today with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Hey. Nice to meet you too, to be honest though didn't quite vibe. Best of luck with the hinge endeavours though!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What that means exactly I'm not sure. I am thinking two possibilities. Either a) she decided that she could do better because of how attractive she was relative to me. I'm not sure if that's the answer despite the obvious logic of it as I am not sure why you would invite someone for another 20 minute walk after the date if that were the case. b) the other possibility is that she detected that I was autistic and was put of by that, but equally I think that would've been apparent from the start, and as I said, I thought things went quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In my predicament, being a 25 year old autistic virgin, I am of the view that I need to rectify this as soon as possible, and realistically by the end of the year, else I'm not ever going to get anywhere. I'm not sure how to make it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have also engineered another date, I think, I don't know. The thing is that I worked on a group project for a couple of months at uni with another guy and a couple of girls, including 24F. I have not spoken with 24F since, it's been 2.5 years, and didn't have a lot to do with her during it tbh. However, I saw her profile pop up on hinge, screenshotted it and sent it to her remarking that it's a small world. We chatted for a bit and after my situation with 26F2 above fizzled out I invited her out and we're going out for lunch in a few days to catch up. What to make of that I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, I am looking for advice as to how I can lose my virginity and settle into a relationship before it becomes even more of a liability than it already is.

39,pjvxfl,1631048623,"Is ""whiteness"" just a physical attribute you are born with, or is it a fundamental ""lifestyle"" that defines who you are as a person and only other whites can experience or participate in?","My understanding of the word ""lifestyle"" is that it is just the things you do day to day. For example, exercising and eating healthy. Or going to yoga. Or shopping. Or watching movies. Your lifestyle is your daily routine and what you do or don't enjoy doing.

I was recently trying to explain this concept to a woman by saying, ""I want to date someone who has a similar lifestyle to me. I want to date a woman who enjoys being physically active, since I exercise 1 hour daily and that's important to me.""

I was told this was a superficial thing to want. This person then said they needed someone to be white to match their lifestyle, as they lived a lifestyle that only whiteness could allow someone to participate in. They used examples of going to the Kentucky Derby, yacht clubs, and balls. I explained anyone could do those things with her, but she said no they couldn't, as she wouldn't enjoy it with a nonwhite person so they therefore cannot be a part of her lifestyle. She thought this was a truer meaning of the word ""lifestyle"" than say trying to find someone who just enjoys your hobbies, because it went even deeper for her. To her you are either born into the ""white lifestyle"" or you are not and there is nothing deeper.

She said that being white was her lifestyle, and thus only another white person could experience it with her. She also said her social status derives from her whiteness and she needs someone on her status level.

I have seen online dating data suggesting that most women prefer white men. I always assumed it was just a skin deep preference. Ie. Many women prefer the color of white skin. Like wanting a brown dog or a black dog.

I never thought of it as something as deep as this. I didn't know people thought of whiteness as being an entire lifestyle that only other whites can experience. Or a fundamental part of their social status.

Given how strongly though I see many women have ""whites only"" dating policies, I wonder if this is a common thing among women. 

I have never frankly understood the concept of a ""whites only"" dating policy, since I've found women of all races attractive and I think anyone can live my lifestyle. But if this is how many women feel about it, it would help to explain why it is so important to them.

I consider myself an open-minded person. I'm someone who favors free and open debate. Even to the KKK, I would say let them speak because I think free speech is important. I also believe in total freedom of as much choice in life as possible.

I am just interested to understand this concept since I had never encountered it before. Is this a normal thought pattern among women?

This is a very unique situation. I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for over a year and because it has been COVID, we have seen eachother only once a couple of months ago. He lives in the US and I live in Canada. We have been dating for a year and he is the healthiest partner I’ve ever had. We have built a strong foundation with the help of my therapist who has been so helpful throughout encouraging me to continue to date him because he is a healing partner and I have learned so much. He is kind, respectful, reassuring and so calm and gentle. I was very attracted to him via FaceTime. I have a lot of childhood trauma that you should be mindful of and he has been excellent and very secure the whole way.

When I met him a couple of months ago, I had a lot of anxiety particularly because it wasn’t the intense chemistry I had via FaceTime. He wasn’t as physically attractive in person as I had seen in FaceTime and I was so caught off guard. I spent the entire weekend with intense anxiety because of the disconnect and then also the  difference between what I expected and what I saw. Nothing has changed based on his demeanour but I just wasn’t as physically attracted.

He is coming to tomorrow to see me and I am so nervous and anxious about it. I really want it to work because this is the healthiest partner I’ve ever had but the thought that the feelings are going to recur is scaring the crap out of me. I am 33 and ready to get married but this intense care about physical attraction is leaning me the other direction.

I am not sure if any of that made sense. The logical side of me thinks ‘why not just tell them pre-first date that there will be no sex, I just want to get to know you’.

I've never been in a relationship, casual or long-term, nor had sex. My only experience so far have been two summer flings (which never got to sex, probably also because of time constraints), one last year (which was actually my first kiss) and one this year. Both girls, and particularly the one of this year, were quite good-looking, and the latest one is also someone who is absolutely world-class in her job: that is to say, l believe that to some extent, if those girls liked me, I can't be that bad.
I have sometimes received compliments on my looks - even though I'm rather thin and far from the all-muscle, six-pack kind of guy -, but I'm still quite insecure about them (I guess I might be ""cute"" rather than ""hot""? Ιdk...). On the other hand, I am very self-confident when it comes to being an intelligent, successful person in my studies. I have always been quite socially awkward, but I always manage to make some friends (not sure if relevant, but, by no conscious choice of mine, my friends are mostly girls). I had never been on a date until a couple years ago, and so far have never got to a second date (not counting the summer flings because there were no structured ""dates"" there). I believe that's partly because l wasn't able to turn the first date into an actual romantic thing - they've almost all been coffee dates, maybe that doesn't help -, and always ended up looking halfway between an interview and two friends chatting. I also have a hard time meeting new people, and in particular approaching girls in a non-friendly way, as I'm always worried about looking creepy/becoming the laughing stock of the room/ uni/library. So, my questions are: 
- How do I meet girls, and make them understand l'm interested in them without being creepy? I don't think I'll ever have the confidence to walk into a bar, start talking to some girl I've never seen before, and it actually leading somewhere.  Please don't suggest apps - 90% of people are on there only for the sex, while my priority is an actual relationship.
- Once l've met someone, what kind of first date should I go for (coffee, drinks, dinner? Κeep in mind that as any student I don't have lots of money...), and how do I generate that necessary ""closeness""?

52,pjx8ac,1631052893,How can I (21f) begin to understand that men and women can be close friends without any hidden romantic feelings?,"Tl;dr- I have a history of relationships where the outcome was that my exes ended up leaving me for, or cheated on me with, a close female friend/a girl they wanted to be friends with. I ended a friendship with my only male best friend because he had feelings for me and wouldn’t respect that I didn’t for him. My current boyfriend has close female friends, and I want to understand that this is okay, but I don’t know how to begin. I do already attend therapy, and this has still been a struggling topic.

The TLDR is all you really need to understand the situation. Infidelity subreddits have always been helpful and provided a lot of support and comfort whenever I've posted about dealing with partners cheating, but the one thing I never liked was the overall adamant belief from them that men and women can't be friends. I love my current boyfriend a lot, but recognize that if I want to be with him, I need to accept his close friendships with women. I know that I can always just choose to leave, but I also know realistically that most people have opposite gender friendships. I'd have to deal with it no matter what relationship I enter into.

Don't get me wrong, I can understand where this feeling is coming from. It's becoming harder for me to resist that belief myself because I don't even have a successful friendship with a guy to point to. My closest/best male friend secretly harbored feelings for me, and wouldn't respect that I just wanted to be friends. We're no longer friends. I'm also referring to close friendships specifically, one where you can call a guy your best friend and have no romantic feelings, not just simply having male acquaintances.

I really do want to change, but I keep running into mental obstacles because I don't have a clue where to start. I don't know how to begin thinking differently. Every time my boyfriend warmly interacts with a female friend or coworker, I just get so angry and flare up with jealousy/hostility.

However, I couldn't stop thinking about Morgan. Me and Morgan met again on another night out and she was with her group of friends and Hannah was there too. We hung out and had a good time. Me and Morgan get along quite well and she seemed to want to talk to me quite alot which is good.

Here's the thing though. Will Morgan be totally put off by me because I kissed her friend the first night I met them both? I want to ask Morgan to meet up and hang out and that but i keep thinking if it's pointless because she wouldn't want to be with a guy who does that and it will seem like I'm going around trying to get with everyone in her friend group (I am not, I genuinely really like Morgan and I regret kissing Hannah because I honestly feel nothing for her) 

So help me out guys, should I just let my crush on Morgan go, or see what will happen?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjxbin/be_honest_how_much_chance_do_i_have/
57,pjxcxt,1631053295,Should I give up and move on?," I  (21M) met a girl in college at the start of the year and every time  I’ve been around her we’ve really hit it off and spend the whole time   talking to each other. Over the summer I decided I would finally grow  some balls and ask her out. So, before classes started back up and I  knew she was back in town, I told her that I wanted to take her out on a  date. She replied with, “That’s sweet but I’m actually not looking for a   relationship right now.” I told her I totally understand given that  this is our last year in college. Maybe this is important, or not, but  she was in a serious relationship about two years ago.

I  can’t help but feel like I gave up too quickly and that I should tell  her how I really feel. I wasn’t particularly looking for a relationship  either but she’s smart, beautiful and has a contagious  personality, and  I enjoy being around her. I’m also aware that the whole “I’m not  looking for a  relationship right now” excuse can also just be a nice  way of saying “you’re not the right guy.” But I’m being hopeful here I  guess.

This kind of response is  all too familiar for me, but I never pursued any girl further after  that. I’m really infatuated with this girl and I’m tired of getting  nowhere in starting relationships, but I also don’t  want to force her  into it. Any advice would help.

They have asked me about what I post, the communities I visit, etc.

While I was truthful, I did not go into great detail.  I’ve given them the gist of what I’ve posted and we have talked about communities I have visited.

On a totally unrelated subject, we were Googling something on their computer and I noticed my Reddit username in the list of recent searches - they were in control of their computer and they clicked on the box to expose the searches.

I asked what this was and they said, “oh yeah, I figured out your username.” 

“And you have clearly been searching for my posts, right?”

They admitted they had.

I asked them how they got my username and they did not want to tell me.  🤔 I asked them how long they had been looking at my posts and they said for over a year.

I asked them why and they said they wanted to see what I posted and if I was telling them everything.  I asked if they felt I had lied, omitted anything.  They said I had not.

I feel incredibly violated by this.

Their response is that Reddit is public, everything you post can be attributed to you personally, it is not meant to be an anonymous forum (I disagree.  I feel that it is different from a FB or Instagram profile, which usually does have identifying information, pictures) and that finding someone’s true identity is easy.  

I disagree and feel I am being gaslighted.  

They say “I’m sorry that you were hurt by this,” which feels like a bullshit apology.

68,pjyx32,1631058211,Left the third date planning in her hands - and she hasn't mentioned it in over a week. Please help.,"I (29m) have been on two really (really) amazing dates with a girl (28f) that I've been chatting with for a month but I'm confused on her intentions and where to go from here.     


A little backstory, I've been spending the past few years really trying to figure out what I want in a partner and I've shifted towards looking for a life partner rather than just a good time. I have anxious attachment and certain personalities can bring that out but Ive been trying to really work on that (and have made some decent progress).    


So when I met this girl that checked almost all of my boxes I was really excited. Our chemistry is borderline magical, I haven't felt this way from someone in what feels like at least 5 years.  However, she seems to take things much slower than I'm used to. I usually go for (and get) a first kiss on the first or second date. We have yet to kiss and that's honestly okay, but maybe not helping my current situation. During the first date I told her ""I'd love to kiss you right now"" and she shook her head 'no'. During the second date, I went in for the kiss after dinner and she pulled back saying ""we can't"". I asked if it's because she wants to go slowly and she said it was but didn't provide any more information (so I'm a little unsure). At the end of the second date last Monday (aug30) , I asked if she was free on Friday (sept3) and she said she had plans with her sister. So I told her she could schedule the next (third) date. She said okay, and I dropped her off at home. She was pretty warm and enthusiastic over text for a few days after that, but never brought up the date. After about three days I asked her along the lines of ""so when are you going to ask me out on a date?"" and she responded by teasing me with ""you really are impatient aren't you? ;)"".    


We had the long weekend just pass and she had plans for all of it, so she was pretty busy and wasn't as responsive as usual. Not the end of the world, but it did trigger my anxiety quite a lot. Her response time since I asked about the date has slowed down a lot but her texts are still very enthusiastic and it doesn't really seem like anything is wrong objectively. But subjectively I am honestly freaking out a little bit.  I was trying to just chalk it up to her being busy and hoped things would be normal again after the long weekend. But they have kind of stayed the same.   

I know she felt the same way I did about the dates being great (she commented on our chemistry and how her face hurt from smiling so much, and sent me a picture of the rose I gave her in a vase after the date).     


But I'm at a point where I'm very confused. I've dropped a few hints for things she could suggest for our next date subtly (""oh I also haven't been to that place before!""). I've considered being honest about how I'm feeling and have crafted a message to send to her about it. Essentially it boils down to ""I'd love to call to chat if you can find the time. But here's how I'm feeling..."". I can share the specific message in a comment if wanted. But I also don't want to come across as needy this early into things, so I'm hesitant to lay it on the line. I'm trying to remind myself that it's only been 8 days since our last date.. But that in combination with her decreasing how much we're talking has me freaked out. Enough to come here and ask for advice lol.   

I can't tell if she is just taking things slower than I am used to, or if she is losing interest and trying to break things off slowly without any confrontation. Does anyone have any insight or advice into what I might do to help myself out of this situation? Anything is very appreciated and thank you in advance :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjyx32/left_the_third_date_planning_in_her_hands_and_she/

We have a great chemistry and just laugh and smile when we are together. We hangout with the same group of friends and he's taken me on some fun dates like hiking, breakfast, lunch, golfing, bowling and getting drinks. He is a chef so he's got a pretty tiring and busy schedule, as do I. I recently got out of a 2 year relationship that I ended because of distance and incompatibility. So when I first started seeing this new guy, I told him I wanted to take things slow in terms of the progress of our relationship and he was very understanding and respectful of that. I was happy to be single and getting to know someone new without the pressure of being in another relationship.

I still don't want to jump into a relationship with him, let alone anybody right now, but my feelings for him are growing and causing me to overthink everything now which is exactly what I didnt want. Anyways, he only texts a couple times a week to set up dates and check-in and I am someone who is used to constant contact. Is this normal and does it mean hes not very interested/invested?

So, last year while working at Asda, I met a girl who I fell for hard pretty much instantly. I liked pretty much everything about her, but unfortunately I waited to long to ask her out and another one of our co workers beat me to it. This obviously really sucked but I accepted it,and  thought maybe in the future when I’m no longer working with them I could follow her on Instagram to see if they were still together and maybe go from there. I didn’t have a proper Instagram account at this point, just a blank one that I use to follow pages I like.

I ended up leaving the job in April and haven’t spoken to anyone there since then, at this point they were still together. I’ve set up an Instagram account since then but only have a few followers. More importantly, I’m pretty sure she knew I fancied her at the time, so I’m worried that following her now will just seem weird to her, especially if she’s still with her boyfriend. we never spoke outside work and I’ve not kept in touch with anyone there. I also kinda left the store on bad terms after getting fed up with management, so this might also make it a bit awkward to try and get back in touch with her.

I know this probably sounds stupid but it’s kept running through my head last few days and I’m not sure what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjz139/reaching_out_to_a_old_crushco_worker/

He is struggling with mental health problems and told me that he can't give me what I expect from him and that he can't be in a relationship. 

I knew that he was struggling and it was apparent sometimes when we spent time together since he would get closed off and dismissive at some point. 

I told him that I really like him and that I would indeed like to be in a relationship some time down the road. But since I don't want to add more stress or pressure into his life we shouldn't see eachother anymore.

He then told me that he doesn't like the thought of not seeing me again. We talked some more and came to the conclusion of continuing to date eachother under the circumstance of communicating more about feelings. 

However, I'm a bit afraid of this relationship being a one-sided thing in which I continue to develop feelings and conciously or unconciously put pressure on him while also setting myself up for heartbreak.

77,pjzluu,1631060675,How do you guys/girls tend deal with denial / seeing someone as perfect in a relationship?,"I often have a problem in dating where I kinda become 500% infatuated with women, which usually starts after a week or two of talking (if everything goes perfect)

This leads to intense overthinking and sometimes I even feel no attraction to other women during this period of the relationship, even physical. My replies (which are already fairly fast - I reply if I’m available) become much more frequent as I find myself unable to stop talking to the other person 

Sometimes it’s good at the beginning - it’s always great to get good signs back from someone you feel this way about and sometimes you get it back - but after a while it becomes very unattractive (as you could imagine), not even like I’m that different I just give off different vibes, usually become unable to criticise them and stuff like that

I also develop an inability to accept the truth by refusing to read signs, if she says a reason why she isn’t able to call I’ll always believe it, completely denying the possibility of her not wanting to talk to me even if it’s the 2nd time this has happened

As soon as I realise this I dial things down because I realise how weird I’m being, and then I can never find that normal state I had at the beginning where I was actually myself - some people even think I’m pissed of with them

I’ve been in long term relationships where this hasn’t been an issue (usually dies down then I’ll explain to her how I felt in a casual conversation, some people even find it cute to look back on) but I know it’s one of the main things working against me in dating

I also find it impossible to bring up as I feel super embarrassed, Im bad enough at affectionate topics early on so that’s a whole nother level and just feels like a huge vulnerability I shouldn’t share (and probably is)

Has anyone here ever experienced anything similar, and how did you deal with it? Also what’s it like to be on the receiving end of this behaviour?

Any suggestions on certain dating apps to use, places to go?","So a few months ago I got out of a relationship that lasted a few years am now thinking about dating again. I've always shied away from dating women I was really attracted to and have finally decided to really go for what I want, or at least try to.

This may sound shallow, but I'm a white guy that is primarily attracted to black women. Visually, I really like black women that embrace hip hop culture and style in terms of makeup, hair, jewelry. To really be specific, if a black girl is wearing big hoop earrings or those bamboo ones, fake eyelashes, long acrylic nails and weaves, there isn't much that can top that imo. This is not a preference that can be described as a phase, I've liked for as long as I can remember.

For everyone who is going to get mad: I find many black women attractive that do not share this ""style"" too. But can't deny that a black girl matching the description above will always be the most attractive girl anywhere in my opinion.

For everyone else who is going to point out that this description is only visual: I get that it seems shallow. But it goes without saying that if I cannot click with a woman personality-wise or in terms of chemistry, it will not work out. I'm hoping I can find somebody to connect with mentally, but do want to go for a partner that is visually appealing to me as well.

I realize advice provided (after possibly getting a kick out of the specific nature of my preference) will probably be general, and that's fine.

He never followed through on that invite. He did text once except it was something like “could u please download ____ instead”. I mimicked his response and simply said “okay, ill do it. downloaded”.

82,pjzwh7,1631061770,"Frustrated, Spiraling Into Loneliness &amp; Hopelessness","I know many men come here with similar notes, so forgive me. I just need to get it off my chest in an organized way. I hope this is reasonable. I would greatly appreciate any advice or insight.

I'm a male (24 years) who lives in a major city. I've always seemed to struggle with dating. I'm heavily introverted, but have a good social life and several great friends I get together with regularly. I consider myself an average/decently attractive guy. I think I'm pleasant to be around for the most part. I do social activites (bars/events/etc.) and try to expand my social circle as much as possible, but there's only so many ""friends of friends"" out there.

In college I lived a normal college life. Partied and socialized a lot, it was a blast. I had a share of hookups, sex, etc. but not much more than that. I mention that to communicate I've had that exposure and I'm not some dude who doesn't understand what the dating world is actually like and hates women or something.

So now I'm an adult, doing the regular lifestyle, working a job, and falling into hopelessness. I'm almost at the point of giving up honestly. I don't ever seem to warrant interest from women when I'm out in public. I don't understand how to meet more women. I've exhausted my ""network of friends"" as mentioned. And again, women don't seem to make an effort to be approachable/initiate anything, and I know it's ""the male's responsibility"" to start that stuff.

I've tried dating apps for several years now, it's never worked for me. Barely any matches/interest, which absolutely destroys my confidence, so I always end up deleting them. My profile is fine according to my male &amp; female friends. What are my other options to meet women in reality? Cold approaching in public seems bad. I think women find it as off-putting and/or creepy, and factor in coronavirus making it unacceptable to interact with people you don't know, and masks and everything make it quite awkward. Am I supposed to just wait around and hope for a cute girl to end up right next to me in the produce aisle during my grocery store trip I make every 1-2 weeks, and make some dumb comment about the asparagus to initiate conversation? It just seems far-fetched and doesn't actually happen to people. What are the odds?

I know it's not right to desperately desire to be in a relationship, but I don't feel like it's like that for me. I think I would be fine to be single forever, and don't feel like I need a woman to ""complete me"" or anything like that. But is it wrong to desire companionship? I want to get married and have a family eventually too. That feat sounds impossible right now. Nights by myself all the time are making me lonely. I'd just like to actually have somewhat of a dating life. This whole thing brings me to tears sometimes. I don't know what to do. My dating life is nonexistent. I see a therapist to talk about my issues, but it's not like he's a dating coach.

So this was long, I'm sorry, but it felt good to write out like this. Thanks if you've read this far. And again, would be awesome and super kind if you have any thoughts or advice to share!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pjzwh7/frustrated_spiraling_into_loneliness_hopelessness/

We didn't kiss until the third date, we went on numerous ""dates"" for about 4 months, never did anything more than a kiss. He told me his body count was decently high, then the very first night we spent together he had issues with performing and he ended up telling me he was actually a virgin. I told him I didn't care, and we finally made it official before I went back to college which isn't to far from where we were living. Last week he came up to visit me and we got a hotel room and spent the night together. That night was the first night we had sex after we finally were 1000% comfortable with each and it was a good night. When I was there I told him that I loved him, and he did end up saying it back but for some reason it didn't feel super real. He is such a love and I feel completely loved but for whatever reason i feel like when he says it he doesn't really mean it and i'm terrified that I ruined such a good thing that i had with him.

But I’m sad to say the supply of nerds (using the term loosely) in these spaces seems low. Too many people trying to network with professionally taken photos, people obsessed with hiking and overly strenuous activity, and dudes leaning up against Porche’s they probably don’t own and even if they did who gives a shit? I don’t want to play games of appearance. I want to play Nintendo Switch games lol

I’m just looking for an honest, warm hearted guy who likes what he likes and isn’t ashamed of it, be it video games or anime or D&amp;D, or Ren Faires. I’m not trying to go full on lives-in-mom’s-basement. But I’m looking for someone who’s not necessarily trying to be cool or approved or “be somebody” other than exactly who they are.   Someone comfortable with staying in and playing board games and laughing and talking and just existing comfortably. Someone who doesn’t feel compelled to perform masculinity and doesn’t look for me to perform femininity. Also I find glasses hot idky lol

I just wanted to say remember to factor in your surroundings. I recently move to a new city and have had a way more enjoyable time. 

In my old city I was in a lot of toxic circles and was around more toxic people and that had an affect on me because I was trying to my energy with the wrong type of energy and it didn’t work ever.

In this new city things are different, people are different, which means different results.

But, after the most recent date, I received a text saying he had a great time but when I responded I was met with him liking my message but not responding. I have noticed that he is not a good texter. Even when we went out, he did not look at his phone. And He often suggests calling but is very late with text responses.

94,pk178o,1631066485,"My (26M) black, Christian parents affirmed their support for me being gay and surprisingly encouraged me to find a relationship. Now I'm not sure if I want to continue seeing the guy (27M) that I've been secretly dating for the past year.","I came out to my parents a year ago to discover a very supportive embrace and a high amount of encouragement and affirmation in who I'd revealed myself to be. This was more than I expected because they're both Christian and somewhat conservative. Anyway, we hadn't talked about it a lot, but during the time, I'd developed a quite nebulous and undefined romantic relationship with a guy. Despite becoming pretty fond of him, I'd always been hesitant to go further with him because of our pretty significant personality and cultural differences.

I'm African American, from the East Coast of the US, and have grown up in an extremely diverse community of people that has afforded me a lot of opportunities to develop cultural competencies throughout the years. He is white, from the Midwest, comes from a very conservative Catholic family, and hasn't grown up having the same ability to experience and learn from others unlike himself.

Throughout our relationship, I've come to realize how many ways that we just don't connect because of the difference in our backgrounds. We have different senses of humor that don't always align; we process and deal with emotions in different; we see the world and people differently. Sometimes it doesn't bother me, but other times I'm left feeling kind of unfulfilled when we're together. And sometimes I feel really comfortable and able to be (one side of) myself when I'm around him. I think he knows this because as I was trying to explain why I feel unsure about pursuing a relationship, he noted that he thought that I felt unsatisfied with him because I ""have to code-switch"", which is true in a lot of ways.

Anyway, this past weekend, I was checking in with my parents about how they were processing my coming out to them a year later, to which they reaffirmed their support and even encouraged me to find a relationship. Something about that was very liberating because I never invested a lot of energy toward finding a relationship due to the fact that I didn't know how they'd feel about me being in a full-blown relationship with another guy. I think I'm finally ready to find that now, but I just don't know if it would be with this guy.

Most importantly, I don't like the fact that he has no plans on coming out to his family. I feel like I'd be wasting my time dating him because I'd never meet his family, and even if I did, then I might not ever be fully embraced. That bothers me a ton because family is extremely important to me. I've always imagined my SO becoming a part of the family and for our families to merge into one bigger family.

Are my concerns valid? Should I pressure him to come out? Should I walk away? What do you all think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk178o/my_26m_black_christian_parents_affirmed_their/
95,pk17up,1631066542,My Experience With Online Dating Thus Far,"I started using online dating about 3 months ago and haven't had a ton of success. I've basically tried all the major ones during the past three months and have noticed certain things that have annoyed me.

One of the biggest annoyances that I've come across is when I get a match about 90% of the time the other person never responds. I'll get the match send them a message, not just a hey or hey what's up, but an actual message with some meat to it and I get nothing back. What I can't comprehend is why on earth these people are matching with me if they have no intention to even send a single message. I know people ghost all the time (which is awful btw) but I can't comprehend why people don't even send a single message. The entire point of online dating is to meet and talk to people so if you're not up to that then why are you using these apps?

The three apps I've used the most during the past 3 months are Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder. Been on Hinge and Bumble for 3 months and Tinder for about 2 months. I've had a varying amount of matches on all three.

In 2 months I've had 5 matches on Tinder which to my surprise is the most matches I've had with any of these apps. I would've thought that I'd be getting more matches on Hinge given that I'm looking for a long term relationship. Out of those 5, only one person actually sent me a message. Their reply came 3 days after my initial message and I responded to it a couple of hours later and then never got another response. I've also used Tinder Hot Takes (for those who don't know it's basically kind of like a blind date but just over text and then eventually you'll see the other persons profile) and even on Hot Takes so many people don't respond. Which to me is baffling since the whole point of the feature is to talk to someone to then see what they look like.

Hinge is by far my favorite app that I've used and I've had 3 matches in 3 months. The confusing part to me is that my first two matches came in my first month of using the app and then I had absolutely no matches for 8 weeks. I was still using the app during this time but wasn't getting any matches. Like I said before this was confusing to me as I can't comprehend how I'm liking hundreds of profiles over those 8 weeks and not a single person reciprocated interest. Anyways my first match actually led to a short conversation. Conversation was going well until the other person just stopped responding. My second and third match never responded to the initial message. What I don't understand about Hinge is this app is supposed to be for those looking for a serious relationship yet some people don't even send a single message. Also, another thing I don't understand is that for all of my likes I send a comment along with the like which is meant to be a conversation starter for if we match. All 3 of my matches didn't respond to the comment instead they ""invited to start the chat"". Like I said the whole point of the comment is to start the conversation but then they just ignore it and wait for you to initiate the chat.

Lastly is Bumble, which is an app I don't understand whatsoever. It was the first one I downloaded as a close friend recommended me trying that one first. I've been on the app for 3 months and haven't had a single match. Not one match. Nothing. I really can't comprehend how that is even possible when I'm getting matches on Tinder and Hinge. For the first month, I spent the most time on Bumble. Honestly, too much time on the app and not a single person liked me back. I honestly wonder if the app is even working because like I said I can't if wrap my head around how that is even possible. My friend who recommended it to me met his gf after one month and they've been dating for almost 3 years and are planning on getting married. Yet, I've been on this app for 3 months and haven't even had a single match.

Anyways, I'm sorry this turned into such a long post but I really needed to vent because this is getting really frustrating. I'm not even annoyed at the lack of matches. I'm just annoyed that the ones I get don't even respond. I'm not someone who's looking to be inundated with matches. I'm honestly just looking to talk to someone, hopefully go on a date with them, and see where it goes from there. But it's nearly impossible to do any of that when the majority of my matches never send a single message.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk17up/my_experience_with_online_dating_thus_far/

I frequently noticed her making eye contact with me even if I wasn't the one talking. Also, I also noticed that when she would be talking to someone else, she would look at me instead of the person she's talking to. 

Honestly, I'd love to start getting to know her more but don't want to come off in an awkward way. I'm not the best at noticing if a girl is into me in any way lol. How can I go about this? She just started following me on Instagram so this would be my only way of contacting her.
