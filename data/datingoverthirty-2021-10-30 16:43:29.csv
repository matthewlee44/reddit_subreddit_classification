89,qki61x,1635785399,A case of low self esteem,"

I (33f)started talking to someone (35m) back in July. Our conversations have not gone beyond Snapchat although I attempted many time to move it to text. Things became racy and this situationship has honestly become a case of daily sexting with mild conversations. This guy is not over his ex (after investigations of my own lol). I‚Äôve asked straight up and gotten the yes I am reply but his actions say otherwise. 

I‚Äôve removed him from my social media multiple times only to add him. I know the answer but I really need to move past this, but my ego won‚Äôt allow me to remove him again due to fear of looking weak‚Ä¶I‚Äôve allowed loneliness to accept his subpar efforts of conversation and multiple no shows for dates. We have slept together once and as great as it was it probably won‚Äôt happen again because he‚Äôs not interested (no matter how frequent our sexting is. He‚Äôs a single dad as well but I have no help where as he has shared custody).


As I read this I know how lame it seems. I‚Äôm a single mom getting back out there. Yeah it‚Äôs easy to say focus on myself but I have never had such a dry spell. I just really liked communicating with someone frequently but I‚Äôm crossing personal boundaries and morals for a pen pal.

How do I slowly withdraw myself from this?

92,qkjwap,1635790065,Dating when you're moving next year!?,"Hello! I went through a pretty heartbreaking breakup back in April and have been spending the last several months healing, working on myself, learning to be okay alone again, living alone for the first time. I went on three dates from OLD in the summer but ultimately needed a little more time to build my confidence back up.

Anyway, I have decided to move to a new city across the country. For several different reasons, I won't be able to make the move until June 2022. So now I find myself in a weird spot, where I feel ready and willing to start dating again, but I'm moving far away in 7 months. I don't want to lead anyone on, waste anyone's time etc, but in the past, casual dating/FWB hasn't really been for me. Ultimately I do want a long-term relationship but have kind of accepted I should wait until after I move to get more serious about dating. At the same time, 7 months without romantic contact, flirting, and sex seems pretty dang lonely, lol.

I'm wondering if anyone has navigated something like this or has advice. Should I get on the apps but make it clear from the beginning that I'm moving soon? Should I mention it at all, or wait until I meet people? Or should I just use the next 7 months to continue working on myself? Would you date someone who you knew was moving? Just looking for opinions I guess! :)

Thanks in advance!!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/qkjwap/dating_when_youre_moving_next_year/
93,qkk4n3,1635790724,[33M] Cute waitresses/baristas around the neighborhood googled my music and now they're giggly but neither of us has acknowledged why. I'm interested in one - what's the protocol here?,"Uhhh, so I got my heart obliterated almost three years ago and started writing and playing songs to cope.

I'm actually not terrible and have done a few small time tapings with my name prominently featured and because the internet is the internet, anyone who googles my name sees them as the top result.

I have a local bookstore cafe and a local thai restaurant I really like to go to. I noticed first at the bookstore that after I had come in a few times, all the baristas started getting really smiley and flirty.

I'm a 33 year old bald dude who projects a very imposing persona because he's terrified of the world finding out he's a softie, so people are usually really reserved around me.

but these girls are like...really giggly. LIke...they knew me.

It took me going to the thai place a few times and having generally pleasant (I guess I'm really polite?) interactions with the waitresses there to have them, but particularly one of them get super giggly and be the one to serve me whenever I went in. Like she would go out of her way to make conversation with me all throughout dinner and then even after I paid and was trying to leave.

I couldn't understand until I looked back down at the receipt I had just signed and saw my full name printed in capital letters at the bottom.

someone googled me

I was kind of taken aback but also my vanity was flattered - like what the hell this is so absurd.

So like this waitress is really cute and sweet and has a bubbly anxious nervous energy that is just my type - question is: how do I go for it?

Like obv it bothers me that someone googled my name and I don't get to introduce myself on my own terms, but also....she cute

lmao this is such an absurd situation and I'm just giggling smiling laying here in bed typing it out

What do I do?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/qkk4n3/33m_cute_waitressesbaristas_around_the/
94,qkk64d,1635790835,Re-entry dilemma assistance! 38/m,"Earlier this year my wife decided one man was not enough and I (38/m) am now since entirely divorced. I took some time alone and am now getting back into things in full. I've been out of dating for 12.5 years in total. TBH I was mostly happy about that...regardless I am now back in the fray.  I've read all the usual advice (work on yourself, get new hobbies, join new groups, etc) and am doing my best.

So what's the dilemma?

Going from 60 - 0 overnight in my sex life has left a pretty big hole (no puns intended).  I've always been a ""relationship"" guy and would like that again in the near future but, it obviously takes time. And having never been into the casual lifestyle I am pretty intimidated by the idea honestly. I also get the impression that most of the women I run into who are looking for relationships have their side pieces (if they desire to have that) and therefore not many are looking for casual meetups too. Otherwise the group of people into the hookup culture are so foreign to me I'm not sure where I'd even start.  As time goes on I think this will impact my confidence more and more. 

Clearly I'm trying to phrase this better than saying ""help me get laid""...and hopefully I have?  I am, and have been, full-time WFH for years. Several good friends but they are all mostly rooted at this age (married, kids if desired, etc) and not many new people getting introduced. Also trying to avoid any type of ""clubbing"" scene...just not me. Any advice on how best to navigate? I don't want to shoot myself in the foot, but also want to be honest.

99,qklx0c,1635795624,34M Hinge Profile review,"Hi, kind of new to discovering this sub and was curious for any critique on my profile.

https://imgur.com/a/RwSGPqY

I don't have really any relationship experience. I kind of had a relationship going starting over summer but she ended things on me after she lost her job. Been a bit down about it since but feel like I need to get back out there and try. Torn between that and maybe taking time off from looking and try to focus on my health and fitness, try to get down to pre-covid weight. The half marathon picture is the most recent one. But also have that fear of FOMO if I'm not actively looking. 

Thanks!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/qklx0c/34m_hinge_profile_review/
