0,p1sgrp,1628612135,Dating a Camgirl,"So i need some advice, I (23M) have been dating my Girlfriend (20F) for about a year now and its been a pretty rough journey, Admittedly a-lot can be traced back to my insecurity in regards to her profession, but it can also be stemmed from the inability for her to understand, that its hard to have a partner in her profession, at least for me it is.

Some reoccurring arguments we've been in has been about how she treats her viewers. In some instances i feel like she treats them better than she treats me (this is a long story but i can create another post if you'd like). I've had issues where she gives her users pet names, calling them baby (this is the problem currently), or daddy or stuff like that.  I understand that in her profession typically models resort to this behaviour especially in the beginning in order to gain a following, but typically these types of models also don't have a significant other in the equation. Another issue we currently have is that she actively avoids telling her viewers that she has a boyfriend, ill admit at first, early in the relationship, i wanted her to tell them my username and tell them i was her boyfriend and stuff like that but i did realize that it is inconvenient to have her do so and therefore all i ask is for her, when someone asks if she has a boyfriend, just to tell them that she does, and thats it. Her reasoning for not doing so is because ""people are crazy on these platforms, and she prefers to keep her private life separate from her work life"". This is a pretty good argument and was the reason why i went from wanting her to tell them my username to just saying yes to the question but its difficult to sit there in support for her, and hearing her call them pet names, or while she treats them better that she treats me when she is connected. There was a point where she would defend cam2cam, i obviously am not ok with her viewing other users cams because typically they are not there just to say hello, they are preforming actions in which i do not want to name, and therefore i have always had a problem with this, she would argue with me why she needs to have it and it was always because people pay for it, even though they might pay for it once every month or so, but the idea that someone will come along and pay for it always bugged me. But finally she decided to remove it and i really appreciated it but we still have arguments over these other things in which i truly believe i shouldn't have to tell her to not give other people pet names, to no treat other people with more priority (though i understand there are instances such as family emergency and things of this nature where she has to).

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that some insecurity is tied to all of this from my end. But is it wrong to expect her not to use pet names when referring to her viewers? Is it wrong to not want to be kept a secret from the viewers? Is it wrong to want to be treated a little bit better that the rest?

I’ve had little to no success with women in the past when I think I was pretty confident and now I’m trying to understand if confidence actually did anything for me.

2,p1spnr,1628612839,How do I achieve that goal?,"It is my biggest dream to fall in love with Mr. Wonderful and the settle down (whether that be through marriage or a serious common law relationship. I’m open to either one). I just want to know what it feels like to have a guy feel like he’s the luckiest guy In world because I’m in his life and vice verse.

And therefore, whenever I meet I guy i connect with, I immediately start hoping that he will be turn out to be my Prince Charming and worrying that he might not. Hell, the minute the guy seems like my type…..within 2 weeks, I’ll probably start thinking I met the love of my life. 

This just leads to a lot of emotional rollercoaster. People tell me not to go into dating with the mindset and to relax but I am not sure how to do that. And besides….my motivation for dating is to find my life partner….shouldn’t I judge guys in how they will make as a life partner if I want to achieve that goal?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1spnr/how_do_i_achieve_that_goal/
3,p1sv6g,1628613293,Should I (21F) try online dating?," Hi, I (21F) have never dated before, so I seek the eternal wisdom of the people of the internet. I am fairly content being single, but my brain has been bugging me about this for a while.

To be honest, a lot of it is stemming from my friends I follow online. They are dating and seem to have an amazing relationship. They have been together for a long time, have great communication, and have fun just being around each other. I’m a little envious, and I want to be close to someone like that.

I also miss having someone I could consider a best friend. I have friends I talk to sometimes, but it isn’t the same. 

I am looking to get into a committed relationship and eventually get married one day. 

My main concern is that dating seems really overwhelming. I see so many posts about toxic relationships and the constant struggles of dating, and it gets me a little worried. A lot of people seem depressed and hopeless too. 

Also, I’m specifically asking about online dating because I don't know how to do it irl. I don’t drink or do drugs, and I don’t like loud overly-stimulating environments like a club or bar (it gives me a lot of stress). A lot of my friends are online friends too, so it isn’t like I can ask someone to introduce me to someone.

I am also diagnosed with anxiety. It isn’t so bad that I have to take medication, but I would imagine that it would impact my ability to date. I know I’m not a perfect person but I’ve improved a lot over the years and I’m continuing to work on self-improvement.

Lately when I’ve been going out to bars and such, I find myself drunkenly flirting with women more than men and even kissed one of my friends (just a peck) The last straw I guess was last night I had a very detailed dream about being intimate with a woman and her really liking me. I’m not sure what to move forward because I feel like I can admit that I’m bisexual, however I’m not drawn to casting a label on myself and now I can finally understand why members of the LGBTQ+ community don’t always do that. I also don’t necessarily feel a need to come out because at this point I’m just physically attracted to women and and still only interested in being in a relationship with a man, BUT maybe my friends should know so they understand why I’m flirty with women at bars?

8,p1t0nq,1628613754,I feel that he’s losing interest in me,"I [19F] decided to go on Bumble back in early July. If you don't know what is Bumble, it is the same thing as Tinder however the girls get to make the move first. I did not have any ""straight"" objective on why I was there. I just wanted to see if the app was worthy of my time. The guys were all very nice, preferably nicer than the guys on Tinder until one catches my eye.  A [21M] and I talked about one thing that we had in common, the type of music that we liked. We actually had a liking towards this band (not going to mention the name of the band) and we tease each other with jokes that only those who were only fans of that band would know. Soon after, we were flirting a bit. I am usually not the type of person that likes to flirt with guys, especially with those who I don't know personally. However, talking to him, let alone, flirting makes me comfortable to do such things with. It was not the dirty flirting that we did, mostly it was wholesome. I did not talk to him on the app as both he and I did not use it often. The only reason why I was on the app was that I wanted to talk to him and not anyone else. A few days later, he sent me all his social media so that it would be easier for us to talk to each other. 

Everything was going well. Unfortunately, when we first started talking, I had a fever from my second dose of vaccination.  However, A would check on me to see if I was feeling better despite him having other plans. Slowly as time passes by, we decided to talk more and... flirted. Both of us would always be cheeky with each other (him wanting to carry me as I was way shorter than him, asking me to come over to his place and cuddle (we live very far from each other so I had to pass lol) and more. However, at one point, things got way deeper than usual. He mentioned his traumatic experiences with both of his exes (for the respect of him, I would not mention openly what were his experiences). At that point, I felt bad for him. He is a nice guy, why would 2 people do dirty to him? But yeah.
Unfortunately, the next few days started to change. A is someone who does not like to use his phone compared to others and it was something that I actually liked about him. Not using his phone led to late replies, it was something that was already happening at the start. However, it did not bother me as much because his energy in texting was still hyped up so late replies were not really a big deal. As time pass by, his replies sounded so drained out, it felt like he was not putting in the energy anymore. It did not feel like he was interested anymore. It was like he wanted to reply to the conversation just for the sake of it. I was bumped out on how his energy was changing. It kind of made me feel like I was the cause of him not wanting to talk to me like before. I felt guilty and wanted to talk to him about it.
I told A that we should take a break from each other for a while because I felt that I have been bothering him a lot when he has a lot of stuff on his mind and that I wanted to be there for him but the best step now is to just leave him alone to calm his mind. He told me that he would talk to me once he feels better.  A few days after that, I decided to text him again. I asked A if there was something bothering him, he said that there was however he chose to ignore it. I reassured him that if there was anything, he could talk to me about it. He said that he hasn't told anyone about it. Again, I reassured him. A reiterated that he did not want to talk about it and would talk to me once he feels better. I told him that I did not want him to do anything harsh on himself. He told me that he wouldn't and that's the end of that.

It's been a week since I last talked to him. We still follow each other on Instagram. There would be times where he would look at my stories and I would look at his whenever he posted. He would usually be the first few to like my posts but now, he just doesn't. (maybe I post at the wrong timing lol) Sometimes, I feel bad. I really like this guy a lot (he knows), he basically is someone who I treasure dearly since my breakup 2 years ago and I want to help him as a friend. What does all of this mean? Is he or has he lost interest in me? What should I do? Please help. I really need it.  Also, I am sorry if I put off as creepy.
Thank you..

9,p1t1z9,1628613859,Am I at more of a disadvantage when it comes to dating eventhough this other guy has spina bifida as well?,"Alright I 29M have always struggled with dating because I have a physical disability. I know people say that's not true but it is let's be real. Dating someone with a physical disability comes with misunderstanding, fear and worry for a potential partner. I am very independent and self sufficient. I am a black man who lives in a predominantly rural white area. Where my closet family members are an hour and thirty mins away from me.

Then this is this guy who I know and goes to the same church as I do and he is a 24 years old white male with blonde hair and blue eyes. He has spina bifida as well and he seems to be independent and self sufficient as well. He drives and works just like I do. He seems have no problem with dating with women who don't have a disability and  I never see anyone telling him that he needs to date women who also have disabilities. 

What makes me so different than him and why doesn't he seems to struggle with women dating him. Like I said we have the same disability and we are both self sufficient. The only few differences we have is that he's white and I'm black. But also his family has money and they have very successful business in this town and works for his family.

 I adore strong ,independent  women who truly enjoy single life but apparently  I am not one of them

This is my first post here just so you know.

Tldr, i'm being ghostet, but i don't know if it's really ghosting or something else is going on.

So i matched with this girl on lovoo, if you don't know its just like tinder but more active in switzerland. Things were going damn well, she textet me first we bonded first over our favoutite animes and stuff. Until like a week later she we were supposed to go out, but we did not fix a date when exactly and she did not respond. Fast forward to 4weeks later and she texted me again, saying she was off social media entirely for family reasons, which are 100% true in my opinion, and that she moved in with her family for that month. 
After that it was again like she never left and we chatted and called each other sometimes for like 6h and sometimes even sleeping on the phone together.
I know this may sound stupid to some, but it just felt right. We had so much in common and we had so much fun, the only problem was just that she went on vacation a few days later for 3 weeks. So i was not able to see her before. Now the real kicker comes. She was supposed to come back on sunday and we said that she would come over to my place so i can cook for her. We were on the phone on saturday until she passed out and that was tha last thing i heard from her...
She did not tell me she was back, she did answer any of my calls and did not text back at all...
The thing is though, i know she should be working again but her lovoo profile sais she is back at her parents house, because they live so far from each other i can tell (at least i think that). So it could be that something happened privately and she is distancing herself again because i cant tell you i did something wrong, it felt like we had a real connection..., but i see her online all the time and it hurts so much that she cant just tell me whats going on...

To the few that will actually read this, thank you and if you have any advice or think i should hang on or something, i appreciate you...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1u3yg/feeling_a_bit_lost_over_a_girl/

When I quit working at that place he needed to know something, so he messaged me trough facebook. That's when he found out I wasn't in a relationship anymore, and that's when he started seriously making moves. 

I know it should be normal that people don't make moves at someone who's in a relationship, but honestly? The amount of people that tried hitting me up knowing full well I was in a relationship of over 2 years astonishes me. 

He told me this today when we talked about the first time we seriously started talking. Not in a boasting way, it was more about something else and this passed trough the conversation.

In grocery stores, malls, walking around downtown. It goes pretty well. My approach is easygoing and non threatening. I'm very polite, respectful of her boundaries, I make her laugh, I close strong and very causal suggesting for us to go out for a coffee or have lunch at a later date in time (which they seem down for). I get her number, text her 15-30 minutes later saying something like ""nice meeting you!"" while making a small callback/joke to our in person conversation. Ending it with an ""enjoy the rest of your day"", leaving my name at the end of the text, in case she forgot it. That conversation goes well... But here's my problem... (By the way my approaches are typically some variation of that, more or less \^\^)

I'm not quite sure where to go from here because I usually get ghosted after this some days later when trying to set something up. Or they send a nice message saying ""Hey I'm actually not interesting anymore, but nice meeting you"". Which I appreciate...

But what's the smoothest way or best way to communicate with a girl after getting her number to increase the chances of going on a date with her? Should I not text her at all after getting her number and do the 'three day rule' or wait a week? Should I be more flirty? Is there a specific way a girl prefers a guy to talk to her through text or otherwise, after she gives him her number? Should I not suggest a coffee or lunch (then why do they seem interested and give me their number then)?

I just moved to a new city and I’m throwing myself into the dating scene via the apps. I had sort of a spontaneous hang with a guy over the weekend, and it was so nice! We hung out at his place, watched a movie, even cuddled a little. Honestly, I have no complaints about the encounter - it was super pleasant and there wasn’t really any awkwardness. I feel like we get along well. Cool!

During the hang out, he mentioned (without any prompting from me) that he is going to be busy this week and out of town for part of it, but that when he gets back he’s more free to see each other again. He reiterated it too when he walked me out- this week is crazy, but after he will be free.

With the exception of a text to let him know I got home safely that night and a response to a friendly text I sent him the next day, he’s been relatively silent and I haven’t heard from him. My overthinking is getting the best of me - if he was interested in me, wouldn’t he still be in touch a little more even if he isn’t available to hang out in person this week? Or is he just really busy, like he said, getting ready to go out of town, and just sort of focusing on that?

I’ve been in relationships/situationships before that have started super intense right off the bat, with constant communication and contact, and I don’t want that anymore. So, maybe this all sounds entirely normal to some, and I need to get used to how a lot of people approach dating. But, I would like to get an opinion to see if i should take this as a sign that he isn’t super interested after all. The obvious answer is to wait a week for his supposedly more busy time to end and if I hear from him then that’s my final answer.

37,p1vl7h,1628621287,Random crush on someone - how to handle/should I handle? -,"
Hi all,

I hope this is the correct place to ask for some advice! :) 

It is a bit childish, but I am so bad with these things. I wrote a lot, sorry! The nerves…

A friend of mine got married last weekend and it was the most beautiful wedding I have ever been to. Usually I feel a bit uncomfortable at public places and events, but I had a wonderful evening and enjoyed every little bit of that evening. Didn’t go there thinking about looking at others, not my intention at all.

I was so nervous first, but it was a nice comfortable small wedding due to covid. The groom has a friend and for some reason I cannot help thinking about some looks and smiles we shared and he makes me grin. I didnt talk to him, because it was an Afghan/ German wedding so it would be a disrespectful to speak to men out of nowhere, but now I regret it. I also didn’t think I could have a crush like this, because I came out of a bad relationship but was always focused on feeling attracted first to looks I think, but this guy made me smile because he was so much fun, so kind to them and everybody in general. Cannot believe I am saying this as an almost 30 year old, but he looked at me a few times even across the room and smiled.

I was hoping he would maybe ask for me or something, but so far I didn’t hear anything and I myself keep wondering what he would be like to talk with. Does that sound stupid? 

I don’t want to disturb my friend, because she just got married and don’t want to make her think badly. Don’t think she would, she has a heart of gold, because I am stopping myself and keep saying he didn’t ask himself either.

What would you do? Leave it or do something with it? I am being stupid? I only dated my ex, so I don’t know what to do :))

Thank you!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1vl7h/random_crush_on_someone_how_to_handleshould_i/

I've been here two weeks ago on a road trip with my dad, and I loved it here so much that I decided I wanted to go back here and explore a bit more for my first solo trip ever. I felt comfortable with the country and me and my dad's trip felt pretty hasted, so I wanted to see more. I happened to also have met a cute bartender the first time I went, whom I met again today.

Because when I'd sat journaling, he showed up, because apparently he had to work.

So, we exchanged a few smiles again, but didn't speak to each other just yet. When I had to catch my train, I decided to get up from my seat five minutes earlier to have a chat with him anyway.

so...in my dream, i did not react violently when i saw them together. i know this might sound stupid but vivid dreams really hits u differently--in my dream, i just questioned why they were being cozy together, and my beau defended in a way that he was not doing anything wrong. the dream was cut off and in the next part of it, i hung out with the same girl friend and she was telling me about her admirer. i knew that she was referring to my beau who i was chatting in my dream. i saw signs that he unfollowed me on socmed (weirdly it was spotify and the activity showed on discord lol). the dream felt so real that i was left anxious upon waking up. 

now. personally i don't expect anything from my beau but he's a person i rly wanna take care of for a long time. but sometimes my head goes crazy thinking about what if he met this girl or that girl which is my friend also and he finds them more interesting? i believe that if that happens he wont act on it now but i know that people keep tabs on other people like options once they get out of a relationship and that is another uncomfortable thought that i have.


please let me know if it is just me being bothered by some stupid dream. also i recently saw Vox's Dreams, Explained so i thought this was my anxiety showing in my dreams. it's creepy but i wanna shake this off sm.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p1wxzw/i_feel_threatened_with_my_highschool_friends/

60,p1xlly,1628627395,Should I stay friends?,"Met this guy a few months ago, he’s about 4 yrs older than me if it helps. I let him initiate conversations and set the pace, so he asks me out to dinner after texting for a while. I felt like we hit it off. He even asked me if I wanted to go somewhere for ice cream after and talk, so we did.

A few weeks go by, he asks me how my days are going, he starts to tell me how he’s going through a lot at the moment and that he’s looking for a counselor. I appreciated him confiding in me, so I told him to not be a stranger if he wants to talk or just get together. So, he asks me to go to the drive-in with him, which is a 30-40 minute drive from our town. 

We go, he gets a little flirty, but nothing happens because again, I’m inexperienced and don’t like to initiate, but there’s chemistry. On the way home, he asks “Is this a date?” and I pretty much tell him I was under the impression it was.

When he drops me off, he tells me he had a lovely time and I tell him the same. He asks if a hug is okay and I agree. I don’t know if it was just me, but even hugging him gave me butterflies and I felt a little bad for not being as affectionate as he was. He even makes plans then and there for us to go again soon.

Here’s where things get messy. Afterward, we’re texting a bit and he eventually asks me what I’m looking to get out of this. I’m a little thrown off, but I decide to be honest. I tell him verbatim: “Well, I really like you, but I wasn’t sure if you felt the same so I thought I’d take it slow.”

He tells me that he’s had a rough past few years and recently got out of a long-term relationship. This essentially leads to “I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship right now, but I’d very much like to be friends.”

I tell him I’m okay with that (I do just like having friendly conversations with him, even if I did catch some feelings), but that I would like to know if he thinks something more committed might ever be a possibility (it was forward, I know, but I justified it with wanting to know if I was just being rejected) and he tells me “I absolutely will let you know.”

Essentially, he explains that he doesn’t want to make empty promises, and I tell him I can keep it friendly, I just need to know the boundary is there. He essentially says okay, and to just let him know if it’s ever bugging me. 

I can’t help but beat myself up now and wonder if I was too direct too soon due to lack of experience. A friend I’ve confided to with this told me that it seemed to be a good sign that he was so honest with me and didn’t just try to lead me on into a situationship, but I can’t help but feel a bit ambivalent about whether or not to stay friends with him.

I can go on practically any app to get what I want or to try being with different types of people. For someone who is bisexual, it is literally a playground of queers and fetishes. 

This is not something that I encounter in real life and it takes a long amount of time for someone to open up about this stuff when you start a relationship the normal way. Like most girls and even guys I meet don't start talking about this over sexualized stuff until at least the second date and that is when you go into it knowing it is a date. Forget about actual friendships that develop into relationships. That can take months or years! Whereas, online they start chatting you up about what they want to do to you and sending you nudes within the first few messages. 

Now what is frustrating is that the online dates are quick to chat and then ghost, while the IRL dates are quick to connect but not compatible in the bedroom and/or freak about my sexual history. Since I don't look like the type of guy who'd be into this stuff is there anything that I can do to attract the right type of people that don't really involve the scene type stuff? 

I'm going back to school so how do I get comfortable mentioning this type of stuff earlier on when meeting random people in class or in casual conversation? Do I just lay out a bunch of kinky jokes to see how people react? I also never talk about my online dating habits to anybody IRL.

68,p1ysyn,1628631073,Guy I was talking to chose his ex and her family over me,"I had been following this guy on Instagram for a while now and I made a move and messaged him about two months ago. He reciprocated and also started messaging me occasionally. We ended up hanging out and dating. We had been on a few dates (I would say about 5) and we talked constantly by texting or I would call him occasionally and we just got along really well. He would always say how cute I was and how he couldn't even believe I would talk to him or even like him (think he has kind of low self estem). Anyways, I think he's super cool and last night he asked if I wanted to hang out even though he was super tired from not sleeping well the past two nights which didn't really have anything to do with me at all but he was hanging out with his best friend all night since he picks him up from work. I agreed we could hang out and when we do hang out it's always a good time. We talked a good amount and watched like half of a movie because we were just talking so much and out of nowhere he says he has to go even though he only got there like 2 hours ago. I was a little sad and asked why he had to go and he just said because he was super tired(which he was). It quickly escalated to him saying he had to talk to me about something and I jokes ""are you breaking up with me"" and when he didn't laugh or say no, I knew it wasn't good. He said his living situation had gotten too complicated and he didn't feel like we could see each other anymore tentatively. He was talking about the fact that he lives with his ex girlfriend (and her family) that he was with for about 3 and a half years (since he was 17) and she's the only girl he's ever been with. He had told me this pretty early on and it was a little strange but I honestly didn't mind as long as he said he didn't have feelings for her. His ex is also dating a girl and has been since they broke up pretty much, which was about 10 months ago. The reason he hasn't left is because he has his studio set up there for making music and the lease isn't up for another like 10 months or so and he didn't want to just leave them hanging. It became clear they his ex's mom relies a lot on him for emotional support for some things she's going through and ultimately his ex and her family didn't really like that he was dating and giving them less support. He said he felt like there was a lot of tension and he didn't want them to be upset with him which he said he felt like it was leading up to him having to move out because of it. I didn't really feel too threatened by his living situation because I didn't know him too well and we had just started talking, it wasn't anything serious yet. It was getting serious though and last night he made the decision to end things with us because of it. He basically said he'd rather feel more comfortable at home than to date me and have it be a problem. We hadn't fought about anything up until they point or had any issues. I thought things were going great but I was wrong. I'm super sad now and it's because he was so great to me and I had already thought we were moving forward into something more serious. We hadn't even had sex or anything like that and it was just a nice time and I liked how I felt when talking to him. I obviously got upset when he told me this and I told him he should leave, so he did. I told him I was going to just block him on Facebook because I was so mad. He ended up blocking me on everyone though immediately. Like Instagram, fb, Snapchat even. Does anyone have any advice that would help me move on from this or understand it more? I just can't believe he would choose them over having a good relationship with me. He had other places to live like with his mom, who super wanted him to move back in with her because she was worried his current living situation wasn't healthy for him.

One thing I like to do is actually discuss love languages with someone and ask them what is something I could do that would make them feel loved, appreciated or happy. 

We're not mind readers so while you can probably try to go a long about way of figuring out their love language, it would be easier to have that conversation straight up!

I never crossed any boundaries and neither did she. 

About a month ago she broke off the engagement with her fiancé. As far as I know she broke it off with him and they were on the rocks for the past year. 

Now we started flirting a lot more. Nicknames, touching, stupid pickup lines, she visits me at work when she’s off, the whole thing. Everyone at work jokes that were dating. I enjoy being around her, she laughs at my dumb jokes also makes me laugh. She’s a great person and I’m starting to get more interested. 

Now I’ve never been in relationship before and I’ve got some self esteem issues so I honestly can’t tell if she’s into me or not lmfao. I’ve been reading around about being a rebound and I’m getting a little worried. As far as her EX, she never talks about him whatsoever. Even her friends don’t even bring him up.

84,p20jxh,1628636686,Dating to relationship transition (?) but she will leave for 2 months. Bad timing.,"Hi,

following situation: been dating a girl for 1 month now. We see each other at least every weekend for 2-3 days. Sometimes under the week because we share the same social circle, but we are both working. I am 25, she 22. 
Our chemistry is great, conversations are awesome, great sense, sex is great, sharing common interests and it is absolutely a great level of me being older and sometimes more mature in life, which she appreciates a lot.

The problem now: we had not had „the talk“ and she will leave in 2 months for 2 months working abroad. 

I am thinking about how to proceed here. My feelings say she likes me a lot and why should she spend so much time with me, be so responsive to my actions, if she did not really like me and i am just someone she is seeing. But of course my anxiety voice says, she is younger than me and might feel like missing out something abroad, if she commits. 
I know most of you will say „just ask“ but i kinda fear the rejection and am afraid thing will be weird instead of just enjoying the months and see what it will be like then. But if we continue to date for another 2 months, it would be weird to not to talk about what we are, wouldn’t it?

How would you guys handle this? What is your impression from what i am telling you?

89,p20xh5,1628637933,"Where Exactly Are The Lines Drawn To ""Show Interest"" Without Appearing ""Clingy/Desperate""?","I feel like so many men/women either do not understand this, or even incorrectly weaponize it as an excuse against others because they are lazy/selfish/immature and do not want to develop a relationship for whatever reason.

What specific things do people do to appear clingy/obsessive/desperate? How can they balance this with showing interest? I know it does vary somewhat. I think it's clear that you shouldn't be a stalker on one end, or unresponsive/ghosting on the other. But where would you draw the lines for these in general?

Obviously you don't want to:
- put several ""?""s after they didn't respond to a text, spaced out over several minutes/hours. (Or any messages after no response, for that matter)
- text them every day in the beginning stages.
- be closed off / unresponsive 
- never ask them out or ignore them

But what else?

I like it when women are just honest, and tell me if they don't like me for ""XYZ"" reason. But I understand, some guys are immature and will freak out. But that does not mean women should be immature and not communicate. (My mini rant- sorry. It has just caused me a lot of pain).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p20xh5/where_exactly_are_the_lines_drawn_to_show/

91,p213tt,1628638539,Dating with insecurities,"I (24F) matched with a guy (29M) on tinder about a month ago while he was in my state for work. He and I hit it off really quickly and talk daily. He seems like he’s crazy about me and I feel the same way about him. My only problem is that I have a lot of insecurities toward myself and I feel like it’s going to cause problems. My last relationship before this ended with me being cheated on so that’s a big fear of mine now. In addition to this, I’ve been very overweight my entire life but have lost 120 lbs in the last two years. I still see myself as being very overweight so it’s hard for me to believe that someone would even be interested in dating me at all. Idk where I’m going with this post, but if any of you have any words of wisdom that would be great!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p213tt/dating_with_insecurities/

98,p21ph2,1628640638,How do I tell my best friend I have feelings for him? Should I even risk it?,"Reposted from another sub since I'm really in need of advice right now.

So I, (18F) have known my best friend (18M) for over 5 years. Over the last year, I've developed/ realized that I have a crush on him.

I want to tell him how I feel, but I have no idea how to do so. I have anxiety, overthink a lot, and I'm generally pretty bad at social situations and cues. I can't tell if he feels the same way about me either, so that also adds to me stressing over it. 

I've also heard about other people getting feelings for friends, and the friendship becomes very awkward because the crush is one-sided. I really don't want to ruin my friendship.

I've never had any dating experience or crushes before this, and I'm not very good at expressing how I feel- even when it has nothing to do with romance. I guess I got stuck with a pretty bad combo when it comes to dating, but I want to at least try and make do with how I am.

All advice is greatly appreciated, thanks for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p21ph2/how_do_i_tell_my_best_friend_i_have_feelings_for/
