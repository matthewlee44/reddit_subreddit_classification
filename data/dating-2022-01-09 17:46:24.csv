0,s056g4,1641771987,Should I mention this?,"I was talking to this girl for about a month and a half. She has gotten out of a bad relationship about 4/5 months ago. Me and her first started off as friends and, although we haven’t done anything sexual, we got really close. We talked subtlety about a relationship, however, recently I went in a trip and she joined a bit after. There she said my friends and I were too much (talking about how when we were drunk we tried ti get her to drink with us). She then expressed her feelings about that trip and said “we can be friends. I don’t hate you because you saw today that we can have a normal conversation.”

She did do that, but when we see each other during the day at work, it’s always that way. She mentioned a lot during that first vent text, but now she seems distant. We don’t have any real conversation anymore.

I want to reach out and just tell her:
“You said let’s just be honest with each other.  Nothing is what it was like before between us. I would never want to pressure anyone into anything. That’s not me. I like when people say it as it is. Which is why I liked you. You were real with everything, but I ruined it with the one night on the trip. I honestly wish you wouldn’t judge me based on that night, however, it happened and it is what it is. It’s not something that can be replaced or forgotten.
…
If we are going to be friends then I would actually like to be friends. Not the normal “let’s be friends” where we keep something at heart, but let’s actually forget the past and move on. And if you don’t want to continue being friends then I understand. And don’t think because you don’t want to be friends that I still won’t be there for you..one thing I will always do is hope that everything turns out the best for someone. Talking to me or not. If you ever need anything then don’t worry about me saying no. If I am able to help then I will.”

I am asking if I should because I don’t want to lose her as a friend and would be fine without a relationship, however, I don’t want to have a friend that is only friends because of pity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s056g4/should_i_mention_this/

(only met up with her one time), I did like her but she changed her mind about the whole thing (I think I came across too eager and especially cause of lockdown the convo got stale) and I got a little offended she wouldn’t give me a reason and kind of got a little mad on a phone call about it all. Still embarrassed I even did that.

See her at work on occasion she only works Saturdays. 

Have no feelings for her at all anymore got over it very quickly and that situation is dead and buried. We never spoke about it even in person. I only told one person about it whom I trust and not sure if she told anyone really. 


Fast forward nearly two years have been dating a new coworker for about a month and a half (same job) who I was crushing on for a while. Have been on several dates and spent some nights/evenings together and it is going very very well! I like her more than just attraction, her personality is flawless and she is just so kind and caring I can’t get enough of her. 

Do you think I should tell her about this one off situation or not?

They don’t really talk much at work from what I have seen but I just don’t want this info to maybe be presented to her and she possibly changes her mind about me? or thinks I was hiding things

3,s05in0,1641772909,What would you do in my situation?," I 25(m) am in my final year for my undergraduate degree. I originally went to college right out of High School, but left halfway through my first semester.

After working as a waiter for a number of years I matured a bit and decided to go back to school. So now here I am, a senior at 25.

I am incredibly lucky enough that my parents had saved for my college education, and when I dropped out they basically said ""It's there if you ever wise up and decide to go back""

So at 25(m) I am 100% dependent on my parents as I'm in school full time. I've come to terms with this, but I know that girls won't like the fact that I'm not self-sufficient as a 25 year old adult.(Believe me I don't like it either)

4,s05iof,1641772913,Netflix Breakup,"I had been dating this traditional girl for a year and it’s been rough at times, mostly because she has traditional Asian values and I’m more, contemporary. 

The last fight we had was over a recurring topic, my Netflix subscription that I share with my ex. She hates the sight of seeing her profile there but it’d be a hardship for my ex to pay for outright, so since it doesn’t cost me anything outright, I figure why not?

Am I wrong to resist this? I don’t understand why she can’t get over this topic, and while it’s not the only issue we fight over, it’s front and center because she seems the jealous/possessive type when she asks where I’ve been and with whom I’ve met up with. 

I’m in my mid forties and prone to occasional naps so as flattering as that sounds, the concerns are unfounded. 

Lastly, she doesn’t like the cordial relationship I have with my ex’s family. If she had her way, I wouldn’t be on speaking terms, let alone send Xmas gifts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s05iof/netflix_breakup/

I started seeing Daniel around October so it’s been roughly 3 months. He and I started off very very casually, to be honest I was initially just looking for my sexual desires to be fulfilled. One night, he drove (he’s like 40 minutes away from me) to come see me and we had some amazing sex. He was a bit upset I tried kicking him out after sex, and we talked that night and he said just having sex gets old so he wants more than that - and if it becomes serious, then it does. So we had both agreed to casually date. 

We worked around our weird schedules with my work involving travel and managed to keep seeing each other, except I noticed in the last month or so, he’s texting me more frequently, he’s much more physically affectionate (prior he refrained from this) like handholding, forehead+cheek kisses, just real intimate stuff. We now engage in PDA when we go out in public together. 

Awhile back I asked if he was sleeping with anyone else (mainly out of STD/STI awareness) and he said he isn’t! We didn’t have much more discussion on that and left it there. Over lunch the other day he had made a lot of jokes about my “side pieces” like I was seeing other people, to which I responded “do you really think that I’m seeing other dudes??” lol. He was like oh I’m just joking around, etc. I felt like that was maybe a test to see how I’d respond on that subject.

I don't know where is this going but I'm really enjoying the process of knowing her and she is more and more attractive in my eyes the more I know her.


I don't know with certainty if she likes me but I think at least she has some interest in me. And if she doesn't like me it's totally fine, not everyone it's gonna like me.



For me all of this it's a success because I had to go out of my way at first to speak with her and to invite her to do something together, and I never did that before with another girl.

He gave me his number first, but I barely texted him because I honestly didn’t know what to say half the time. He took me to his date party, but in college that never has a correlation with dating.

27,s073jt,1641777313,Need Help Gauging Interest,"Hey all, first time posting here, and first time needing dating advice in about 5 years now. Might be a long one so bear with me, and thank you in advance if you do.

Context upfront: I'm 23, just got out of a very strenuous 5 year relationship, and am trying my hardest to get back into the dating game, to varying degrees of success mostly boiling down to me just meeting a few good people online. Dating apps have been of no help, Tinder is a waste of time &amp; attention, Hinge fairs a little better. 

Here's where my little tale begins. This last Wednesday I went out for lunch with a coworker &amp; a good friend of mine. Mexican food, ate our fill and got buzzed at 3 in the afternoon. We both walked down to a Bath &amp; Body Works, because I needed to get refills for that little car scent thing they have. I picked one I liked up and made my way to the register. This girl, pink hair in twintails, and a stuffed animal pinned to her uniform. She was very cute &amp; according to my friend, deliberately made a push to come ring us out. She said that they were running a sale, 3 for $10, so I went and picked up 2 more. She replied to that with ""you have good taste"" or something similar. She had this quirky personality about her, from the way she spoke &amp; how animated she was while she spoke.

Now to the issue. I want to ask her out. I haven't asked anyone out in, well, 5 years. I haven't shown or have been shown interest by anyone during that time, so I'm out of the game (not that I knew how to play it to begin with, relationships have always happened out of luck with me). I believe that there was some level of interest she had in me, even if it was minor interest at best. I think the way to do it would be to just go back there, and if I see her, just do the deed. I don't have much to lose, so if I get rejected, there's no skin off my back. I just don't know, though. I'm worried that I'll mess up &amp; ruin what little hope there is for something here. Anything would be appreciated, be it help, advice, or questions that I could answer to clear stuff up, because I know that I've probably missed something while writing this lengthy post out.

28,s07481,1641777367,Should I text him after our date?,"I (29, f) met a guy (30) on Friday night and we went out for about 3.5 hours. When I first walked in he came over and hugged me. We had a great conversation and went to 2 upscale bars that night. 

At one point he even sat next to me and put his arm on the back of the couch behind my back. He even offered to drive me home (and did) then gave me a hug and said “I’ll see you around”. I haven’t heard anything from him since then. 

Does it seem like he’s just not that interested? Or trying to wait it out a bit? He wasn’t texting me consistently before and did mention he was doing something this weekend but it didn’t sound as though it would take all weekend either.

29,s0766a,1641777522,We have to stop using “they’re not that into you” as a blanket reason for when things don’t work out.,"Recently, I was hurt by men who ghosted or stood me up last minute. I took it personally and everyone I went to about the cases said the same thing. “They’re not interested, move on”

Fast forward some time later…

I found out one guy stood me up because he was car-less after totaling his months prior and too broke to take me where I wanted to go that night. It’s all his fault for how he handled it, but I really took it personally. “Some other woman prettier and more interesting called him and he wanted to do that instead.” NOPE.

Another had ghosted me because he spent all the funds he had left fixing his vehicle and some house repairs and was waiting tables somewhere to try and make every dollar he could, picking up any shift he could, and I think took to doing something else he didn’t want me to know about. He didn’t have the time to see me On weekends or evenings when I was off of work and it looked like he just had no time for me. He knew he was disappointing me so he’d just stop responding. Go home and sleep and just say F it. I have a corporate job and if I knew what he was doing I MIGHT thing less of him and cut him off. (His logic)

I’m leaving out a couple of other situations that are too specific and I can’t elaborate here.

Point is, these men liked me and we happened to meet by chance but the timing was really bad for them. They didn’t feel like themselves and weren’t ready to open up to me about insecurities and who would be at that stage.

I’m just here to say that if you KNOW DAMN WELL you felt a connection with someone and that it was mutual, their reasons for falling back may truly not be about you but about themselves instead. 

Dating isn’t just hard for those who want love and get left, but there are men and women out here who want to give you that but are held back by insecurities and who knows what else. 

Ghosting is NEVER okay. Standing someone up is NEVER okay. But reasons people do this is because of how they’ve been treated when they’ve communicated. — Let’s start welcoming people to speak to us about what’s going on instead of reacting to being rejected or whatever excuses they give us. Thank people for their time and wish them the best. If you feel like they’re full of crap, then save that negative energy for when they ultimately try to come back by not letting them in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0766a/we_have_to_stop_using_theyre_not_that_into_you_as/
30,s0777s,1641777606,Should I call a guy out for the difference in his texts?,"I’ve been dating a guy for the past month or so and just noticed within the last week his texts are really different. The one thing that has changed is that the last time I saw him, I asked if he was seeing other people and he said no and I said that’s nice and that I’m not either, and I’m glad we can both focus on one person at the same time going forward. And we were on the same page about everything. Then this past week I haven’t seen him because I went on a work trip, but I’ve noticed there’s been a major change in our texts since we’ve had that conversation. Yesterday he took hours to reply all day, and didn’t even text me at all after 4 PM and didn’t reply to my last text until the morning. 

And then today, he’s been replying sparsely, but hasn’t been reciprocating my flirty texts saying I want to cuddle or that I can’t wait to see him or things like that. He’ll heart them, but that’s about it. That’s not the same thing though, right? 

I guess they’re only reason I’m worried is because last week and a couple weeks before he was texting me nonstop all day long, sending me lovey-dovey things talking about the future and showering me with compliments. The only thing that’s changed is that we had that conversation, and then I went away. But he was on the same page with me about everything and I even told him that if this was a casual thing that’s fine but to let me know and he said “no no no, I like you and I wanna get to know you better. And I like where this is going.” So I thought all was fine. His texts just don’t match up and there’s such a shift and it’s scaring me. It doesn’t feel good to tell someone that you miss them and would love to cuddle with them right now and then they just heart the message and ask what you’re up to… Am I over thinking this? I just feel like he’s not being flirty or reciprocating my sweet texts but maybe this is just how guys are once things become more serious? If this continues, should I say something and ask if he’s still interested, or if he’s having second thoughts? If my flirting is making him feel uncomfortable now or if he’s scared about his feelings for me I would just rather him be honest",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0777s/should_i_call_a_guy_out_for_the_difference_in_his/

Can anyone help?,"Like the title states, I have more or less come to grasp the concept of what pre-selection means. Essentially, if a few girls like a guy, he's considered datebale or atleast attractive. If a man has had no likes or relationship experience he is tossed out like last weeks garbage and is considered a ""loser."" Women base their interests on the perspective of other woman. Fine, I can cope with this.

Now for my predicmanet.

I'm a 28 year old formerly overweight man who has never had a relationship before. Sure I've messed around with a few one night stands, but never had a girlfriend. I think alot of this has to do with my perception of self as well as my external image.

Being fat.

Now that I've lost the weight and am edging toward my thirties with no ""true experience"" to discuss, I'm wondering four things.

1. How true is the preselection bias/game?

2. How much of a red flag is it to have never been in a relationship?

3. Based on my disposition, am I utterly fucked or am I liable to face alot of rejection because of this?

4. Should I just lie and just roll with the ""fake it till you make it"" even if I have to invent a fabricated story just so I can avoid pre-selection bias?

She comes in once a week for a half hour. When each lesson begins we have a quick conversation for a few minutes but it's just the typical ""hey, how is it going,"" or ""anything new in your life?"" Type of conversations. I do kind of crack a joke or try to extend the conversations a little bit but beyond that they don't go very far. This girl is coming to these lessons to have me help her get better at guitar, she's not there to hang out with me so it's hard to try to flirt with her and get to know her better.

It's made me consider asking her out. I have no earthly idea what she thinks of me and if she would say yes. I think either way it would mean that she would probably be stopping lessons with me. Cause here's all the possible scenarios

She says yes, date goes well, we continue going out, it'd be weird to give lessons to someone I'm dating.

She says yes, date doesn't go well, lessons are awkward now

She says no, now I'm teaching someone who rejected me, not fun

So it's probably safe to say she would stop lessons with me and I feel bad about that a little bit because that's what she initially came to me for.

So what should I do? Do I just leave it be? Do I flirt with her a little more in lessons to try to get her to say yes to a date or is that inappropriate? Do I even ask her out at all?

Or should I just wait until she stops lessons all on her own and then ask her? I have no idea when or if that could happen though, could be months. Any advice on this appreciated, thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s09j2r/crush_on_my_guitar_student/

62,s0a2e4,1641785970,"We were on the same page after a conversation about our feelings, and now he’s pulling away.","The guy I’m dating and I basically defined the relationship on our last date and came to the point that we both agreed we weren’t seeing other people and that we wanted to solely focus on each other going forward. Ever since that talk, I’ve noticed a major shift in his communication patterns. His texts are very far and few in between and they’re very, very casual and short which is unlike him. 

He usually showers me with compliments and tells me how badly he wants to see me, and stuff like that.. he was so flirty and sweet to me before we had this talk earlier this week. It’s not like he’s ignoring me, he’s still initiating conversation but I told him I couldn’t wait to see him soon and he just loved the message and changed the subject. 

I don’t wanna keep getting deeper into this if he’s not on the same page as me anymore or if he’s scared. Could he be scared about his feelings, or could it be something else? I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong because he was being so flirty these past few weeks, I thought me being flirty today would be OK but then I felt weird about it when it wasn’t reciprocated. And now it’s been hours since he’s responded again. 

Should I confront him about this and ask if he’s having second thoughts? How long should I wait to ask and what exactly should I say?

Let’s call him ‘R’. Like it was so damn obvious. But the thing is I knew right from the start I wasn’t physically attracted to him. 

So in the past year we get quite close as friends. If he was studying in the library and I asked him to hang out, my friends would legit see him pack his things as quickly as he could to get to me. Also his friends have told me multiple times that he fancies me. I could also sense it over the past year in all our conversations. Mind you, all this time I guess I lead him on cause I never pushed him away. So maybe he always thought he had a chance??? I don’t know. 

So a few weeks ago, there was an event in uni and my friends and I all got drunk… including him. We all then decided to get back to college, but then ‘R’ gets a taxi and he takes me with him. We talked about so many thing during the 30min ride and it was such a good time. He asked me about my type, and even personal questions like “what’s something about you that no one else knows about?”. Like it was so deep and I felt that maybe I do like him. We end up going to his place and he played the guitar of a song I knew in the piano, and we joked around. Then we ended up kissing for so long, and he wanted to have sex but I told him I didn’t then… and he respected it. 

So, I stayed the night and the next day we were fine and i didn’t feel awkward. He followed up with a text asking how I was (from the hangover) etc. The day after this happened up till a few weeks, I could honestly say I didn’t like him like that and felt shit that I made a move on a close friend (didn’t want to sabotage our friendship). So we didn’t bring up about what happened, and basically acted like it never happened. But then a few weeks pass, and everytime I see him I realise I like him more…. Till one day I knew he grew on me and I actually do like him. Maybe it was the distance, I don’t know. So one day I told him we need to talk and I confessed that I I like him, but he didn’t give a definite reply if it was mutual (which hurt). We went for a night drive the same night and had such a good time getting to know eachother. He even said we don’t know much about eachother so I get why he couldn’t verbally reciprocate, but since then he’s been sort of distant. I don’t know if he was after the chase. But thoughts???

I’m not sure the whole story of what’s going on yet (I didn’t have time to see him before he left town) but apparently, he’s going to pick up the cat both of them use to have. 

Him and I are not a couple &amp; are not seriously dating, but the thing is I’m already starting to feel a type of way about him going back to see his ex. The main reason for him going there is to get the cat but I can’t help but wonder if they’re also going to sleep together. 

I’m a little frustrated with myself because I feel like this is something I shouldn’t care about since we’re not seriously dating. We both should be able to do whatever we want since we aren’t exclusive or had that type of intention or discussion. 

When he returns to town part of me feels the urge to ask him if they slept together but then it’s also none of my business and I also partially don’t even want to know because I will likely feel a little hurt &amp; also may feel less of a desire to sleep with him. I’d feel a little icky &amp; a little bad about myself to sleep with someone who just slept with their ex days prior.

He’s excited about the cat &amp; said he looks forward to me meeting it. His trip is several days which is a bit questionable… it makes me think he is using that time to either 1. Reconnect with his ex, 2. See other people, or 3. Just simply make use of out the money spent to travel there &amp; treat it as a mini vacation. \*Sigh\*… I feel like more than likely they will sleep together and who knows, they may end up getting back together.

Is it possible for someone to see their ex and not want to sleep with them? I can say not all my exs have been someone I wanted to sleep with again after the breakup. 

Perhaps this means I am starting to catch feelings? But I DO NOT want to feel jealous or even feel that I don’t want him sleeping with other people but that’s simply how I do feel. 

What should I do when he returns without seeming like a jealous person? Lol

Background: mid 20s, cis-male, not religious, white, college degree, employed

Yesterday I was on a hinge date that I thought was OK, but she hasn’t texted me since we exchanged numbers at the end of the date. I don’t think I’m worried about it not working out with her going forward as I am worried about both feeling rejected and losing her as a connection of any kind. 

We were very sweet to each other on our first date. She revealed she thought I was cute, which was brave of her to say and I was flattered. I worked up the courage to ask to kiss her goodbye while I waited with her for her bus, which she allowed. I loved our one kiss and it made me super happy. 

I’m a romantic type. I felt connected by our kiss, and I hold very special places in my heart for those that share a kiss with me. 

So now that I’m bracing for rejection, I’m just wondering how I can answer these questions in my heart about why I feel so romantic? Desperate? Hopeless? Why I am the way am?

Some of my friends tell me he should have kept in contact with me in the months he went away so that alone is a red flag, while others say that is an unrealistic expectation given that we had only been on 4 dates so I should give it time. I would appreciate anyone's perspective on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0cdj0/should_i_give_it_time_or_stop_hoping/
89,s0ceuq,1641793327,"Update from the other day, we're dating","So we had a third date that came unexpectedly yesterday as her plans changed last moment. We fully enjoyed ourselves and the time we spent. We had that conversation of, ""Are we a thing and actually want to make it exclusive?"" and it was a natural yes from the both of us. 

I have a good feeling about her and she feels the same way about me that it's going to be a long term relationship, hopefully marriage. Yes, it's early on, but we are being realistic but hopeful about it. 

She hasn't dated for 2 years and I haven't dated for 6 1/2. So it's been a while for the both of us, but we are totally fine with that. Both mid 20s, and we are comfortable and can be ourselves around each other, which I fully enjoy. Met part of her family and they like me so that's a plus. She also has a kiddo, we've yet to meet cause they've been with a babysitter (which is fine, she wants to be safe on the first few), but I'm probably going to meet them this upcoming weekend so I'm excited to meet them and introduce myself.

So I have a good feeling about this, hopefully it's meant to last.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0ceuq/update_from_the_other_day_were_dating/
90,s0ci1p,1641793627,Is it normal to want “days off” from my girlfriend,"I dont mean days off like, we just go have sex with other people or something like that. I mean days off like i want her to leave me alone for a couple of days or something. For context im a guy in my early twenties and shes a girl just turning 20. We get along great most days, and we live apart in separate cities so we dont see one another daily but usually every weekend we see one another. But from time to time she’ll come down to my place and spend a whole weekend with me, by the end though i just want my own space and be able to do my own thing. I understand she wants to see me and visit with me, i feel like an asshole because of it but i get so exhausted from doing nothing but hanging out with her, i have to scrap weekend plans  with friends or doing things around my house occasionally because we’ll be visiting for just a night but then suddenly she decides shes staying a whole weekend, or she’ll ask me to stay longer and longer and next thing i know im guilt tripped into staying another night. Im an independent person who likes the freedom to do what i want when i want. It feels like im losing all my time and i feel selfish for not wanting to share all of it with her. The next three weekends shes basically told me what were doing, by the end of today i told her i wasnt coming next weekend and she tried guilting me into coming regardless. I know she just wants to spend time but the clingyness is getting to be too much. What do i do? 

Tl;Dr: GF guilts me into shutting down plans to spend time with her and i feel like im having less and less time to myself",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0ci1p/is_it_normal_to_want_days_off_from_my_girlfriend/

I know it’s unfair to assume they’re all lying but I just don’t know what to believe anymore. I would prefer if they were just honest and said they sleep around. I wouldn’t even care if they did. It’ll just be nice to know, so I know to keep it casual with them and not take them serious.

94,s0co34,1641794183,Rebounding - why is this considered perfectly acceptable?,"Or... Well, if it isn't, then *why do people do this*.

I have only had a tiny handful of serious relationships in my life. Whenever those ended, I flatly refused to even consider getting involved with someone else until I had taken some time, at least several months, worked through my feelings and moved past it - because I knew that if I did not, I would just end up making things worse for myself, while also hurting someone else in the process.

*If you're still not over your ex, then you're not ready to even be thinking about being with someone else*.

It's not going to help one heal in any way. Quite the opposite...

How do people fail to realize how horribly unfair it is? You're literally only setting two people up for even more heartbreak... Not just yourself, but a completely innocent person who probably had absolutely nothing to do with whatever happened in your last relationship and *did absolutely nothing to deserve this.*

So... Why do people do this even though it never, ever ends well?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0co34/rebounding_why_is_this_considered_perfectly/

98,s0d416,1641795624,Dating after abuse,"I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years. I got out a year ago, and took a year to myself to heal. My first real healthy relationship ended because I was too unstable to recognize healthy boundaries, and I got too attached. I took everything as an indication that this person didn’t like me, I was extremely open and vulnerable about my trauma, and I think it trapped him. I’m embarrassed and sad. I was in therapy for a year after my abusive relationship and I really thought I was ready to date. The person he saw was not the person I am. And I’m really sad, because I cared deeply for him, and he showed me what healthy intimacy looked like. I miss him more than I ever missed my ex. Has anyone experienced this? How do I even approach dating with all this trauma? I feel broken and damaged. 😔",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0d416/dating_after_abuse/
