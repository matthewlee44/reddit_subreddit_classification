I started chatting to a girl on Bumble, we exchanged numbers, chatted a little on whatsapp and then we've now met up twice.

I wouldn't call it a date per se, because all that's happened is we've proceeded to stifle any awkwardness with heavy dousing of alcohol and went on to fuck several times after. Whether we actually *vibe* or not sober is another issue. 

Thing is, I dont know what she thinks or even what she wants. Does she want marriage and kids? Does she only want dick? I mean I personally don't want a full blown relationship right now but I'd be open to like, keep this *arrangement* going, so long as it's mutual obviously.

But she hasn't once said *that was really good lastnight* or *you're nice* or even if she said *you're too arrogant, bye* 

I think the word is reticent. Also I mean, I may be wrong but, I think if I just left our convo on Instagram alone, I don't think she'd reach out.

Some people who have not had sex for long stretches can take solace in the thought ""I wasn't trying"" but I have been trying all that time, every different way I can think of and still absolutely no success.

I know someone will come with the platitude of 'stop trying so hard and it will drop in your lap'. I have tried simply 'doing what you enjoy' and made no difference. I started volunteering and made some good friends through that and nothing has changed in this department. What is worse I keep hearing about these new people I met getting into and out of relationships which really does make me think something is wrong with me.

Thing is I used to have sex in my 20s. Not as much as I wanted, I always felt deprived, in hindsight I see that was likely due to not following up on relationships, but now in my 30s I am dry. So I know what to do, or rather I did, but something has changed. I think society has changed but I just don't know how to adapt because I don't know what is wrong.

It is interesting to browse this subreddit to see this is quite a common phenomena.

Maybe all the hot vivacious couples are just the top 1% that are most visible in society while there is a gigantic underbelly of hidden and forgotten sexless people like me that make up the majority of the population, like the troglodytes.

It doesn't help my parents constantly asking me *do you have a girlfriend yet*! and then shaming me when I say no telling me I am ""too picky"" as if I am getting offers for dates left and right around the clock and I am just turning them all down.

Then you have the constant bombardment by the general media telling you of all the celebrities and their relationships, and pop music being drilled into your mind in every retail store with its sex mad focus.

I get that complimenting may be flirty (although not necessarily), but even then, I find it hard to distinguish between flirty and friendly compliments.

backstory: 

I (23f) have been talking to/dating this guy (23m) for around 5ish months now. We met on a dating app in September and immediately hit it off! We have similar interests, view/outlook on life, dumb shitty humor, and generally just understand each other well. We are 30ish minutes away from each other and he‚Äôs in school and I‚Äôm working a lot. Among other reasons (we both kept getting sick, the holidays, and he spent and entire month back home to visit his family), we weren‚Äôt able to actually meet up until middle of January. Mind you, we had talked to each other EVERY SINGLE DAY within that time period. And not just a couple scattered messages throughout the day, but consistent (and often ‚Äúdeep‚Äù) conversations.

Our date in January went really well and we ended up talking for 4+ hours at a coffee shop. Since then we have only physically seen each other a handful of times, but have become really comfortable with each other. We‚Äôve had sex, which I wasn‚Äôt really expecting as I have extremely bad self esteem + body issues and problems with intimacy from past religious trauma (he knows minor details about both). He made me feel extremely safe + wanted and I appreciate that so much. He expressed the same feelings. At this point we are still texting every day. Overall i enjoy his company a lot. It doesn‚Äôt feel forced, but natural. 

I think it‚Äôs important to say that I am not very experienced with dating. I‚Äôve never been in a defined relationship and I don‚Äôt regularly date. I‚Äôm really not a huge fan of dating apps because they seem disingenuous to me so I will usually only use them for entertainment purposes or to find friends lol. Which is why that early on I was surprised I kept talking to him. He is also from a different country, and has told me many times that dating in the US is way different than back home. 

so my question is this: is it too soon to have a DTR talk? I am not seeing anyone else and I don‚Äôt plan to, but I have no idea what is going on inside his head. At this point I like him enough that I don‚Äôt want him talking to any other girls. Especially if we continue to sleep together, because of course if he‚Äôs intimate with others I need to know in order to be safe. I‚Äôm not really sure how to bring it up. I am pretty sensitive to rejection so I‚Äôm nervous. I just don‚Äôt know what to think and I often get in my head trying to understand what‚Äôs going on and then I spiral üò≠

my god that was long oops!! lololol
but what the fuck do i do??? am I crazy for wanting him to myself???? help ??

I met him at university, and I've known him for half a year now. He's flirted with me in the past, and I'm pretty sure he likes me. Even if he doesn't see me in a romantic light, he at the very least finds me attractive. I know he'd at the very least be down to have sex. It's hard for me to tell, because he's always been very respectful. If he does have a fetish, he's not like a stereotypical guy who constantly comments on a girl's ethnic background and dresses in traditional Asian attire. He's a nerdy guy, and likes a lot of anime and video games. He's what you'd consider to be a weeb. I'm a weeb too.

In high school, he was in a five year long relationship with a Korean girl. He and I grew up in the same hometown, where the population is predominantly Hispanic. Asians only make up about 3% of the population. On Instagram, he follows several Asian pride accounts. He sometimes posts stories of political awareness, but 95% of the time, it's regarding Asian pride/rights, even though he himself is Hispanic. There's a girl at our school who I know for a fact he doesn't like, but finds her really pretty. She's half Filipino half white. He even follows at least one girl that he doesn't know, only has like 1000 followers on Instagram (so she's not an Instagram model), and she's an Asian chick, and even though he doesn't know her, he likes every single one of her pictures.

The reason why this concerns me is because I'm mostly Hispanic, but also part Asian. My great grandfather was Chinese, so I'm barely even Asian, but I've had several people tell me that I look Asian. Even people that are Asian themselves tell me that I look like I can be half Asian. My friend even told me the other day that the way I do my makeup makes me look even more Asian. I asked my brother later if I look more Asian the way I do my makeup, and he said yes. It also doesn't help that because of COVID, we don't see each other's full faces. So in all likelihood, my crush probably thinks I look Asian. If he doesn't think that, my Chinese last name will sure do the trick. Do you think he may have a fetish for Asian girls?

I get that we all have preferences. We all do. He just happens to prefer Asian chicks. That's fine. Some people prefer Hispanics, Caucasian, Black people, but I'm having trouble differentiating as to whether he thinks I'm pretty in general, or if he thinks I'm pretty because I'm Asian?

Since I was 16 I‚Äôve been trying to be a stereotypical bad boy. In high school I saw the way the guys that were assholes to me behaved and how they got all the girls and tried to emulate that. It obviously never worked and it was just something I can look back on now and cringe. 

So now I‚Äôm left with me. Just me. I don‚Äôt even know if I have a true personality because I‚Äôve spent so long trying to be someone I wasn‚Äôt. I know I have interests and traits that I either ignored or suppressed to make myself cooler and now they‚Äôre back.

But now I‚Äôm left wondering when it‚Äôll be my turn. The same type of guys are still getting all the girls in college and I feel like there‚Äôs no market for guys like me. I have good qualities but I don‚Äôt think anyone wants that yet. My therapist has told me that the qualities I have now aren‚Äôt what girls my age are looking for so I should look for things other than sex and relationship for the time being. 

I didn‚Äôt think to ask her when that time would be. I think im dependable, hard working, intelligent, soft spoken, kinda nerdy when it comes to history and science, I‚Äôm sensitive and thoughtful and a good listener, but it just feels like no one wants that yet.

All this made me slowly fall for him, which I realized in the meanwhile that it was not reciprocated.
We had to say goodbye because he came back to Europe and I continued my trip, so I didn't think I will see him again (at least not for the next 3-4 months) because I had plans to go down to South America, however due to unexpected reasons, my trip was brought to a grinding halt so I returned to Europe. You'd think it's great because now I can meet him again but guess what OP did? I told him that I have long term goals of becoming a mom and getting married and, if we see each other again, I want it to be in a meaningful way, where we consciously consider a potential future together.
He could not guarantee that, and I realized I'm more invested than he is, therefore we agreed not to see each other again, which was really sad and painful but I accepted that he can't give me what I want, and that I have to follow my intuition and not get attached to him even more by meeting again.
Then, 2 days later, he offered to see me just as a friend and I accepted which made my hopes get high up again.
I know I should not be expecting anything out of this potential encounter, since I agreed to see each other just as friends but it really bugs me that now, the dynamic is one where I feel like I'm chasing. I sent him a voice note explaining how and when I can come visit him and proposing some plans about our potential encounter and he hasn't even replied (more than 12 hours have passed).

We had a pretty PG-13 hookup at my apt, I'm insanely attracted to her physically, but throughout it became clear i wasn't going to be interested in her for the long term. 

I can be kind of a sensitive dude, and she was pretty blunt with some comments about my body that didn't make me feel great, honestly.

I'm trying to figure out how best to break things off now. It feels really shitty hooking up one night, and then sending a message the next day saying thanks, but no thanks. I don't suppose there is an outcome here where I am not seen as a jerk, but i was hoping to get some thoughts on what to do or crafting the right message to do the least amount of damage. 

The weird thing is, I'm really surprised she doesn't feel the same way. I don't think I'm her type and have casually mentioned that to her somewhat in jest, but she kinda ignores it or pretends that what she just said that doesn't fit my description isn't a big deal or whatever. 

And like, selfishly, based on her comments, I'm also kind of concerned about sending her into psycho mode. And now she knows where I live...

Long post warning. 

I thought a positive post would give you some motivation I desperately needed some time ago.

So, first and foremost, don't give up on dating! Meeting new people always, and I mean always, make you something more.

Short bio 30 y/o (m), uni dropout. Contract worker for IT / agile / project management.

Exactly one year ago I was past two long term relationships (5 y. And 4y) and looking for the one. Luckily, we had just had our first date.

How did I find her? Just hear me out.

My Tinder profile was just myself near a desk I used for remote work. Lokal IT guy, in a tshirt. My second picture was with 20 clips on my hair with bits of my niece in the background. Nothing more 

My bio was just that I'm a cuddler, and looking for another one. 

Tip 1.: Be honest and for honesty you shall be after. 

1. I hoped to filter out all women not bothering to ask who that is.
2. I was looking for a serious relationship.

So, one day, swiped right. On a girl with a glass of wine in her hand and a bio stating ""just don't be a dick"". A match. 

I wrote to her, that I happen not to be one occasionally. 

Shortly after a few exchanges I invited her over to my place as I usually did. Why? Cuz I am was always open about the fact that I lived in a 30m2 flat that was just suitable for me and I saw nothing wrong with that.

Tip 2: If a woman does not find your present understandable, she's not worth sharing your future with. Be open about it. 

So, this means I'm cooking or ordering. 
I already asked before what kind of food she likes, the answer was burgers. Asked about sushi as this is my go to for snacks. 
Jackpot. Made burgers, ordered sushi.

Tip 3. Making and eating food is around 30% of the time you have during weekdays. It's extremely important to match your eating habits. Don't pretend you like grass if you're a meat lover. 

Two days before the scheduled date, I tested positive for covid...

Immediately sent her the result with a request to postpone it 2 weeks. She agreed. Told me later that she totally thought I was bailing on her, but the picture of the test was enough to convince her. 

Tip 4. Don't postpone o purpose, but if she is willing to wait for the first date, she's probably looking for more than an ons. 

Got better-ish (year afer still struggling with lung performace), she remained in touch the whole time. 

Day before date i asked about the dress code. And by that I made this very clear that's a casual burger time and a sweater and jeans are welcome. She agreed. 

Tip 5. Don't go out of your comfort zone on the first date. She's to meet you. Not the guy you wish to be. 

A day before I asked about drink of choice. Beer-like fruit mango flavored drinks was the answer. Stockpiled for both her and myself as I don't mind these at all. 

First date was awesome. Just talked for hours about who we are, what we do, and shared some funny stories. Also got stupidly messy with the burgers. Turns out she's a physics engineer looking to start her masters. We share interest in astrophysics it seems. 

Fun fact: these days she says she misses the trivia that I dropped. Like, vampires don't show up in mirrors cuz once they were made of silver and now just polished aluminium, so that i might still be a vampire and she'd never knew. 

Tip 6. Enjoy your sense of humor. If she does too, that's awesome. If she doesn't, she won't suddenly start just because you look good. If she's any smart at least. 

She texted her best friend a few times to ensure her she's fine. Which is good. If she's fine sharing your company with her friends, you're doing something right. 

Tip 7. Very important. Don't press her to stay any longer than she wishes to. If she goes, she goes, not buts. Just ask her to text you when she arrives. If she does, there will be another date, if she doesn't, don't text until the next day, and only text to ask if she's OK. If she forgot. She'll explain, if she doesn't, move on. You did your part. 

Now a year after this date. I'm about to propose, and we already agreed so it's a formality. 

Along the way, she started has Masters, I reentered uni. Both on the right track. 

We had one argument within that year, while seeing each other 2-3 times a week, and we cleared it by nighttime. 

FINAL TIP: Look for someone you can disagree with and still enjoy the time spent disagreeing. Respect for the other one is invaluable. 



Hope this helps anyone. 
I wish I could share all the good feelings I have thanks to her. 

Damn, I could write another one just about meeting her parents, but that another story.

He knows what it means to have a partner. He told me he is looking for something long term ideally. I am searching for the same.

He is brilliant, has a fantastic job, his own condo, and is very very very handsome. He‚Äôs empathic and kind hearted and adores his mom and grandmother as well as his kitty. He has a group of friends who he hangs out with regularly and his own interests. 

I had my period on our first date but we still slept together anyways. I couldn‚Äôt keep my hands off of him and him to me. It was amazing! 

Something I‚Äôm worried about is my recent involvement with an abusive person. We‚Äôve gone no contact and I feel over the hump of it but it does come up in my head from time to time. I‚Äôm having trouble trusting people and myself. I don‚Äôt want to come off as insecure. I don‚Äôt know if I even feel comfortable sharing this with him and wouldn‚Äôt for at least a few months. 

I also had three deaths in my family this year and a miscarriage. The guy knows I‚Äôve had a ‚Äúchallenging year‚Äù but I haven‚Äôt really shared much. Im afraid he‚Äôll be scared away if he finds out I do not have family besides a sister and that recently my mental health hasn‚Äôt been good due to these circumstances.

He works in healthcare and seems really compassionate and realistic so I don‚Äôt see him reacting poorly but I truly am very nervous about eventually opening up. He was sharing something personal and said he very rarely gets angry which made me feel safe.

I don‚Äôt want to screw this up and I like him. He seems like he could make a good partner if we do continue feeling chemistry, which he expressed he feels. No matter how hard I try to find red flags with him, I‚Äôve yet to see one. He seems like a genuine guy.

During the course of the semester, there was one student--one year younger than me--who tried to spark conversations with me after class. Eventually, he attended my office hours just to ask questions about me and walked with me as I left. He was conventionally attractive and seemed to have a good heart. He's quite charismatic, but his demeanor shifted around me--stumbling over words, saying things that didn't make sense, etc. I kind of assumed that he was interested in me. 

The day after the final exam, he sent me an email explaining that he planned to ask me out at the end of class, but he didn't want to put me in an awkward position in front of the professor. I left immediately after class ended, and I saw him waiting outside the classroom, so this made sense. He said that I was kind, intelligent, and accomplished and that he wanted to get to know me more, so he asked me out for coffee. I agreed to go out with him once grades were posted. As a side note, he ended up doing quite well in the course. 

Anyway, we ended up getting coffee in the evening, and he treated me perfectly. He got there early, met me outside the coffee shop, held the door for me, paid for my drink, and walked me to my car when it ended. He asked me deep, genuine questions about my life. In occasional breaks from barrages of compliments, he asked about my motivations, career aspirations, family life, favorite books, etc. The coffee date actually lasted very long, clocking in at just under three hours. By the end of the date, even though I didn't feel a spark, I thought he was kind enough to give a second shot. Before we left, he looked into my eyes and said, ""I think you're great."" You could tell by his tone and body language that he genuinely believed it, and it was pretty flattering. When we got to my car, he held his arms out, giving me the option to hug him. I gave him a light one and got into my car. I later learned that he actually went to the coffee shop a few days earlier to check the best time to come.

Afterward, I spoke to my sister and mother, and they seemed to think he was amazing. I could easily recognize that he's a good person, but I just didn't feel attracted to him. 

Eventually, the second date came, and it mirrored the first in many ways. He asked me to lunch. He found a place within walking distance of my apartment and even checked the menu for vegan options for me. During the first date, I flippantly mentioned that I wanted some fuzzy socks for Christmas, so when he walked up to my apartment he had fuzzy socks for me. I thanked him, and we walked to the restaurant. He held the door for me, and--to my surprise--he actually had a reservation even though it was mid-day and the restaurant was almost empty. He said he got it, ""Just in case it was a little busy."" He spent the time complimenting me and asking me similarly deep questions. When the bill came, I seized it and paid. He protested and repeatedly asked me if I was sure. After he bought coffee and socks for me, it felt fair to pay. 

Before leaving, he asked if he could talk to me for a second about something. Likely sensing my hesitation, he told me that he didn't want to make me feel uncomfortable by taking me on more dates if I didn't want to go. He said that he'd prefer to be disappointed over making me feel uncomfortable. I told him that I wasn't sure and that I only date people I could see myself marrying. He said that he only dated people he could consider marrying too and that my long-term orientation was one of the things that initially attracted him to me. He said that too many people at our ages--19 and 20--are too interested in partying and drinking, and I was different. 

He walked me back to my apartment and asked if he could hug me before I went inside. I agreed, and he hugged me tightly. I thanked him for the socks and the kind word and told him that I would call him in the next few days telling him my feelings. 

I eventually chose to go with my gut and called to say that I just don't feel a spark. He took it gracefully. He told me that all the kind things he said about me were just as true as before, and he was certain that people around me saw them as well. I called him a gentleman with many great traits. At the end of the conversation, I could tell that he was on the verge of tears, and he said that he enjoyed getting to know me and said goodbye. Given that our university is as large as it is, it's rare that we'll ever see each other again.

So I‚Äôm pretty new to the dating scene as I‚Äôve only had one long term relationship that ended a little while ago and didn‚Äôt really get too much experience with dating etc.

I have a crush on a guy I met at work as co workers, I think he‚Äôs really cute and nice and when we have spoken we really seem to vibe and get along! (He is single and everything) Obviously I had no real idea but I kind of thought he also had a bit of a crush on me too? He always looked excited to see me at work and little things like that. I added him on social media and he likes all of my posts and everything like that!

I recently stopped working there (which I was a little sad about because I wasn‚Äôt sure when I‚Äôd see him!) so I thought maybe I‚Äôd try and message him and get to know him better, the convo was alright and I feel like we had some flirty banter (compliments, joking about hanging out etc) though he is a very slow replier! I don‚Äôt really read too much into that as he doesn‚Äôt seem much of a social media user. 

We went out the other night and my friends (also from work) invited him and he said he‚Äôd try and come but didn‚Äôt (again no worries could be any reason, maybe we just missed him), I messaged him at the end of the night a casual ‚Äúsad I didn‚Äôt see you tonight!‚Äù but he hasn‚Äôt replied (or read it yet to be fair) and I‚Äôm just kind of getting the vibe that maybe I‚Äôve read things wrong and he‚Äôs not interested in that way? Again I‚Äôm pretty new to this so I‚Äôm not great at reading signs or anything like that, I don‚Äôt want to be really pushy/desperate and always the only one messaging if he‚Äôs really not interested! 

I‚Äôm just a little upset that I seem to have read things wrong and a bit embarrassed, how do I deal with being upset about a crush? And how do I read situations like this with guys better in future?

I am not arguing that validity of that being true, as I know how many women -- especially those in larger cities where single women outnumber single men in the dating pool -- begin to really find it difficult to meet a man looking for a relationship when they enter their mid-30s and older. Hookups and flings are aplenty, but finding the right guy willing to commit? Yikes. And if they're not trying to hook up with you, most of them are trying their hand with women far younger than they should be considering.

I think something that doesn't get talked about is the male equivalent of that, and that would be how when guys who are single and do NOT live in big cities start to lose their dating value as well sometime around entering their mid-late 30s. This is not to say that the well dries up completely, but what happens is that you are in standard suburban or metropolitan communities where your options with single women around your own age begin to come very limited and scarce because most have already met someone, are getting married and so forth. If you hop on a dating app (because it's your only lifeline,) the interest you receive starts to skew a lot older with women in their late 40s-early 50s. 

In most instances, those women are divorced and have children, which is not a judgement on them, but -- at least in my personal experience -- they also tend to be looking for something casual, as many are new to being single themselves. Some guys are fine with this, because guys are thirsty as f\*ck and see it as easier or a fantasy situation, but if you're a guy looking for a relationship with someone more relatable who you can share interests with and relate to where you are in life, this isn't ideal, especially if you yourself have never been married and don't have any children. Even if you are willing to meet someone further out, the options of older women to more age-relative matches starts to look something like 75% women ages 45+ and 25+ women in their 30s.

We met about a year and a half ago and became close friends. 

About a month ago we started sleeping together, and he admitted he likes me and has fallen for me. I asked him why now ? (I‚Äôm moving to a different country in 3 weeks). His answer was that he regrets it and should have told me sooner and spent more time with me. 

The last month we‚Äôve grown very close (dates, talking about what we want in the future, talking about having kids together and marriage ect). 

But last night I saw a bunch of texts on his phone at 3 am from a girl. He quickly closed it and when he went to shower he took his phone with him. 

He keeps saying he‚Äôs gonna miss me a lot and how he‚Äôs gonna come visit me when I move and how I‚Äôm the only girl he‚Äôs sleeping with. I just don‚Äôt know if I should believe it. 

I‚Äôm leaving in a few weeks and I don‚Äôt want to fall even more than I have now. Also he has a BAD rep when it comes to dating and sleeping around (he‚Äôs slept with 4-5 girls that I know of in my circle, and I‚Äôve heard stories that he is super into cheating). But I‚Äôve never seen this side to him. All I see is an amazing sweet guy who‚Äôs super caring and emotional. 

Is it uncalled for to just ghost him? Im moving out of the country for at least 3 years, and don‚Äôt really think our friendship would have lasted anyways. We‚Äôre not together so I don‚Äôt really feel the need to mention the texts. But after last night I got a really bad vibe from him.

around the middle of our entire time knowing each other so far, we exchanged numbers and snapchat and did talk a bunch almost all day for a week which i'll admit was too much, i think i was a little clingy but he still responded to everything, and by this point, i'm pretty sure he's not interested in me anymore and lives about an hour away and is working during his gap year. we've only met once so i'm not too let down about this but i do think he's funny &amp; good person but eventually we stopped talking on discord/snap/text. i had brought up some ideas for another meet but he didn't seem too enthusiastic so i killed the thought.

for a while, i thought he would fully ghost me but started texting a bit dry on instagram so i just matched his energy. he keeps sending me memes and i keep fully expecting him to ghost me so i also send 1-2 memes everytime he sends me some. i'm not really sure what his intentions are since his ex broke up with him almost a year ago but neither am i because i've never been in a relationship before.

I *really* just need...someone to talk to about this, I feel like I'm going crazy.

In 2014 (I was 24) I met this guy (will call him Max), on a dating app. I was 4 years younger than him, and in complete honesty, not in the place to date seriously (was more dating bc I was curious). I had gotten out of a very deep/longer relationship only a year earlier and hadn't fully healed from it. Max and I dated for about 5 months, but, I eventually ended up moving abroad. I liked him while we were dating but, my mind was also very focused on plans of traveling and teaching abroad bc it was something I had committed to doing. There were some thoughts about us trying to stay long-distance but we eventually mutually agreed it would be better to break up, we were both in our 20s and I knew I'd be gone for at least a year or more.

Fast forward...

We somewhat stayed in touch while I was abroad, writing back and forth every now and then. When I returned, after a few months of being back, I bumped into him while out and about (I live in a smallish town). We re-connected, but I was very intentionally trying to be *friends* with him (wouldn't let him pay for me, he would call me things like ""amiga."") During *this* whole time, I was in a VERY dark spot mentally, trying to figure a lot out about myself. I don't think I ever really told him that, I just tried to always pretend that I was fine. But I absolutely wasn't, internally.

After over a year of being friends, he eventually asked if I would consider dating again. Deep down I knew he still had feelings for me, and, I actually think I had them for him, but I know I was very intentionally stomping them down bc I just didn't feel I was up for a serious relationship. I was carrying loads of depression during this time and was overall a total mess. 

I met up with him and just told him I really liked our friendship but didn't think we had chemistry. I know I hurt him a lot. The killer was, I had actually been casually dating someone else during this period, but only for maybe a month or two and it was more hook-up dating because again I knew I wasn't in the place for anything serious (I did tell Max about this guy, not a lot though). At the same time, Max told me about a few girls he had been trying to date during this time, none of them working out.

He claimed he was still ok remaining as friends but...I never saw him again after that, after a few weeks he stopped talking. I totally get it and completely understand, I know he didn't want to be around me with one-sided feelings.

That was 4 freaking years ago. I've seen him every now and then in passing but nothing's ever said. BUT, we have this tiny connection on Strava (a running app) and he almost always likes my runs/rides.

So, the other week, out of the blue, I reached out to him (texting) and after 3 hours of catching up, I apologized for my past self for not giving  us a shot to date again when he brought it up in 2017. He said no apology was needed and that he had no regrets. Everything is ""square.""

But, I've realized that we really...I think we really could have something very special, if the fucking timing just worked. I've been missing him a *lot*, *a lot*, I don't think he has any idea. I know he's still single, and I'm still single. I know at this point the ball's in his court if we were to reconnect - I was the one who reached out the other week randomly, and I messed so much up in the past already. But now I just feel so heartbroken, realizing really just how much I miss him, and how much I want to see him again, and how much I wish we'd been able to meet at a time when I was ready for a committed relationship. I don't know if there's anything I can do really besides just sit here feeling heartbroken, probably how I made him feel, and wonder what things would be like if I had given him that second chance.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163521,public,self,I've been very certain that I've just repeatedly had terrible timing with someone who ...
