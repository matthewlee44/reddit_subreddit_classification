2,ospqk9,1627401782,Marriage Ultimatum!! Advice Needed!,"Hi everyone,

A little background here. So I (23) and my girlfriend (21) have been living together for about half a year and dating for almost a year and a half. She’s told me several times before that if I don’t propose by the end of next summer that she will leave. For me, it’s hard to make relationship decisions let alone any decision when I’m pressured into doing something. Don’t get me wrong I really love her but I don’t want to get married yet. 

She’s a very insecure person and I can’t help but think she’s trying to do this so she can grab ahold of me tighter. She doesn’t want to lose me but insisted on leaving next year if there’s no proposal. She’s still in school as a senior and has an entire school year left. I have a full time job. I’m just not sure if this ultimatum is a sign for things to come in the future or not. She has told me that she knows what she wants and knows what she deserves. I totally agree that I want to give her the world and I have. I just think pressuring someone into something as serious as marriage sends the wrong message. 

Like I said, she’s very insecure and doesn’t like me talking with other girls. Ever. If I do, she better get a run down of every complete thing that was said. Anyways, her history says she is very insecure and she tells me it’ll go away once we get married but it’s hard to go into the future and believe this is true. I still feel like her behavior will continue even after marriage. And once marriage happens that’s it. I believe in sticking it out with your partner unless something terrible happens and you need to end it. So I don’t want to have a regret that once I marry her the behavior will continue or even get worse and then not be able to get out of it. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ospqk9/marriage_ultimatum_advice_needed/

11,osrev9,1627407343,The most random “date” of my life.,"I’m not sure why I’m even writing this but figured I’d share. So for a little back story, I’ve been divorced for 2 years and have been dabbling in the dating scene for a year. I haven’t had the beat luck but I have gone on a few dates but nothing materialized. (Other than one and I dumped her because we just didn’t gel together). So I recently got on hinge and I match with a seriously attractive woman. I figured it wouldn’t go very far but holy shit, she’s into my average looking self and we have a great conversation over a few days. I tell her I’d love to take her on a date and she agrees so we say Monday night after work we will meet up for this first date. 

Well here’s where it gets interesting. Saturday we are taking and having our usual great conversation and she says “you should come down to my place now” which is 2 hours away. I was doing side hustle (food delivery) and said fuck it, I’ll go. I get there and it’s her and her mother and her step dad. They have food grilling and plenty of alcohol that we all start sharing and drinking. I’m having a great time and we are still figuring each other out but her mom and step dad are having great conversations with me. The girl I’m there seeing calls her friend and is bragging to this friend about how amazing it’s going and that she should come over to meet me. So her friend comes over and we meet and I could sort of tell that she wasn’t a fan. 
She was grilling me pretty harshly on a lot of questions. I handled it all pretty well and nobody thought much of it. Well it gets late and everyone goes to bed, I thought I would crash on the couch or something that night or even my car but to my surprise she takes me to her bedroom and we hooked up. I know it’s not generally good to hook up on a first date, especially if you both had been drinking but it consensually happened. We cuddled all night, talked about how great it is we met, how excited for Monday we were. I even got invited to some family reunion next Saturday. 

Well we wake up a little late and I could just tell something was weird. She wasn’t really paying any attention to me and was weird. I started to get a little worried but hey maybe we are all hungover and just needed the day to recover. I drove 2 hours home and it’s been weird since and I’m kind of at the point where I’m just accepting she’s not interested. She bailed on the Monday night date which I knew was coming. It kind of sucks because I for sure am into her but I’m thinking she wasn’t really that interested in me but maybe got caught up in the moment. I wouldn’t of driven 2 hours for sex, not for nothing but I was really into her and wanted to get to know her. Maybe I should of said no to the sex or even going in general down there and gotten to know her first. Maybe i was just the flavor of the week. Maybe her friend said something or didn’t approve. I’m not sure but I’m pretty bummed out but I guess if anything I had a good time with some good people, just pretty confused I guess on what happened where a flip just switched instantly. 

TLDR: My average looking self somehow pulled a solid 9 or 10 and fucked it all up in an unknown way after driving two hours to her house where her family was having a barbecue.

I’ve met girls at parties, dating apps, bars, clubs, through friends, through volunteer work, if you can meet someone through it over done it, and nothing. Not one girl has liked me. I don’t mean like “this one girl liked me but I didn’t like her” no, not a single girl I have met has been attracted to me or interested in me beyond friendship.

I don’t know what I’m doing that’s so wrong or why I’m so repulsive to women. I feel so hopeless. I can barely even get a text back and all of my friends have at least 3 girls trying to date them.

20,ossrx5,1627411816,Ending My Online Dating Journey,"After my last date with a real cute girl I have decided to end the online dating journey.

Also after comparing my in person approaches with girls to all of my online dating experiences it has literally been nothing but a massive waste of time as well as stressing me out and frustrating the hell out of me.

For me if I walk up to a girl and talk to her and get her number we have just through all the bullshit that can take weeks to get over with online dating. I'm a man of action so I like to do things rather than talk about them which apparently isn't common in my experiences.

Regardless of how gorgeous the girls are online, how awesome our texts conversations go, and how I may ""think"" things are going they are always the complete opposite. Yes you should have no expectations but I can't blindly put my hope in something when I am trying to find something serious.

Typically the chances of a girl wanting to go out is so small it's almost non existent.

I changed my profile, had new pics, tried new things, have different mindset. Always end with the exact same results of flaky girls OR girls who don't know what they want.

I don't wanna be around girls that have no idea what they want when I know exactly what I want. That's where I knew I have been wasting time. Also thinking back to every girlfriend I ever had was because I walked right up to them and started a conversation and got their number. I find it very easy compared to the Looooong process of matching, texting, trying to be funny over texts, and hoping this random girl wants to hangout. 

My last date was last week with a girl who presented herself as someone cool but was blindsided when I met this girl in person. All she did was complain about her life and every effort to change the subject was interrupted but more bullshit I could have cared less for. I never felt so drained after a date 

I'm glad it works for some people but this isn't my style. In college people on tindr and other dating apps seemed to always want to meet. These days I'm put on hold for a week or two and by then I pretty much have lost interest in this person I never met.

I can't present myself online using pictures and words. In person creates a synergy that's impossible to create unless you are face to face. So I'm done with this because it's quite boring and I already know what to expect 99% of the time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ossrx5/ending_my_online_dating_journey/

He reciprocated, and I replied saying I’m excited to see him again and to let me know when works. It’s been silence since then.

32,osttdo,1627415269,I met a guy on Tinder and we really hit it off in our first date.

We laughed, had fun, I stayed over and we spent like a whole day together. 
He texted me after the first date saying he had a great time and wanted to see me again so we set up a second date for last Saturday.
That same day he went on a really long hike so instead of meeting at 7 we met at 9pm. 
I was spending time at my best friends house with other two friends and I, because we’re so chill, thought it was a good idea for him to come over and experience this event (he’s here in my city for only 3 month’s, he’s from Germany).
The thing is that day I was extremely tired from a bad night sleep the night before and I didn’t think this through. It was too much to have him meet my friends so soon and even tho he did amazing, it was all a bit awkward and more awkward things kept happening after, even when we were already just the two of us (like the Lyft taking so long to come I had to call Uber instead, etc).
I sent him a text yesterday saying that even tho he said it was all good I apologize for the let’s just say not so smart decision I made and that I still wanted to hang out again.
That was yesterday 7pm and it’s 1pm next day, he never texted back.

36,ostxkc,1627415663,Am I the red flag?,"I recently went out on a few dates with someone who, after our third date, told me he’s not connecting with me in the way he’s looking for. 

We met on a dating app about 2 weeks before I moved to the new city we both live in. I normally don’t like to converse too much with a potential date before meeting in person as I think it adds pressure to meeting a total stranger. However, with him it felt so natural, we had a great rapport and ended up keeping in touch consistently until my move.

Our first two dates went really well and we had obvious physical attraction to each other. A lot of making out on the first and second dates. We also communicated daily after the initial date. All signs pointed in a positive direction. 

On our third date, which was 24hrs after our second (his idea to see each other on an impromptu second date the day before) he seemed subdued but still overall normal, nice convo and a few drinks after dinner. Based on the physical signs and flirty banter we had via text since we met, I assumed the natural next step now that we knew more about each other was to see if we have sexual chemistry. I asked him to come home with me and he said not tonight. Here’s where I was wrong -

He was being gentle in his declination and still gave me a kiss and apologized but I was overcome with feelings of rejection that my reaction, I think, came off as angry and frustrated. I was so thrown off by his response and my knee jerk reaction was to freeze up and become skeptical of him and his feelings towards me. He tried to suggest maybe we see each other on the weekend but I was so clouded by my feelings that I interpreted that as further rejection as in, he’s saying that but won’t follow through. 

I know that my reaction was an overreaction and I’m sure it looked childish and immature in his eyes. But am I being too hard on myself? All signs pointed in one direction until he turned around abruptly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ostxkc/am_i_the_red_flag/

38,osu1fg,1627416025,Full circle?... Or not.,"So someone msged me on POF saying he was wondering why he's never messaged me when it seems like we'd get along but then he realized it was because I didn't want kids (I'm fully sterilized btw) and that was a deal breaker but he'd still want to be friends since we seemed like we'd vibe. I looked at his profile and behold, it was someone I had a crush on back in grade 8/9... we had a class together and I remember even confessing to him and making advances but i also remember he parried them and seemed rather uninterested. After the class we had together ended, we pretty much stopped talking and disappeared from each other's lives. 

So when he messaged me, I looked at his profile and was like wait... what high school did you go to? Graduated ___ year??? Yup, it was him. I told him I think we had a class together and I used to like him. He was like... ""wait, are you that girl??? the girl I was afraid to like"". I show him a picture of myself from high school and he's like omg you are... turns out, he was very attracted to me but in high school, being a year apart was such a big deal and his friends all said not to do it so that was why he didn't reciprocate despite really wanting to. we continued to talk and recollected how attracted to each other we were and why. So after chatting a bit, we both realized the attraction existed as if it never left. We were both really intrigued by this encounter so we decided to meet up. My place still isn't done yet so I opted to go over to his. We chatted til 3 in the morning, reminiscing, filling each other in on what we've missed in the last decade and a half of not talking, basically just really enjoying each other's company despite the giant elephant in the room, you know... my not wanting kids and him wanting kids. But at that point, none of that mattered, we were just very attracted to each other. We then went to bed.

In the morning, we talked some more now that some of the initial flare had subsided. He told me he's still very attracted to me, i'm everything he remembered and imagined i would be and more, and that he would love to experience a relationship with me, despite knowing it'll one day end because of how he wants biological children and I definitely don't. But I told him, I'm not the type to date just to date... I don't like going into relationships knowing it's going to end one day. I'm not good at that because it can break me. No matter how wonderful that time we spend together may be, it'll still be a world of hurt when it ends... and I can't bring myself to commit to something knowing I'm going to have to let it go. So he says he can't in good conscience ask me to be with him knowing that I'm like that and it also wouldn't feel right to me to a) monopolize his time when he has this plan for himself and b) take fatherhood away from him knowing that's what he wants. But I like him. And he likes me. I want to be with him. And he wants to be with me. I haven't felt this level of connection with someone in a very long time... I'm so conflicted.

As much as I want to be okay with just living in the moment and experiencing the relationship, I've never been good at being the in-between girl... I'm perfectly okay with not ever finding someone but if I'm dating someone, I'd want it to last. I'm not sure what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osu1fg/full_circle_or_not/

After that we hang out at his balcony and drank tea, then I headed home. He also walked me back to the station and texted me to check if i am home safely.

I wouldn’t probably think about it and keep it casual, unless the moment while we were in the kitchen, I gave him a goodbye hug and he kisses me 😅 it was so unexpected cause we have no physical contact at all during the whole date, even while we were standing so close in the balcony looking out of a castle and the moon (so romantic) 

I told him that we haven’t yet held hands but we already kissed, so we held hands on the way to the station and kiss a light goodbye

49,osuko7,1627417831,Well....I'm speechless. TL;DR at the bottom,"So. I went away for a weekend recently and met this girl. I'd met her 10 or so years previously as she was and still is part of an extended friendship group. I messaged her saying let's go for a drink sometime as I got the feeling she would like that! Well, turns out she did. We went on the perfect date. I was really attracted to her. She was everything I like in women. We kissed at the end of our first date and from then i was kinda smitten 🙈

We arrange a second date for the following week. As you can imagine I looked forward to it alot! But then....

I got covid. Not a particularly bad case of it but   bad enough, shall we say. Clearly that means I can't go on the date and I'm pretty gutted. We talked pretty much every day and everything seemed great. I was happy. Anxious, because that's what covid can sometimes do to you, but happy. 

Fast forward to today. We've been chatting for nearly 2 weeks and I'm looking forward to seeing her again 😄 I ask her what wine she would like so I make sure to leave early and buy a bottle for us to enjoy later. Bought some beers for myself too. I drive to hers feeling kinda nervous but excited at the same time. 

I park up and see I have a missed call. Basically, I ring her and she tells me her ex is back on the scene and she doesn't want to waste any more of my time (yeah, because I can just get a refund for the 2 weeks of my life she has knowingly wasted) can you imagine treating someone with such utter, UTTER disrespect?? Im fuming. I tell her she's done me a favour by doing this as I will have nothing to do with someone who treats people with such contempt. I hang up and block her later that evening 

I'm just so hurt and angry. Why let me waste so much time and get my hopes up to let me down so spectacularly at LITERALY the last second. I've been on the dating scene for 3 years and in thst time I have NEVER had a second date. Not. A. Single. One. I thought on this occasion that I might finally break that seal and have a second date for the first time ever. But I was let down and treated like dirt as I was jumping over that hurdle. How do I bounce back from this? Please someone tell me. 😔

First off, We’ve only been together for 4-5 months and they’re wanting to get a place together by January of next year. We’ve been long distance for the majority of our relationship starting in April. While being at school I would drive 2 hours every weekend to see them. Once summer break started I moved back home which is 7 hours away from them.   My partner has never lived alone and neither have I. Their current roommate is now kicking them out because their roommate wants to live alone. So my partner is moving in with their dad with the idea of moving in with me once I move back for school. They’ve stated that they’re getting older and want to start a life with me but I also want me space. My partner does not take care of themselves simple because they don’t know how and that nobody has taught them how which are the words they used. They don’t have a steady income or enough money to move closer to me. They have things that need to be taken care of before even thinking about moving in. They’re not wanting to move closer to me because they wouldn’t be able to afford living on their own. I’m in school and don’t want to transfer. There’s a lot of responsibility that I feel like has been put on me. I’m a college student, I currently have bills as well. I thought I could handle and care for them but I’m starting to realize that’s beyond me to “fix” them while I’m still learning and figuring out myself.    To simply put it I’m afraid of letting my partner down. I’ve told them I didn’t want to move in right away and they got really upset. I want time to live by myself and they don’t. I feel pressured to find a place just so they have a place to live. 

I recently told them that I was having doubts about moving in together. They told me they didn’t want to talk about it because it would upset them.

She made it clear that she couldn't make the time to meet as she was preparing for a big exam she needed to pass in order to receive her license to work in her career field. Makes complete sense.

She took the exam and then I finally brought up the idea of going out on a first date which she seemed really on board with and I actually asked her for any ideas on what she would like to do. She said she is really down for anything even if it's just grabbing coffee and sitting in the car.

I wanted to do something a little more special so I asked her if she would be into grabbing sushi and then doing an escape room which to me is a very normal first date.

She agreed to it and actually seemed excited about it and flirty about it telling me ""This is exciting...I've never really been on a first date like this one before!""

A few days pass by and I don't reach out just to give it some room to breathe. I book the escape room (non-refundable), I message her yesterday telling her I'm excited to meet her.

She hits me back 5 hours later telling me how she appreciates me wanting to take her out but that she met someone she is very interested in and she wants to see where it goes and she thinks that it would be wrong to date multiple at the same time and she hopes I understand.

I'm trying to get an idea if I scared her off by offering something a little bigger than coffee in the car? Either that or she got back together with her ex-boyfriend which seems to have ended recently.

All of my friends know I've never had a girlfriend but I've just made up stories of hooking up in college + after. COVID definitely didn't make things better. I pretty much missed my window to get it out of the way (college, I went to an all boys high school) and meeting women is significantly harder. I've never even kissed a girl when a large percentage of my cohort are sexually experienced. I'm going to have to fake this but I definitely don't know how. No one I know can relate at all.

Weight: 192

Income: 70k + some freelance work

Hi all,

**Sorry for this long post. I really need help.**

I am dating a 29 (M) that I met over Tinder 9 months ago. I am 34(F). We both started dating casually, then become casually exclusive after two months of dating and exclusive after three months. We became official after six months into a relationship.

He told me after three dates that he is a commitment-phobe. I believe he still was hoping to get back with his ex for our first two months into us casually seeing each other once a week. He broke up with his ex to regret that he made the biggest mistake and tried chasing her for another year. But once we became mutually exclusive, I think his frequency of texts, calls to her went down. However, his being commitmentphobe always resulted in him having more power in this relationship. I was terrified to be me; he had asked various times to ensure that I am not developing any feelings for him because he had none. For the first three months, we saw each other once a week, moving to twice a week, and by the 5th month, we were seeing each other every other day. I remember one night after sex; I was looking into his eyes, he got anxious and told me that he has no feelings for me:(

Anyways I like this guy a lot, so I just went with the flow. I didn't argue with him. He wants alone space, and I gave him that. I never even once mentioned I want to go here because I never felt comfortable saying that without giving him anxiety. 

His birthday was around 6th month; I bought him 200 dollars shoes, took him for a very fancy dinner, got him a birthday card. These details are imp for the context later.

After the 6th month anniversary, I casually mentioned my friends are confused about what we are, and he is like do you want to make it official? I agreed.

However, soon a month after making it official, he told me that he doesn't think this is forever for him. He has doubts because our conversation doesn't flow; there is intellectual incompatibility. I cried; he cried when he said that. After a couple of days, I made peace with it.

Meanwhile, there was the other guy I met, who was taking some photos for a modeling gig, and my friend arranged a photo shoot for me with him. After the first meeting, he ended up getting a crush on me. My bf doubted that, and I told him that yes, he has a crush.

Since I started to get a bit distant, my boyfriend, after two weeks of telling me that he doesn't see me forever, said that he didn't mean that. He is excited for us, for our future. He made it official because he sees the future together. 

However, two weeks after that, he took me to a party and never introduced me as his girlfriend. I confronted him. He said he just assumed that it was apparent that we are together at the party, but there is some doubt in his head that this is not going to be long-term. So this gives him the anxiety to call me his gf.  I told him that things like that make me not tell others that I have a boyfriend. I feel very insecure. I told him that the photographer guy asked me if I have a boyfriend; I told him that it is more serious than casual, less casual than serious. He got upset about it; he said that I am doing this to hurt him. I said no, I don't feel comfortable calling you bf when it is not long term. Mind well, this guy has not met any of my friends, and we have not said I love you. Just so you all know, I felt guilty of telling that to the photographer guy and then telling that to my bf. In my head, I was trying to say to him that I don't see from your action that you think this is bf gf relationship, and when someone asks me if we are bf-gf, to say yes makes me uncomfortable. But in hindsight, I know that calling official means bf. And, if someone has a crush on me, I should have told him that I have a bf.

And, on my birthday, he did nothing. Infact he argued with me for not being able to give an opinion on dinner. He said he wants to do his own things when I am there, and he feels that he needs to entertain me. I told him that he just needs to communicate. I don't mind whether he wants to do his own thing. I have given him a safe space to tell me. I would go back home without any issue if he feels trapped.

I asked him the reason why he has serious doubts. He said 1) whenever he asks me anything, I say whatever he likes. He appreciates that I let him make decisions, but it bothers him that the relationship is all about him. I don't have my stand. To that, I reply to him, that we were in casual for way too long. I was so anxious to give you any anxiety by saying, let's go out for dinner, or let's do this, especially when you made sure that I don't develop feelings for you. That fear still lives in me, that I will cause you (a commitment-phobic) anxiety. Secondly, my bf takes antidepressants, mood stabilizers, viagra, and ADHD meds to give more context. His mood fluctuates a lot in a day, so I let him take decisions, which backfired. 2) He said intellectual incompatibility. He is brilliant; he knows a lot of things about a lot of topics. I am a scientist, on the other hand, but maybe not as intellectual as him. We both don't have common hobbies. He is in computer, and I am in science- biology. He uses to play many video games with his ex; on the other hand, I don't even know how to play video games. 3) He sometimes feels like I am his younger brother, following him. And, following him in a sense, no good conversations, just following him.

So, now we are giving it a try. he says he has serious doubts, but he is optimistic, and he will give this a try.

However, I feel so hurt. I think I have so kind, generous, considerate, but I am constantly in a place feeling insecure where he changes his mind about me every 2 weeks. And when I bring that in the conversation, he says this has been the problem with his past girlfriends; they all felt insecure. He realizes that, but he doesn't know to fix it. He doesn't want to fix it. And, he should live alone. Just fluff, no mention of trying to make his partner secure.

He was scrolling some conversation next to me on his phone, and I saw him telling his friend that he is tired, there is work drama, relationship drama—Exit (0). I am not a coder, but I imagine he meant he would like to terminate this?

- When i met her for the first time i was with some other colleagues just talking and i noticed she makes allot of eye contact with me and was facing me allot. 

- From the first moment where we really didn’t know each other, she always talked allot to me straight away about personal things.

- And here’s probably the biggest thing and why i need some help with this is that every time we talk and stuff i see she blushes.

78,osxiwm,1627427291,Reflecting on this past relationship I tried to make right in the end and how sometimes they’re just not worth it y’all (newly dating with HSV1),"

Backstory:

Ngl I was very attracted to this guy and liked him a lot in general since we both loved to hike and ski and also loved to play music (jazz specifically). A pretty unusual combo in my experience. He was also unfortunately the first guy I ever had to disclose my HSV1 too. I attempted the slow route so I could have a chance at being seen as me and not the virus. So I went three dates sending zero signals and neither did he essentially. So third date I decided to just ask the classic “hey are we just friends” because that’s how it seemed and I didn’t think there was point in telling him if he didn’t even like me. To which he said “I just like spending time with you and I’m not sure yet”. So I told him. And all he said was “ok” and it was very obviously an I got caught off guard and am not ok “ok”. It didn’t come up again. He avoids me for a few weeks and then comes out and says he doesn’t want anything romantic but wants to keep spending time with me. Very clearly related to the HSV1 since he could’ve just said that when I asked. I was honestly mortified because he either was never attracted to me and I told him this gross fact about me, or this fact about me was so gross to him it was a deal breaker. I couldn’t be friends with him after even though he wanted too and made a bit of an effort. My ego was absolutely crushed since it was the first time I had experienced a rejection over it. I wouldn’t have been able to look him in the eye. He gave up and we didn’t speak for 3 years. 

Now:

I’m partnered and have had basically every guy I tried to see seriously be ok with it since. I lost a lot of friends during covid and thought maybe now was the time I could patch things up with him and apologize for my insecure behavior and we could be friends? My partner and I have been looking for some other gays to be friends with. I message him and wish him well. We actually have a decent convo and he’s sending smiley faces and saying he. Would genuinely like to hang again even though we didn’t end on the best of terms. So I attempted to apologize for those bad terms and said it was on me and explained that he was the first guy I had that talk with and I was a mess and am sorry it ruined a potential friendship because he’s a cool guy. He ghosted lol. Just baffles me that 3 years later he still won’t in a matter of fact “this is just what happened” way discuss it with me. All he had to say was I understand, or sorry you went through that/thanks for telling me. Seriously. Iike hes not hiding anything I know that’s 99% likely why he rejected me. I’m over it and wanted to see if friends was possible. Everyone always told me that guys who can’t handle that are a waste of my time and not worth it. Didn’t believe them but now I know.

At least I got some final closure knowing that I tried and told him what meeting him actually meant to me back then. the ball will now remain in his court for good.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osxiwm/reflecting_on_this_past_relationship_i_tried_to/

87,osy14i,1627429030,On texting after the first date,"I went on a date a few days ago with a guy i met online. We did a pretty casual activity and he gave me a ride home. I thought it went well, it wasnt like some absolutely amazing date but definitely good enough that i wanted to go out again. I dont think you can decide if you like someone after just meeting once (unless it was a terrible date ofc). Anyway we said the thing when he dropped me off ""i had nice time lets do it again"". But now he hasnt texted me, i mean i havent texted either so im not sure if he is waiting for me to say something or if he just wasnt feeling it. I dont think either of us are big texters so im not looking for a conversation but i was hoping he might text to set up more plans. 

For context here: I set up the first date. I always see guys on here complaining that women dont plan things/reach out first but i have a completely different experience. I am ALWAYS the one reaching out and making plans. So the reason i havent texted this person yet is because i was trying to be patient and wait for him to set up the next thing. I wanted to try a different approach than i normally do.

So question for the guys here. If you didnt text after 3 days does that mean you are waiting or you dont want to go out again? Alternatively, if you were too shy to text first and the woman texted you after 3 days, would you have already moved on or is that a normal time frame? Again im not talking about a text conversation but plans to hang out again, because that doesnt need to be done immediately after the first date",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osy14i/on_texting_after_the_first_date/

But the following day she replied with her photo and said she was up for meeting for drinks if I would be interested. I looked at the photo she sent and unfortunately I'm just not attracted to her. In total we haven't messaged much; there's about 4 messages between us overall.

My question is, should I send a polite rejection message? Or is it OK to just not reply in this case since we don't have any plans? I don't want to be rude by telling her I'm not interested in response to her photo.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osy2ai/to_send_a_rejection_message_or_not/

93,osydf8,1627430203,Do you guys consider this “playing games”? And if not what do y’all consider that? REALLY LONG POST,"23M. This part isn’t where i think the games started. So there’s this girl at my gym who’s gorgeous. I don’t like interrupting people when they’re working out, even when they’re on the set break, so it was hard for me to catch her at a good time to ask her out. Fast forward I go to the hospital for my annual check up and they say I need to go to the lab to get my blood drawn for test and when I go to the lab, the gym girl is my nurse! So we make small talk. I didn’t notice it was her until she said she recognized me from the gym. She complimented my clothes and for someone reason I decided not to ask for her number there and told her “see ya around”. Next time I see her at the gym, me and her are leaving at the same time and I told her “do you like sweets? I know how to make these delicious oreo treats and I’d like to make you some. I could bring them to you at your job on your lunch break if you like?” She says yes and gives me her number. The night I’m about to make them I text her when’s the next time she works and she answers and asks me what the ingredients are and I find out she’s lactose intolerant and can’t have them. So then I ask her if I can take her out for dinner instead. She tells me she’s only in town for work and could use some friends while she’s here. THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE GAMES STARTED. So I agree and ask her to go to this arcade at the mall next week and ask “when are you free?” She says “yeah sounds fun” and never responds to my texts again. The only text I sent her after I asked her out was a tiktok and she ignored it. So 4 days later I see her at the gym. I’m going to the locker rooms to leave and she’s walking on the treadmill. I know she notice me walking towards her direction since the locker rooms are right behind her and she glanced over at me two times while I was farther away. As I got closer she didn’t look anymore and as I went past I notice in the corner of my eye she looked at me and I think I heard her call my name but I had my headphones on so I wasn’t sure and kept it moving. I just figured she wasn’t interested in dating or being friends and just didn’t know how to say it because It’s like why ignore my texts but talk to me only in person?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osydf8/do_you_guys_consider_this_playing_games_and_if/

I weight the same but look bigger, lost some muscle mass. But even skinnier back in 2019, I still never got attention from guys. Did I look better back then or do I look the same or better now?

96,osyvrq,1627431949,What does it mean when I girl says she has imagined you naked and wants to bang you but only wants to be friends,"We (both 30 yo females) met on Tinder at the end of last year, where she stated that she wanted casual on her profile.

The very first days we wouldn’t talk too much but then we talked nearly every day. If we didn’t talk for a couple of days she would say she missed me. Our conversations were very interesting. She said to me she had never met a girl like me, so intellectually and physically attractive. 

At some point I felt something was off, and she tells me she feels there is something she is not giving to me, like I need more. Which wasn’t the case. I asked her what was going on and she confessed very traumatic stuff about her childhood. Asks me what is that I want and I tell her that I don’t know yet because we haven’t met but that it‘s very easy to fall for her. She says she had on her Tinder that she wanted casual. (Even though she also complained about people only wanting sex in the casual framework). She also tells me that she only ends up in relationships because men pursue her so much, not because she initially wants or falls for anyone. That she only fell in love once and it was uncomfortable. Her last ex cheated on her, so she has a lot of trust issues, together with past trauma with men. She also told me she had never been in a relationship with a woman but wanted to try, yet was scared of what people may think, specially her dad, as her mother is a lesbian and her dad hates her for it. We agree we will give each other time and space, and meet up when I’m back to the country, as I was on a long holiday During covid with family. 

Truth is that we would continue engaging on social media and writing each other from time to time. If I put a selfie or something on social media she would write me in awe with my beauty, as per her messages. Also loved my poems, etc. 

At some point, I was very confused and not too clear, as all this conversations happened via WhatsApp. I had a panick attack and wrote her asking if I could call her. She was out with a friend but called me. Then went home and we talked again. She tells me she just wants to be friends yet she also tells me that she has imagined me naked many times and also that she would definitely bang me. 

I am not sure about you guys but I wouldn’t say that about a friend. I was in so much pain and so emotionally confused for so many different reasons (family, identity crisis, work, trauma as well, etc) that I asked her to block me and I deleted her from all social media accounts. She said she was very sad and that she didn’t want to continue talking that night. She didn’t block me, I asked her, and then she did up to this day. I’m still blocked. 

I reached out to her in several ocassions, one of them when I was truly sad, where I opened up to her, and she never replied.

As I was waiting for the order, I glanced @ his gf and she was looking at me head to toe &amp; would look away. From time to time she would do this and each time she looked away, she snuggled with her bf and would slap his ass. Quite Positive that she couldn’t see that I was looking at her bc of my sunglasses.

99,osz5gj,1627432923,Invisible disability while dating and fear?,"Invisible disability while dating and fear?

Hi, how are you? I don't know how to get straight to the point or make sure my question is understandable. I love myself but I do battle with internal feelings just like anyone else. My most insecurity is my brain in other words my mind. I have invisible disabilites and many times I do want to cry. It is not easy because I feel like it is hard to be understood or to understand others. I'm a female who is in her 20's. I have a psychologist and psychoatrist so I'm also in medications. I was born with my brain partially damage. I was not going to survive when my mom was pregnant but I did live and later I was interned at the hospital for many months because I was dying.

 

So, I was born prematurely and I was born with my brain partially damage especially in my frontal lobe part of the brain. I have outbursts, anxiety, and I do not see consequences. I do feel feelings but I do not understand many things. It is hard for me to read body language or facial expressions. People have to explain to me the same things in simpler ways because I do not understand they way people explain things or communicate. I also drink medication for memory and for other stuff. Besides this I also focus on my hobbies and I exercise and I am very busy with work. To me dating is a topic that makes me have fear.

 

I do wish I could date but I am afraid of relationships. My parents had a very traumatic relationship and divorce. And then there were custody problems. My dad won the custody but later my sisters found the truth and who he actually is so they left him. I left my dad when I graduated from high school then I moved in with my sister. Now I live with my mom and her family. My mom has helped me very much. I do not have a good relationship with my dad but there is no right or wrong on raising a son or daughter. There isn't a bible of how to raise kids so for that reason I do not blame him.

 

Now I live with my mom and I have to believe that relationships are possible because my mom has a good relationship with my stepdad. I cannot think of the past because I need to let go of the past. But I am very afraid of falling in love and dating someone. I do not want to have children even though my mom wants me too. I do want to have kids in the future but I will not let that happen. I saw the way my parents struggle to raise me because of my invisible disabilities. And I do not want to have kids then I will hurt them. It is not easy and that is a fear I have. I don't want others to struggle because of me.

 

I have emotional rollercoasters. People have said that I am not malicious and that I do not have common sense. And my mind is that of a younger person. But my family tell me that I am still beautiful in the inside. How can I get over the fear of dating? And advice? Thank you for your time and have a nice day. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osz5gj/invisible_disability_while_dating_and_fear/
