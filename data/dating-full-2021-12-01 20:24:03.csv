Everybody knows everyone, you get it. Me and my gf broke up about a year ago after being on and off for about two years. She now lives 7-8 hours away and I live in our fellow hometown, just landed my dream job and life is great.

All of a sudden, this girl who I have known for 10 years starts to push for something more, it seems. We’ve always been friends, but never anything more, and we’ve never hung out alone together. Now she wants to meet up, hang out, and she seems genuinely interested. She got a kid about 6 months ago, her relationship ended during her pregnancy due to the guy being an ass.

So, single mom. Her brother is one of my closest friends (I have no idea how he would react to me dating his older sister), and she happens to be the best friend of the step sister of my ex (who I am still friends with, mind you, but we don’t hang out whenever she’s home, just ended on good terms).

Now, I want to date this girl but don’t know how. To start dating a person you have gotten to know deeply on a personal level over 10 years, seems strange to me. And I know there will be reactions from my ex and her family since the girl in question sometimes used to be present at certain gatherings when I was with my former girlfriend and her family. So what do I do? Respect their friendships and back off, or do I give it a shot?

A friend warned me that this girl might just feel a bit «desperate» due to being a single mom, and I can see that, as she has never shown any interest before now, but on the other hand I feel like she is such a great person and she isn’t just «settling» for me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131652,public,self,Found someone on accident,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6o7t5/found_someone_on_accident/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

While on date 4, the guy(28) who I’d been seeing asked me which app we met on because he forgot. He asked in like a kinda sincere way, not realizing how that might make me think or feel. At this point we had already slept together twice, both liked each other, and we were literally on this romantic date. But I was like, “Wow you make me feel so special, gosh how many apps do you have..” and he had zero clue as to why I would be taken back by that. I realize now that I assumed I was more special to him at that point, which is why it bothered me, and ultimately where things intimately went wrong while we dated. It was only date 4, but I assumed at least the decency of not making me feel like a number.

I’ve asked a few friends and some of them were like “It’s not that big of a deal, but it’s still not that comforting to hear” and others go “Damn how many girls is he seeing wtf you’re not a number ”. I didn’t know if I was being shallow for thinking he should care, or if he was being shallow for not thinking he should care.

I felt like a job application though after this I had to reevaluate how much I should be caring about people I date. Which goes against my own livelihood of doing things with genuine purpose. I have a hard time understanding people who subconsciously waste the time of others and can’t even remember which app, thinking we are all just disposable robots. In the end when we broke up he even asked to be my friend. “Cause you’re a good person,” he said. That felt shallow. 

It started to make me realize everyone thinks about dating and human relationship different, and how there is a range of much we individually matter to each other and how everyone assumes such.

So I am a male in my mid 20s and I have a few issues to say the least. So here is my backstory, I was raised in a pretty crappy environment (between 0-8 YO I have experienced a war, living under a dictatorship and a fair bit of terrorism). I have had some pretty oppressive parents (father wasn't the one to give advice and shit and mother was a control freak and really really destroyed me mentally, emotionally and socially). I basically grew up to be quite awkward (which I don't really mind tbh but others do). My inner confidence (ie saying I am going to do a task and following through and actually doing great in it) is through the roof (hate to say this but this is due to the fact that I always feel like I am not enough), but my social confidence is quite shit (this is probably due to lots of bullying from my mother and lovely school folks). ANYWAY, with the way I was raised I ended up not being close to my family and not being family oriented,  I also deviated away from religion and so on. I am fairly accepting of everyone (whether its social status or religious beliefs or whatever) all I ask is that someone has goals and works hard to achieve them. My problem is, the personality I have now cultivated is what is seen as a giant red flag... I am usually a workaholic (but my work is a hobby), I usually am an obsessive (whether its work, going to the gym or any hobby ... I usually engulf myself in activities), and I am not family oriented and religious.... people have been looking down on this a lot and it is honestly really annoying me. I wish I were more like everyone else and enjoyed the subtitles of everything in life, but this is just how I grew up I actually love myself quite a bit (at least when it comes to work and engulfing myself in stuff). My thing is:  


1 - Do you all think I need to change things about myself (if so what and how)?  


2 - How would I go about wording some of these negatives and turning them around?   


  
Honestly, I feel like I have no sense of direction when it comes to ""the meaningful things in life"" (ie. finding love, and empathizing with people). As far as dating apps or whatever, I would say I am fairly good looking and I have been doing good with getting matches ... but usually after talking to me most people can tell there is something off and things end up dying.  Also I kind of like being weird (at least a little bit because of how well I end up doing stuff) but I would like some help figuring out what I can change ... at least give me a little perspective so I can know when I need to tone it down and how I can better approach speaking to people.

So i started seeing a guy who was pursuing me for two years, like talking and asking me out but i didn't feel like going out because i felt i wasn't ready for relationships (work stress) and because i assumed our wavelengths didn't match. But eventually i gave in and thought let's give it a shot. 

Within 1.5months of dating, it started turning so so toxic. I have commitment issues which i really need to work upon and he was emotionally quite repressed, like he couldn't express as much as i needed/wanted. And our fights always spiralled down to me asking him to communicate and him telling me to be patient with him and give it time...

Finally we both decided to call it off because it was hampering our mental peace and work. We decided to be friends and not block each other off, and deal with our emotions if ever we felt it and talk about it if it got too overwhelming for both of us because we had started to fall for each other.

So within 2days of our break up I'd mistakenly hidden him from viewing my status updates and forgot to unhide him ugh. I'd not even given it a thought all these days. Yesterday I suddenly saw what I'd done this and unhid him. Today he texted me... Almost two weeks since our break to ask if I'd suddenly unhidden him... and why... I told him the truth and we conversed about normal daily stuff and our work and our health. I... Just don't know. Why would he text me this...i am not yet over the episode of us dating i guess and i need time and space apart from him. I should probably communicate this to him but i don't want to be vulnerable now that we're not together. And somewhere ugh maybe i want to see if things can work out between us. I don't know if I'm overthinking his ""curiosity"" as an approach to get back together or I'm just projecting my ideas on him...

I want to say things are progressing normally however I have some concerns that I'm not sure are warranted so I'm looking for insight.

- She never texts first. I feel like if I don't text her we just won't talk which is obviously not a great feeling to have. We will sometimes go a day or two without talking if I don't send her anything

- She's still using tinder, or at least opening the app as I can see her distance from me changing. Obviously she's still well within her right to do so as we've only hung out twice but it's just another thing putting doubt in my mind

- We had a dinner date planned for last night which she backed out of last second because she found out she was exposed to covid at work and wants to get tested. This is believable as she is a nurse and she hasn't made a pattern of flaking on dates so I'm not putting too much thought into this one but thought I'd mention it

In the last 3 months, she’s starting seeing someone new who only lives 15 minutes away. Now I hardly see her (which I understand).

I’m never upset that she’s not spending that time with me anymore. It’s just hard living with someone who’s spending 3-4x a week with their partner while I can’t remember the last time someone kissed me 😞 

They invite me to go out with them to restaurants and bars. Honestly, they’re so compatible with each other &amp; I’m so happy for them!

Ive had a lot of time recently to just think and see where my life is going. Im a 21M currently limping along in college with an awful dating life to boot so as you can guess im.a virgin lol.

I got rejected from a girl i really liked a few weeks ago and i took it really hard, it just stings more when its someone i couldnt help but get tbe butterflies when i thought of them and i giggled so much whenever me or my friends talked about her. It just made it more heartbreaking when she said she didnt think i was right for her.

Honestly i wont lie my confidence and self worth fluctuates all the time, sometimes i feel like im an ultra chad who doesnt need anyone or anything but then a lot of other times i feel so alone and so worthless but i guess what im trying to say is that ive learned there is comfort and opportunities for development in the pain you go through.

Im trying to become a web developer and really work on my physical appearance as well as reading more books not for women but because i want to feel better about myself because i know i have sooo much potential and life left in me. I do hope that a girl would give me the time of day because i just feel like ill always say or do something to mess it all up no matter how hard i try but having very few friends my entire life and having a mindset of hard work can get you anywhere is kind of whats keeping me going right now.

We've talked about our upbringings, jobs etc, spent time alone talking and joking together etc. Could just be me, but lately I've noticed things like we're standing closer, he makes more of an effort to come over to me, helps with little things. The last time I saw him he hugged me goodbye, which completely threw me off guard, and it felt like neither of us really wanted to say goodbye. 

But all that said, I still keep thinking - is he like this with everyone and is he just a nice guy in general? Am I just seeing/feeling what I want to see just because of the way I feel? Could very well be.

So, I downloaded Bumble and after a few minutes of swiping, I matched with the most gorgeous dude who was very successful and honestly someone I thought was out of my league. **Precursor: I knew I was open to having a one night stand if it felt right, and the 100% chance I'd never speak to him again.** 

We met up at his place to decide on plans to go to a bar, he drove us out to a downtown area and we drank and danced at this really cool bar/club that played music he knew I liked. He was really fun to hang out with, talk to, and he even got really hands on (hugging by the waist at the bar top while ordering drinks, kissed me on the dance floor, touched my thighs when we were talking at these bar tables). I rarely ever like when men try to pull PDA on me, but I can't lie, he was so gorgeous and the mutual attraction was there that I let him do it and I loved it. He kept telling me I smelled amazing and even said my lip gloss tasted expensive, lmao. He eventually took me home to his place and we hooked up. It just gets a little weird for me because men I have electively decided to one night stand with rarely ever pull the ""slow love making"" card, BUT this dude did the really romantic low and slow type of sex, and was hands down some of the best experiences I've had since being in a relationship a year ago.

Fast forward, walking me out he:

\-jokingly/in all srsness told me he didn't believe I had a 7 AM breakfast reservation (which i really did) 

\-kissed me on the lips when I just went for the hug and thanked him for a good time (i felt awkward because i did NOT see that coming, i always believed it should never happen with one night stands or FWB)

\-texted me less than 10 minutes after we left and drove off telling me that he hopes i get good rest and that he still smelled like me and it was lowkey bomb haha 

\-texted me when he was off of work later that day and said he was hoping to see me before i left out of town for a second time

\-texted me that he was thinking about our night ALL day at work

\-now he's one of the first people to read my IG stories every time I've been posting

So I texted him a few days after, and I purposely asked him if he knew any other good places in SD and that I went to a bar he recommended with a friend the day after just to see what he'd say.

\-He jokingly assumed I went on another date with a guy and said ""wow and you didn't take me with you""

\-He told me of course he'll show me his spots but I can't take any other dudes there LOL

\-And he reiterated that he has been thinking about that night at work since I left town

How should I feel about this entire situation? 

I feel like I'm expecting NOTHING at all. I don't expect him to like me or even expected him to want to see my face again. But now I feel like if I go back in 2 weeks to hang out with him, there could be a possibility that this could be potentially someone I can casually date long distance? **Calling all men: What do you think this dude feels?

I met this girl on tinder about 4 years ago, we went on a few dates. We kissed a couple times, but it never went anywhere. A couple of months go by and she reaches back out to me saying that she wanted to be friends.

Over time we develop a good friendship. Neither of us are from the area so it’s nice to have people you care about nearby. She is from another country, and while we were friends she starts dating a guy she met that is from the same country as her. She would often talk to me about how she wished he was more understanding, or showed more interest in her feelings. I knew this guy wasn’t good for her, but I kind of felt that it was probably comforting for her to have someone she could relate to from back home. I can’t even speak her native language, for instance. He probably felt comfortable.

They broke up several times but would get back together shortly thereafter. I was actually going to visit her one day when she tells me that he just came over and they got back together. At this point I still thought I was fine being her friend, but I realized that this actually upset me and I didn’t want to come over while he was there. She tells me she doesn’t think we should be friends if I have feelings for her. So I just don’t contact her for awhile.

A couple months go by again, and she reaches back out to me. She’s still seeing this guy but we continue our friendship and everything seems fine. We don’t talk as much as we did at one point, but one of us would check in on each other every couple days just to say hey. I wasn’t trying to hold out for her. I was still living my life, keeping my options open, and just trying to be a good friend. I did several large favors for her, things that I honestly thought her boyfriend should be doing, but she went out of her way to ask me and I didn’t mind helping so I did them without questioning.

So just about a month ago she says that we haven’t hung out in awhile and wants me to visit. So we go out to get some fast food. She orders first, I’m expecting that we will just order and pay separately. But she orders, steps aside and nudges me to order with her and then I pay for both of ours. Which is fine, it just felt oddly date-ish and caught me by surprise. While we are eating, she tells me that she finally realized how selfish the guy was and that she had finally ended things for good with him. Over the next two weeks we are talking more, I know what days are her worst for work so in the morning on those days I would reach out with a funny applicable meme just to try to set her day up with a little humor and let her know she wasn’t alone.

Anyway, two weeks ago we are texting and she casually brings up that she has a date the next day. I didn’t even consider previously that this would upset me, I’m just trying to be a good friend, but reading that text made me ridiculously sad. I’ve always been extremely confident to the point of cockiness, but a ton of extremely difficult life events hit me all in the span of a few months recently and it triggered severe anxiety and depression. I’m still trying to figure out how to be myself again and just reading that sent me into a bad depressive episode that I’m honestly still working through. I didn’t respond. Didn’t say anything to her. Today she texts me and asks how my thanksgiving was and says we need to hang out before she goes to visit back home for Christmas. I was trying to be nice but also keep my distance and of course she can tell something is wrong. She asks if everything is ok and when I tell her it will be, I’m just being dramatic, she pushes me to tell her what is wrong.

I end up telling her that I still have feelings for her, that I realized I couldn’t be a true friend to her, and that I wasn’t at a place mentally to try to suppress my feelings.

It sucks. I feel like it was a lose lose situation. I either lost a good friend, or risked further hindering my depression progress over nothing she should feel guilty for. I knew she didn’t feel that way about me. I wasn’t trying to hold out for her to change her mind. I was trying to be an adult and preserve a friendship.

I know I am a smart, caring, funny, good looking guy, but there is just something holding me back. I know the “nice guys finish last” saying is bullshit, but it honestly does feel like it sometimes. She will spend years fighting to preserve a relationship with an “ugly jerk” (her words) but it felt like I never really had a chance. And I’m honestly not sure why.

I don’t have a ton of people in my life and I live in a very remote area so it’s hard to meet new people, and this isn’t the first time I’ve developed feelings for someone that didn’t feel the same way. I refuse to feel badly for being a caring individual, but situations like this make it really difficult to keep opening up to people. I don’t blame her at all, I know you can’t help how you feel, I just wish I knew what it was about me that gives off these vibes. I figure if I was a total piece of shit, people wouldn’t go out of their way to try to maintain a friendship.

Every time I Google for advice I only find topics where men are being too physical and pushing boundaries.

I (28M) went on a date with a woman (25F) after matching on an app. We had lunch, it went amazing, great chemistry and conversation, and she offered to walk around to just talk. What I thought would be an hour or two turned into four hours. We were literally sitting in the cold just talking and at times she looked like she was going to explode with happiness while we talked. I'm not even joking, it's like she had to suppress herself physically sometimes cause she was going to explode haha.

We hugged a bunch throughout the date. Arm around my waist, leaning into me when laughing, hugging me because I was shivering (I didn't realize we would be outside so long and came unprepared), linking arms when walking, no kiss at the end though (It didn't feel like she wanted one, but I kissed her on the cheek and gave her a hug and she seemed happy and was insistent we see each other again). I think she touched me (and I reciprocated) more than my last 5 dates combined....and then multiply that a few times. She even texted later with an idea for our next date later that day which we will be doing this weekend.

I've never had this before. I don't have much relationship experience, but the few recent dates I've been on recently have been nothing like this. The women are nice (sometimes not), but I never felt attracted to them despite them being conventionally beautiful women.

But my buddy said anyone who is that affectionate/happy JUST meeting someone is a red flag, and imagine how she is on all her first dates.

For example, she texted me the other morning and it went something like this: 

Her: Do we have class today 
Me: No we don’t. Sorry I forgot to tell you.
Her: I could have slept for another two hours. I’m gonna get breakfast now.
Me: Enjoy (Looking back at this response I feel like a dumbass)

At first we would talk sporadically for the first 2 motnhs but then got closer the last 2 months! We would text everyday and hang our at least once a week. However,  there were some red flags that I have mentioned to him about before we had sex and said I had nothing to worry because he was not going back to his ex.

Back story- basically his ex girlfriend cheated on him with multiple dude and she was very nonchalant about it when he confronted her. This was the red flag I told him about. I told him it seemed he was still into his ex bit he kept reassuring me she had hurting badly and would never go back to her!

Now last fast forward yesterday! We had a bit of argument  because we both agreed that we were fwb but would tell each other whenever any of us had slept with someone else just so we can make sure get tested and not exposed to anything.  Well he told me he had unprotected sex with another girl right after we had unprotected sex, mind you, the only reason he came clean was because I asked him straight up if he was having unprotected sex with anyone else then he admitted to it. Then suddenly he just blocked me on all social media and my number! No explanation! Just texted send me text saying how it's best for us to cut ties. 

I'm completely devastated 😢, I he told me be had told his parents about us andI thought we were getting serious but then he went no contact. I think he may had gotten back with his ex! I'm heartbroken, he insisted he would never go back to her and not he just completely ended things abruptly!

Any advice as to why he may ended things abruptly? What can do to no be in this agony anymore? I want to move on but heartbroken over the whole matter!

I am kinda out of the loop and not very active on social media rn. 
Whats going on is that 3 weeks ago i met a girl very randomly and we’ve been texting non stop and have gone out 4 times total. We haven’t kissed but she almost did kiss me, BUT also, she touched me. She flirts heavily and i am falling for her very fast. The tension is hard to resist. 


The thing is i literally just found out that she is tiktok ‘famous’ and is in a relationship with another girl. + I checked her background and she has previously been in a messy, toxic relationship where she cheated and then got a third girl involved and just like so so so much drama. 

The situation seems to be scary tbh and i dont know what to do. If from one side my heart is broken because of what i’ve found out, the other side of me just keeps wanting her. I crave her literally the whole time and i cant stop thinking about the insane connection we have. The way she is with me, like super cute, interesting, charming. 
I remember the second time we went out she invited me at her place and we sat for 20 minutes straight staring at the walls, and it felt good. Cause we were both so electric and in ecstasy because we were next to each other. 

Above i said she touched me and what i meant by that is that the third we met up we briefly went shopping cause i needed something and i tried the dress on, let her inside my cabin when i was done and i was looking at myself in the mirror and she was behind me, with her breath on my neck. And while we were looking at each other trough the mirror she made her hand slip trough my whole body and she squeezed both my breast and then my thigh. I was in complete shock. Electrified. And she never stopped making eye contact. She just knows what shes doing. I am completely falling for her. 


Plus she always remembers EVERYTHING i say and keeps baking stuff i like and gifting me things i mention even if its silly stuff. She literally shows me sooo much love its insane. 


I dont know what to do. I dont know if i should tell her that i know about her gf. I dont want her to distance herself from me. I know it isn’t okay cause duh, she has a gf but my mind and body are craving her and i just can’t stop that. I am attracted to her in a way i cant explain. I don’t think i can help myself.

He is pretty well established and secure in his life and career already and he is pretty emotionally secure and rational in general. He hasn't really talked to me yet about any problems or decisions he is facing in his life, and even when I asked him if any big topics have been on his mind lately, he says there aren't.

I consider myself pretty independent for my age, I have a good plan of what to do in my career, have a job lined up after graduation, and I am pretty emotionally secure. I have asked him for his input on career-related topics a couple of times but I wouldn't say that there is an imbalance in life experience- he has been alive longer and we have different perspectives on things but it doesn't feel off to be with him, if that makes sense.

I haven't really needed to give him any emotional support or anything because he hasn't really needed it, and I just don't know if this is normal. Part of me is worried that if he doesn't really ""need"" me and the only thing that is keeping us together is that we like each other, I don't know if this dynamic works or if it's just doomed. I mean, I don't really need emotional support either, I am good at regulating myself and am also a rational person in general.

What have your experiences been? If we don't really ""need"" each other for anything other than romantic companionship, is it doomed?

Similarly, I am sure he has some needs deep down that may just not have come to the surface yet. If it's not really obvious what his needs are, how can I figure out what they are so that I can support him better in our relationship? It's possible he may not even know what his own deep needs are too. I don't really know what my needs are either. I am like a self-cleaning oven, I really only just need someone to bounce thoughts off, as well as companionship, but other than that I don't really think there's anything specific I need.

Had other people in the group tell me they thought we would be cute  together. I was afraid of asking her out directly so we eventually just  went on a hike/walk with just the two of us, but I never actually called  it a date. It was really awkward and there was no physical touch or  anything. At the end of the hike I asked what we were doing (I phrased  it nicely) in terms of dating and she said she thinks we would be better  off as friends. All good and there were no hard feelings honestly.

Fast  forward a month later or something and I haven't seen her since but she  randomly texts me asking me about car insurance stuff we talked about  before. Was a little confused she reached out, but didn't blow her off  and we went back and forth for a little bit over text. A few weeks later  I was going to a free concert with my one friend and we had an extra  ticket, so on a whim I invited her just as friends. She came out and was  definitely playful that night (teasing, hand on the shoulder, I always  found her sitting or standing next to me - which shes done this during  later hangouts too). I had another friend privately tell me later they  thought me and her were dating, which confused me again. We hung out  some more in the fall, another comment came from someone else (this time  in front of her and the group), saying we bicker like a couple, and she  got mad about that. Idk if she was embarrassed or what but I never  commented on it.

So then she went  back to the other side of the country for a month to visit her family as  she works remotely. I thought no biggie I'll just talk to her when she  gets back. Nope she hits me up a few days after she left, looking for  small talk. We went back and forth. Then again a few days later she saw I  went out to a certain bar. She asked how it was, etc.

It's  pretty obvious what she's doing. And I don't want to be a sucker about  it. I think she's pretty, I like her personality and how we get along,  but I don't want to be strung along like this. I might be seeing her  this weekend at a bar as she's now back in town, and if so I was going  to be straight up with her - basically that I would like to take her out  on a real date and see where it goes. But I don't really want her to  keep hitting me up like this. I don't care if she comes and hangs out  with the group, however I don't want to be her texting buddy.

She's from South America, I'm from the US. Our relationship has definitely been mostly physical, we've never had a conversation about being exclusive, or boyfriend/girlfriend, or anything like that. But from the beginning, I was clear that I was looking for a relationship, and not just casual encounters. 

Anyway, moving on. Lately I've been feeling like our relationship has run its course. I'm looking for a long term partner and I realized that I don't think she's it - I think there is too much of a language &amp; culture barrier. She's a sweet, lovely woman who I want the best for, but after my last relationship fiasco I've tried to work on prioritizing my own feelings first, and trusting my gut, so as to not start a years-long relationship with the wrong person (a mistake I've now made twice). 

She was on a vacation with some friends, and during we continued to text occasionally (with some mild flirting). As her date to return was coming, I asked if she wanted to see each other in a few days (on what would be today). Which was a mistake - let me be clear. At this point, I was just thinking about sex with her, and not about how I could be potentially leading her on to something that I didn't want with her. 

Shortly after, I realized all of this, and decided to send her a follow up, much longer text, explaining that I actually didn't think we should see each other anymore, since I didn't feel like we were compatible for a long term relationship, but that I wished her the best, etc. and that I was sorry for sending mixed messages (asking her to come over and then stopping our relationship can be whiplash-inducing, I'll admit). I know I'm not perfect, I know I have more work to do at more clearly communicating how I'm feeling about things to women, but to me this felt like a positive step in the right direction.

As I mentioned, there's a language barrier between us, but she can understand written English just fine. To her, it seems like our relationship was MUCH more serious than I thought it was. Again, we maybe have seen each other a total of 4 times? Maybe 5? Not so many, in my opinion. We never had the discussion about exclusivity, we never labeled ourselves as anything, and she's acting like I've broken her heart, which is really making me feel like shit. She's said all this stuff in responses now about how we met during the ""worst time of her life"" and that she's ""confided in me her fears and insecurities"" which is honestly fucking news to me - we've never had any such talks like that.

Should I keep trying to get her to accept my decision? Or should I block her number with a final ""I'm sorry, but this is my final decision and I hope you make peace with it, I'm going to block you now"" message? (Or something like that)

He has definitely been flirty with me, always overly enthusiastically asking about my day, weekend ect. Whenever he comes into my work, he's noticeably looking around for me. So I read the signs well. He said he was pretty busy with work, but was definitely interested, so I gave him my number. He texted the next day, and our conversation started off very casual, talking about work, ect. I asked about his hobbies and he replied, ""Outdoors, hiking, libraries, hopefully you!"" Ugh, that's cringy. I ignored that line, and kept texting about other things. After about an hour, he texted, ""I have to say you have a really nice butt, and pretty eyes."" Again, I cringed and moved on. I start talking about a time we can possibly get together for food/drink out, he replies about me coming over to his place for a ""Movie and chilling."" Seriously? I then texted him about his forwardness, and that before either of us starts going to anyone's place, we should maybe get together out somewhere first. He said he understood and that he was ok with that. Throughout last week, we sent eachother brief texts to check in, every time him making additional comments about my butt or coming over if I was feeling lonely. Oy vey. Fast forward to this past weekend, when I was out of town visiting family. We hadn't text for a few days as we were both busy. I reached out and asked how his day was, and he asked how my time with family was going. Ok, everything is fine. Then later that night, out of the blue, asks for pictures from me. The thirst is real with this one. I didn't write back until the next morning, where I said, ""Look, I think you and I are looking for different things here and that's ok, but I'm not looking for a hookup."" He responded saying he understood, but that he wasn't looking for anything serious. Then went into a story about him and his gf breaking up after 7 years and him having to sell his house. I commended him on his honesty when asked about his intentions and left it at that. 

If you're heartbroken and looking for some casual fun, it's all good. Just put it out there dude, instead of looking like a freaking creep. The persistence and overly forwardness comes off really desperate. Even when I went through my own casual sex phase back in the day, I never went for guys who whipped out a dick pick, or were overly forward and to the point.

I noticed a girl had been coming in every single day and talking to me at length and in a very enthusiastic way. We got on great and she mentioned she had just been on a tinder date so I asked her how it went. It was a good way to know she was single. After she said it went badly and prefers to meet people in person I said I do too and asked her for her number. I had wanted to do this for a few weeks. We get chatting and shes flirty so I ask her to go for a drink or meet outside of where I work. She asks if its as friends or a date? I say date and she plays with me a bit until we organise something.

She says how excited she is and everything before meeting. She looked incredible and I felt so lucky to be with her that night. She invited me back to hers and I end up in her bed after a coffee. We don't sleep together but there were some major red flags. She told me how to kiss her, how to hold her and not to touch her hair. Very controlling of the situation. She then gets on top of me and tells me of all the guys shes messaging and how shes trying to get over a guy she loved.

I was like what on earth have I got into - but I still really liked her. She invites me to a sex club... I've never been to one and it was interesting. She then jokes with me that she needs a slave. I play along with it. She comes into my shop, I help her pick some stuff and then accidentally drop something - she says to one of my colleagues walking past 'my slave isn't doing a very good job today' and does similar with another. That night invites me to hers for cuddles after I finish work - I get to hers, get in her bed and she says she wants to sleep. Immediately. Impossible for me.

Long story short she says she told me she didn't want to be exclusive. At this stage I'm confused more than possible because no, she hadn't but I'd guessed from talking about the guys - including showing me dick pics.

Tonight she came into my shop with another guy and tells me he smells and that he needs to smell good if hes staying in her bed. I'm under no illusion nothing will happen but I'm correct to feel absolute rage at the audacity. I was in her bed a week ago. Surely shes nuts.

So this guy (M25) and I (F25) have been seeing eachother for two months now and in the beginning he was really intense and things were moving pretty fast so I brought up being exclusive in the second week. I know that was so soon of me. His response was that he “can’t be in a relationship rn bc he is going through stuff and he also doesn’t want to jump into things too fast”
 I was honestly surprised bc he was treating me like a girlfriend but at the same time it was only week 2 of us knowing eachother.(This was 2 months ago). So I noticed that he kinda started to maybe back off a little like for example not texting me everyday, and now seeing eachother once a week instead of almost every day. But Then he invited me to go to this event and meet his boss.  
Then after that we went almost 3 weeks without seeing eachother. He still would ask me to hangout but then last minute cancel or it’d be a last minute thing? But also during this time I mentioned as a joke how I spent all my money one night out and he offered to send me over some money if I need something to tie me over? Then I mentioned one day how I was looking at cars one day and he said “let me know if you want me to come”.
So after almost 3 weeks of not seeing eachother,I called him out on us not seeing eachother in a long time and he apologized and said he was going through a lot but he knows he needs to do better. 

 Then a few days later he invites me to go out to eat with him and his parents?! He said he wants us to meet.  He was holding my hand the whole time and I over heard him accidentally refer to me to someone as his “girlfriend”. This was last week.  Its funny though bc then we go 2/3 days not hearing from eachother but then he does these couple like things.

We have been going back and forth consistently (although often with 12 hours between responses on both sides) since Saturday. The conversation has been good and we are both very engaging. She is asking just as many questions as I am. Each response typically covers 2-3 topics. I see a date in the future at this rate.

Now, I do not have much experience with this. I have only been on two dates and never been in a bona fide relationship between the lack of interest and external factors like engineering school and the what-not.

Now, what do I do when 

1. The conversation eventually stalls out for some reason or I do not know what to talk about? I assume that this will happen.


2. We move past the point of merely getting to know factual things about each other? Most of my friendships are based off shared experience. How does one transition to this point during dating without stalling out on the whole thing? Like, what do you do when the strict ""interview stage"" ends?

Things were honestly fantastic, or so i thought until the monday after a nice weekend of seeing eachother and FaceTime, she tells me on Monday we need a break. I was devastated but i said if thats what she needed absolutely, peoples feelings are liable to change and could see things not working out etc. we kept talking all throughout the week and things seemed to be going well until one week later I get the dreaded “right person wrong time might not just mean a week” and she decided to break it off for good then. I was heartbroken because I honestly was in love with her. But through all of it i just wanted her happy so i told her i wished her well. Until the very next day i get a text from her telling me all about the boy shes already crushing on. My already broken heart was then torn out of my chest when she said he was coming over. The very next day after she dumped me. And the day after she was already wearing his hats clothes etc. i dont know how to feel or what i should think but shes posting all over social media how shes already crazy about him. And through all of this im not mad in anyway just so hurt. And everytime a conversation has been had between us she is very short, rude, and confrontational. Its feels like she wants me to get upset so she will feel better about it. I tried the whole being friends thing but she just wouldn’t stop telling me about him, I couldn’t take it. We knew eachother a month before dating for a total of 4 months knowing eachother and she just threw it away and moved on like it was nothing. Im going to get over her, but my already low self esteem and self worth have taken a massive blow and i dont onow when or if itll recover.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131731,public,self,"Got dumped recently, really need to know if im wrong for feeling how i am.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6vqd2/got_dumped_recently_really_need_to_know_if_im/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
