We're both currently in second year, having spent the entirety of first year online.

I texted with her a little bit over summer, but it was only really small talk about how she found first year etc, and never went any further.

The first semester of second year is over now, and I never spoke to her once during it. This is a combination us ending up in different friend groups, the classes being pretty big, and me just being way too shy. 

If its not too late, I would still love to try and talk to her, but I'm not sure on how best to do it.

My first approach would be to text her again, ask her how she found being back on campus etc, and maybe suggested going for a coffee or something when we get back after Christmas? 

If not that, then I could just wait until we're back after Christmas, and by some miracle work up the balls to go talk to her.

Obviously the first option is far easier, however I'm afraid it will come across as too forward, a bit creepy, and a bit sad because it's the second time I'm randomly texting her. Talking to her in person would probably be the better option, but I've no idea how to approach girls and will probably just keep putting it off until the semester ends. There's also a slim chance college's won't reopen after Christmas.

I feel like it ended prematurely. Should I have been more understanding? All I really want is for us to go back to where we were then. I want to message him and say I've made a mistake. I really just don't know anymore. Any thoughts?

“Every time I ask her when we’ll see each other again, she doesn’t react anymore..

I met her via Tinder. We went on two dates that were really fun and I could tell she really liked me. The only thing is: I’m a male transgender. I have told her that the second date and yes it was something she didn’t expect, but she said she didn’t feel different about me. She stayed with me till 2 am and we even kissed after I told her my story.

Well.. after our second date we still chat a lot on whatsapp. But every time I ask her for the next date she stops replying at that message and the next day she starts texting about something else.. totally ignoring my question. 

Last week I confronted her about it (not in a accusing manner) because I can also understand someone needs time to let my story sink in. She said she was sorry she gave me that feeling and that she still wants to date with me, because she felt so at ease with me.

Well another week of chatting and me gathering courage to ask her again.. and it is the same story again. We chatted the whole day yesterday, until I asked for another day and it is silent again.

I want to give her some more time to react, but it’s confusing..

Is she leading me on or do I have to give her more time to let my story sink in?”

The situation now:
Well it’s the same. I ask her to date. She stops texting me for a day. Well.. we had sort of a date planned for today. But she canceled because she had stomach flu. But now I get a snap that she is drinking wine at a bar.
But she also says she really wants to see me again. I’m just confused about everything. Why do you sent me a snapchat of drinking wine, while you canceled our plans? Is she testing how stupid I am? A week ago i posted a story that I was iceskating. She asked me with who I was iceskating. I said with friends. She said: “oh not a date? Because than it would be over between us”. We’ve had two dates.. and did not seen each other for a month now. She keeps texting me.. but I’m just confused..

Apps such as Grindr seem to be absolutely useless (or maybe I’m doing something wrong?), due to corona going to gay bars around town is not an option (not even sure it’s a good place to look, but it’s the only place I can think of where you can meet other guys and actually KNOW they’re into dudes as well). I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to increase my chances of catching someone’s eye. Maybe I’m trying too hard, but at the same time it’s not like it’s any different when I’m not trying.

I’ve found myself becoming a hopeless romantic once again. I’m going through a period of time where I wish I had that kind of connection, someone who makes me feel special, someone with whom the feelings are mutual, intimacy, and all that. Not just to fill a void and no cheap hookups, I’ve kinda figured those just aren’t my thing. Whenever I’m in public I’ll see plenty of guys that catch my attention (daily, it’s exhausting but my brain is an unstoppable machine when it comes to this); at school, on the street, etc. but as a guy it’s not like I can just step up to another dude and start flirting. I’ve had multiple “crushes” or interests at school already (and here I thought by now, at 22, I’d be over those kinda things lol), only to find out every single time that each one of these guys are either straight and/or taken. Makes me wonder if gay guys in my area are a myth (for reference, I go to an art school, and not to push stereotypes; but I didn’t think nearly every guy around me would be straight). That said, it’s not like people could tell I’m gay just by looking at me or talking to me either, at least that’s what I’ve heard.

I guess I’m a bit exhausted from all these feelings and internal frustrations that come from this, so part of this is me kinda venting maybe, but I’m also looking for any advice or tips to see if there’s anything I didn’t try or think of.

I seem to have started having feelings for him. Dang it.

To give you guys context, we’re still living under the same roof (we’re out on an almost month long trip with friends for business purposes) so I’m with him everyday except when we’re both out for work (we do work while on the trip). We live with five other friends.

I haven’t really given him much thought prior to the karaoke incident. I’ve always known he was attractive (physically handsome, has an amazing voice &amp; great humor) &amp; I even had a crush on him a few years back but we’ve been friends for so long that my crush eventually faded. Until that karaoke incident. *sighs

My response was to shake the incident off because I don’t really know what his intentions were so I assumed he could be just overly friendly to me or it was just a random thing he thought of doing. I tried not letting it get to my head.

However, after that incident, he’s been acting really kind and concerned towards me which makes it hard to forget what happened. I’ll give you examples:

1. One time I had to stay up super late at our common room because of how stressed I was with work. I was internally panicking and I didn't say anything about it to anybody.
Without me asking, he stayed up late with me. He sat down beside me &amp; stayed there way past his sleeping hours. 

2. He always checks up on me. I noticed that out of all of our friends, he was the one who would easily recognize when there was something wrong with me &amp; would go out of his way to make sure I was ok. (

3. Whenever I felt excluded, he'd make sure to bring me into the conversation. I'm an introvert so I find it difficult to socialize much &amp; prefer being silent. Whenever we're out at parties, he'd make sure to include me in the conversation.

4. He asked to take pictures with me. This one feels silly but I had noticed he wasn't the type to ask for picture with anyone. Which is why when he suddenly came up to me and asked our friend to snap a pic of the 2 of us, I was really surprised.

5. He learned the chords to my favorite song even though he said he doesn't listen to that artist. He took a few minutes off his work time to learn the chords because he wanted to play the song for me. He made an effort to teach me the chords and encouraged me to learn even though I sucked at music.

6. He'd offer to take my pictures. Whenever we're out on work breaks exploring tourist spots, he'd offer to take my shots. He'd see a nice spot or scenery &amp; then tell me to pose so he could take the picture.

These are just some of the things he's done after that incident. I think if it didn't happen I wouldn't have made all these a big deal, but now I've been wondering about what it actually means.. because all those six things &amp; the song he dedicated for me, kinda seem special? What do you think? Is it something a mere friend would do?

The thing is, I’ve been catching myself looking more often at him and been realizing how handsome he is at the most random times of the day (e.g. while we’re eating dinner as a group) &amp; feeling embarrassed when I realize what I’m doing.

I am usually not the person to initiate however I’ve been talking on and off to someone for a little while now, and there’s a couple of things (relating to him thinking I’m likely to say no) that I suspect might be holding him back from asking me. Either that or he isn’t actually very interested. 

I have met him a number of times in real life; but only briefly as a friend of a friend. I do not see him regularly and I am no longer very close to the mutual friend so it is unlikely I will see him any time soon. So this will have to be via message. He messages me first a lot, and although neither of us are super quick repliers, I really like talking to him and think we have a lot in common.

So I kind of want to see if I’m wasting my time or not in continuing talking to him, and I think the only way to do this and get a definite answer either way is if I go for the question. But I don’t want to do so if this would ruin my chances altogether and I should therefore just wait it out.

Opinions very much appreciated! 

And to clarify- it’s not really rejection I’m worried about. Sure I’d be disappointed but I’m not so invested as to be devastated and hey, that’s life!

Sorry if this is really long, but I feel like I need some advice.

So there’s this girl who I really like. She’s super smart, funny, and interesting. I have pretty low self esteem and think that everyone hates me but I really thought that I had a chance with this girl. We talk every other day when we have classes together and she’ll wait for me after class to talk. We even did a project together last week, and it went really really well. I thought for sure that I might have a chance. She is kind of shy, but I felt like she was giving me some signs, and I know nothing about girls (and just people in general) because I feel like I’m really awful at talking to people and usually keep to myself, but I thought that everything was great.

So, about 2 months ago, she added me on Snapchat, and we had been snapping each other a couple times a day over that time period. A couple days ago (almost a week now. :( that sucks), she just stopped snapping me back. We had a couple more classes together, and she still waited for me and talked to me as if nothing was wrong. I know that Snapchat is super stupid (I didn’t even use it anymore until she added me) but she uses it all the time, and I feel like she saw me get back to her and just decided not to respond. This feels pretty awful. Just last week (and earlier this week) I felt like I still had a good chance and was gearing up to ask her out, but now I feel like this might be slipping away. Should I still ask her out if she’s acting like she might like me in person? How much does this matter? I really don’t want to give up but should I? Am I totally insane or just a little bit crazy? I just feel like with who I am, I won’t be able to talk to anybody else with any chance of getting anywhere, and she is really fantastic and and don’t want to lose this opportunity.

Before sex he was all talk about it not being the only thing on his mind and acting as if he was interested in my life. We had sex eventually, I didn’t hear from him for days, which was unusual. Then he asked a week later if I wanna meet again, I said yes, but then he never made any plans.

We’ve been dating for a short time (it’s only been 3 weeks). He’s only been Muslim for a few months. He’s very passionate about it which I admire. However he is at time dogmatic and that I do not enjoy. I’ve been trying to educate myself on his religion so I can be more empathetic to his beliefs. We had out first “mini” fight today because I was watching one of the educational YouTube videos about Islam. He got a little up in arms because the narrator most likely (we didn’t know for sure) isn’t Muslim. He told me it’s better to learn from an actual Muslim. I said to him that I would prefer someone that is neutral to learn about Islam from because I hate dogmatics in explanations. So after that I sent him a video of a Muslim youtuber talking about how Muslims shouldn’t date non-Muslims. He stated he saw it already and he knows he’s not supposed to. So I said why don’t you just date a Muslim girl then. He said he tried and it didn’t work. When I asked him to elaborate he said he didn’t feel comfortable. I said we had talked about far more important things than this before so what is the problem. He immediately got upset and said he doesn’t press me when I say I’m not comfortable talking about something.  I said I understood and cut the call short at that point. I kinda think things aren’t going to work because he’s not really open to general conversation on his religion. I feel like if I challenge his belief in anyway he’d get annoyed/upset. I also don’t get that if he knows he’s not supposed to date a non-Muslim/non-believer why he wants to date me so bad (literally wanted me to be his girlfriend after our first date).,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1135903,public,self,I’m dating this newly converted Muslim,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/retf4g/im_dating_this_newly_converted_muslim/,no_ads,0,,,,

Sometimes there is an attempt at romance that is rejected, and it transitions into a “friendship”. In some instances, there are unexpressed feelings with someone where dating was never intended. In most instances, the object of affection already knows, in which case they are being somewhat dishonest as well.

We’ve been told that if someone doesn’t want a romantic relationship, but offers friendship, the mature and kind thing to do is accept the offer.

I am an 18yo male and have never had a relationship, nor kissed a girl or done anything sexual. Part of the reason for this in the past has been that I used to be extremely anxious about approaching and talking to women, but that has largely gone away ever since I've stopped watching porn (plz don't start an argument about whether Nofap is pseudoscience or not in the comments, I just wrote this for context). I  still get kind of anxious, but not as much. 

I am a fairly good-looking guy, although I have a bit of extra weight, but I would characterise myself as more bulky than fat. I go to the gym regularly and play sport at uni and am not an antisocial person, I am just not part of the 'popular kids'.

I go to a top-tier uni, but I'm not really a nerd. I enjoy talking about deep stuff, philosophy, religion, art etc which kind of helps when talking to girls at uni as most are quite keen on this sort of stuff.

Apologize for my broken English I'm not a native.

It all began when I met in Thailand this Guy from the US.

We met in a bar and we both drank a lot, and instant chemistry so we.... make out in the streets of Bangkok in the middle of the night. He was a tourist ( I used to live in TH) so I thought that would be it, and I would never see him again...

But he invited me for a date on the next day and was amazing, we had dinner and we went even to red-light district saw some strippers... back to my place amazing sex... 

He was a tall and fit guy half Asia, half African America he was my Jason Mamoa sort of...

But he had to leave to visit other places and but we still talking, he had some more time left in Asia, however, I had to go for a run visa in another country, and he came to me!! Stayed for 4 days.. and was perfect...

He went back to the US and we were talking every day... So in the same year, I went back to my country in Latin America, and there I tried my US visa, was denied... and I just thought maybe that wouldn't work so little by little we lost touch... I went back to TH, and lived my life... met some guys but nothing serious... so the following year he texted me saying he was coming to Asia to visit some of his family 

( let's say China)... And I all my hope for him grew again, I even went to a Tarot reader and she told her words ""I'm finally completed, male and female sides"" So I thought omggg he is THE ONE, I'm going to marry him no matter what I will be with him.

During this time of my life, I was suffering of panic attacks and anxiety ( because of drug abuse) and I felt sick physically even tho nothing was wrong... He told me he couldn't visit me in TH, but I said no problem I will go to see you, so I went... 

It was so good to see him, I even felt better, I felt protected I felt loved... but on the second day... He said something like ""Jenny is not really happy that you are here"" .... (Wtf ? ) ""Who is Jenny?"" I replied

and he answered ""Oh is My Girlfriend "", I was speechless I left Thailand with no money at all to see him, thinking that he was feeling the same about me and I was just adventurous ... I was going to spend more 4 days with him! I got worse, all the pain was back and he brought me to the hospital one time... His mom was also in town and he never introduced me to her... 

I usually have my expectations with relationships very low... and when I finally put that high I fall badly.

Well the past 4 days was really weird... and I left China and the next was my birthday... he texted me with birthday wishes, and one hour later he ""butt called"", wtf - FUCKING ASSHOLE that's was even more painful lol, you know when you get that 5-sec hope and is it crushed instantly? That was the feeling with this butt call... 

So I decided to block him and delete his number, two years later here I'm still thinking about that... and I can't meet anyone new, obviously covid happened and in TH the lockdown was very harsh, I finally move to another country but I'm blocked! I can't open myself. And this makes me feel a bit dead inside... 

I've been in other relationships that were left with a broken heart and even worse than him, but since that, I can't open, and wonder is this the result of many failed relationships? or just this one? And why I could move one before? And how I can start again with my love adventure?

Basically we were sitting at this picnic table next to my mom and her friends. We were holding hands and somehow my hand ended up on his thigh. And then I like inched it closer and yeah..I was texting him to ask if he was ok just to make sure it wasn’t like making him uncomfortable or anything. Basically our messages were just us saying we were horny. And then I was like “I’m so confused on where it is” and yeah..I found it. Tbh this was like the most risky thing I’ve done but it was pretty fun. I did it again when we got in the car and i could feel it pulsing. I looked over at him and he was yeah definitely enjoying it. It was only through his pants but yeah. Anyway this morning we technically were sexting if you call it that. He’s told me that he’s a bottom and I’m more of a switch I guess. So basically he said I could control him for the day so..yeah. I gave him JOI and he came. I feel weird about it now since we’re young and idk how to feel about it.

Some quick backstory - I know this woman as what I would consider an acquaintance for quite a few years. Her family is close to another family that my folks are close with. 

I’ve spoken to her briefly at gatherings over the years and our families now know each other very well. I was in a relationship in the past as was she so things never happened between us. With that being said, I’ve always considered her a catch. 

After a breakup, I’ve found myself on OLD. As faith would have it and to my surprise, I ran into her profile on Hinge. The doofus that I am panicked and without swiping left or right I exited the app instead. I believe when this happens, the persons card is still somewhere in the pack but I have no idea how much swiping I’ll have to do to find her again. 

My question is that we are friends on Facebook and I’ve been considering messaging her instead of swiping endlessly on Hinge to find her again. My fear is that I would come across creepy messaging her on FB about seeing her Hinge profile.

In other words, go about a romantic process before sex. So this was the approach I had when asking for her number.

I currently work at Taco Bell and have fumbled the bag very hard twice.

During earlier this summer of 2021, I started my job at Taco Bell and work in the drive thru taking orders. Firstly, I don’t really find myself attractive but have been called cute sometimes by older women but I think it’s because I’m Asian/hispanic and have a sort of baby face lol. 

To get goin, my type is latinas. And this girl pulls up in the drive thru and absolutely takes my breath away. She is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful hair and she takes my breath away. She hands me her card and gives me eye contact and smiles. Shit was mad dangerous man it was so attractive. Continuing on, my Taco Bell workers take extra time on making the food for some reason so I just stood there awkwardly and didn’t spark conversation with her. The food came eventually and I thought I would never see her again.

Today on Dec 7, she came back again and I nearly had a heart attack. She was even more gorgeous somehow and she game me that eye contact but it was different in a good way and she smiled at me with eye contact. Unfortunately, I did the same thing and just stood there awkwardly, I gave her the food and she gave me the same sexy eye contact and smile. And she was gone, I wanted to kick a wall so hard i was fucking kisses for pussying out.Like listen I think can tell when someone’s just being friendly but this was so different from anything else. 

My question is what should I attempt to do next time. As someone who has never had a girlfriend or attempted to have one besides this one girl we don’t talk about, I don’t even know how I should’ve greeted myself or started the conversation. I was overthinking it because I didn’t want to come off as too friendly or cuz I don’t know how to flirt. 

Now I will never know if she was being friendly or flirty because of me being scared.

I feel like every time I make conversation with a girl, I come off as too friendly in a way when I want to show I’m attracted to her. I don’t know how to show someone I’m attracted and I don’t want to come off as creepy.
