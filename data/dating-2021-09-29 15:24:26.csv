It didn't feel good to be let down of course, but other than that it felt pretty good. I got to be completely honest with her, I now know there isn't a relationship there, and we're still friends afterwards. 

Is this a good idea to do with everyone I have feelings for? Just being honest and ripping the band aid off quick to see if there's a chance or not?

I’m talking I’m ready for marriage, kids, the works. Before my current relationship when I was 18 I was young and dumb and got with a MAN who was 24 and I let him completely control my life. I was at his house every single day, I catered to everything he wanted because he told me this is what love was. If I didn’t do certain things or if I didn’t cut off my best friends and certain male family members he would say that I didn’t love him and he would threaten to leave me over it. He went as far to slam my hand in a door when I tried to leave after a fight and then begged me not to tell my parents or police because “he was just under a lot of pressure with school and work”. Here’s the thing! He only worked 2 days a week at Tim Horton’s on weekends and then did 1 class a day at a community college for a music degree. He would always make me drive everywhere and pay for everything because I “had the better job and didn’t have to pay bills” which I did but he would not believe me. Anyways, one day I was at his house waiting for him to come home and I was going to surprise him with lunch because I got off work early, so he had no idea I was off work. I was sitting in my car and a man pulled up into the driveway gets out and goes straight into the house….. at this point I moved my car around the corner and waited for him to come home. He got home went inside and I called him acting like I was on break. I asked him what his plans where and he said “oh I’m really tired I’m just gonna take a nap” so I hung up went up to the door, knocked and was confronted as the “creep”for stalking him. Being a weirdo etc. he was cheating on me with ANOTHER MAN! I freaked out cussed him out and broke up with him instantly. He would constantly show up at my work, show up at school, begging me to come back. I refused every single time. One night after class I was walking out to my car and he jumped out from behind and attacked me then left me for dead. A gracious campus officer rescued me that night. I am here because of her. He went to jail and I met my current boyfriend 8 months after. I have been to therapy to cope and I really do feel like I am passed that point in my life but I have so many thoughts that pop in my head at random times that make me insecure with my current boyfriend.

8,py4yhw,1632950322,I (21M) NEED ADVICE ABOUT A GIRL I LIKE,"
First of all I'm on mobile and English is my third language.

For the record, I have never been in a relationship, i have never been liked by a girl and I have no idea how flirt. 
Well, a couple weeks ago i started fp school ( I think its called trade school in the US) . I started another career path after working for 1.5 year. The first day I noticed there were 3 girls in my class but thought nothing of it. 
A couple days later some of our class went to a bar during recess and 4 of us stayed there for an hour more since we didn't have class. There I saw that the the girl (we'll call her M) was and is quite cute. We were talking (the 4 of us, not just her and I) and I got know more about her. At some point we were talking about the height of one of the teachers I we commented that M is quite small. In an attempt to say that she is short I said that she is compact size. We shared a laugh but i realized that maybe I shouldn't have said that since we don't know each other so well. I felt like a crap. I wanted to apologize to her but I didn't find the moment to talked to her.

A week later we were at the same bar and the same topic came to the talk. I we were laughing ( also her)  about how she wears boots so she can reach some machines. Since we were laughing and talking so much I casually asked her how she feels about people talking that way about her. She said that she  doesn't mind since she thinks it's funny too. i felt a bit relieved but not completely. 
In all this time I realized that I have been developing feelings about her and that it all started when I heard her laugh. When we would talk with each other I felt like there was a small but subtile connection and it felt weird since I have never had that with any girl in my life. Every one was a long time friend or someone I didn't know much. 

Fast foward to today. I was thinking for a couple of days about asking her out but didn't have the courage. But today was the day. First I asked one of our mutual classmates ( that is her friend for more time than I) if he knew if she is datong or seeing anyone. He said that he thinks she was dating someone but didn't think she is with him anymore but isn't sure. I thanked him and asked him not to tell her.
After the recess we were in class but I didn't have any work to do so I started helping people. I realized that she is having trouble doing the exercise so helped her since the the teacher is unavailable at the moment. That time was about 2:30 hours. 

Well to the point of the story. After class we were heading the same direction alne the both of us and before parting diferent way I asked if I could talk to her. I told her that if she needed or wanted help with the exercises i would love to help her accompanied by a coffee or something. She thanks me and said that she could use some of the help in the future. Then I told her that  other option was to go grab some coffee anytime. Whitout haveing a response I excused myself and told her that I didn't know if she is dating someone. She quickly said that she would like to grab the coffee but that she recently broke up with her boyfriend and that she isn't ready to be in a new relationship yet. Yet knowing knowing this I told her that I don't mind and that I could wait. Also that I will keep helping her in classes.

Now, you reading this when should I ask her again? How much should I wait?

T.L.D.R.: I sense a connection with a girl and asked her out, she said yes but she isn't ready yet to be in a relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py4yhw/i_21m_need_advice_about_a_girl_i_like/

At random times, though, I felt like I may have accidentally overstepped boundaries with some questions but immediately tried to redirect the conversation and go to some different topic. On top of this I felt like there was never any physical interaction although that may be normal but other than hugging I tried to respect her personal comfort and avoid putting my hands on her or anything.

I started seeing someone (L) about a month and a half after we broke up. 

In August K and I reconnect. In September we agree to be back together. I'm still seeing L during this time. Both K &amp; L find out. L cuts contact. K and I work through this. We ended our relationship may of last year because of her questioning her sexuality. She's in a relationship with a woman now and I'm happy she was able to figure this out before we got married and had to deal with any other fall out.

Now the new partner (S) asked if I've ever cheated and I told her about this. Obviously she has reservations about everything especially since we've met it's been nothing but fireworks. She told me she doesn't want to be made felt an idiot again from a prior relationship. Now from the infidelity incident, I Iearned to grow and be a much better, more communicative partner. K and I learned through a lot of relationship material how to respect and maintain boundaries. Everything I've learned I'm using in this current relationship.

I told her that I like her a lot and would like to further our ""relationship"". She told me that she doesnt feel the same way and that we dont know each other that well. This part I find ironic because thats what I was suggesting... Get to know each other better but under the impression that she knows what my intentions are (which is eventually start dating). We stopped talking and hanging out for two weeks.

It was her birthday today and I got her a small gift I knew she would appreciate. I told her to meet me and she did. I gave it to her and we chatted for a bit. After a while she told me that she likes a guy and is talking to him. After asking a few follow up questions about him she told me basically this: ""I like him and we both agreed that we should get to know each other better before starting anything. Right now we are just texting and occasionally hanging out but we want to further our ""relationship"" "". 

I wished her good luck but inside... SERIOUSLY? Exactly the same thing I wanted. Now dont get me wrong she doesnt owe me anything but damn... That hurt. She slept with me, hung out with me a lot and now she is doing the same thing I wanted to do with her but with a guy she just met?

16,py5pnx,1632952632,Ex moved out 3 months ago and hooks up every weekend. I’ve been sexless for a year.,"Idk if this is the right place to even vent but idk what else to say or do 

I’m a 32 year old guy who recently got out of a 3 year relationship that was sexless for the last year. My ex finally moved out and is living her own life. We still kind of are on good terms and occasionally help each other out. Recently I found out through a mutual friend of ours that she’s been pretty much going to town almost every weekend. Has multiple partners and is kinda dating around and sleeping with whoever. I personally expected it but for some reason hearing about it made me very self conscious about myself. 

I have a good career, I work out, I have a dog and a cat and my own home. Everything is going relatively well for me. Except in the sex life department. I absolutely wish I could have a sex life again but for some reason I just honestly cant find anyone who wants to have sex with me. I go out once or twice a week for live bands and trivia and I try to see if anyone looks interested in me but it seems nobody even looks at me. 

I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me or it’s possible that my ex was the best that I could do and I’m probably screwed now that she’s gone. She’s out there hooking up and I’ve been sexless for about a year and half, my ex being my last. Since she’s left no woman has come over to my place, I have t gotten matches or dates on tinder. I follow all the general rules of looking attractive and being active but I honestly feel like their is something that nobody is telling me. Idk if I’m ugly or weird or anything but I feel like a complete failure because the rest of my life is going swell except that i don’t have an active sex life even though I absolutely would love to have one. 

Idk what else to do honestly. I go out, I try to talk to people, I go to social events, I work out, I have hobbies but here’s this one part of me that would make me feel somewhat special to someone for just one evening and it’s just not happening.

19,py68cz,1632954224,"Is it okay to not ""fight"" for it?","This is a rant and a question in one. 

I've had this conundrum in my head ever since my last relationship ended and then I went back to the dating scene ever since. When someone says they don't want to be with me I'm just like okay. I'm heartbroken if I've gotten attached but I understand their point of view. And the thing with me is that I'm a firm believer in if a person wants to stay with you or date you they'll. You shouldn't have to convince them to be with you. If my significant other has it going pretty bad, I try to be a better version of myself for her and I do what's asked of me. Yet even then I don't sell myself to that person. And I think that's been hurting me lately. Girls have said that my behavior has puzzled them. One time I can be really great  and at times according to them it's impossible to get through to me. I've lost out on some wonderful women over the past year due to this. 2 of them have come to me and said that I didn't push hard enough when I asked them out to make it official. Both of them initially said no and gave some pretty valid reasons. And I accepted it. But some weeks later they complained that I didn't try hard enough. That I didn't pursue them enough. And I accepted it rather than fight for it. Now, my point is why should I do that? I asked you out. You said no. The story is over. I want to be with someone who wants to be with me. Not someone who I've to convince to stay with me. Even with my ex there were a lot of times when other guys came and tried to ask her out. And at times the situation did get messy. And I just said if you want to be with him then you can leave. If you want to be with me then stay. It's up to you. I've told friends about these times with my ex and the majority of them (and also my ex) were of the opinion that I shouldn't have given her the option. It makes the other person feel less wanted. My ex always used to say how can I say that and that she wants to be with me. But my arguments are the same. I can't control how the other person behaves. If someone loves me, I'll love them back. Shouldn't it be simple? If I'm wrong, please tell me why and how I can change it. One last thing, even though I don't ""fight"" for it, but I've always made my affection for the concerned person very clear. How much they mean to me/the things I like about them/ things I try to learn from them so I would say a lack of affection isn't something I lack.

I'm not sure if I should tell her that I'm still a virgin or to provide the backstory as to why. It's one of the things that I feel is unresolved from my past due to poor life choices and is something that I still feel quite self-conscious about.

2nd date was also great, and I was expecting a kiss. We went to a bar and talked for 4 hours, then she invited me back to her place to get the dogs to take them for a walk. She invited me to sit on the couch, but she sat on the arm on the opposite side of the couch. Weird I thought. At the end of the date we hugged and she backed away.

3rd date was awkward and she kept her distance from me again. I straight up asked her what the deal was. She explained that she likes me and is going through some personal issues. I said that's understandable, but I'm not looking for a buddy, but a girlfriend. And that I assume lack of physical connection is a lack of interest, but she swore that wasnt the case.

We then talked on the phone for hours like tlnothing was wrong.

4th date last night. Went out to dinner then she agreed to come to my place. I sat on the couch to watch tv, and again she sat on the far side of the couch. I got up to go to the bathroom and sat a little closer and reach my arm out. Again she did not move closer..

At this point I'm totally confused, so I straight up ask her again what the deal is. She tells me that she's attracted to me and likes me, but is having a hard time being affectionate. She said we should hang out a 5th time to try again.

I walked her to her car and gave her a hug, and leaned in for a kiss which she accepted.

Idk this whole thing has been fucking with my head. Were both attractive young adults with a lot in common, and can talk to each other for hours.

Slowly over the course of the year she slowly didn’t talk to me as much and we just drifted and I was scared to make the move of saying hi to her and then Covid happened lockdowns came and eventually didn’t see her for over a year.

After the date, he needs to send the first text and what does the girl do....ghost for no apparent reason.

40,py8xbi,1632963506,Am I being an asshole here or just being jealous or both,"
I am 20 years old I am currently a junior in college(Recently transferred) and I am also a tutor for the university mostly calculus and pre-calculus courses. I do tutoring Tuesday &amp; Thursday it was a normal day I met up with 2 students and I helped them with homework and what not but there was one last student who was late so I was about to leave but decided to wait as it is my job and when she came in she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen no cheesy shit she is so beautiful. Anyways we sat down helped her with her classwork and I am not gonna lie I was distracted I was just looking at her she caught me a few times but just smiled I just tossed up as nothing our session was over and that was that. A few weeks later she comes back and I actually strike up a conversation it was so easy I did not have to force anything and in the end, I asked for her number she gave it to me and I am not gonna lie I was so happy I go home  I call her and we talked for hours I waited  3 days to ask her out she said yes. We go on a date and it went well she smiled a lot and at the end of our date she kisses me we make out for a while and that was that. When it comes to relationships I have only been with 3 girls and they were long term relationships and I have never felt more comfortable with her I felt I could be more open with that being said I am a virgin I have never had sex I have done ""other things "" but have not gone the full length. I believe in complete transparency I told her about my virginity I was freaking out a bit because what if she thought it was weird that I was a virgin at 20 years old but she said she loved the fact that she was gonna be my first when I was ready. 2 months past I have this amazing girlfriend life is good I am on track with my school, she has exposed me to new things and places because before her I was very laid back but with her, I feel like a better version of myself. This is where I feel like I kinda messed things up because we were just laying in bed in her house and since she knew about my virginity I wanted to know about her past experiences its only fair right? when I asked she seemed surprised all she said was that ""I was not going to be her first"" but she loves me and that is all that matters I saw she was uncomfortable with the topic I changed it and we went along with our day. I kept playing the conversation in my head over and over again and it got the best of me because I was curious to know how many there were before me so again I asked her to give me a number (I know its childish) but she said it did not matter to our relationship but I insisted and she told me after she made me promised that I would not think of her differently. She slept with 23 guys she is 21 years old btw some were boyfriends, hookups, one nightstand. I know she had a life before me and she did things before me and there is nothing I could do about her past after she told me I told her I love her and it did not matter and we went along with our day. A month pass I was feeling ready to have sex for the first time she was excited so was I because I had wanted her so bad and here was my chance. This is the part that makes me an asshole because her parents were not gonna be home for the weekend she said we could have the place to ourselves I was beyond excited now. She even tried to make it special(she had roses that said I love you when I walked in) we were on the couch we were having drinks and we started to make out and she took me to her room and she starts undressing me and kissing and I was doing the same but I don't know what happened my mind was just thinking that you are just another number you're just number 24  and I stopped told her I was not feeling well anymore and if we could take a break she understood and told me we could try again later or tomorrow but I told her I had a headache and went home.   I had no problem when she told me about her past experiences why now? it's like I am imagining her with ""them"" and I don't want to that I even told my best friend about it and he says that it was just because I don't have much experience if I  did it would be different.

I asked why she didn't reveal her name and her response was because of weirdos. I understood, I think.

But then I asked ""So, do you prefer to reveal me your sexuality and the lack of experience, rather than your name? Or was it to see if I'm a weirdo?""

I got instantly blocked, without any conversation, nothing, just blocked...

I'm a  42 yo male KHV  - that's 'Kissless, Handholdless Virgin' to those who don't know. Kind of an idiotic acronym.  Couldn't date as a younger adult partly due to being  caregiver to a dying parent from my mid twenties to mid thirties.  Psychologically I'm still somewhere in my twenties. 

I don't identify as inc\*l or hate women, although such accusations will be  inevitable, because there  is some bitterness there. 

It sounds ugly, but dating/relationships with middle-aged women who have been through it dozen times or more holds little appeal. People are looking old at this point, just the thought of a first sexual experience with someone this age is strange, and the gulf in life experience has become ridiculous. I can't have children with women my age but if I look for someone younger I'll get labelled superficial or creepy.

Sometimes  I Just can't be bothered debating with  self-righteous people who already had their lives, even if they mean well. Most people got what they wanted when they were youn. It's easier to take the moral high ground when that life experience allows them to move on. And women seem to expect the same dynamic to work for them at 42 as it did at 22, then lash out when it turns out not to be that way any more. Complaining about how superficial men are and their own sexual invisibility to a man who has always been invisible gets annoying fast. 

And  at this point most people are so tired and jaded that even socializing is becoming unappealing, so I'm in a social and romantic no-man's land.

Is there any point to trying now? What for. Companionship? I can get that with friends.  A younger woman (late 20s/early 30s) isn't likely to want a middle aged manchild with less experience that a 20 yo, and I can't behave like a brain in a jar and pretend physical attraction or having a family doesn't matter to me.

49,py9chd,1632964988,I feel like on paper I should be successful at dating... but I'm not and I can't figure out why.,"Alright, I'll list out what I think is relevant:
I'm 24, male, I live in New York City. I'm 6'0, 190 pounds, make 6 figures, constantly get compliments on my hair, and my platonic female friends find me to be a likeable person. I'm the type of guy who can pull weird factoids out of his ass at any time and has extensive knowledge on weird, niche topics.

The downsides: Well, you might've guessed it from that ""weird, extensive knowledge"" point but I'm on the autism spectrum. I'm relatively high functioning but I get massive anxiety around women. Another point is that while I have straight teeth, I chipped a couple of them a few years ago, but people tell me it isn't noticeable. If this could be a deal breaker I'll get them fixed though.

I just...can't seem to find any dating success and it doesn't make any sense to me. I know people who are an absolute wreck and still have no trouble getting dates. I've been questioning if this might be due to a mismatched gender identity (you can check my history to read all about that if you want) but on further contemplation I like my body and I'm comfortable with my appearance. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong here.

I'm trying so incredibly hard not to be bitter but when I worked my ass off to lose over 50 pounds during the pandemic, get a 6 figure job, and move to a city known for having an extremely favorable dating scene I would've thought I'd get SOMEWHERE. The fact that I've done all that and I'm STILL failing has left me feeling like maybe being autistic has made me a fundamentally broken human being who will never experience what it's like to be a functioning human.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/py9chd/i_feel_like_on_paper_i_should_be_successful_at/

I’m a 22 yr male. My life looks nothing like it did before the pandemic. In many ways for better! Dream job, steady finances, and a bright future to look ahead towards. 

But I’m rebuilding my life. Because the pandemic changed my whole life. My last relationship of over 5 years ended, I lost my friends, and my job keeps me a little secluded from the local city. 

I’ve been on a few first dates but it’s hard to keep my head up. There isn’t much to do where I live so meeting people outside of dating apps is a little tricky. (It’s doable for sure)

Idk, this probably is just a rant but it’s hard to keep going, stay happy, and keep dating. Between being ghosted, stood up, asked to join a cult, and no romance It’s hard to want to keep trying.

For more detailed context, we’ve been talking and going on dates consistently since May of this year. We hit it off pretty quickly and I would say we have a lot of common interests.

Both times I think the dates went well - he said he had fun!

This past weekend I was out of town on a vacation, and his sister was visiting from college, so our texting slowed down on both sides, but I figured it was fine because we were both busy. We caught up again soon after and texted all day on Monday, but on Tuesday it slowed down again on his side and it’s now Wednesday and he hasn’t texted back in 24 hours. I don’t think I did anything to turn him off but I’ve been seeing him active on social media.

I’m not upset or mad at him because I know having an actual conversation requires a different thought-capacity than just mindless scrolling on Instagram and Twitter.

59,pyahqq,1632969037,Being ugly [M] 22,"

I’ve been working this new job where I’m outside all the time going from house to house. I see a lot of pretty girls and I honestly feel sad when I see them. Because I know I could never have that. 

I look at myself in the mirror and compare myself to other guys out there that would do so much better than me in terms of looks. I’ve never had a girlfriend and for very bad reasons. I’m always scared and shy and when I see a girl I’m attract too I just don’t even try. What’s the point. I just know what they’re going to say. No

Yesterday, I saw this really pretty girl come outside and thank me for delivering her package and I just felt so hopeless. She looked so perfect. I know she doesn’t see me as attractive. I’m just some random 

I wished I looked better. My face and head is shaped so weirdly and my acne won’t go away no matter what I do. 

I have a kind heart and have been friend zoned by every girl I’ve tried pursuing. I guess people don’t want to be treated well. This world just rewards bad behavior. 

No one sees me more than just a friend. I’m just nothing. Not even “ugly girls” want anything to do with me so I have no one. 

I think I’m just gonna quit trying to date someone. Just be alone by myself and focus on getting better but damn. It’s such a lonely feeling. I guess I want someone to care about me since my parents didn’t do so. I’m always looking for a woman to validate me and make me feel like I matter because I don’t know how to love someone.

70,pyb985,1632971806,Hi I met a boy he’s super cute,"
There was a boy in one of my college labs. He had nice hair and wore glasses and had absolutely terrible writing. He was super good at calculations though, one of those guys that finds problem solving/ mathy stuff easy. It was a super tough stem class and I always felt inferior to him since he was so smart haha. 

Anyways, before every lab while everyone was waiting around for the prof to come in, he’d always walk across the room to my bench and stand around next to me. (Which was surprisingly confident of him). We had been partnered once before so had kinda become acquaintances. 

I was super shy around him and could rarely muster up the courage to say anything. He was pretty shy too I think but I can’t tell. We’d kinda just stand around in silence until he had to go back to his bench. I always looked forward to it cause he’d stand kind of close and I felt so safe idk. I looked at his hands a lot I hope he didn’t notice lol. They were so nice he had big hands and chubby fingers and hair running up the hand and super short nails. He was tiny bit shorter than me so I’d always make an effort to not wear my heeled winter boots lol cause I heard that makes guys feel bad or something. 

I’m not really sure where I’m going with this but I wish I had said or done something. It’s confusing that he had enough courage to come approach me every time but never really said much? It was quite a comfortable silence though like we’d kinda just smile at each other and people watch so maybe he didn’t feel the need. 

I know I’ll probably never see him again and If I do he’ll probably have moved on but I cant remember the last time I felt so safe around a guy. I keep reminding myself how I barely knew him and for all I know he could be a complete asshole who didn’t even like me. So yeah. Give advice or whatever.

71,pybcj2,1632972146,"Did dating/sex feel different when you were a teen, compared to now in adulthood?","I feel like I missed out on young puppy love and all the apparently exciting stuff that comes with dating and having sex as a teenager.

From what I see in media and from peers' recountings, teenage experiences just seem more exciting and meaningful, since there's an aspect of newness, of transgression, of doing something grownup that satisfies your hormonal urges in a way that can't be replicated in adulthood.

This could mean sneaking out to party or hang with your bf/gf and friends, having sex in forbidden places like a car or a classroom, discovering romantic love and the fun of sex with your young bf/gf, being irresponsible and rebellious, etc.

And generally, I feel like I missed out on the 'magic' that seems to permeate those youthful experiences, and I find myself longing for that kind of excitement and satisfaction, which might not even be possible to attain in adulthood because of various factors (more jaded emotions, less opportunities to be transgressive, more consequences for irresponsible acts, etc.). 

I'm having trouble moving on from missing out on these experiences because adulthood doesn't seem to offer anywhere near that kind of pure fulfilling excitement that young sex and dating could.

Does anyone feel the same? And for those who had these experiences, could you say if they did feel different to what you experience nowadays?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pybcj2/did_datingsex_feel_different_when_you_were_a_teen/

so then a couple days later we make plans to go to the movies the following weekend &amp; she basically said she wasnt in the right place mentally to be dating right now, &amp; she had so much fun with me on the date &amp; if i was looking for something romantic or platonic. she said she was comfortable with something platonic &amp; that she found her self feeling a bit anxious (from what i was told, its been a rough few dating years). i said i wasnt sure what i was looking for, that i was just seeing how things went. we agreed to just meet in the middle &amp; she was relieved i said i had no real plans in regards to what i was looking for. we went to the movies &amp; got ice cream after. 

after that 2nd date/hangout i caught myself crushing pretty hard so i’m pulling back a bit just so i dont build up false hope. i think i was just caught a bit off guard bc they said i wasnt friendzoned &amp; then say that they’re not ready to date(which i totally understand), then on top of that they wanna get to know me better, wanting me to open up about myself (which to be fair i havent really been open about myself). i’ve only ever been in one real relationship a couple years ago, so to have someone seem genuinely interested in me is nice. especially after the last few years of dating women with a bland personality &amp; overall boring.

I'm kind of nervous and kind of like this lady a lot.

Wrote her a letter awhile back and I thought she was more or less disgusted by it when she took it from me. The letter was something like, she shines through to me and every smile makes me a shade happier. Everytime.

Never mentioned the letter again, but when I say similar things to her she turns a bit shy and that makes me shy, then we're both just shy.

Ya know?

Really would like some advice on what I could do to make her feel comfortable and not as shy with me. I'd like to... have her feel safe with me.

She has been having a problem with guys stalking her and I've been putting myself between her and these guys, at her request of course, and she's just so thankful... Sometimes she tells me that she feels safe when I'm around and I make her mood improves when she sees me.

Really makes my day a lot brighter. Being around her, stumbling through our conversations. Really just the cutest thing ever...

I have not had a girlfriend before so this intrigues me. A lot of people simply said that love will come when I least expect it. While I don't disagree with that advice and understand where it comes from, I'm still wondering how people know if they're in a ""talking"" phase or if they passed the threshold from ""talking"" to ""relationship"" or whatever phase they're in. How do you know if you've passed the threshold into the ""talking"" phase, or transitioned from ""talking"" to ""relationship?"" How do these transitions even work in the first place? Do both people just confess their feelings one day and boom! Presto! Relationship! Or is it a more gradual transition where both poeple just have a strong affinity towards each other? Although I don't know how the first option can happen because confessing is usually a bad idea, but (I may be wrong when I say this) if both people want to enter a relationship and want the other to know and agree to it then they would have to confess anyway. So how else would you know if you passed the transition into a ""relationship?"" I'm afraid that I may not know because, again, I have no dating experience and I'm afraid I may miss opportunities to enter a relationship if I fail to recognize these signs and enter a talking phase without even realizing it.

96,pychjc,1632976553,thoughts??!,Hey guys… the guy I’m talking to wants me to fly out to see him. I ended up paying for my flight and he paid for my shuttle to get to him from the airport… I feel weird because I’m like why didn’t you pay for my flight? I mean I guess it is fair but like it’s my first time going out there and I was expecting him to pay for it since he asked me.. I feel dumb already lol but what are your thoughts,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pychjc/thoughts/
97,pycn2z,1632977181,Gut Feeling,"I’m not here to ask for advice or tips on dating. I really want to come on here to talk about how crappy I’ve been feeling for a couple of days. I was talking to this guy for a some time now and things were truly great. This was the first guy I’ve dated in a long time and every single date was fantastic. He was easy to talk to, understanding, straight forward, genuine, and I felt safe enough to open up quickly and be vulnerable with him. Never once during this time did I ever felt like he was toying with my feelings and I never had to question what his intentions were because he always expressed them to me with no issues. It was reassuring and maybe I jumped the gun, but I started envisioning how life would be with him. Things however took a slight turn. For the past few days/week I felt that something was off. I had a gut feeling something was wrong and that things were going to end. Also, I’m not crazy about astrology, but Mercury being in retrograde also didn’t help ease my gut feeling. I tried to reassure myself that he was busy with work and life which I completely understand. Sometimes people just want a break from things and relax - a little social battery recharge. I thought things were looking up until he called things off as he doesn’t share the same feelings as I did. I was initially shocked, but at the same time I wasn’t because I had that gut feeling. I was overwhelmed with emotions. I started to break down and all the thoughts of “was it me?” “What did I do?” “What went wrong?” and anything of that sort started to flood in. I had a complete break down because I really wanted it to work out. He reassured me that he enjoyed every single minute we spent together and still hopes that we can be friends whenever I am ready. And I’m not sure what your opinions are, but personally for myself I don’t mind being friends. It’s going to suck a bit for some time and I want to take the time I need to process everything and “heal” from it before we can be friends. Good news is I’m feeling slightly better, but this is a work in progress. -end vent session-

98,pycw2i,1632978220,Is it too much to ask…,"I, 35 m, and I have had the worst luck with finding a nice, normal, chill woman. I believe that I am a good guy but I continue to find women that are dealing with the perpetual baggage. Like, why does this keep happening? Im a great conversationalist, Im kindhearted, a free spirit, if you will. Not much makes me mad, I go with the flow, I’ll do everything for and with the woman but I still get the short end of the stick. Why? What did I do to deserve this? Any input would be greatly appreciated because I am at the end of my rope rn. 
Thanks for the comments and advice, in advance. 🎃🤙✌️👍",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pycw2i/is_it_too_much_to_ask/
