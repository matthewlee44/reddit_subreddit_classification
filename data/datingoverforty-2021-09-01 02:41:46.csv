7,pfymtp,1630517112,Should I post my weight loss before and after picture in my OLD profile?,"Basically, I have been hiding the fact that I used to be significantly overweight a few years ago. However I lost a lot of weight and now with dating, when things begin to get physical I am always very embarrassed about the residual loose skin around my abdomen and upper thighs. It’s a natural consequence after being overweight and losing that weight, and unfortunately it can only be dealt with through expensive plastic surgery, that I can’t afford right now.  I am proud of my weight loss, but I don’t want it to define me, which is why I preferred to try to wait before I disclosed that information to people in my life. (Most of my work colleagues don’t even know that I used to be overweight.) 

However, now I’m starting to think that maybe if I just put it out there in my OLD profile that men will then just know, going into dating me, that my body isn’t going to be perfect, and I will have loose skin, since I have lost so much. So I’m asking; Is this a good idea? Or is it better that I wait to disclose this personal information until we know each other better? What do you all think?

14,pg38th,1630530808,Interesting observation about dating sites and saying you don't drink alcohol.,"So I find myself back on OLD, bumble to be specific. Between the last time I was on OLD and this current go I decided to stop drinking alcohol, not because I had an issue or even drank often or in large quantities but after meeting up with an old college friend and having a couple of beers I woke up feeling horrible and just decided I don't want to drink anymore and it's definitely not something I need in my life. Anyway, this time around on OLD I decided to mention in my profile ""I don't drink alcohol but all good if you do, I don't judge"" just for transparency figuring it might be important to some women and the lack of any matches is staggering. I'm nothing to write home about, probably a 7.5 on a good day but I've never had any issues with getting matches on bumble but now that I've explicitly stated that I don't drink, crickets. I've dated women in the past who didn't drink and I never thought twice about it but apparently it's important to a lot of people.

What are your thoughts? Would you date someone who didn't drink alcohol? Is it a deal breaker? Have you tried in the past dating someone who didn't drink and was it weird? Just trying to get some insight.

20,pg7whr,1630546649,Am I bad at OLD?,"Obligatory this is on mobile. Also I understand that no one is necessarily *good* at OLD but I would love some perspective, oh gracious internet strangers.

Just restarted profiles on OKC and Bumble and started a whole new Hinge profile after changing states. But I seem to be having the same issues in my new home that I had in my old one. Few matches, which I understand is not abnormal for my demographic (43M). The problem seems to be when I  *do* match.

Regardless of how well the conversations seem to go, eventually almost everyone seems to end up ghosting me. I try to be honest and witty and forthright, all characteristics about myself that I like and think come across well for the most part via the time-delay hell that is most OLD chats. I ask them questions about themselves and their interests, and I always at least reply when they message. If the particular branch of the conversation seems to be ending I'll go back to their profile and ask another question if I can think of one I'd like to know the answer to, in order to keep the conversation going. If they seem uninteresting I'll politely let them know that I don't think we have much in common and wish them well in their dating journey.

Perhaps because of the relatively small number of matches I don't understand whether this is a normal experience for many in OLD-world or whether I'm somehow not engaging enough, or perhaps I come across as gruff or demanding, or worse, boring?

36,pgocu1,1630609300,Ending contact - do I owe an explanation?,"I met someone on OLD last October and though we’ve spent time together doing various things over the past 10 months, things technically never evolved to dating. I would argue there were perhaps many mixed signals but no handholding, kisses or sex. We enjoyed going for walks, eating dinner together at my place or his, watching Netflix, etc but neither of us initiated a conversation about how we felt or whether we wanted to take things further. 

I suppose I knew on some level at some point that I was friend-zoned but again…mixed signals. Anyway, it still came as an unpleasant surprise when he suddenly asked me recently at dinner “So, how’s your summer dating going?” as if we had already had a conversation defining what we were doing. He then proceeded to tell me all about a woman he’s met, their courtship history and how after 2 dates they were going away that weekend for an overnight. I was rather stunned at the admission, the way he did it and I felt like all that was necessary might have been a simple “I like you, I enjoy hanging out with you but I’m not feeling anything romantic here…” No need to elaborate on the rest. 

We finished the dinner and evening fine but the way he did that didn’t sit right with me. Blurting out “How’s your summer dating going?” was obviously a setup for him to share his news. I did tell him later that it made me uncomfortable, told him why, and said ‘I’m sure you didn’t mean to upset me but I thought you should know how it made me feel.” He appreciated that and suggested we meet in person to discuss, which we did. 

We talked and I felt good about getting some things off my chest, asking my questions, even though I believe he still was not completely honest or straightforward at times. Even if he didn’t answer truthfully or directly, that’s still an answer for me. I’m not heartbroken, nor am I jealous over this woman he’s met. It’s about finding happiness, if not with each other then with the right person. 

Anyway, he wrote me again days later to say hi, how’s it going, how was your weekend? I see no reason to continue communicating. Can’t imagine his girlfriend would be pleased to know he’s talking and hanging out with someone he met on a dating app, either. But do I owe him any sort of goodbye or do I delete/block him like my friends are suggesting?

40,pgqco2,1630615458,Female opinion: is she into me?,"So, I have a friend from our gym that recently closed. We both got divorced earlier this year and kind of became divorce chat buddies. In total we have known each other around 5 years. I wouldn't say we are flirty, but have good chemistry when we talk. A couple of times since then during social occasions, she has asked me some probing questions, if I'm dating anyone. At the time I always took it as if she were asking what it was like dating post divorce as I was a little earlier than her. But could she have been thinking of asking me out?? I always responded with fun stories from my post divorce dating misadventures, which I'm now afraid may have scared her off.

I thought about gauging her interest at one point, but there are a few reasons why she may not be into me. I think she wants kids in her future, I already have 2, and a vasectomy (she is 38, I'm 44). She is a little taller than me, and much more of a beast in the gym than I am. I think she may want a traditional attentive boyfriend, but I'm a little limited in that area as I have primary custody of my kids and they come first in my life. If I thought she were actually interested I would jump at the chance because she is a great person not to mention gorgeous.

So in any event, we've been in each other's DMs and are looking like we're gonna grab drinks Saturday. She actually invited me out last week with a few mutual friends but I had to decline.

In view of this whole situation, should I believe she is interested here? I have history of reading these things wrong. And to complicate things even further, I've been seeing someone else, not with an exclusivity talk but definitely steady, who is also somewhat out of my league. But my interest in gym girl is too strong to not explore this.

If people just wanted to talk and never set up a date I'd end it with them. I had quite a few dates, then ended up in a relationship with someone for 18 months. I'm finally feeling like I'm in a good place and ready to date again after that ended, but OLD seems so different now...

I am still matching with a lot of people, but one of two things is happening. They either chat for a day or 2 then disappear (which is fine, I just unmatch and move on) or we hit it off, have great conversation, set up a date, and then the DAY OF, they text me to cancel, saying they just aren't ready to date, they are still processing their divorce, etc etc...  They always say things like ""it's not you"", etc. Thanks, I know lol...

It's infuriating! Not only is it just frustrating from the standpoint of whyyyy are you on the apps if you don't have the balls to go on a date? But it's also so disrespectful of my time and my feelings. (I obviously try to limit feelings lol, but I do get excited about dates and meeting someone new!)

We exchanged a couple of messages.  I messaged her first, again on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night.  Chat exchanges were good.  Not too long, nor too brief.

52,pheqxz,1630706115,Humorous lessons from a catfish,"Hopefully we will all see the warning signs before the scam really hurts. This post is intended for amusement  and learning. Warning: it’s long. 


I decided to try OLD again; I only create 1 profile on 1 site at a time since it’s enough bs to wade through. Day2 I get a like from a rather good looking fella (flag1 - in my head: *why would he be having trouble meeting people*) who actually isn’t my type since he’s sporting a full, but groomed beard (flag2 - *everyone says to be open to meeting someone that I would not typically meet*). Pleasant openings were exchanged of a few sentences. I inquired about ethnicity since his was listed as ‘Other’; to which was told he was from the Netherlands. (*isn’t that still Caucasian?* -Flag3 But whatever since maybe it’s just a US delineation) He asked what I’m looking for &amp; even though ‘Something casual’ is on my profile, I answer ‘occasional dating, for now’. When I reversed the question, his was a ‘serious relationship’ which didn’t surprise me since ‘long-term relationship’ was selected on his profile. Then the long, diatribe of what a loving, committed relationship looks like started. (Ummm BIGFlag1), but I asked: “what does that look like to you? Exclusivity? What do you call the time between meeting &amp; getting to know leading towards a committed relationship?” To which he simplistically answered ‘friendship’. (*ok, that I can do*) 


Some more casual exchanges occur for another 2 days before he suggested we move to WhatsApp. Here’s Lesson1: WhatsApp is tied to your phone number. Even with using the QR generated code, the info is still shared. WhatsApp isn’t my preferred texting method, but of course he didn’t have KIK or Skype, both of which are linked to an email account. I’ve gotten criticized for not trustingly giving my phone number to a nice fella that became a FWB earlier in the year; so I’m was trying not to be so ridged.  Flag4 - Funny enough, his initial greeting was “hello pretty” but considering ‘beautiful’ is overused &amp; not quite to ‘dear, sexy, or gorgeous’ yet, I let it slide. Over the next few days, my actual name from my profile was never used to address me - BIGFlag#.  


Lesson2: Another weird thing I noticed with WhatsApp is that his messages never showed the check marks turning green for ‘read’ which was completely different than when I text with my friends on the same app. BIGFlag2 Plus, if he commented on something I wrote or shared, it would paste the repeated dialogue box over his response. Again, not the same as when used with my friends. Deductive reasoning concludes that it’s from using the app on a desktop and not a personal mobile device, but I’m just theorizing. 


Then the personal questions started: ‘what is your family like…?’ In which I gave general info and never any names. Standard get to know intro. But when asked in return, he was an only child of deceased parents, and wife passed away 8yrs ago during birth of his son. (*Tragic but really?!?* HUGEFlag) This is the start to when I am pretty sure I’m getting catfished; I know that we will never meet, but am curious to know what tragedy is going to be spun to ask for money. So I don’t report and block at that time because I would have missed some of the hilarity below.  


When asked what he [CF for CatFish from here on out] liked to do for fun, holy moly word vomit ensued: “ I enjoy cooking, especially when cooking with someone special; … good conversation and am a good listener. Holding hands at the beach with my partner and watching the beauties of nature, like to spend a quiet time with my woman at the fireplace telling her some good stories and running my fingers through her hair, dancing, i am a very romantic man who love to treat my woman like queen” and more: “ I also like exploring i love to travel out new places and activities. Finding the simple pleasures with a special someone at the grocery store, walks along the lake, just hanging out can be magical making anywhere in the world our hot spot. I am a fun loving person ,loves to try new things, but sometimes my mood matters, the weather too matters, when its rainy, love to sit at the fireplace, cuddle, loves to read novels while the thunder storms is making its noise out side, when i am  with my partner love to play with her  romantically , pillow fights and all that, and it  would be fun reading her some good novel till  we fall asleep together. But on normal day, love to cook at the kitchen, drive around town with no destination looking around and seeing new places.” WOW that was overkill imho. 


When asked my favorite color, I only provided a specific shade, one word answer, and got back: “My favorite colors are both white and red, because the white stands for a pure heart and the red stands for love, so when you add the both of them together you have a pure hearted love, that is me because I do have a pure heart for love” *Oh my* - big eye roll time. 


In the middle of Q&amp;A, “I’m off to the Gym, but I’m open to text and reply you until when I start to work out”. That’s great to set reasonable expectations that one is not always available but… it’s a Sunday evening… 8pm … as a single dad of an 8 year old that should be getting ready for bed &amp; school the next day. (*that must be some amazing babysitter or super kind neighbors*) I’m not complaining since a vid clip of overhead shoulder presses was sent; clothed, not offensive, but you know - planned proof that the workout occurred. When later asked what CF’s kid was doing while at evening gym trips, ‘watching movie’ was the concise reply. 


The morning greetings went above and beyond a simple hello: “ Good morning pretty, I hope you slept well? Every day is beautiful. Each day is special. Each day is a gift of God, and this is why we call it the 'present'. May the light and freshness of this new day, bring in a sweet vibe in your life. Live the day, as if there is no tomorrow And enjoy every moment, like there are no worries. I wish you a fragrant and beautiful day.💞🌹” and “ Good morning pretty🥰 Yesterday, today and tomorrow are all a chain of achievements for a hard working person like you. May you get all that you work for and aspire for. May you paint this world with your colors so bright and cheerful. May all you do be so beautiful. Have a lovely day dear 🌹🌹”


See a pattern yet? When CF asked the question, a long answer was most likely cut/copy/pasted; but when I asked a question, it was short and usually with broken English.  Feel free to ask a question [like favorite food? Music? Sports? Temper? Looking in the mirror? Past marital life affect now? Goals &amp; dreams? kind of mate? Problem with marriage? Favorite attributes of another? How romantic are you? Why looking online? Likes &amp; dislikes again? Favorite thing to do alone?  Inspiration in life? What is love? Trait to maintain a successful relationship? Communication properties?] you might use to when getting to know someone new and if I have CF’s answer, I will provide so you can get a feel for the exchange. 


Ready for more ridiculous? CF apparently has tons of money. “I drive Mercedes Benz, Range Rover, BMW….I’m looking forward to get sweet sport Lamborghini or Bugatti” *Dream big single dad!* 


I actually think this is a good Q: “…can you tell me what would make you smile on a blue day?” But it seemed that “Dad jokes and maybe cheesy pun memes” was not the correct answer since a smile &amp; someone else’s happiness was all it took for CF. 


I was surprised I wasn’t pressed for more info when asked what I do for a living since my response was very general and then added: “ I don’t prefer to get into the specifics of my profession until after meeting in person and getting to know each other more”.  CF said he was a mechanical engineer… on an underwater oil rig… (*hold up - engineers I know are concise, not verbose; plus what happens with the kid when working onsite?*) The plot thickens! 


When asked what CF had for breakfast: “I had Sandwiches”. And what did you put in your sandwiches? “ Whole wheat, sourdough and rye” (isn’t that just toast?*) 


CF was the first to mention “… I look forward to spending some time with you in person.“ Of course I took the bait &amp; asked: “Is there a lunch time this week that you could meet?” But got a brush off: “I will notify you when is possible ok“   


Was day5 (yes only 5) the right time to list out the factors that go into a successful relationship? There’s 7. It was an active copy&amp;paste day for CF. 


And for the final question i tolerated: “pretty Tonight you can do anything you want, No penalties, No reprisals and the Cost is Unimportant. What are you going to do?” in which “sleep” was not the answer CF wanted since he had plans: “Since it's only for one night I would drive down to (my city), order me the BIGGEST FRESHEST LOBSTER I could find, eat every single bite, then get a room at the swankest hotel right off the beach, dress in the most GORGEOUS 40's something outfit and go dancing with my specific woman, take my telescope to the hotel roof and watch the stars until I got sleepy, sleep without any phone ringing, any cell phone ringing any TV going, get up in the morning and drive back to (CF’s city)”. More big dreams but also big holes since both of our cities are less than 50 miles apart and both are land locked.  Hmm. When I checked the profile again, low and behold the city had been changed to a coastal town in another state. 


Lesson3: don’t forget with whom you are conversing.  When I attempted to read the OLD messages, the account had been locked and under investigation. I’m heart broken I wasn’t the only one on CF’s agenda. I did also report it as a fake, and subsequently blocked on WhatsApp. 


The irony was not lost on me that the following day I got a text on my real message app: “Your AppIe-lD account has been locked for security reasons. To unlock it, You have to provide some additional information: [hyperlink provided]”. LESSON4: please NEVER click a link when you don’t truly know the source. Yes I reported it to Apple. 


It was a nice change of pace to not be asked for pics but offered some sfw pics instead, not jump to sexting nor pressured to meet, have more than a short phrase exchange, and to be greeted with more than a gm. BTW, I’m keeping some of these questions for source material when my next potential match runs stale in the conversation/texting department.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pheqxz/humorous_lessons_from_a_catfish/

57,phjd1c,1630723573,Am I missing something??,"(F49) Hi all, so I've met two guys on OLD that I've been talking to but am not sure if I'm evaluating things with either of them correctly. I feel like I am a high value woman, have a successful career, am fit, look good, am nice, overall a good communicator and willing to make the time for someone I'm interested in, etc. And I'd like the same in a potential partner. We're all busy but I think if you like a person, you make time for them, not excuses. I've verified both of these men are who they say they are and they're legit. They're both successful business men and have busy lives just as I do.  *side rant - communication is a big thing to me and I don't understand why men don't ask me a lot of questions about myself. Do they not care to know me as a person? I'm not just a vagina. Ugh! 

So anyway, I had matched with guy #1 a couple years ago, talked and texted and went on one date. It was fun and he was sweet but something felt off. He didn't ask for a second date and that was that. 2 weeks ago I saw him on OLD and swiped right as I thought, why not. It was a match as he had already swiped right on me. We started texting and caught up. He explained that he thinks I'm a great catch but at the time of our first date, he was dealing with fall out from a stalker ex who wouldn't leave him alone. Plausible explanation. I asked him to lunch but he had a meeting. I told him he's not in my friend zone so if he's interested in a date to let me know. He told me he definitely wants to take me on a date....and then nothing. He hasn't asked and I'm stumped. He's also not a big texter so communication is limited. And I feel like I'm in limbo with him, and I don't like it.

Guy #2 is awesome and I really like him. We've been texting for about two weeks also. We have a lot in common but live about 7 hours apart. I haven't been on a date with him in person yet. We talk on and off but some days it's minimal which I think is because we're both really busy. I make more of an effort to text during the day than he does. He answers some of my questions, but not others. Overall he does okay, just not as communicative as I would like. 

I guess my questions are: 
1-Do I let both of them know I'd like more communication from them, even if that means all communication ends because they can't or won't give me more? I don't want crumbs from anyone, I'm worth more than that.
2-Or is this how it works now and I'm just getting ahead of myself and need to be patient? Because as things move forward, even if it's slow, it will get better. 

Advice and thoughts would be helpful. Please be kind. Thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/phjd1c/am_i_missing_something/
58,phlhgp,1630732616,No Longer Competing With a Ghost,"So, I posted about a month 1/2 ago (Am I Competing With A Ghost?), and just wanted to give an update.

I(48F) finally ended the nearly 5 month LDR relationship with a man (38) who had been taking chunks out of my emotional and mental health for the past month. His high school sweetheart died in July of this year and he took it really hard because she'd been the ""love of (his) life"" and ""soulmate"". It just got to the point where I just couldn't do it anymore. The constant pictures, posts and videos about her and how much he loved and missed her were all over his social media platforms. He changed his profile pic to the last pic they'd taken together. I had to see all of this nearly every day for weeks and then he'd turn around and text or facetime me, wanting to cry, vent or talk about her because he had ""nobody else to talk to"". I tried to be supportive and understanding, at first, even though it was becoming increasingly difficult for me considering the newness of our relationship and my feelings for him. I felt like the 3rd wheel, like I was invading their space. Yet, I put aside my feelings and actually felt guilty for feeling the way that I did. All for a guy who, when it came to us being exclusive, was ""weary of a specific commitment because he'd been burned"". But then he later love bombs me. The triggers and the crossed boundaries were just too much and he could never see things from my side. As much as I tried to be caring, understanding and supportive, I found myself feeling more like his therapist than potential love mate and began feeling insecure and resentful. Despite the fact that he was aware it was bothering me, he continued. I take responsibility for the fact that I didn't set proper boundaries and hold him accountable as I should have early on, but it just never seemed to be the right time. Two days ago, we had a terrible argument regarding a question I'd asked him about their relationship and it annoyed him because it was a question he'd been asked numerous times since she and he had been together. It was really bad and that is when I decided I needed to take a step back and allow him to continue the journey through his grieving process without me.  His heart was, understandably, broken but don't we all deserve to be loved by healed hearts, not broken ones? He never answers his phone so I broke up with him using the voice record option on Messenger.🤦‍♀️ He deserved a phone call, I know, but he hates using the phone and never answered it when I call.  He ended up calling me, on his phone no less, some time later just as I'd gotten into bed and he was livid!! He seemed more upset about the fact that I didn't call him on the phone and that I'd cancelled my flight to visit him next week. He was literally yelling at me because he'd bought me all these gifts and rented a car (which is odd considering we had already agreed that he'd send an Uber to pick me up and drop me off at the airport then I would rent a car for 2 separate days we'd planned on visiting a couple tourist attractions) and that his wallet would take a hit (and here I am out roughly $100 due cancelling my flight). He never ONCE expressed a desire to address the reasons why I felt like I needed to take a step back and prioritize my own emotional needs over his, but I guess it didn't really matter at that point anyway. I hope he gets to the place where he can let her rest and then resolve their past and his other issues. I think I was in the way of that. I hope he will be okay. I, on the other hand, am done with dating for the foreseeable future. I don't think I'm nearly as ready for what's out there these days as I'd hoped.

Decent sized city west of the Mississippi. I've been doing OLD for years now. I have no shortage of matches... if I am willing to date under 25 or late 50s up. And I'm not saying that in an ageist way, there are great guys at every age, but I would kind of like someone at the same stage of life as me as far as being mid-career, post-schoolkids, but not approaching retirement anytime soon, and it seems like that's generally related to how long you've been on the planet. It's not that I don't match with guys in their 40s, it's that they appear very rarely at all no matter what I set my range to. Of my choices, I've gone with the young ones thus far, because I live a pretty young life. Gym rat of the small and ripped variety, roller derby player, still working aggressively and likely to do so for quite a while yet, live adjacent to a college campus/downtown and love how lively it is. I have a metabolism that still thinks it's 22, so I like being able to do things like walk to bars and band venues, order pizza at midnight, etc. I own my house outright and I have a professional job that requires a graduate degree, so I'm not saying I'm an irresponsible barfly. I'm just very high energy, I don't have responsibilities that preclude that kind of thing, and I still enjoy it. Settling down quietly in the suburbs doesn't really fit. But although my last two relationships with 20-somethings were happy and lasted a year each, with amicable endings, I don't see a 24 year old as a likely lifetime solution at 44. It could happen, but my inability to have children would be a deal breaker for most.

On paper, she is great and matching all the basic information in terms of my ideal partner. Due to the lockdown, our options of seeing each have been limited to exercise and only on the weekends. As such, I would be lucky to see her for 1.5 hour on a Saturday and that is it! During the week she rarely replies to message on messenger because she is not big on social media. However, when I asked her for a best time to call she then says texting is fine so that is that. When I do see her in person, she has a great personality and seems outgoing but I have found she seldomly talks about herself to any detail and I am only learning very superficial things  from her. I am a very outgoing person and her mode of communication is driving me crazy and is confusing the hell out of me. She rarely initiates a conversation and I feel like I am talking to myself but she will briefly answer me when I ask her some questions. She says she enjoys my company and would like to see me but her communication skill is so lacklustre I don't know what else to say because a conversation flows when both people can play off each other's information but it is not happening here.

81,pi1h01,1630795972,Dating for introverts...how?,"43m here, thinking of getting back into dating but I'm more introverted. I'm not shy, I just prefer quiet nights instead of going out where there are crowds. I'm know myself well enough to know I don't want to fake being more extroverted just to attract women...that will just end in disappointment for them. I'm hoping there are women out there like me that are into geekier things and long RV trips. But where the heck would I find them? If they are introverted like me, the odds of finding them seem so small!

Side idea: I think it would be great to have tshirts with a message like ""Single and introverted! Don't be afraid to tap me on the shoulder if you want to talk!"" Or bars that are meant for introverted singles so there's already an expectation of wanting to meet people.

82,pi2ssn,1630801105,I’m really torn about someone I had a great first date with yesterday,"This guy seems awesome. Totally my type physically, similar profession to me, super intelligent, funny, sexy, warm and sweet… Within five minutes of walking into the coffee shop I knew I wanted to see him again kind-of-thing. This doesn’t happen to me very often and I could feel that it was mutual. I was so excited about him. 
 
Then, after about an hour he drops it on me that the reason his marriage ended is because he cheated. Now, people say things like ‘once a cheater always a cheater’ and I think that’s BS. People make mistakes all the time. I’ve made tons (though not that one). He said they had separate bedrooms for years and that when he would try to pursue intimacy with his ex-wife she would tell him to get a girlfriend and leave her alone, so he did. He said he was telling me on the first date because he knows it’s a big deal and he wanted to get it out upfront. I can respect all of that. 
 
What bothers me is there seems to be no ownership of his mistake. Like, he discussed it as, she told me to go get a girlfriend so I did- as if it was just some sort of big miscommunication. When I asked him how he ended up with whoever the girlfriend was, he said ‘it just kind of happened.’ Which, I think it’s about the lamest answer possible. People have agency and make their own choices. 
 
Anyway, if all he said was that he had made a huge mistake, had an affair that ended his already dead marriage, and that he had regrets about that, I think I would really respect that. What’s bothering me here is the abdication of responsibility in his description and the language he used.
 
So, what do ya’ll think? We’re supposed to go out again soon. But I keep thinking about this and I’m torn.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pi2ssn/im_really_torn_about_someone_i_had_a_great_first/

85,pi4tpj,1630809276,"Jealous, insecure, or both? Either way it's getting OLD","Been seeing a guy ( LDR) for almost a year. Our incomes are wildly different, I make easily 10 times what he does. Several times he has told me that it's not a problem for him, but then he turns around and says things that are definitely indicating that it is a problem.

For example, a couple weeks ago I got a very large unexpected bonus. I was very happy about this especially since this has been a very hard year for me, and I was happy to share this with him. I was expecting some sort of praise or whatever I'm not sure, which I got, sort of almost begrudgingly I could tell that he was trying hard but a happy face on it. But then we went into several hours discussion on he wished he could make that kind of money and he works just as hard as I do and he should have taken the corporate path. And I'm just kind of bewildered by all this, I understand where he's coming from but at the same time it's getting kind of tiresome. It's getting to the point where I feel like I cannot share anything with him because it's going to set him off into feeling insecure and then I'm going to have to talk him down from that ledge and it's just getting old.

Right now I'm on vacation with my adult son, we have not taken vacation together for over 2 years. I'm sending him pictures and he's telling me that he's having a hard time seeing pictures because he's jealous. And then he immediately corrects himself I just want to be with you. But honestly the vibe I get is that he is jealous.

I worked very hard to get myself where I'm at career wise and finance wise. I lived hand to mouth for many years, I worked my ass off to put myself through graduate school. I deserve my success and I'm not going around flaunting it but it's nice to have all your bills paid without worrying about where the money is going to come from. Honestly I am really really tired of this guy's attitude, we have talked about it before and he's always reassured me oh I'm not jealous of your success or whatever but honestly then stuff like this happens and I'm just like is this me making too much a deal out of it or what? I'm just really tired of feeling like more and more I cannot share things with him because it's going to set him off.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pi4tpj/jealous_insecure_or_both_either_way_its_getting/

First of all, he knew what he wanted. Or what he didn’t want. 
Second, he knew he couldn’t get it all so he had to compromise. 
Third, he wasn’t interested in dating. He wanted to be in a relationship. Once he got into a relationship, he did his absolute best to make it work. 

Finally, he overlooked little things.
