31,nywfh7,1623591221,Dating patterns,"First of all, I‚Äôm 38F. I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has experienced this too. Also warning in advance, please excuse the profanity.

So I was on online dating for about 4 months until I finally got fed up with it after multiple rejections in person, so I deleted my accounts before my confidence was completely destroyed.

I‚Äôve been working out at the gym since January and it has been my thing to take my mind off the bad dates and my ex which ended last year in October (which dragged out far too long - saw him last month for the last time). I‚Äôve become extremely passionate about the gym and to be honest it makes me feel better than getting matches.

Before I deleted my account, I went on a date with a guy who in my opinion was a bit of a step down for me but we had a lot in common. We had a great date or so I thought and he was all over me. I wasn‚Äôt into him though so I didn‚Äôt really care if he didn‚Äôt text me the next day.

But he did, only to say ‚ÄúI had a good time with you, but you‚Äôre not the one for me‚Äù. I should not have been offended about it, but I was. He didn‚Äôt need to text me that, as I hadn‚Äôt texted him anything anyway. 
It wasn‚Äôt my first rejection this year. This put me off meeting guys though and I thought, fuck it, just focus on yourself and someone will come along.

There was one guy who constantly tried to get me to meet him before I deleted my accounts, and he kept trying afterwards too as he had my number. My confidence was shot though so I kept rejecting him for over a month. Eventually I told him why I was doing it, because of my past dating experiences.

Last night he texted me and I told him I just got out of the gym, he told me to wait as he wasn‚Äôt far away from there. I got a bit anxious as I was all sweaty and no makeup etc but I thought once again, fuck it just meet him, if he rejects you too, who cares you will look really hot soon anyway üòÇ.

And we met and honestly it was so passionately intense it was unreal. I could‚Äôve slept with him too but I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd never felt that with anyone in my life! Completely mind blown, he smelled good, his voice, his eyes his presence‚Ä¶ everything.

After all of this, I realised this is a pattern.

Every single time I lose interest to date, someone comes along and it is like magic, sparks.

What is this phenomenon? It‚Äôs happened twice from online dating now. I rejected my last ex because of low self confidence finally gave in to meet him and we ended up in a relationship.  Now I feel like the same thing is happening. Does this happen to you, it‚Äôs a complete mind fuck ü§Ø

TLDR; why after so many rejections, bad dates that lead you giving up trying, do you end up meeting someone awesome?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nywfh7/dating_patterns/

42,nz0k9a,1623603075,Crossing over with a fwb,"Met him (41M) on Tinder a couple of months ago. Fun consistent conversation but it took me (38F)very flat out offering my number and then very directly asking him out for things to progress. After a very intense love bombing situation earlier this year, I just wanted to go out with a nice guy that wouldn‚Äôt hurt me and I wouldn‚Äôt have feelings for. Someone who likely didn‚Äôt date a lot and maybe a bit shy but I found attractive. 

I tried to use him. At that first date, he was nice and I want sure I wanted to because he was also a spazz but took him to my house and made my moves. Was pleasantly surprised this sweet guy was very skilled in bed. He has never done any sexting and none of our conversation goes so deep as to talk about our love language or past relationships or make claims about the future and tell our parents about the other (all things the last guy did). Nope just focused on the present and enjoying each other‚Äôs company. 

Now I want more. We only see each other once a week. It‚Äôs always fun and the sex is so hot and satisfying. We text often but not every day or even all day which was overwhelming with that last guy. It has become a given that we see each other every week but he was out of town last weekend and since we didn‚Äôt see each other for two weeks, Friday was pretty hot. Super low key when he left in the morning asked if he wanted to come back later. He said yes. Earlier in the night I said something about seeing each other on other days of the week. Tried to be fun about it but I really don‚Äôt remember how it landed. 

Anyway, now it‚Äôs Sunday and I didn‚Äôt hear back yesterday. I wasn‚Äôt specific and didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúlater today‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to reach out to make a fuss about it. Have definitely pushed people away by being too needy or aggressive. 

I try and have these meaningless fwb situations and catch feelings. Not the first time. I like spending time with him. I know he likes spending time with me. We‚Äôre both adults who are used to spending time with ourselves and have a lot of weekly responsibilities too. And this was the 5th time we sleep together and a friend told me about this thing where the guys she sleeps with tend to back away after the 5th time. Something about this timing is make or break I guess for any of us??

50,nz3b97,1623610904,Can I avoid talking about work on dates AND men in my industry? How?,"I have three interrelated problems relating to work and dating:

1. **I don't want to talk much about work on dates:** Men want to ask me a lot about my job on dates. I don't mind answering basic questions, but I'm very passionate about my work, men seem fascinated by it, and I can find it draining if the conversation lasts more than a few questions. To be polite, I'm of course also asking them related questions back about their jobs and then they think I really want to talk about careers. On the one hand, I do want someone who thinks it's a turn-on that I have a career (and I want to find a partner who pays his own rent/mortgage, so presumably they also have a job). But I primarily want someone I can relax with and turn off the work part of my brain. I want to have lots of common interests outside of work.
2. **It's hard to find men in my city who don't work in the same industry as me:** There are a few large industries in my city. It seems like everyone on the apps who lists a job works in one of two industries, and I've been part of both of them personally. It's not a ""me"" problem - a lot of my female friends in my city also complain about the overrepresentation of these industries among men on apps. (The difference for my female friends is that they don't work in these industries.) I've tried going out with men who don't work in these industries, but just from a numbers perspective this doesn't happen often. I've also tried going out with men who don't list a job at all, which is a surprisingly huge number of men on apps - that has mixed results, sometimes good, but it can also be truly insane (e.g., 40yo man living with his parents who had no job but was working on two Youtube channels).
3. **I want to avoid ""don't shit where you eat"" situations:** Because I end up going on dates with a decent number of men in my industry, there's often this weird angle where if we don't end up in a serious relationship, we might want to do business together, or one of us might want the other person in our professional network. There are rare occasions where we are equally interested in maintaining a professional connection - this usually goes one direction only and I've been on both sides of it. I don't know what to do about this at all, beyond being super transparent about my feelings and intentions and never ghosting. I didn't even realize how weird this was until someone in this sub reacted to me commenting that I make men pick a lane - either romantic or professional network.

Does anyone have tips on navigating this? Is there something I'm missing that seems like a really obvious solution from an outside perspective?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nz3b97/can_i_avoid_talking_about_work_on_dates_and_men/

I'm a socially awkward and  anxious tater. My friend helped me put an OLD profile together, because  the idea of meeting new people coupled with a fear of rejection had me  stress eating and panicking while trying to write it on my own. So they  helped me get the larger bits down since they know me really well, and I  tidied it up a bit.

Now I'm asking you, professional marketing advertisers of human personalities. How can I do the profile dance less clumsily?

I  know this sounds like I'm not ready to date, and that's probably true.  And it also sounds like I should focus on me, but I've already done that  for the last year. My therapist says it's time to actually re-enter the  world of socializing after literally hiding in the wilderness.

Nails, self care and maintenance, accessorize, hair, nice clothes and matching shoes. When I get dressed for a date I dress nice. If my date does not, I find myself wishing they'd worn more than a worn t shirt.

I get it's the first date with a stranger and you don't know of you're even going to like them. And if someone is comfortable and confident dressing whatever way they want I don't mind that but on a date I feel like you're trying to put your best foot forward and impress your date. That's what I'm doing, anyway. 

Does anyone else feel this way or is it completely normal to just dress however on a first date?

76,nzavrz,1623632764,Polyamory and dealing with my first ever romantic rejection at 35,"Hi y'all.  

So, uh... Not sure how comfortable this group is in general with polyamory.  The polyamory or queer specific subreddits are probably a better place to talk about this, but the people involved will almost certainly see this post and recognize the situation if I post there, so I'm seeking alternative locations.  

The tl;dr - Hi, I'm married and in a poly relationship.  My wife dates a lot, I don't.  Up until this February, my entire love life has been me responding to other peoples' interest in me.  This February, for the first time in my life, I told someone I had a crush on them (friend from my online D&amp;D group who I've never met in person).  It was mutual!  And then we lasted two weeks....  Still trying to be friends, but now she's dating someone else and it's fucking wrecking me.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the long version.

So I'm 35 years old, married and poly.  My wife dates a fair amount.  I date very rarely.  I've always been extremely shy about dating and romance.  Up until recently, my entire relationship history has been me responding to other peoples' interest in me.  And it's only in the last few years that I've been able to do that without being a total nervous mess at the start.

I've been in this online D&amp;D group for a couple years.  Large shared campaign world.  Very active text RP.  I left for a while and came back to find a few new people around.  One of them I consider to have become a pretty good friend.  We'll call her K.  I happen to know from general chatter that K is also polyamorous, and in her late twenties.

Around April last year, K's long term girlfriend, let's call yer N, joined our D&amp;D server, and we all got along great and have become pretty good friends, I think.  Also, my character ended up dating both of their characters!  I think that N and I bonded pretty strongly over our characters' relationship, and that RP has become a pretty big part of both our participation in this community.

In OOC chatter, I learn that N is aromantic.  At least, she thinks she is.  Her slow-burn-since-high-school relationship with K being the big exception that makes her question that identity.  She talked a lot about her experiences and trying to figure out what she did and didn't want out of a relationship.  (Also, she's 26 years old, so...  That's a big age difference I have felt really weird about.  She's still learning a lot about herself from where I stand at 35).  I did a lot of thinking about what it means that she is aromantic as, over the months, I developed a pretty big crush on her.  I didn't know it, but at the same time she was developing a crush on me.

So, after almost a year of knowing each other, as I have been agonizing over whether or not to even do anything about this crush, someone new shows up in the D&amp;D server.  We'll call him T.

T met N's character and the two of them hit it off spectacularly.  They had this big three day long scene of these two characters flirting and hitting it off that had the entire server chatting and raising their eyebrows and laughing about it.  Now, I'm a shy awkward nerd, and this hit a lot of insecurities for me.  I wish I could flirt like that, but I can't flirt to save myself.  I'm honestly kind of scared to make that sort of fast connection with someone?  But at the same time I feel ashamed that I can't.  Mix this with the fact that I've been silently sitting on this crush for a couple months and I was feeling kinda shitty about the whole situation, but trying not to show it.

I feel like N must have picked up on the fact that something was off.  She DMed me to check in on if I was alright with it all.  And, I couldn't answer that question honestly without telling her I had a crush on her.  So... I told her about my crush.  And it was mutual! First time in my life I've ever entered a relationship because I was interested in someone, and not just because someone was interested in me.

We chatted a lot about things (but never actually talked about my initial insecurities re: her and T).  Talked a little about what we wanted from a relationship and about her still figuring out romantic attraction and if she was feeling it or not.  In retrospect, we didn't really talk in detail enough about it.  And we had one video chat date the next week.  And, polyamory feelings!  Dating someone who has a long-term partner that you are friends with feels super nice?  Feels like joining this nice little family.

So, two weeks and one date in, after my wife made a joking comment about N being my girlfriend, that trigged a minor anxiety attack for N.  This is apparently a pattern she's run into before, where she panics at the idea of things getting serious or things moving too fast and wants to back out of things.  But, the clencher I think, is that she mentioned not really feeling any chemistry on our date.  Another big insecurity hit for me.  Awkward mess that I am.  I suck at one on one conversations and am always super awkward on dates.  (of course, anyone friend dating me IRL would already know how awkward I am, so it had a particular sting with the person I get along well with in text spending time like that with me for the first time.)

And, you know, I understand.  I was kind of prepared for this when we started, pondering the aromantic thing.  We took a step back and re-thought things a bit.  We eventually settled on this sort of grey-area flirty friendship, not trying to date, taking things super slow.  Keeping up with our characters' relationship.  I wanted to have a more detailed discussion about boundaries, but we never got around to it and there was a moment where I think I dumped too much about life problems on her and backed off because I felt super weird about things.  

I had lots of ideas about how breakups could go and about staying friends after (I am still friends with all my exes).  But in every past relationship I've always been the less interested partner, and I quickly found out that things didn't work the way I wanted them to.  It feels weird.  I'm, like.. slightly mad at my own mind for working this way.  I want it to be simple.  I want to just be friends again and have it not be complicated.

Meanwhile, N and T are still being super flirty and things are progressing.  At some point N tells me she's got a crush on him.  I've been debating on if I want to say anything about where I'm at re: that.  It feels like... my jealousy issues are my issues and I shouldn't bug her with them, but it also feels weird not to talk to her about them?  I took some time away and was trying to figure out whether to talk about it and what to say, and while we're circling talking about other things, she tells me that she and T have started dating.  We had the ol' sorry for how things went, still friends conversation.  I mentioned having more stuff I wanted to talk about, but needing some time to process.  And I really do still want to be friends!  

And now they've been dating for a month and a half.  

It hurts that we flopped so quickly, and our entire attempt at dating happened in the shadow of this other budding relationship that's going strong.   It's complicated because I like and want to be friends with everyone.  T is great.  I obviously like N a lot.  And the stuff we have between all our characters in RP is really important to me and I really don't want to give that up!  But watching them flirt and hearing them talk about dates and making plans just hurts.  

I feel dumb going through this the first time at the age of 35?  Like, these are feelings most people experience and learn to deal with in middle school or high school, and here I am, a grown-ass *Married* adult dealing with this sort of heartbreak and jealousy for the first time.

The thing that's killing me, though, is that ""joining a nice little family"" feeling I mentioned.  Seeing T and K joke around and develop this nice little metamour friendship is just... the twisting knife in my heart.  Like, I don't mean that as an afterthought.  N and T's being together I feel like I can deal with, but seeing T become a part of that little family group I thought I was going to be a part of is really hitting some deep down painful stuff for me.  It's all those ""I wasn't cool enough.  Do I even have friends?  I've been replaced"" sorta feelings.

And I don't know what to do, or if I should say anything?  It feels like I shouldn't bother them with my issues there.  There's no hard feelings.  No one is upset with anyone and everyone wants to still be friends.  Of course, my ""want to be friends"" feelings are still all twisted up in my ""I still have feelings for N"" feelings, and I think that'll take a while to process.

79,nzbjzh,1623634886,Advice on how to decide between multiple people?,"I revived my dating app profile a couple weeks ago and after a few matches and text convos that didn‚Äôt go anywhere, I am in the fortunate position to have second dates with 3 women this week. The dates have been 3-6 hours long so more than just a 30min coffee chat. 

I think all three women are really interesting. While they are quite different from each other, I can see myself building a long term relationship with each of them. This has never happened to me before.

For those who might have experienced similar situations, what have you done to get to a decision quicker?

In case it‚Äôs helpful, some more details on each of the women.

Woman A: I feel really comfortable talking with her. I had the longest dates with her. We kept talking and talking. Of the 3 she‚Äôs probably the least attractive. But still better looking than the average I‚Äôve matched with. 

Woman B: she has the most in common with me in terms of history like schools we went to and cities we‚Äôve lived in and even family structure so we could relate to each other‚Äôs experiences. She‚Äôs probably the most physically attractive but is also the least active of the 3. Being active and pushing me to be more active is a core value I‚Äôm looking for. 

Woman C: she‚Äôs the most active and extroverted of the 3. She looks really busy socially (from her IG). She‚Äôs got a crazy work schedule too. Our first date was interrupted by her work. While that meant the date wasn‚Äôt the best, we got to talking about deeper things like past relationships surprisingly quickly. I‚Äôm slightly more attracted to the idea of having a relationship with her (lifestyle, values, physical attraction) than the other two but I know the least about her as I‚Äôve spent the least amount of time with her.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nzbjzh/advice_on_how_to_decide_between_multiple_people/

95,nzj1mu,1623663617,It is a mess,"Hi you all, 

First of all i want to apologize for any orthographic mistakes. This is not my first language. 

I know i have been troubeling you guys multiple times now but i really got myself into a mess with a guy and need honest advise and opinions. I met this guy last year through tinder... came on really strong at the beginning and after a few times sex he got what he wanted and left. However he remained in contact even though it was superficial. Then he came back.... i was even harder to get but yeah at the end it worked and he played the same game... same in december... same in february. after february we did not see each other for 3 months... until last month we went on a date again. Only as friends... nu kissing nothing more.... went well for a few dates until he heared about an other men ( i am friends with this guy for over 15 years but indeed we have a tention). One evening he reacted jalous. .... and so on... now fast forward to last saturday. We went out for dinner... he payed everything... afterwards we went for a few drinks... and after that we moved on the where his best friend was sitting... ok there we started to drink shots ( normally would not do that... but yeah it happened... ). So i stayed over.... consequence... i almost threw myself at him.... really strange for me to do so.. but yeah a week before i told him that i was in love with him. He listened and took it calm and serious. Result of the story... he slept on his sofa and i slept in the bed. Morning after we cuddeled a bit but still nothing happened. We are both adults so had a conversation over it. His anwer being that he needed all his strenght to refuse the day before... but that he respects me to much. Gave me a kiss on the mouth and forehead when i left. Called to see if i got home well... Yesterday evening he gave me a goodnight message... this morning he told me he he had trouble falling asleep yesterday. I am going to take my distance ... still have my sanity... but it is hard since it is the first time in 6 years that i felt this way for a guy. And i know that maybe you will say that he is not a nice guy... although he really is... he is really sensitive and considerate. His profile ... he had a lot of women.. now almost 40 , loves going out and loves life in general. has no kids... has a good job and is responsible.

97,nzkkhf,1623669750,Long distance fwb ?,"Hello. I got myself into a situationship a bit. I would like some advice or if you can share your similar experiences..
34f, single since 3 years, dated quite alot during this time but only had 2 fwb and 1 potential sirous relationship that didn't work out. I am now really happy single and focusing on my career. I recently decided to move 2000 km away from where I was living for the last 10 years for work and being closer to family. And of course, I met someone 2 months before leaving... Right from the start I made it clear, this is casual and it will end once I leave. He agreed. I suspect that the timelimit and lack of pressure to become sirious actually made us really relaxed and we both somehow cought some feels. I am naturaly very protective and reserved with feelings and did not say anything until the last moment, when I simply told him I am sad I don't have more time with him because I rarely conect with guys like this. He agreed and we said our goodbyes, very adult like.. And I thought that was it.. However.. He keeps writing me everyday since I have left, even wants to visit. And I keep replying and I secretly really wish he would visit üò¨ I do not initiate because I know this is a recipe for a disaster. I don't want a long distance relationship but I also don't want to loose him. None of us can relocate, at least not for a few years. I don't want to start a ""what are we"" talk with him yet, I am also not obsessing or crying over it, I don't know him really well so I am really holding back emotionally right now. I am just wondering if I should listen to my pragmatic reasonable mind that tells me this is the worst thing I need right now, or go with my gut (heart?) that tells me there's something here.. ? Am I just being scared I will never find anyone else, since I needed 3 years to find this connection? Do I just find him attractive because he is unavailable and will therefore ""not hurt me"" which is also something I tend to do? I am so confused.. Any insides would be great..
