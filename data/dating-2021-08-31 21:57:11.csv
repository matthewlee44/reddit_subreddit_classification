I genuinely can’t tell if he was into it-i mentioned having a good time and seeing each other again and he agreed but I feel like that doesn’t mean much.

I thought our relationship was perfect, I don’t know what went wrong.","I exclusively dated this guy for five months. Mind you, HE was the one who pushed hard for us to end our fwb relationship and to start seriously dating. I have screenshots of confessing his feelings for me and me expressing concerns about going long term, so I know I’m not going fucking insane. I thought our relationship was going so well. I  fell in love with him and I thought he did too. He constantly talked about the future of our relationship. 

He suggested last month that we fly out and visit his family for labor day weekend (he’s from out of state). I was pretty hesitant at first, but he really wanted to make our relationship “official” I guess. He even bought my ticket and went as far as getting us our own airbnb so I wouldn’t have to worry about being uncomfortable around his family. But a few days ago, one week before our flight, he confessed that he thought we were “moving too fast” and asked to be casual again.  But he still reaaaally wanted me to visit his family because he likes me soooo much. He admitted that he felt “pressured” to be in a serious relationship when he didn’t want one. Which makes no goddamn sense because HE was the one who asked to be serious and I was the one who was initially against the idea. I was too shocked and hurt to say much. Just told him to go fuck himself and immediately blocked him on everything.

5,pflxny,1630468305,Just because I'm not career-oriented does not mean I'm not ambitious.,"I am so sick of people acting as if ambition can only come from one's careers. Like if you don't want to ""climb the corporate ladder"" and ""live for work"", you are automatically deemed ""not ambitious"". How does this relate to dating? Well, several people on this subreddit have said that they couldn't date someone who wasn't ""ambitious"". And surprise, surprise, 9 times out of 10, they meant ambitious about their careers.

Do people not realize that people can be ambitious about things that are not career related? Like I could care less about my job. I believe in working to live. I have no interested climbing the corporate ladder. A job is just a way to make a living for me, and for a lot of people. I'm ambitious about my true passions in life. If they eventually become a source of income, great! But my passions nonetheless are what give me joy in life. My job doesn't. But it does provide me money so I can pursue my real passions.

Now I know that people who are looking to get married and start a family will be concerned with the occupation/salary of their selected partner. And for those people, this does NOT apply to you. Obviously, if you're gonna have kids, you need to earn enough to provide for them. That being said, even in this case, you'd be moving up the ladder so you can take care of your family. You aren't necessarily doing it because you're ""ambitious"". Maybe you are though, who knows?

I myself however, have no plans of getting married anytime soon, if ever. And I never want kids. Like I'm 99.9% sure at this point I don't want kids. The idea of being a dad seems lame and stressful to me. So there's no reason for me to put myself through the unneeded stress of climbing up the corporate ladder, working 60-80 hour work weeks, putting in overtime, just to try to get some ""prestigious"" job title, which comes with very little (or no) pay increase, tons more responsibilities, and longer hours. Screw that. I just want to make enough to make a living and fund my real passions. 

And anyone who says I have ""no ambition"" just because I'm not a corporate slave is not worth my time. Because people with this mentality are so deluded in that they think ambition and passion can only come from one's career.

13,pfmgfy,1630470281,To kid or not to kid...,"I apologize immensely for the length of this, but it is a very heavy topic and requires as much context as is possible.

Over the years of my life and the two relationships I've had, one thing has always been a topic of much confusion and indecision: kids.

I don't have any problem with children. I know they are the future and would give my life to protect any child if the circumstance arose. I enjoy them and their innocence and I very much enjoy passing down knowledge and instilling as many desirable traits as I possibly can.

I helped raise 6 of my nieces and nephews, all from the age of newborn up until 14. I have a lot of knowledge in raising children, though I'm no expert. 

However, I myself do not necessarily desire to have children. Kind of.

Some people are YES or NO about it. I'm somewhere in-between. Right now I just don't have what I consider to be the right living situation and financial standing to, IMO, properly raise a child how I feel is optimal and conducive to a healthy environment. Both for myself and the child.

I also am someone who is willing to compromise and were I currently in a relationship where my partner wanted children I would not immediately turn down the thought. There would be MUCH thought and discussion but I would ultimately do my best to make my partner happy in any way I can while also communicating how I feel about it and what I believe would be the best course of action, based on all circumstances surrounding us and our situation. 

If turning it down, FOR THE TIME BEING, was what would be best then I would, but if we had a good situation going and kids were not too crazy or terrible an act, I would be happy to oblige.

Now comes the weird one: dating a woman with 1 or more kids.

This is tough for me.

I am not downright opposed to the idea of being with a woman who has kids, but I am also not only looking for a woman with children. I don't see anything wrong with it and would embrace the responsibility wholeheartedly but I also don't know if it would be a good idea for me, her, the children, or a combination thereof.

I'm not particularly fond of the idea of essentially being ""forced""(for lack of a better word) to help raise a child that I had no involvement bringing in to the world while I also like the idea of being a father/figure to a child who may not have one. Or at least being the great side of the coin.

If I really like a woman and want to be with her then I have even more reason to take that child under my wing and be the best possible thing in their life that I can. I would enjoy that! But if the woman is not all that desired in my eyes then a child is going help to push me away quicker and move on.

Now comes the TOUGH part: dating a woman, becoming VERY attached to the child but having no desire to stay with their mother.

This is a really rough one for me. I don't want to become attached to a child and essentially hate their mother. While I won't have much issue with losin the woman, I'll lose the child who I love dearly, if I decided to end the relationship. It would destroy me, especially knowing that child did NOTHING wrong. At least when the woman does something  that causes me to want to leave, I have a sort of ""justification "".

Let me know, and please keep your ignorant/arrogant comments to yourself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfmgfy/to_kid_or_not_to_kid/
14,pfmktg,1630470762,"First ""first date"" in a long while - and I'm now harboring a possible deal-breaker","I am about to go on my first real date as a sober person. I got clean five years ago. Early on in recovery, I met a much younger guy in ""the program,"" and we embarked on a relationship that would last a year. (He relapsed, and I ended it.)

Fast-forward to today, and a friend has set me up with one of his friends, who I'll call Alex. Alex and I have been talking and plan to meet in person this weekend. He's older than I am, and an actual, accomplished grown-up. Everyone I've ever been with was either an addict, didn't know \*I\* was an addict, or both. The guy from AA, he knew what I was before we even spoke to each other. (Granted, at the time, I had no business dating anyone, nor did he.)

So I'm possibly about to start something new, as the healthy, fully formed woman I am today. He has suggested we meet for a drink, because of course - that's what one does on a date. And I am absolutely fine sitting at a bar with an ice water. But still, I'm nervous. Not so much about my past - I have worked hard to process all that and to maintain my sobriety, and really, I'm \*proud\* of that part. No, I'm afraid that drinking socially is something he understandably enjoys, to the point he'll be uninterested in partnering up with someone who can never join in.

Of course, I'm thinking of this from the perspective of someone for whom substance use was a must, for many years. I understand that for most people, it's just not that serious. My question for all the normal single people out there - the people who can have a couple of drinks, no problem: Would you be immediately turned off by a recovering person, and the restraints that come with that? Am I being silly even worrying about this? I honestly can't tell.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfmktg/first_first_date_in_a_long_while_and_im_now/

Not too long ago she told me how she slept with a Army guy after knowing him for three weeks and kissed when they just hung out. (Not dating)

Turns out he was looking for a FWB and had slept with 30+ women, she found this after the fact and told me she regretted it. Then he blocked her and she's panicking because she's scared she may have contracted HPV. I've been there for her to talk to and try and comfort her.

She told me that she was just lonely after a break up with a 2y ear long distance relationship and he told her he loved her ect.

He's like 6'+ tall and better looking than me, I'm 5'11 with *ok* looks. I've never had sex, kissed or been in a relationship before. I can't help but feel envious and insecure, there's a flurry of things that have gone through my mind.

Among them have been if she was attracted to me how come we haven't even held hands yet but would sleep with this guy after knowing him for three weeks.

Is my pp big enough 5'8, not a joke. Actually insecure about this.

Never having sex or kissing before but hearing this makes me feel less. *I know not to expect things* but I can't help but feel less and not being good enough if she did it with another guy.

Only until three days ago did she say she liked me too after I had told her that quite a few times, I don't know how to feel, she told me not to be jealous because she called him a ""fuckboy"" and that I was her type, nerdy, virgin, pure, Tom Holland, ect.

From the beginning once we met (Bumble) I let her know my intentions, which was a relationship. She's now saying she wants to work on her self even though she wanted to hangout this weekend.

The magic figure turns out to be 37 percent. To have the highest chance of picking the very best suitor, you should date and reject the first 37 percent of your total group of lifetime suitors. (If you're into math, it’s actually 1/e, which comes out to 0.368, or 36.8 percent.) Then you follow a simple rule: You pick the next person who is better than anyone you’ve ever dated before.

22,pfn69k,1630473273,Sex on a first date: yay or nay? Does putting out too soon reduce your attractiveness?," 

So I recently got out of a 4 month relationship with a man I met on Bumble. I felt like we were both really into each other and I honestly thought we had long term potential. Long story short, he has 2 young children and he is terribly busy and we don't get a lot of time together. He also seems traumatized by his ex wife's drinking problem and does not like it when I drink around him and that ultimately led him to break up with me. I had some wine and fell asleep during a movie and it triggered him and we got into a fight over it and he basically just left and said he wasn't doing this again, even when he admit that I had not done anything while I was drinking that was ""wrong"" but he just didn't want to repeat the past. I felt like this wasn't fair as he judged me based off his ex-wife's actions when I hadn't done anything wrong, but it is what it is and I feel like how easily he broke up with me made it easier for me to move on. Maybe too soon.

Not even a week later, I decided to get back on Bumble... mostly just to feel like I was still desirable and I know that's selfish but I had to distract myself from sitting at home wallowing in self pity. I got a bunch of matches but ultimately I wasn't really that interested in anyone since I was still hung up over my ex. I did end up finding a man that I had a decent conversation with and lives near my area and he asked me to meet for drinks to which I obliged because why not? We met up at a bar near my house and had a pretty good time, shared a lot of our past and we were both very open. We both got somewhat drunk and I invited him back to my place to hang out for a bit and so he could sober up before going home. We ended up having sex and I imagine I probably should have waited a bit, but what can I say? I was drunk and horny and he was attractive and I wanted to. He ended up crashing at my place and leaving for work from here the next morning.

We texted each other a bit while he was at work and he ended up coming back to my place during his lunch break where we hooked up again and had lunch. I am a bit concerned because the previous night, and probably from being drunk, he was telling me stuff like he wanted me to be his girlfriend and he wanted to take care of me and help me and be there for me, which I thought was very sweet. I didn't really take it to heart though because we were both drunk. After he left from our lunch date, we didn't text much the rest of the day but I knew he was busy with work. I'm wondering if it is a detriment to put out too early, as I am not really sure if it was a turn off to him that I had sex with him our first date, but it's not like he resisted or anything. I had also noticed the night of our date, his phone lit up and I saw he had new Bumble matches and not that I was really offended by it since it was our first time meeting, but I am wondering if he's still looking or might move on after ""having"" me. It's my own fault for letting that happen, but personally sex is quite important to me and I figure might as well see if there's that chemistry, although probably not the best while both intoxicated.

I guess my question is.... do men think less of women who put out first date and do you lose interest if you get sex too soon? And going back into the dating scene and meeting men I know nothing about, is it wise to keep my distance until we know each other better? I have a tendency to fall fast and hard if all the cards align but honestly I don't want to put myself in a situation where I get used and hurt again, although it seems inevitable if you are dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfn69k/sex_on_a_first_date_yay_or_nay_does_putting_out/

Anyway. I have been more or less single for almost 2 years now. I met someone on IG inadvertently. he's somewhat local and started messaging me. 

We've talked for a month and he asked if I want to go eat. I said yes and I think we'll go this weekend. 

I've read on other posts people talk about meeting someone and not ""feeling it"" or whatever.   
I'd like to know more about that. I'm trying to prepare myself for that but I'm not sure what to expect. We seem to get on well talking. I've never gone on a date with someone I haven't met in person in some way before they asked me to go. so of course in those cases I had a good assessment that there was something there before they asked. With the internet its different. 

As to this person, as time passes we talk more and I think a month is a good time frame to decide to go out with someone I've talked with online. I feel I can assess him sufficiently through his long history of social media posts, he seems alright. He's fairly attractive, seems well off in many ways (mentally, as a parent, etc). 

But I'd like to know how often its happened to you that you met someone and didnt feel it.   
How did you meet them in the first place (dating site, etc)?   
Did it take you by surprise when you met them in person and didnt feel it?   
How long did you talk to them before meeting them and ""not feeling it""?   
What did you do when you met up if you weren't in to them? 

Of course I'm not trying to set myself up for failure. But I am trying to assess this entire process and think about things people have told me that have happened to them. It's hard to fully discern how attracted to him I am with just online. So I'm not sure how to prepare for what might happen lol.

27,pfnlxq,1630475261,She [30f] wanted to opt out of this world,"I met a girl at the beginning of the summer and we started dating. We lived about 2h away from each other's and she wanted to have a kid one day but not me so it was kind of a deal breaker for us since we're both in our early 30.

One day, she announced me that she was depressed and anxious because of her life and her job. She had a lot of friends, a great job as a pharmacist, well paid, lots of benefits and etc. So she stopped working and started focusing on her mental recovery about 3 weeks ago. She told me to ""not wait for her"", cancelled our weekend plan and that she has been depressed for a while now. 

So the next week I invited her to go to a spa and get a massage, go to a restaurant etc. After that I asked if she wanted to come to my home spend some time together even if I had to work during the day so we could still spend some times together. Unfortunately she refused and wanted to spend time alone. I was okay with that and I gave her some space and the fact that I'd be there if there's anything, sent her some kind messages to wish her a good day, sweet dreams and similar stuff.

Today her dad texted me to let me know that she committed suicide this morning. Apparently, he asked her to call me the night before but she didn't. I still can't believe it, I don't know what to do, I am totally lost, I feel a bunch of emotions, sadness, anger, anxiety, regrets, etc.

I don't have a lot of friends, I have a very hard time meeting new people, no one to turn into so that's why I'm posting on here for suggestions and emotional support. She was a fantastic person, very kind, very supportive, always giving great compliments, great advices etc. I feel like I wasn't there for her when she needed it the most.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfnlxq/she_30f_wanted_to_opt_out_of_this_world/

I was thinking about deleting the app bc it was exhausting and I was gonna tell him to text me. Before I could do that he asked for my Snapchat. I gave it to him and we’ve been snapping for 2 weeks now. Usually when guys ask for your snap, I feel like it’s gonna lead to sexual things. He hasn’t asked for anything or even tried. We just snap what we’re doing. His snaps usually are what food he’s dating, who he’s hanging out with (usually friends or family), or where he’s going. He’ll ask what I’m doing and sometimes he’ll tell me I’m cute and stuff but that’s about. It’s always very casual talk but not conversation. He doesn’t ask me about my life. He just say whatever like for an example he told me his back hurts and he’s going to the chiropractor today. One day we’ll be snapping the whole day and other times he leaves me on delivered for hours. I thought the obvious that he’s not interested in me but then he snapped me asking if I had an iPhone and sent me his number. I texted him and he didn’t respond till the next day in the afternoon. I think he’s interested but then he does things like that when he won’t talk to me all day. Maybe he’s waiting for me but I doubt it. And he hasn’t asked me to hang out or meet up. I’m confused about what he wants because we’ve been snapping for 2 weeks and he’s made no moves or effort. I also don’t want to give him all my attention because he’s most likely talking to other girls considering here we met.

sometimes he will just disappear for 2-3 days, and he turned off my hookup date for couple times…

And she's right. She is my type. She came over tonight and I introduced myself. We all had beers and talked for awhile and then she eventually left. It was pretty casual. Nothing too crazy happened. 

They walked outside together for a second to look at her car. And later that night I asked my roommate what her friend thought of me. She said she wasn't exactly sure and the topic didn't come up that minute or two they were out there. But she thinks I presented myself well. 

Maybe I'm being negative. Maybe I'm overthinking this whole scenario. But I feel like if she was into me, she would have said something? I mean I know we just met, but aren't girls pretty sure they like a guy when they meet him? I figured she'd me like ""he's cute! I wanna see him again!""

A couple of weekends ago I just didn’t feel he was very attentive to me when we were in a group setting and I thought he might have noticed I was annoyed because coincidentally he didn’t text me for a week after that weekend. I was pretty upset and frustrated about it but he eventually reached out which actually irritated me because of all the up and down emotions I was experiencing thinking he was trying to avoid me (granted I didn’t reach out to him either but I assumed he knew I was annoyed) but  I played it cool and we eventually set up a day to me up which is when I brought up what I was annoyed about.

It was difficult for me to talk about this because I thought it was so early in our dating to have things that bothered me (I didn’t like that he kept walking ahead of me, never bought me a drink at the bar crawl he was hosting despite me treating him to dinner and spa earlier that week, and also left without me and my friends to the next bar because he didn’t want to miss the bus that comes every 20 mins).

I brought these things up to him and he definitely made me feel heard and validated  and apparently didn’t even know I was annoyed. He apologized for not texting me for a week because he was getting ready for a trip that following weekend.

He also said that can be pretty oblivious so to feel free to “yell” at him in the moment (obviously he was joking about the yell part). He then said he can be a bad texter too. But he also said he appreciated learning my love language which was nice.

I’m also on edge because I got out of a 3 year relationship in March where I was embarrassingly under appreciated and disregarded and felt I was verbal about everything and totally disregarded. My ex wasn’t very generous either and was consistently trying split everything even though he made a lot more money than me.

Anyway after we spoke about everything I decided to reach out toward the end of the week and we chatted before his camping trip and he texted me when he got back but the thing that bothered me was that I asked him a question and it took him almost 48 hours to respond to my question about his camping trip and during that time I was checking my phone not understanding why he hadn’t responded and when he responded today I was annoyed again - there was no “sorry for the late response” but he answered the question and wanted to know what my plans were for this coming Sunday when he comes back from his Labor Day trip.

40,pfoifd,1630479515,Did I do something wrong in this scenario?,"Sorry for the long read. I have only had 2 dating experiences before this as I went to an all-boys private school before going to college so I'm more just typing this all out to get some outsider perspective on what I did wrong so I can learn from it and do better in the future. 

My roommate is quite the socialite at my school and threw a party at our place Friday night. He told me beforehand he invited this girl with the intention of setting the two of us up. She's the same major as me, introverted like I am, and has the same interests but while I'd rank myself as a 5, she could try her hand at modeling if her major doesn't work out, to put it mildly. I am honestly kind of intimidated by how far out of my league she is but I did my best not to show it. 

Two of us end up alone in the corner of the house talking for what felt like two hours. Maybe it was because we were both decently drunk but the conversation flowed pretty well. Which is surprising because being a great conversationalist isn't my strong suit. 

Before we end up parting ways I get her contact info and invite her along to come with me, my roommate and one of his friends to this rural swimming spot. 

The following day I drive us all out to this spot where we do some swimming and sunbathing. She and I manage to get quite a bit of alone time together but the conversation wasn't as easy flowing and honestly kind of stagnated a lot despite my efforts and intentions. Later that night I sent a text saying I'm glad she came and enjoyed spending time with her.

Following day she posts a picture of herself to her story at the fancy pool she has at her apt complex. I made a comment about how boujee it was thinking nothing of it really when she responds she's there with her roommates and my roommate and I are welcome to come. Shortly after this, she responds that her roommates had to leave but she'll still be there and to just come by anytime. Since my roommate was the one who tried to set us up, he and I come up with a generic excuse for why he can't make it but that I could still come if she didn't mind. Sent the text saying this and proceeded to wait for her response to gauge her reaction. 45 minutes pass and she never opened it so I decided fuck it and just go over since she said to just go ahead and come over. 

Drive to the apt and walk to the pool but find it's locked and you need the residences code to get in. I call her but she doesn't answer. I text her saying I can't get in but she doesn't open it. After about 5 minutes of waiting outside the gate I head back to my car and sit in it wondering what the fuck that was all about for a few minutes when she comes walking by and see's me sitting in my car. She proceeds to give me a, ""what the fuck are you doing"" look when I explain I couldn't get in and tried calling her. She just says, ""oh"" and leads me back to the pool (which was the direction she just came from as it seemed like she was heading back the direction to her apt). We spend a few hours lounging around the pool but just like the day before I really struggled to keep a conversation flowing the entire time.

I decide to let a day pass after this before just asking her out to try and make it clear how she feels because I'm a bit confused. Two days later I text her asking her if she'd want to join me for a hike Thurs or Fri. She says she might be out of town during that time but she'd get back to me and let me know. Obviously, this isn't a yes but it's also not a no so I just say ok. After a couple of texts, I mention that me and some of the people she met on Friday would be going to our school's first football game of the season during the weekend and if she's in town she'd be welcome to join us. She just says that she's never been to one of the games at our school before. After this, I tried to get some conversation rolling off of this but only managed to get incredibly simple replies like, ""ya"", ""that's fair"" before I realized what was up and gave up.

Obviously now I get that she isn't interested and didn't want to say no to me asking her out. What did I do wrong in this scenario though?

It’s not one of those “deliberately ugly” pics (in fact I think it’s kind of elegant), it just shows the curve of my nose very clearly. My main reasoning for doing this is that my nose is a very prominent feature on my face and that if someone doesn’t like it in the photo, they wouldn’t like me in person anyway. On the other hand, I feel like girls generally don’t post pictures from the side profile angle; I’m also wondering if I am just overthinking because it’s my biggest insecurity.

46,pfp3d6,1630482305,Ghosting - Advice needed!,"Hey folks, this is my first post on Reddit. For years I've read many insightful posts on this community and now have decided to open up to seek help from here.

I'm a 30F cis-het woman based in Asia. In late July I matched with a 39M Asian man, divorced with a child. We spent about a week talking over the phone and texting and we both agreed that it was refreshing - considering it's really hard to find people to connect with. He was very attentive, constantly checking in on me.



On the night of our first date at a local bar - he showed up 45 mins late but was profusely apologetic about it. I was close to leaving the place because I was sure I was being stood up, but decided to let it slide because where I live, the traffic's quite bad. We had a great conversation and he dropped me back home. While we were in his car, he told me that he likes me and thought that I was someone who could match his intensity, he couldn't believe that I was single and wasn't already dating someone around my age. We both agreed that we were looking for something meaningful, that we weren't fooling around and that we'd make time to get to know one another more. Anyway, we kissed and he left. As soon as he got home, he sent a text saying he was sorry he kept me waiting and that he couldn't get enough of me.

The next day - which happened to be a weekend, I noticed that there was a complete change in his tone of messages to me. It was very casual, very delayed - spaced 2-4 hours apart. Very unlike what I saw before our date and over the course of the last 10 days of communicating with him. I asked him if everything was okay and he said he was just caught up with work. I kept myself busy over the weekend, had stuff to do anyway. On Monday, I still had not heard from him. Texts were delayed, even more, he took longer than a few hours to reply. Later in the night, I asked him again if everything was okay because it bothered me that we hadn't spoken and if anything had changed from his end I'd rather know than be kept waiting. He responded (again very delayed, very unlike what I saw before) saying he'd been really caught up over the weekend with his kid and that he'd been trying to catch some respite - to which I replied saying I understood and that he should just keep me posted next time. Tuesday came and went, I still didn't hear anything from him. Not even a phone call. Then on Wednesday, I left a text saying I knew he was ghosting me and that I found it really disrespectful that he would resort to this - especially after making himself come across as someone who cares. Naturally, there was no response to that text either.

My friends told me I did the right thing because this was clearly an act of ghosting.

It's been a month since it happened and normally I'd move on, but in this case, I'm really unable to. I'm torn between contacting him again and also holding on to my self-respect because why would anyone try to establish contact with someone who clearly is not interested in you, right? The thing is, I can't stop thinking about him and I'd appreciate any advice on how to proceed. Tell me I need to move on if I'm right, or tell me if I should get in touch with him - maybe he had a genuine reason for not reaching out? Perhaps he was a little afraid that things got intense?

49,pfpg8p,1630484063,Sudden loss of interest,"Hope you’re all good! Been dating this girl for around 6/7 months, and although we were taking it slow emotionally, recently we started to talk more and seen eachother more. Last week we spoke all week on the phone and things seemed amazing and like they were really taking off. She’s expressed how much she likes me both through words and being affectionate etc. But this is where it gets weird.

On our last date we went for a nice meal. I paid and she was super grateful, we left the restaurant holding hands laughing having had a great time. We sat outside for a while and during this time she seemed to take an odd turn. She suddenly got super quiet and said she felt anxious. I quickly realised she wasn’t okay and it seemed like an anxiety attack so did my best to distract her and get her somewhere more relaxing (we were sat on a super busy high street). She kept apologising and said just felt really bad she just needed to go home, so I said I’d drop her back and got us both an Uber. When we got back to her place she came out of the toilet and was white as a ghost, she was pacing and seemed in a bad way. I said I could leave and she said she felt so bad and didn’t want me to but needed to just be alone. We kissed goodbye and she said “see you next week”. I left feeling pretty awful, guilty that maybe I caused the anxiety or didn’t do my best to help her. 

The next day I asked how she was feeling and she took a while to respond but said she was sorry and felt really embarrassed.

She’s told me about her dating past before and has said that she often can’t get past a certain point with people. Slowly starting to realise she’s one of these emotionally unavailable people.

53,pfq3bz,1630487406,Setting Boundaries in a F w/ B Situation,"Okay, so I met this girl on an app (MeetMe)...we've hung out a few times, hooked up once. When we hooked up we had a conversation afterward where she just wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna ghost her, and I wanted to make sure she wasn't gonna try to make me her boyfriend since I told her from jump street that I wasn't looking for that. 

Fast forward the last couple months we've known each other. She's been dealing with a pretty serious situation involving some family matters (for the sake of respect and privacy that's as far as I'm willing to say). Because of what I know and how much I've been made aware of the situation, and have personally invested time into helping her out, I felt a genuine transition from us being chill friends who fucc sometimes, to being a real emotional support for her, and because of that I don't feel comfortable with having any kind of intimacy with her because I don't want to take advantage of her being vulnerable. 

I tried to talk to her about it tonight cuz she hit me up bein' kinda drunk (I don't drink, so this made me even more uncomfortable), and I decided to address it as kindly as I could. As soon as I told her ""yo, on some real friend shit, I'm not really comfortable bein' fucc buddies"" she hung up. 

My question is: was I an asshole for addressing the situation directly? I was just tryna keep it real and set a boundary because I can't be both an emotional support and a fucc buddy...it's too much to expect of someone who isn't a significant other in my opinion.

54,pfq62s,1630487756,Was she being nice or interested?,"I first started talking to this girl through 
Instagram. 

Instagram:
We had recently both gone into college and I posted a story asking what dorms they had gotten into. She swiped up and replied with her dorm. We talked about each other’s dorms and then started talking about the dining halls and how they close at 2 am. My dorm is connected to the dinning hall while hers were not, so I jokingly said “aye I’ll let you in for some midnight sacks” and she replied “you are the dorms are right next to each other” and I said “say no more I got you any time” and she said “I would help I could get in by myself but if not you best believe I’ll be waking u up at 2 am”. We continued to talk and she showed me the different pictures she had taken at the school because of how picturesque it was. And I said “no wonder you described it as picturesque you had a whole photo shoot there. Have you ever done modeling ?” And she replied with “HA NO” and she went on to explain how modeling was so difficult and then she asked me if I’d ever taken a “family pic before ???” And I said “yes why?” And she said it was painful , but I went on to tell her how I found that hard to believe cuz she was so photogenic and she told me “don’t be fooled I take millions” and she went on to describe how that’s why she couldn’t be a model cuz she had no patience so there was no point if she would be done with the whole process after 2 pictures and I replied with “maybe you can start a trend of terrible models 😂” and she replied with “great idea!!😂” and then I replied with “for sure it’s always good to start trends 😂” and she only liked the message and never responded. 

Time passed and she posted a pic of her in a Santa clause hat with the caption “merry Christmas ya filthy animal”. I commented “I live for home alone references this time of year” she liked the comment, but didn’t respond to it. Later on she posted a Instagram story where she asked people to ask her anything. I did. Her favorite team were the Green Bay packers, so I said “Rogers &gt; Brady” and she replied back with a “I appreciate you” with a picture of her giving a thumbs up on her story. 

Party:
Later on in the year. I saw this girl at a party. The first time in real life. I saw her from across the room and we made eye contact for idk how long. It felt like a movie scene where you look at someone for a second and everything slowed down but know they looked at you. I knew she looked at me cuz a few seconds later I looked back and she was looking back too.

So after all these events is she being nice or was she interested. I know the party scenario could just be my point of view and she could’ve just been looking back like who’s that weirdo that stared at me and tried getting a better second look but who knows because we had never seen each other in person all we had were our profile pictures and by that time we hadn’t texted in over more than half of the school year so who knows if she would’ve remembered me.

3. she admit to doing very toxic things in the past that may have cause some of her exs to go crazy or turn toxic themselves. she only admitted this when I asked the question. 
4.  break up with her ex boyfriend 1 month go then got a new boyfriend only to break up with him too.

60,pfrqwu,1630494889,The Catch-22 of a Hopeful Romantic,"TL:DR: A Post Break-Up Testament of encouragement to the Stronger version of myself who can one day break free of the vicious cycle he is presently in.

It’s been quite a while since my Long-Distance ex gf dumped me and asked if we could stay friends because she “still cared for me, but just differently”. I was still in love with her, but she had her mind made up at that point. I thought of all our mutual friends who shared a hobby and I also didn’t want to sour how I felt about that hobby I care about so much, so I agreed (against my better judgement) and assumed the hurt I felt would mend on it’s own with time, but so far nothing seems to be showing any signs of healing. 

It comes and goes like phantom pains in the part of my heart where my feelings for her once were and it triggers from things like hearing her voice, her sending pictures of her dog that I adore but will never see again, and hearing what else she has been doing with all her newly acquired free time from taking a Hiatus from our mutual hobby (and also our relationship). I couldn’t truly understand her reasoning, but her noticeable lack the conviction to match the words she told to me to convince me to try the friend thing in the first place has made it hard to trust her words across the board. All I know is one of the main reasons I cling is how hard it is to say goodbye, and maybe it’s the same with her but she has never told me her intent. With her Hiatus though, I thought it could be a good time to try and talk my way out of our hollowed friendship since any mutual reason of interacting with one another had essentially ceased and I mustered the courage to try, but she presented appealing compromise after appealing compromise to try and keep a reason to interact with me like movie club or game nights, and eventually I gave in because I realized I had the courage to ask, but not the willpower to follow through and resist.

I hoped going in to see if trying something different could start the mending process again, I made an effort to keep up the schedule because movies and games were something I still genuinely cared about and could maybe numb the caustic feeling in my chest I feel by interacting with her, but she acts as if she is testing the waters constantly as if to see the bare minimum necessary to keep me coming back. I know I deserve better, but so far I’ve lost the courage to abandon such a sizeable chunk of my past including all its good parts, and am still missing the willpower to count my losses and move on because it would hurt too much to admit all that time was for nothing. 

Its like I am drifting between the moments where I feel the phantom pain reminding me of my scars and giving me clarity, and the moments of willful ignorance sprouted from my hopes for healing; standing astute and ready to be dashed again. I don’t know when I will leave this destructive cycle, but I hope by writing this down for myself and others to see and having advice or opinions to look back on, I can one day find the strength to break free of this prison my fear and feelings have built around me. Maybe she does actually care about me still, but I know I am entitled to more than what I have been given which should be enough reason for me to speak up again, but only time can tell if I can muster the will to do so. From that point things can only change for the better whether I feel it immediately or not, but right now I already feel the draw of sleep, and with it another span of time where I might ignore the pain again from being sated by some minor acknowledgement or message. For those of you who read all this, Thank You. I’ll edit the post if circumstances change.

A Final Word To Myself: Your identity lies with your strength rather your weaknesses, don’t let your moments of lacking define your future. Also allow yourself to lean on those who offer their shoulders in earnest, that means they want to see you better off like you wish yourself to be. You can do it man, we all know it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfrqwu/the_catch22_of_a_hopeful_romantic/

I (22f) met him (20m) in a language exchange app, hoping to be taught Russian culture and language. We started off awkward but slowly loosened up to each other, and we even switched from chatting to voice and video calls. The language and culture exchange became a discussion of different things to get to know each other better and turns out we have similar interests and we both are so enthusiastic when spending time with each other. Right now marks the 5th month of us talking to each other online. I am trying hard not to mess it up by confessing my feelings to him but we happen to video and voice chat every single night and I fear that he might get tired of me eventually because I can't meet him in person plus we've been talking all of the time online. I assume he likes me too but I'm not so sure because of the past experiences I've had with online dating. I wanna be the one to confess, to make it clear--- but at the same time I don't wanna ruin anything. I'm getting so restless, I keep on thinking about him all of the time. If ever he likes me too, I want us to keep the relationship for a long time (until I can meet him in person). I just don't know when would be the right time to confess. Or how we could make it work. FYI he is the only guy I've talked to for 5 months, other ppl only lasted for 2 months max.  

Problem is I'm scared of getting friendzoned. Some guys I talked to before sounded really intimate and even look like they like me but they all mislead me in the end.

67,pfssxq,1630499079,"Just looking for some advice i guess? Kind of a long post, oops","So i’ve been single for just about 3 and a half years, and honestly, it sucks lol. It seems to me that for whatever reason, despite being decently good looking, being in good shape, having a friendly personality, good sense of humor, being decently intelligent, and having a big heart that i enjoy using to spread love and kindness to those around me, not just my friends and family but my community as well. For some reason, it seems impossible to meet any women interested in me, and i’m not sure why. Maybe i’m just not catching the signs, but in the past it seems that it was much more obvious when a girl was into me. Don’t get me wrong, i’ve definitely had opportunities over the past few years, but honestly not many. It seems i’m really good at catching the interest of really beautiful women on rare occasion, who at the time, i would have considered way out of my league. But it always seems to be at the absolute worst timing. One of them that i met in jan 2019, i had met her and someone else literally within days of each other, and i knew i had caught the interest of both of them, and i didn’t know which one to ask out, and i didn’t want to be a dick and ask them both out and end up hurting someone’s feelings so by the time i figured out who i liked best, i talked to her and she said she had definitely been interested at one point but got the idea that i just wanted to be friends, which i sort of gave off that vibe i guess since i was trying to figure things out at the time. So it got me no where other than falling in love with this girl as we became closer friends and i just became more and more friendzoned. Then later on, in 2020 i was working at this bar, and this one really really cute girl was a host there, and she showed basically no interest at all at first but then after the first bar/restaurant shut down in michigan ended and we came back to work, for some reason she became very flirty with me and i wanted to jump at it but i was still messed up emotionally because of the last girl. And i didn’t want to start a relationship with someone where i potentially might still be thinking about someone else. Later on i ended up getting fired but would still come in for drinks occasionally with friends because the staff had become friends and aquaintances, and admitedly i also wanted to see this girl and maybe ask her out. Kinda chickened out, even tho she was flirtacious for a good handful of weeks. That part is on me, but i don’t understand why it seems so rare for me to meet someone who expresses interest in me when when it seems to me that i’d be a great potential partner for any kind hearted female with a good head on her shoulders and a good sense of humor. I have my talents and my passions and i’m very clear and open as to what they are. I’m decently confident in myself most of the time, and after having had made the mistake of letting two awesome girls slip by me, i’m not planning on making the same mistake this time around. I’m on tinder and another random dating app or two. Just trying to put myself out there and be myself, and i’m legitimately getting almost no matches whatsoever. And any time that i do they either don’t respond or seem completely uninterested all together and it just feels like i’m being deemed as “not good enough” by the majority of females on these apps for whatever reason. Maybe my pictures suck or my bio sucks, or both, i don’t know. I’m just tired of feeling completely overlooked when the truth is i know i’m awesome and i’m out here trying to make a real connection and make someone happy, rather than just hook up and just be an overall dickhead like 90% of these dudes out there are doing, but for some reason they’re the ones pulling in all the women and then i hear all these stories about these shitty ass dudes who are cheating and breaking hearts and i just don’t get why someone like myself is being overlooked when i see so many women complaining about being tired of being treated like shit. I’m also getting sick of seeing girls with their cashapp or venmo tag in their bio, or their only fans, or saying “follow me on insta” why is nobody looking for something real anymore? I have so much to give aside from a bunch of money, like i get by okay finacially and have no problem paying for dinner and/or drinks. I’m honest, and i’m nice, without being a pushover.

68,pft7nt,1630500562,Dating and the Vaccine,"So I haven't done a ton of dating over the past year or two, and not just because of Covid.  Had some things in my personal life I needed to work out before really getting involved with someone.  Recently, I met this woman for a first date.  It was an instant connection on both sides (we both talked about it last night) and have been talking/dating for the past couple weeks.  She's really amazing and we're aligned on so many different levels.  It's probably been a good 5-6 years if not more since I've had this strong of a connection right away.  


Everything is good, aside from one thing:  I'm vaccinated and she's not.  Now to be honest, while I'd prefer someone to be vaccinated it's not a total deal breaker for me (as long as they don't believe there's a plot to inject nano robots into your arm).  We're both in our mid 30's, work out every day, eat well, and in general do everything we can to protect our health.  She'll still wear a mask and has considered the vaccine, but at this point doesn't want to get it.    


In general, I'm pretty good with the situation as I know she's still taking other precautions.  The issue becomes if this progresses as I'm around my family a lot, which includes my two parents that are 70+ (both vaccinated), and my four nieces and nephews that are all 11-years-old and under.  I don't want to put my parents or unvaccinated nieces and nephews at any additional risk, but as I said I also haven't had this type of real connection with someone in a very long time.

79,pfvihm,1630507997,M21 Trying again with a girl F18,"Hello Reddit! I want internet opinions before i go out and do something stupid!
Im going to go through some backstory so yall see the whole picture

Backstory: So i met this girl at a hot tub in a college apartment complex and we hit it off like crazy, we like doing the same things, she was also kinda a daredevil which was super hot honestly. We vibed really well so i asked her to meet me at my favorite smoothie shop the next day and she came. By far the best date i have ever gone on. 

I was not only happy but also comfortable around her and i feel she reciprocated! We held hands as we walked around a mall messing around joking having a good time.

Then for the sad part, she got cold feet and thought that i was trying to make us exclusive so she hecka distanced herself and when we talked about it via text i told her i respect that and that Ill see her around the complex hoping to maintain friendship because she was super cool.

Since then i moved on and met some fantastic girls but im still waiting to find somebody as cool as F18 was.

K now for what happened last night: so i was hanging around a bunch of friends at the same jacuzzi i met her at. While i was vibing one of my friends had to leave so i walked this person to their car. When i come back to see more homies, F18 is sitting there surrounded by some of my homies. 

When i initially saw her i was like “oh hey!” Kinda like how you see a good old friend. Then I notice 2 of the homies really pursuing this chick. It made me feel a little sad but i was like good for you.  While i was asking how they all met one of the homies pulls up right next to her and wraps his arm around her. I don’t really remember what he said while doing that but i remember looking into F18’s eyes and she looked either surprised/uncomfortable/or uncomfortable that i was there when that happened.

NGL I know that i shouldn’t let it affect me, since we were never really anything exclusive. But something about that really upset me. So i just went to the other side of the hottub and avoided that whole group and talked to other friends (who were mostly female but i aint interested)

I think it stung because we shut things off and i remembered right there all the stuff we both did that was super fun and started to feel attraction again but then I realized that i was pretty easily replaced.

My roomies were also at the pool and i wanted to leave but didn’t want to leave alone for some weird reason so i stayed till like midnight then went back by myself. A whole night of awkwardness.

Ok sorry for the long story this is where i need internet opinions:

Even though i was super mad last night i want to hit her up again. As in try again but we wont do anything or say anything that leads to becoming exclusive. Just take it slower. 

I want to, but whats stopping me is i have been in a similar situation in the past where i tried to try again but if im being honest im just an expendable/replaceable dude.  That case backfired bad. Not saying that to put myself down. But i literally see it. So I’m trying to see if this is gonna hurt my self respect or I’m gonna end up embarrassing myself. 

Should i just try and move on and wait for a girl that i vibe with again (few and far between btw) or should i shoot my shot and risk making things weird.

Cheers, thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfvihm/m21_trying_again_with_a_girl_f18/

82,pfvwau,1630509117,How to approach people you’re interested in?,"Now this can apply for anyone but I, (M18) have just entered college without dating experience.

So, I have an interest on someone but actually approaching her and befriending is a problem. I don’t entirely know how to approach without coming off as creepy or too asserting. I’ve had so many instances where I can just ask her rational dumb questions regarding the class we were in but I just don’t have the confidence to do so. So many thoughts racing through my head on what she might think of me depending on what I ask her for small talk.

I can talk to people I don’t know easily, I don’t really have anxiety but this person in particular I am just too shy to approach and settle with a conversation. My main goal is to befriend her before I ask her out— you know— to get to know her. Because like I’ve stated above, I feel like it would be odd for someone to approach one another on a date without any idea on who they are.

I don’t know what to do, I feel like if I’m too slow on this it will be too late to make any moves.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfvwau/how_to_approach_people_youre_interested_in/

I’ve never had a girl be remotely interested in me. Not even one having a crush on me. And when I say not one, I genuinely mean not one. Not, “well there was one but I didn’t like her” just zero point blank.

I’m the only person I know like this. I’m the only person I know that’s never been kissed. I’m the only person I know that’s never been on a date. I just don’t feel right. Most of my friends constantly make fun of me for it. The ones that don’t still have made it clear they they think it’s weird.

Even my parents and brothers think I’m weird. My parents always ask me if I’m fat and why I’ve never brought a girl home. My younger brother has had girlfriends, my older brother has never had a problem with girls. I’m the one who struggles.

Am I normal? And I’m not looking for a bullshit “There’s no such thing as normal, everyone’s unique,” answers. There’s things that are commonly accepted as weird. It’s weird to be a virgin at 30. Most people think it’s abnormal.

86,pfw74o,1630510047,I(24F) left my partner (29M) because he throws tantrums every time we argue.,"My partner throws tantrums whenever we argue, I've been trying my best to work it out with him but it hasn't gotten better. I have repeatedly expressed that his aggressive and angry reactions really make me anxious and I wasn't sure if I could handle it long term. I have made clear that if this behavior doesn't change, I didn't think our relationship could last. I grew up in an abusive household and I am hyper sensitive to any unreasonably angry and aggressive behavior. He always apologizes and seems to feel remorse and we both suggest ways to make it better but when it comes to the next argument, it's the same thing all over again. The last time this happened I ended up packing my things and leaving the house.

My questions are:   
\- If you have been in a relationship with a partner who has similar reactions, how did you work through it, if at all? Do you think I should try to work through these issues with my partner if given the chance? He has also lived through a traumatic childhood and has a lot of unprocessed anger. 

Our arguments are almost always as follows:

*partner is condescending and then notices that I'm bothered*

Partner: What is bothering you?

Me: Truthfully, you've been a bit condescending and I would appreciate if you would be more mindful of what you say to me. If I misinterpreted what you said and it wasn't your intention to be condescending then I'm sorry I brought it up.

Partner broods for anywhere between 15min-2hrs.

Me: could you please let me know what you're thinking/feeling?

Partner: *angrily* I told we will only talk when I'm ready.

*Partner stomps out the room and slams door on me*

Obviously this isn't the worst that could happen, but again, I'm hyper sensitive to aggressive/angry behavior. I felt cornered because he asked me what was wrong, I told him, and he got upset with me.

90,pfwpre,1630511590,How to approach people if you’re unattractive?,"I (21F) have never had any kind of romantic interaction my entire life (not even having a random stranger compliment me). I’ve recently mustered up the courage to use dating apps and take actual photos of myself (they aren’t the best but I’m proud that I actually did it because of my strong fear of taking photos). I haven’t gotten any matches and the few guys I’ve matched with, I would send them a message related to their profile and they would immediately unmatch (bumble is literally hell). It definitely feels humiliating to get no attention and makes me feel like less of a woman. 
I don’t want to lose hope so I feel like maybe I would have a better shot at trying things in person. I went to my university’s welcome back party and I saw my crush. We’ve never interacted before so he’s basically a stranger but I really wanted to talk to him. I chickened out and spent the entire night just watching him from a distance lol.

I’ve been begging my one popular friend to help me out by going out with me to more social settings but that was a bust.

91,pfwpse,1630511592,Are we going on a date or just getting dinner?,"So, there's this girl who I worked with for a year who I always thought was good looking, was fun to work with and we got along pretty well, but I never asked her out due to a combination of social anxiety and the fact that we worked pretty closely.

Then, within the past few months, we both got promoted/transferred to different departments recently. I hadn't seen/spoken to her for a couple months, so I texted her asking if she wanted to get lunch to catch up. We planned on trying to get lunch, but she's always very busy and is lucky to get a lunch. So, I suggested we get dinner instead, to which she agreed, but she went on vacation for a week. When she returned, I asked again if she wanted to get dinner, which again she agreed to, but said next week (this week) because she had to catch up at work. We had agreed on tonight, but it seems weather may not permit, so we agreed on next week because she's busy the rest of the week.

Two things:

1. Am I being strung along or just bad luck?

2. Is this a date or just dinner between coworkers? Is there a good way to find out without directly asking?

I suffer from social anxiety, haven't had good luck in terms of previous relationships, have low self esteem, etc., so I am probably overthinking a lot and I wanted to get the opinions of strangers on the internet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfwpse/are_we_going_on_a_date_or_just_getting_dinner/
