1,reyl2c,1639343983,During when in the lunch/dinner do I ask the girl out?,"I always prefer asking someone out in person, but I don't have a lot of experience with it. I tried three times in my long life of 20 and I got shot down every time. 

This week, I asked a girl who is in the same university course out for lunch that I liked. We study together alone every so often, and I would say we have good chemistry with each other, but there aren't obvious clues that she 100% likes me back. I asked for lunch on the weekend, she said yes, and also asked if we want to invite a few other mutual friends, to which I replied: I honestly want to have lunch with just us, but if you feel uncomfortable let's invite everyone. She then said yes to one one one lunch.

So far, I think through that exchange I was being pretty suggestive that I wanted something more than a platonic lunch, but I definitely plan to ask her to date me for real during the lunch. I made up my mind to shoot my shot, and if she doesn't like me back I'll move on, but when should I do it? During the lunch, near the end? As we are walking back? Also how do I conduct myself during the lunch? I was always shy so I never really flirted with her, should I be more flirty/suggestive? And finally what are some warning signs that I should actually abort me asking her out altogether? Maybe if she brings up her boyfriend lol (which I am not sure if she has), which is a clear sign that whatever this is can only be platonic, but if she had a boyfriend already would she have even agreed to the lunch in the first place?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reyl2c/during_when_in_the_lunchdinner_do_i_ask_the_girl/

I feel like I’ve never met a girl that’s like the real me. Any girl I’ve gotten anywhere with has been after I kinda play down my eccentricities and rid myself of what I think is me.

Like I’ve never met a girl with my sense of humor and I kinda just mimic the girls to appear funny. I’ve never met a girl that has the same interests as me. I know they’re out there but it just seems so incredibly rare.

4,rez03o,1639345191,Should I pursue this chemistry,"I met this girl through a group of friends. We had both shown up to events and hadn't really talked. I ran into her on Halloween and we hit it off talking about things we had in common. However, at the time I was in a relationship and let her know. She still continued talking to me the rest of the night. We had a lot of laughs, she told me she was going through a divorce, I let her know I went through one earlier in the year. At the end of the night she left and I figured I gained a new friend. 
Cut to last weekend my relationship had fallen apart. I was out with my friends at a bar and she was there again. The whole night we were just hanging out with our friends but I kept noticing her always coming closer to me when the group was talking. At the end of the night all the friends left and it was just us two, we closed down the bar and she gave me her number and told me to text her when I got home. I text her for a while and then we talked on the phone I went over to her house and we talked more. I ended up falling asleep at her house cuddled up with her in my arms. We didn't talk again until this weekend and I went over there again. We watched a movie and talked and she let me know that her divorce just got finalized and she felt like she needs time and isn't sure if she wants a relationship bc her divorce is fresh. I told her I understand that and I just got out of a relationship so not really looking either, but I'm not opposed to one if it happens. We ended up talking all through the movie and making inside jokes. I really wanted to kiss her so I made a move and we ended up making out on her couch all throughout the rest of the movie. I spent the night. We have great chemistry shared a ton of laughs and smiles. We are still texting a lot and hung out today. I just don't know what to do about the whole she just got divorced and isn't sure about another relationship yet. I'm fine with taking it a little slow but idk if I could take ending up as just a friend.

They don't have to actually SAY anything to make me feel ""less than"" when we're all out and they're talking about how one of them is moving away together and another is going to a concert next weekend with their SO. The topic inevitably leads to ""So, are you seeing anyone since last time we hung out?"" It makes me physically ache when I hear that. Because the answer is no, but I always have to find a new creative original way to spin it to the positive each time I get asked that. Like ""nah, I've been on some dates here and there but honestly I just like having fun right now"" or ""Nope haha but work has been nuts so I've just been focusing on that."" It's like I need to hide the fact that I'm single because... well, I'm single. I haven't found someone I actually liked. I haven't had luck on dating apps. But if I say that then the conversation turns awkward/gloom. I feel pitied. I feel inadequate.

 I'm just being real honest myself here--if all of my friends were single or my family (somehow) is, then I know in my heart I will feel 100% better about myself. It's not the fact that I don't have a better half to ""complete me"" that has got me down...I would love one of course, but  it's just this feeling of being inadequate in society if you're single.

15,rezqc5,1639347264,"Dating feels impossible for me. (M24, I have Aspergers)","//WARNING: long and possibly repetative post//

I have no issue asking people out, i dont have any unreasonable prefferences, but as life goes on, im starting to think i cant find love.

I live with my parents, my high schools made no effort to give me a propper education and thus, have nearly no real way to find conventional work. Combine these issues with the fact im on the autism spectrum and real dating is simply not possible for me. And this depresses me to no end.

Ive asked people out before, but i have a feeling either my obese frame, my lack of a job, my living situation or my autism makes people uncomfortable with the idea of getting to know me like that.

If you check my profile, it would show that i love to paint miniatures, i am also really into video/board games and i travel and work with a traveling funfair for much of the year. I love to learn new things, i like movies and jokes and so much more. I believe i have a lot to offer! But i can never find someone who could ever see me as more than a friend at best. 

Not that i have too much of a problem with this, i dont mind being just friends, but i still cant help but want more. I have lived much of my life with many, many friends, almost too many in fact, but honestly, i just want someone to do couple things and romantic stuff with who can like me as more than a friend or an aquaintence.

As im getting older, people around my age are slowly becoming more and more focused on work, university or college, dating just does not feel like its important to people anymore and i just dont know what to do anymore. Dating apps or sites just seem to make people only care about hookups and looks above actually getting to know someone new, going out usually just results in me meeting people who have nothing in common or meeting people i just dont like in general and, truth be told, i also tried blind dates, but they usually figure out im on the spectrum and lose interest.

I dont have any idea what to do. I look after myself well enough and im pretty confident and outgoing. I get im not conventionally attractive, im into nerdy stuff, i live with my parents and i have a learning disability, but is that so bad for every people i meet that i seem undateable?

I met a guy 6 months ago and although it was agreed that it was a fwb situation, I quickly realized I liked him as more. I never really brought it up but tried to show him with actions.(I knew it was kind of a lots cause because we had already started out as fwb) I still wanted to feel it out see, eventually he got it and “confused” he like me too and cared for me but with everything going on with him the timing wasn’t good. 

Unfortunately, this has the opposite affect and gave me hope(but deep down I thought he might not have been sincere) I just wanted so badly for us to test the waters I let myself believe. Anyway he pretty much cut all contact(social media)except for texting. I finally came to terms with the truth and started giving other guys my time and energy. 

I have met a guy online and we’ve been talking for about two weeks and have our first date tonight!!! He confused that he already sees a lot of qualities in me that he likes and hasn’t been so excited for a date in a long time. 

Not saying he’s the one but if I hadn’t let go of the “idea” of a relationship with someone that didn’t appreciate me, I might have missed out on someone that can at least make time to text me back and show the interest in me I’ve been wanting.

I'm done with headgames and all the bullshit that relationships can sometimes get into.

My thinking is that if I'm honest in what I want or would like in a relationship and bringing in up in a discussion,  that it will weed out a possible potential bad relationship. I'm not saying this will be bullet proof in deciding to continue dating or a possible long term relationship with the person.

We also Snapchat each other frequently and find eachother attractive. We’ve acknowledged that both of us aren’t ready for anything serious as we’re newly out of LTR

She wants me to come visit next weekend, and I said I would. However, she asked me where I’m going to stay. I told her I have a friend on the island that I could maybe stay with. She lives alone and has told me a bunch of stories about boys coming over to her place.

I understand that she wouldn’t feel comfortable telling someone she hasn’t met they can stay over but I also feel like Im sticking my head out pretty far since it’s about 150$ ferry ride round trip and 50$ gas + money for a date when we got out.

I feel like if she truly interested, she would maybe offer a place to crash as this is quite a bit of effort on my part for meeting someone.

I am getting mixed signals. I am confused.

Some say the dating landscape has gotten worse in recent decades. Some say that's not true and that, overall, things are better than they ever have been in the world.

That's not the confusing part. Things are much better in some ways and worse in others. For many (most?) people, dating is worse.

So, I start conversations about the topic. (Not just here but on other platforms too.) We all want things to improve. So let's get some motion in that direction? The reply? Crickets. Maybe a response or two sometimes.

Help me out here. Help me, help you, help me. Not because I'm anything talented or special. I'm not. I don't have much to show for 30 years here. I just want to build a life for myself and am finding that increasingly difficult to the point of absurdity and beyond.

32,rf0bpz,1639349004,I feel like my SO and I are too different. I think of breaking up fairly often.,"I have a bit of a dilemma. I have been with my SO for two years, but the honeymoon phase and novelty of the relationship is finally wearing off and I feel like we aren't as compatible as I once thought. In fact, I can say we have *almost nothing in common*. But at this point, I feel like I'm in too deep.

They are the type of person to want to talk often throughout the day and I'm *not* that type of person. If I'm not hanging out with you, I prefer to just check in in the morning with maybe a  ""good morning"" message and a conversation at night to talk about the day. I'm a pretty detached person when it comes to dating I'm finding out.

Their family dynamic is also very different from mine and it's *incredibly* uncomfortable for me. I come from a not so close family, and they are Hispanic. Not all Hispanics have close families of course, but it does seem like it's more common for them to have a close knit relationship with many family members. 

I have very bad social anxiety that really causes me to kind of keep my mouth shut in large gatherings, and that's a common occurrence in Hispanic households. I don't want to be a bad SO so of course I attend the get together, but it's always an insanely uncomfortable experience.

Like I said in the title, I think of breaking it off, but I know it would hurt them very deeply. I just don't know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rf0bpz/i_feel_like_my_so_and_i_are_too_different_i_think/
33,rf0cje,1639349070,"How would you perceive someone with a dating ""gap""?","31M | I've been away from dating for my twenties. I've been with 2 girls post college, each relationship lasted a month. I've been too focused on my career, which is really demanding. So far it's paid off significantly in every way, so no regrets. Now that I got a better work/life balance, I'm trying to get back to the world of dating.  


I've had trouble explaining this part as unexpectedly a lot of people seem interested to dig through the past. It's not that I can't lay it out just like I did here, but some individuals conclude that lack of experience = red flag, which has translated into several ONSs proposals and subsequent ghosting. I realised this gap signals immaturity and lack of experience, and people just want something transient instead of having to worry about the rest.   


That's not to say I'm not extra cautious with my behaviour, I think of myself as a mature person indeed. But numbers speak louder than words, and I wouldn't sweep my past under the rug in any case. 

&amp;#x200B;

How would you perceive of someone with such gap? How much do you prioritise history? And lastly, how do I handle this?

48,rf17x3,1639351579,Time is a weird thing,"3 years ago I was casually dating a beautiful girl, Haley. I really liked her, but she started pushing me away, wanted to explore her options,  and got into a relationship with someone else. It was depressing and I was a bit heart broken, but it happens. I let her go, never fought for her, she needed to figure out who she was and what she wanted. We occasionally texted from time to time, but not much communication over the years . 

Fast forward to Fall 2021. Over that time I was engaged for a bit, then in another pretty serious relationship for some time. Haley and I randomly started casually texting more and decided to catch up as friends (we were both still in relationships-it was a strictly platonic meet up). Then we both wound up single within a few weeks of each other. 

I’m not emotionally capable of dating right now. I need time to heal, but downloaded tinder to feel a little less lonely. Well, Haley liked me on there. Figured it was just a friendly joke, but she’s pretty flirty now, asks me about my sex life, discourages the idea of me getting back with my ex, texts me constantly, and just seems to want to hang out a lot. Definitely more interested than she ever was before.

It’s very unexpected. 3 years ago I’d beg for her attention, right now I’m only ready for friendship. Maybe someday the stars will align and we’ll see where it goes, maybe we’ll just remain good friends, who knows.

1. We  were doing trivia night and one of the questions was what celebrity do I  remind them most of? Some of the girls + 1 of the guys picked  Jake Gyllenhaal? Should I take this as a compliment since I don't look like  him? What personality does that give off?

2. One  of the girls there and I were chatting it up for most of the night,  talking about our favorite cities, what we want to do, our spotify  wrappeds and at the end of the night my friend who introduced me said  she thought the girl and I were hitting it off

Do  you think it's worth it to try and shoot my shot, cause if she says no I  don't want it to be weird in the friend group. Haven't dated in a long time since I was in a long relationship prior so not too familiar with picking up signs.

So the thing is that I have always gotten a lot of compliments from other very beautiful woman and actually they came to me many times to talk but I always had some kind of a blocked towards woman. Somehow I managed that problem and so at the age of 16 I was able to talk to woman BUT:

I hate it to say it but I am 22 years old and I love woman who are older than me. Of course not at the age of 40,50,60,70.. but woman who are 25-35. I just don‘t know what I could do against that but I really love elegant older woman like Monica Bellucci in her prime or Kate Winslet or Alizée ( oh god I love her , she was so beautiful!) 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

Matched a girl yesterday on tinder and we chatted a bit then quickly moved to texting where we talked for a few hours with pretty much immediate responses from both of us. Today we snapchatted back and forth a few times before she stopped responding and later in the day I texted her about something which also prompted a short conversation where again she stopped responding. 

So here's the situation. Last night while texting we made plans to hang out this coming Saturday. I do not yet know if this is gonna be a casual thing or something more but she agreed to come over to my place so we'll see what happens. My issue is I really don't want to scare this girl off so by texting her so much that when Saturday comes along she's no longer interested. But at the same time I don't want to not text her at all because she might again lose interest. I hate how online dating has created this goldilocks zone of talking where you have to find the proper amount to text without coming across as either needy or uninterested. 

Any advice on how frequently I should attempt to talk to this girl between now and Saturday (assuming she doesn't message me first)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rf3n6u/how_do_you_keep_someone_interested_while_you_wait/
77,rf3nds,1639358979,Dating Anxiety...,"Hey all, I'm new here. As a quick intro, I'm an 18 year old college student. I haven't dated a single soul since my freshman year of high school. So safe to say it's been about 4 years. I just wanted to come on and see if there's anyone else who gets what I'm going through. 

I've been single for so long, and seeing other loving couples is hard. I'm happy for them, but I also feel hurt for myself. My past relationships always ended up being not what I wanted. Obviously because I dated when I was between the ages of 12 and 14. But even still, those relationships only lasted about 3 months each. And each person I dated, ended up only wanting me so that they could try to feel me up and have a plaything. Yeah, I know, the boys in my school were little weirdos. 

Now, when I think about dating, 2 emotions flare up within me. I get warm and fuzzy, but also afraid. The warm and fuzzy part I love. Because in my mind, dating would mean having someone else to fall on. Someone you look at and melt because you love them that much. Someone whom you know so well, you don't even really have to say something for them to understand you. Someone to cuddle with, exist with and be content. But this also scares me. I'm afraid that I'll do something wrong, and they'll stop loving me. Or they'll begin to be bored or sad in our relationship, and end up leaving me because it's not fulfilling enough. Or I think that I'll become to attached to them, and something happening to them would ruin me. 

Every time I try to talk to someone to see if they're a potential love interest, about a week or 2 in to talking to them and I'm scared. When their message pops up I want to respond but I'm afraid the message will be something about them leaving. I keep talking to them but stay up at night with an anxiety stomach ache because I don't want anything to happen to them or what we had. 

I crave a relationship so hard though. I'm touch starved because I haven't felt intamite love at all. I want to be in someone's arms, playing with their hair as something plays on the TV in the background. I want to wake them up to a breakfast in bed and see the joy on their face as they eat. I want to hold them after a long day of work and make dinner together. I want them to surprise me with a freshly heated towel after a shower and a kiss on the forehead. Or maybe a snowball to the head outside while were putting up christmas decorations. Maybe a cuddle session on the floor in front of a fire while christmas music plays gently in the background. Or surprise trips to the movies where we joke around with one another the entire movie. 

I crave all those things so hard it physically hurts and I want to cry because it makes me so warm and fuzzy. But then when I finally have the chance to gain a relationship like that, I become riddled with fear and end up losing them anyway about 2 weeks later. Or our constant talking becomes 1 conversation every 2 weeks. 

Why can't I just gain the relationship I want without it falling apart before it could even really begin? Please tell me there are others like this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rf3nds/dating_anxiety/

Luckily I am financially independent with money to spare, but it gets annoying pretty quickly spending $100 on a date night with a girl just to get ghosted after. At what point should I be expecting women to at least try to pay for their half of the bill or offer their input for date ideas? Why am I always the only one who bothers to even look at a check or bill when it comes? Even with girls that we make it to the third date with seem to assume I’d do all the work. Every date I go on, I feel more and more like I’m being used. That I’m valued only because I’m somewhat attractive and can pay for everything. 

I’m only a few months into dating and I’m already tired of having to put in 100% of the effort to plan, pay, or initiate any flirtation. Might just stay single at this rate…maybe it’s why hook up culture exists because men realized the effort they put in amounts to nothing🙄

He is a decent understanding super sweet lad so we have kicked things off but haven't made it official yet.

Yesterday I went to his house for the first time, we were there with his sister and her man, my best friend &amp; her fiance, all mutual friends. We had the opportunity to sit alone in his room which we took but nothing happened. I was too jittery to go for it (kiss him) so we just hung out with everyone instead which was equally fun. 

Here's the fun part. I got really confident after a drink and after we left and he texted me we should meet again soon, I texted him that we should meet because I wanna make out with him. I don't think he expected that and he was confused for a second but I explained I wanted to kiss him. SUPER bold, I've never done that before, I really patted myself on the back for that one. He was super happy about it and here we are...

Today he came to my city, we live about one hour away :(, and he told me he brought something for me, told me to close my eyes and at first I was sure he was going to kiss me but before he often does bring things i obliged and held my hands out smiling. He kissed me lol. I get so embarassed though. After exchanging a few more kisses throughout our outing we had to say goodbye :(. This man will be the death of me I swear. I wanted to ask him to be my boyfriend today but I was so drunk by his scent and kisses it totally slipped my mind :(.

This weekend Im going to his house again, I don't think I'll be able to handle myself xD. Last time I was there behind closed doors just holding his hand, hoping this time I'll be holding his face and neck, feeling his pulse under my hand.

82,rf4hlk,1639361514,Ugly insider: When you're the ugly friend.,"I am the guy that women think is great to have around, but am not attractive enough for them to be interested in more, and here's what I've learned.

It's about looks primarily and heavily. (But we already knew this.)
I've recently befriended this gorgeous woman, we are coworkers, and quickly bonded over LOTR and star wars. Super cool, super pretty and super sweet. Honestly my type. 
But we recently got a new man in the office, and he's the kind of guy that is every girls dream. 
Intense eyes, gorgeous smile, tall and nice build, luscious hair. (you get the picture, tall, dark and handsome).
And immediately, she fawns over him, hasn't even talked to him. And comes over to me and starts discussing how attractive he is, and how kind he looks. 

Fast forward to our Holiday Party. We are all at the same table and she's texting me about him, saying she wants to make a move on him, etc. 

I was doing some music for the party and she comes over to listen to me play, and he comes up and pulls up a chair for her to sit on, and walks away. IMMEDIATELY she's whispering ""oh my God he got a chair for me! He's so sweet and amazing!"" 

Today is the day after the party and everyone is texting photos to the group chat of the night before, and she texts in a photo of our table. 

Apparently he texts her from there, privately, and they've been planning to hang out and watch LOTR (which is something her and I also bonded on) and she sends the screenshots of their conversations bc she's all excited that they're talking, texting and planning to meet up...


This isn't the first time I've been on the sidelines watching this kind of thing happen. This doesn't happen for us ugly men. No women are whispering positive thing about us. The most women whisper is that we are ugly losers and laugh at us. 

No one is texting us from a mass group text to meet up with us. No one is secretly crushing on us wanting to get us into bed.

But this is just an example of how easy it is for normiés. This has all happened within a span of a week. 

And just because he was attractive. And the only ""personality"" he displayed was pulling up a chair for her. It's that easy when you're attractive I guess. 

I could slay a whole dragon for a woman's affection and she's still run away from me. I'll always be just a friend...never a boyfriend, or lover.

She knows I’m interested in her romantically. I’ve been to her house, and she’s been to my mom’s house (back when it was my house too). Nothing ever happened between us - I was very bad at dating.

In 2017 she left the country to go to school in Japan, and I spent some time with her while visiting Tokyo in 2019 - purely as friends, but we *did* go out on things that would look like a date to anyone watching. And both times we went out, she asked me to walk her home, so I know she at least feels safe with me.

Now she’s back in America. I asked if I could take her out to dinner, and she was pretty enthusiastic about it. I’ll be picking her up from the suburbs, about 30 minutes outside of a major city, and then driving back into the city to hit up a good restaurant and maybe a few bars.

I want to park in my apartment building’s garage, which is about 1 mile from the restaurant, and just Uber to the restaurant, since it’s easier than trying to figure out parking in the city. Also it means I can have an extra drink, since I’ll have more time to sober up before I have to drive again. *Also because it would make it easier to get her up to my apartment.*

Is this a bad idea? I wouldn’t do something like this if I didn’t know her well, because I could totally see how a woman would pick up on this and feel uncomfortable about it. But given our familiarity, I’m thinking she might not care, but I’m also an idiot.

So guys.. What should I do?.. She says that it'll take abt two months or more to change the tattoo.. Is she wasting my time?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rf655m/started_dating_this_girl_and_recently_found_out/

97,rf6a4v,1639367076,(25M) Need advice for approaching women,"So I’ve recently been going out to bars a lot with the hopes of meeting some women and hopefully get a girlfriend. I’m decently attractive and can hold a conversation well once I get talking. My problem right now is actually getting into a conversation with someone. 

What are some tips or things you say to women in a bar/club to get into the conversation? I have heard make an observation or just say hi, but I overthink things and end up doing nothing and I’m sick of it. So basically I just need help getting into conversations with attractive women lol I’d appreciate any tips/advice",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rf6a4v/25m_need_advice_for_approaching_women/
98,rf6gfc,1639367648,Love bombing date - end in ghosting - please help!,"Hi Reddit friends,
This happened to me about a week ago and I’ve been thinking through it non-stop.
Maybe some outside opinion would help shed some light on it. Any and all advice/opinions are welcome…


-I 32M Met her 35F on a dating app and hit it off quickly. Nice easy conversation, flirty banter, consistent communication. Talked for one week first 

-Decided on a mid week first date since she was leaving early for Christmas vacation 

-Met at her place b/c she didn’t want to go out, adhering to stricter covid protocols. She visits older family members a lot. Fair enough, covid hesitancy is common here 

-date starts out like most first dates, nervous energy and light getting to know you type convo

-I brought take out for us, we watch tv, eat and pause every so often to talk more

-As time goes on our convo become really deep, we are seeing eye to eye on so many values and shared interests. Talk about family, work, friends, passions, old school stories, religion, future goals, lots of joking and laughter! Compliments! Signs of a good first date!

-A few things to mention was that she is more religious than me (similar religion), asked how a future kid if it happened would fit it and brought up her issues with her strict parents. These don’t really seem like first date topics when I look back but they happened

-10pm, we were going to end since weekday but it was going well so we decide to watch a movie. She immediately starts cuddling, holding hands, laying on my chest

-We watched for a while and eventually I end up kissing her. Turns into a full on make out session, things are getting heavy. When clothes start coming off she asks to slow down, said she just wanted to make sure there was a spark but not looking to rush into anything. All good I respected that and we calm down a bit and go back to talking. Still kissed a bunch of times after and before leaving

-End up planning future dates and she even said I hope you we can continue this via text till I’m back in January. Even joked about inviting me to her trip if I didn’t have Christmas plans

-went home, texted each other goodnight. Happy with the night! 

Next day

-I text her around noon, see how her day is going

-Heard back after midnight, bad long day at work for her. Another bad day with 5am wake-up to follow, I assume wrap up work before vacation. She Asked me how my day went?

-I Reply on Thursday morning…I give her info on my day, empathize with her work issues. Told her she is almost home free. Ask her if she is a morning person b/c 5am is brutal…Then to cheer her up showed her Christmas tree we just put up and asked her what she thought of it? Her family doesn’t celebrate so she was excited about it


No reply…Never heard from her again

I broke my confront ghoster rule like an idiot and messaged her Saturday. Wished her a good trip and asked her why we are not talking…
You guys know what happened next, no reply

Is she just love-bombing on first date for attention? Maybe she has an avoidant attachment style and got scared off?
