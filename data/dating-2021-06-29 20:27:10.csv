I'm about to be 30yrs old on my own again...so enough about that. So I've been with this girl for about 6 months or so and it's been crazy. She had just came out of a very bad abusive relationship and to a guy who had a drinking problem. Idk but it just seems how nice I have been towards her she still treats me like garbage. Idk what to do I mean I do see the good in her but there is no passion compassion if not any romance. Every time I try to show her I am different and a good person I keep getting shut down I buy her flowers she don't care I use to open the door for her and she got pissed at me after 3 months of doing it.
      When I want to cuddle with her or spend time watch a movie she doesn't want to but it's only when she wantes it. 
She is the type that it always has to be her way and I am lost on what to do..I've been there for her emotionally to help her through the tough time and be her support. Nothing I have done is good enough. The crazy thing is she wants to see me everyday and be with me everyday and I'm the fool who moved in with her sister and husband who lives 2 mins down the road.. I'm lost and confused üòï
I am a great man and a catch she says but why am I being treated like crap and why have I lasted this long to where I am stressed out everyday and trying to keep her happy because she explodes over the smallest thing she knows she is doing it but still continues to do it and tells me that she is trying to be better",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oamfd7/super_lost_and_confused/
1,oamjs3,1625016860,Is it rude to ask for someone's number and then never text them?,"So I have this problem recently where I will go out to a bar and get pretty drunk, not blackout drunk though. 

Sober I am a pretty shy person, I really don't like talking to people I don't already know kinda thing. 

But recently whenever I go out and drink I end up befriending tons of random people. I've also asked a couple of women for their numbers and I've been given them, not sure if they were real numbers or not. 

My question is is it rude to then not actually text any of these people? I just have no idea what to say to them or how to go about actually becoming friends or go on dates, so I just don't. 

For info, I have plenty of regular friends but I've met all of them through college or work and seeing them all the time makes me comfortable. But this is an entirely different scenario so I just don't know.

I was not expecting that comment at all, I felt a huge pain in my chest but I didn‚Äôt say anything. The next day I told him it had hurt me and he apologised. Then I asked him again if it was what he really wants and he said yes. I discovered I don‚Äôt want to share my man. I‚Äôm now crying a lot, I‚Äôm in pain.

Why I feel this way enough to come on here and talk about it now is because I have a date with a girl my race. We went on two dates and this time I can tell she wants me to make the move on this date but I‚Äôm terrified. It‚Äôs maxed out by 10 because she is my best friend sister. I know if I don‚Äôt perform she is gonna tell everyone. I‚Äôm freaking out because I actually like her.

28,oaoadh,1625022776,How to get over a guy and not fall so hard?,"So this guy (24) was hired 2 months ago. He seemed very friendly and funny at first. When ever I work in thr office, he would talk to me and I ended up finding out we have a lot in common. I (24) am only 1 day younger than him, we like the same shows and music. We have a similar sense of humor and I often make more mean jokes to him than other people at work since I know he will get them. 

Recently, I have been helping him with his work a little which caused us to end up talking. He expressed that since he is new he feels like people get frustrated at him for getting things wrong, etc etc. So I gave him some advice on what to do and how to improve. At work we send e-cards to each other to recognize each other's hard work and contribution , so I sent him one too and he sent one back saying that he appreciates that I took time to help a new person. 

Recently we have been talking a lot more, on Monday he asked why people cheat, if I have been cheated on and if I think going back is possible. Other days he will ask me my advice on career moves and different paths in our field. Today we talked about our obsessions (food, plants, weight gain and weight loss, etc). Other times we talk about life, relationships, dating, etc. 

As I talk to him more, I find myself falling for him. Which I don't like because I feel that I'm more of a mentor to him. He is single and so am I. He invited me to go out with him and some work friends this Friday, but I work late and am driving home after so I said no. He seemed pretty down about it, I guess. I didn't really think about it, I was just more focused on my very heavy work week. But I feel so distracted by my crush on him at work - I was very off my game on Monday.

34,oaou77,1625024734,Help reading mixed signals from a girl,"For some context I‚Äôm a 16 year old guy and she‚Äôs a 16 year old girl.

So a few weeks ago me and a few of my friends went over to this girl‚Äôs apartment who also had a few friends over. We had to go, but then a few days later, one of the girls who was there (who I‚Äôll call Jessica) texted my friend asking if I had a girlfriend. 

So then we went over to the girls house again, and Jessica‚Äôs friend pulled me aside and said that Jessica wanted to hook up. So I went and sat down with her, and we ended up making out for a few minutes before her friends had to go and she left with them (and she seemed positive about the experience).

So then afterwards, she snap chatted me and said ‚Äúif only we had more time‚Ä¶‚Äù and asked about what else I was doing this summer so obviously she still seemed interested. 

Then about a week later, she went out of town and my friend and I happened to be going to the same place, so I snapped her and said ‚Äúoh no way you‚Äôre going there we are too‚Äù and she seemed super disinterested and replied with just ‚Äúoh cool.‚Äù And then a few days later (we both went back home) I asked on Snapchat if she wanted to hang out next week and she said she couldn‚Äôt because she had this dance program all week.

This seemed disinterested right? I just can‚Äôt tell if Jessica‚Äôs bad at communicating interest (like how before she had to have her friend tell me that she was) or if she actually isn‚Äôt interested.

In my 20s, I occupied myself with work, school, friends, hobbies, family, as well as heavier stuff such as taking care of my mental health and healing previous trauma from childhood abuse. 

Now I'm in a great spot to start a committed LTR. I've learned from my mistakes and can spot red flags &amp; emotionally unavailable partners very quickly. Likewise, I've built decent communication skills and self-awareness of my strengths &amp; weaknesses through my healing journey. 

I'm honestly ready for ""the one"" (or life partner, marriage/starting a family is in my future goals). I realize that I'm getting older and that the pool will shrink/change accordingly. 

I have no problems being alone. I'm fairly independent as most of my life I've had to handle things on my own (friends/family are busy, no partner). I can eat alone, go to concerts/theme parks/movies by myself, etc. I've never been interested in settling for a toxic relationship just to be with someone. 

That being said, sometimes I wonder if I'm the problem. I have ""high standards"" in the sense that I require someone to have a healthy mindset towards the give/take of relationships, the effort &amp; work that it often requires, a willingness to be open to seeking outside help, etc. Compatibility on every level is extremely important to me (attraction, physical/sexual, emotional, intellectual).

I'm human and sometimes I feel lonely and want true companionship. I've tried every typical dating advice in the book: date yourself, it happens when you least expect it, use dating apps, ask friends to set you up, go to the bar every weekend, network within your hobbies... 

The pandemic probably didn't help but I'm social enough, generally. Unless I really buy into the  ""number's game"" of dating and go on several dates every week, I'm not sure what else I can do.

47,oaqbzm,1625030326,We have nearly identical backgrounds,"Broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years \~ 4 months ago, went through hell and beyond, but I felt I like I was ready to go on a date, so I downloaded Tinder, like every normal person does nowadays.

Matched with maybe 10 girls, but didn't click with most of them, but one was sympathetic, well educated and clever. Basically #1 thing that I told myself girl should have, after being with someone who is not very bright. We chatted for couple days and I didn't have nerve to ask her out. Jesus, haven't done this for 7 years, felt like throwing up at times. But I did, just said fuck it, first of all- I be myself and see if I like her, not going there to meet my future wife. She seemed happy that I did ask her out, so this boosted my confidence. 

So we go on a date, first couple minutes are really hard for me, I can feel my voice cracking and what not, but 5 minutes in and I relax, we walk and talk then we sit down for a coffee and start digging into each other a little bit deeper and guess what, she is basically female version of me when looking into our childhood and background. Our parents are nearly identical, we live in similar looking house, we both were forced to play same sport (with the same coach) during our childhood, childhood and everything until adult life has so many overlaps. And no, this is not common, in 25 years of my life, I've never met someone (nor girl, nor guy), who would have so many similarities. This boils down to both of us perceiving world in a similar way. We found it extremely fascinating and strange. Needless to say, we agreed to go out once more. I feel kinda bad, because I didn't establish any physical contact, like touch her arm when she laughs, maybe a light push when she says something silly, but oh well, might learn that with time.

This was my first date in 7 years and it felt quite successful, might approach someone else, but only if I bring myself to do it in public, people on dating apps are nothing like in real life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oaqbzm/we_have_nearly_identical_backgrounds/

57,oarud9,1625036706,"(25m) So I just got hit with the classic ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" from a 25f","This might be more of a rant than asking for advice, since I had a bad night sleep thinking about what my date said last night.

We were on our third date and I already had a gut feeling by then that something was wrong. Between the 1st and 2nd date I felt this positive energy and vibe between us that we're really into getting to know each other and having a good time. But after the 2nd date she let me know that she wants to take it slow (her not being on top of her game, whatever that may mean). So already, I found it difficult to interpret what ""taking it slow"" might mean.

Now, during the 3rd date, she said she actually broke up with her ex 2 weeks before me and her started talking and that she's not yet ready for a (new) relationship. She wants to explore herself, get to know more people in the city (since she's a foreigner in my home country). She also has a busy schedule (work, social life, fitness) and she told me she's happy with it at the moment. Meaning that there isn't really that much time for her to spend on a possible relationship.

So after she told me all this, she did say she likes hanging out with me and talking, and she does want to stay friends, but that she's not ready to commit to anything and will not be in the near future. At first I told her that we can still hang out together and meet up, but that I'll still be hoping for an eventual long term relationship. Although, I did say I would be realistic about it that something might not happen, of course.

After a (bad) night sleep and just thinking about the whole situation, I think that what I said was wrong. If I would stick around and show even the tiniest hope of that our dates might lead to a long term relationship, I think I might just devalue myself, just being happy with that small chance of something happening. While I could be pursuing a woman who is actually interested in a long term relationship, or something serious at the least. I don't want to be on the hook as her potential plan B that's sticking around, hoping for that chance she might change her mind.

So I'm thinking of following the advice I've got from this vid (and other sources) : apparently external links aren't allowed, so for those interested, it's called ""Say This When She Says ""She's Not Ready!"" (Finding Herself or Emotionally Unavailable)"" by Apollonia Ponti.

Basically that I'll give her space and not continue dating with her because I'm ready for something more. And in the eventual case she's ready in the future, she can reach out to me and perhaps go on a date, if I'm still available then.

Some of you might say now that this might still be clinging to hope, but at least I won't have any contact with her anymore. I still really like this woman and we're on the same wavelength about a lot of things (except relationship stuff, obviously). But I could spend my time much more wisely than keep on dating her and being in this grey area without perspective.

61,oassdn,1625041124,Men should focus on in person approaching instead of dating apps,"90% of dating app users are male and of the 10% of female participants 60% are there for amusement.  Of course thats why there are so many single guys having a very hard time finding a date.  

Even worst is the mentality of most people on dating comes directly from their experiences from dating apps.  Ofc its gonna be negative, full of low self esteem, full of artificial coping, etc.

Now if you turn your focus on in person approaching the tides completely turn and its better for both men and women because yall can vet each other immediately.  Women are only against harrassing and disrespectful in person approaches but are super open to respectful and polite in person approaches.  

I know its hard but this is the only way to have a succesful dating life as a male.  I can tell you the more attractive a guy is doesnt mean he will have a successful dating life.  Its actually worse if you are super attractive because the ordinary ugly guy is weighted the same weight as you and stack up on the girls queue and she will prob not even see your profile.  So therefore there is misery on all fronts.  The only succesful guys arent the best looking but the most lucky.

I'm usually also not answering her messages instantly mostly something about 12 hrs to keep some tension. And you might say she might just be busy but that wouldn't make that much sense since she told me that she's on Summer Break atm and could hang out almost any day during Summer break since she's free most of the time.

Now, most of the stuff, for example, telling that she's free all Summer and still makes plans to hang would be signs that she might want to go ""further"" but the long reply times make me think about that. Maybe she just really can't answer my text, which I really don't think or she wants to keep the conversation going as long as possible? Idk what do you guys think! I might sound very needy lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oastmt/what_do_you_guys_think_long_reply_times/

There‚Äôs seems to be lots of men that need specific instructions when it comes to dating and relationships. Of course communication is important but I wish there are more guys who show some initiative, intuition and observation skills to figure out their partner. It‚Äôs exhausting to instruct what you like and don‚Äôt like specifically. It‚Äôs exhausting to tell them step by step what you need for almost every emotional/ physical/ communicational need. It‚Äôs exhausting to remind them to check in on you too and not get caught up in their own storm.

65,oat4pj,1625042774,Did I end it in a harsh way?,"I (29f) have been seeing (37m) for 2 months. We‚Äôve had 6 dates (have the spent the night each time as we live quite far away and one of the nights I took him to a hotel for his birthday) so we‚Äôve spent a reasonable amount of time together. 

We were very clear that we both want something serious so we were going to take it slow and be very honest with each other and let the other know as soon as we weren‚Äôt sure about it so we didn‚Äôt waste their time.
For the last 2 dates I had a niggle that something just wasn‚Äôt quite right even though he‚Äôs an incredible man and has exactly what I want on paper. 
Yesterday we had our 6th date and said goodbye at lunchtime and then after doing some thinking all afternoon I decided it wasn‚Äôt right and I needed to end it.

He‚Äôs Spanish and I‚Äôm English and neither of us is fluent in the other language, because of that I knew I wanted to write it out so I could fully communicate how I felt. On top of that he lives two hours away so didn‚Äôt want him to drive 2 hours to see me on the next date for me to just end it. 
I sent him what I thought to be the nicest message possible explaining how amazing he is and what a great time I had but there was just something missing for me.

I thought he‚Äôd be sad but happy to stay friends. But no. He was so angry and thought because I‚Äôd be acting fine on the dates that it was all an act and a lie. He said It was so disrespectful and rude. It was the exact opposite of how I wanted it to be, all I ever wanted was to be kind and honest with him. The way I see it when you‚Äôre getting to know someone you have to give it everything and make full effort to see how you feel, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a lie.
I hold my hands up and say maybe I should have done it in person, but I had my reasons. He‚Äôs basically saying that I never meant anything, I‚Äôm a liar, he‚Äôd never want to be my friend or speak to me again. It just wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting from an otherwise very mature and measured 37 year old.

70,oatw0s,1625046302,Realizing why I got ghosted,"I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a girl I care for and I couldn‚Äôt get her off my mind just like that. Everything was going great until communication suddenly stopped from her. I started thinking she‚Äôs selfish and was ready to move on.

However after thinking more, I realize I may have done something wrong. Basically we were supposed to go out to an amusement park. I was never cheap on our dates, meaning I would pay for things and one time she pitched in money and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine you‚Äôve gotten me this and that before‚Äù so she wasn‚Äôt using me.

Though one day I messaged her that she will have to buy the ticket since there‚Äôs a lot of personal info that is required. Later I apologized and said I‚Äôll buy it since I invited her. She said it was fine and she could buy it herself with a laughing emoj.

A few days later we talk a bit on text and then afterwards nothing. I asked her if she got the tickets and later if we‚Äôre going at all and no response. I‚Äôm thinking of coming to her work just to talk things out, if she‚Äôs not interested then I‚Äôll leave her be. But I think she‚Äôs under the impression I‚Äôm not interested because of this situation. 

But that‚Äôs not the case and I feel like it‚Äôs a misunderstanding. She also told a friend she was upset that I didn‚Äôt communicate more this one time when we went out. Should I bother trying to meet her and work things out or is this desperate?

71,oatwq4,1625046395,Am I in a Toxic Relationship?,"I don't know if this subreddit will allow it but here I go.

I have been dating this girl, let's call her B. I started dating her back in October 2020 and it's now the end of June 2021. This has been my longest relationship and before we became official, she seemed to be one of the very few women that I dated that wasn't crazy. However, it seems we keep arguing, and I've ignored it because they say healthy relationships argue a lot depending on sources and I thought sooner or later we'd fix our issues, but I feel it's become too much and that this relationship has become toxic.

I'm not going to say I was the best, but I know she's messed up a bunch during our relationship too and I also feel that she's become crazy/less logical because of my past actions.

We still love each other. I've still made the effort to be there for her because she's got a rough family life at home and I just wanted her to see that I love her and that I want to be there for her and make her happy. Sex with her was always the best sex I've ever had. We have made good times and great memories throughout our relationship. Although it seems like they don't matter to her because she said all those good times, great memories, and fun dates were her idea and that I wouldn't have done them with on my apparently absent volition.

*What I Done That Got Her Mad...*

* I flirted with some girls months back, like two months after becoming official.
* Before becoming official, we were openly dating. She decided to only date me, but I wasn't exclusively dating her because I didn't want that at the time.
* Got mad I had sex with girls before we became official.
* I made friends (nothing sexual intent) with a few girls on Bumble Dating.
* I didn't block girls on my social media because she thought I had crushes on them. When in reality it was because those girls were friends, old coworker friends, old classmates/schoolmates, and ok some I had a little crush on (before I even met her).
* I tried meeting in the middle because I thought this was crazy. She got mad that I simply unfollowed them and didn't straight up just block them, because she thought I'd just look them up n shit because they still followed me. Even when I forcefully unfollowed them and unfollowed them from me, she got mad I didn't straight up block them! Even though if I just blocked them, I could find them again in my blocked list. And I don't know about you guys, but I'm barely someone to block people on social media unless you're a spammer, scammer, or someone I really don't like from prior personal experience. 
* She got mad that I didn't block and delete the contacts of a few exes. Why did I keep those few? Because even after breaking up, we didn't break up hating each other, they didn't seem crazy to me, and they're fun to hang out with even if without sexual content. Like just as friends.
* I lied that I stopped watching porn.
* She got mad that I had multiple gmails and Instagram accounts.
* She got mad that she found Twitter accounts with similar handles to mine, thinking that they were mine. Even though I really never made those Twitter accounts she accused me of.
* I lied that I was with friends when I was hanging with some exes. (No, nothing sexual went down, we played tennis and went to the skatepark, the instances I hung with them)
* I got physical with her about three times at most.
* She got mad I didn't go bragging around to my friends about how awesome of a girlfriend I had and how bomb our sex was.
* When I was on a trip seeing my brother in New York, she kept getting mad I wasn't texting her fast enough when I was walking everywhere in fucking NYC, one of the places you really don't want to walk and text. Saying that she still texted me all the time, during her trip in the rural NorCal Oregon region....
* In May I disabled my Snapchat and Instagram to not only better myself, but also to show her that I want to focus on her. She was apparently stocking my Snapchat score and got mad when I lied that I wasn't on it. Before my NYC trip, I decided to reinstall snap for like two minutes to check what my coworker sent me and then I deleted the app again, and she saw my snap score go up and she got mad.
* We had a breakup during the relationship, well a good few. And she got mad that I had decided to reinstall Bumble because I thought the relationship ended at that point. I proceeded to redelete my Bumble.
* Got mad that I didn't delete my OkCupid account, even though I deleted the app and never went on it since we became official. Until she went snooping in my Gmail for shit on me and if I deleted everything perceived to be sketchy.
* She got mad that some hookup/dating websites ended up in my junk folder, and she thought that I went on them. What were these websites? BangHookups and SingleAsians! I know I definitely didn't sign up for these. For one, it was in June and I know I hadn't been on any dating sights since the Bumble incident. Two, the website had nude pop-up ads like you'd get on a porn site and all the ""girls"" that somehow matched with me were girls that were all clearly bots! Three, there was no profile picture of me and no bio on there, because I didn't make these accounts, so how could these ""girls"" have wanted to swipe on this account of ""mine"". Literally the next day, I check my junk folder cause I know I'm right and THEN I SAW IT, a new sexual website scam called MatchSniper!  And she said basically that it is my fault that I have sexual-related scams and spam in my Gmail and that if I don't delete them then it looks bad on me!
* She got mad that my mom wanted us to use protection/some form of birth control since we fucked in my parent's house, and used plan Bs multiple times, and B blamed me saying that it was only me who wanted to fuck raw. When she clearly did too.

&amp;#x200B;

*What She Did That Got Me Mad...*

* She'd keep flip-flopping and saying that ""oh you don't love me, care for me, respect me, watch out for me, take me out on dates"" to ""I'm sorry I do realize you love me, care for me, respect, watch out for me, take me out on dates.""
* Every time I take her out, she says either that it was her idea or that it's because we had an argument earlier and that I was just trying to be nice after an argument. When I drove her to practically every single one of our dates, paid for almost every date, and no I never expected or even wanted sex in return! The sense of acknowledgment and for her to be happy was all I wanted! And yet she keeps thinking I'm doing all this out of guilt, every time.
* She tried claiming that because she reminded me, a week before Valentine's Day, that it was all because of her that we had a Valentine's Day date. Cause that somehow compares to me already have prepared a beach date with her favorite wine and rainbow flowers. It's like ordering a custom cake. but saying you baked it and decorated the cake all by yourself.
* She told me to keep deleting my junk folder and finding out how to stop those sexual-related scam websites I mentioned earlier.
* During our first big breakup, I went to a party with my female best friend, let's call her G. And told her I did wrong to my gf, and that I got physical with my gf. She proceeded to DM my gf and ask her what happened, and she proceeded to tell her that I was manipulative, that I never cared or loved her, and a bunch of other crap.
* She didn't tell me that my female best friend ended our friendship with me until I saw that G was calling her a few weeks after the party I went to. I told her many of times that I was worried what happened with G and she never said anything. When she said she was going to a kickback with some friends, in reality, she was partying with G and trying to set her up with the friends of G's cheating and still current boyfriend.
* She lied and lied that she wasn't flirting with guys at the party and that a flirty guy grabbed her ass at the party, and even tried ending the relationship off on that point. Until days later she finally admitted she was flirting back with the guy too! And yet said she wasn't in the wrong because we were broken up, even though she said I was in the wrong because I had remade a Bumble account when we were broken up!
* She wanted me to block and delete contacts of everyone I had a smidge of attraction towards, even for people I just see as friends or acquaintances today. And yet I asked her to do the same then, going through the guys she had in her contacts and social media (she looked through my socials and contacts too btw) and kept saying that they were just friends and never found them interested. Even though from all the stories she told me about guys and her guy friends, she's told me she had crushes on them, but ""oh that was in the past.""
* During the middle of our relationship, she still had her bumble account and her Instagram handle in the bio. I told her basically that all these guys in her Instagram wanted to fuck her, besides the gay ones, and I was right. Especially since her ""guy friends"" from school were DMing her asking her out and she still kept guys on her socials that sent pics of their dicks. Even though she wouldn't want me to have girls on my social media sending me nudes. 

And of course, her family thinks I'm the only one in the wrong and my family thinks I did some wrong but that she's manipulative, controlling, and trapping me.

I also wanted to get the opinion of others if possible. Like, do all girls just block guys for whatever reason under the sun like how my gf wanted me to do with girls? Am I really at fault for not cleaning out all of the sexual-related scams in my junk folder? Am I hypocritical? Is she hypocritical? Is it okay to have friendships with your exes?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oatwq4/am_i_in_a_toxic_relationship/
72,oatxz9,1625046559,I am 31 years old and I have never had a girlfriend. I need advice.,"I am writing this post to seek advice, guidance, and emotional support on an obvious issue that I can longer ignore, which is that I am 31 years old and I have never had a girlfriend. I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told numerous times that I am a good-looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather Hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could very easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone.¬†

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown.¬†

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me.¬†

If I were a brown guy standing at 6'1"" and not 5'8"", I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life. I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man simply because of my small build.¬†

It is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth; however, I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happiness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oatxz9/i_am_31_years_old_and_i_have_never_had_a/

81,oaw953,1625055960,Staying hopeful,"After a string of bad dates, I met this guy and I thought it was great. We had similar taste in humour, we had so many shared interests. We had similar life goals, were at the same stage in life. He was cute, and it was so easy talking to him. We could easily talk for over 6 hours, and I wouldn‚Äôt feel tired at all. It was so easy being with him.

I also would like to think I have a lot of good attributes - I listen to people who say that you should work on yourself before looking for something more. And I did. I‚Äôm independent, take initiative, paid my half in dates, was polite, have a decent job, a solid circle of friends, relatively fit, complimented him, made time for him. I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm relatively attractive, have good style, and funny. I love looking after people, making sure that they‚Äôre comfortable. 

I thought this would finally be the end of a dry spell. But at the end of the day, he STILL wasn‚Äôt feeling it. 

After a while of lamenting, I can finally and confidently say - Fuck him. He never made me feel special, or let me know that he was thinking about me. He never noticed when I put extra effort into my outfits. He rarely texted first, and would take hours to reply back. He never checked up on me, or looked at my stories. I liked him so much I ignored all of this!!! I deserved sooo much better. 

He said he hated texting, and from the get-go, he was always pretty poor, but boy - if this is how he treats other girls, it‚Äôs a damn shame for him.

82,oawbsa,1625056231,"Subtle, light, playful touch is crucial in building attraction and reinforcing the idea that you are more than a platonic friend","During the first initial stages of dating and getting to know someone, it is important to establish that you are viewed in a romantic/sexual manner, not simply as a friend.

Sometimes, there will be a great conversation and personalities will gel, yet a spark of sexual tension fails to ignite, because the dynamic of the interaction skews more towards friendship.

A key component of ensuring that things progress in a manner that promotes a sexual tension and playfulness is touch.

This can be tricky, because if you are unsure of yourself, or become too eager and rushed, it will backfire and appear creepy or needy. You need to pay attention to how she is interacting with you, and the context of the situation.

For instance, if you immediately try to touch her hands as you sit down on your first date, it will appear desperate and unnatural. Or if she is displaying a low level of attraction or interest, it will likely repel her even further.

A good way to establish a natural, yet subtle touch is hugging when you initially greet each other. The initially hug is light anyway, never a full bear hug or embrace. If you place your hand LIGHTLY on the side of her hip or lower back as you hug, it will subtly reinforce that you are comfortable and confident being close to her without being a creep. Don‚Äôt make it a big deal.

As the night (nighttime dates are always better for first initial dates to establish a romantic dynamic) progresses, if you have good chemistry and have a playful vibe, continue with light hand touching. Authentically compliment her on her nails or jewelry, as you lightly put your hands under hers.

There a several other examples. If you are crossing the street, you can gently lead by placing your hand on her lower back. If things progress and the chemistry is there, hand holding, more intimate or playful hugging, and kissing. Paying attention to her body language and mannerisms are key. If she is maintaining eye contact, is talkative, or orienting her body in a manner to get closer, these are typical indicators that you are on the right path

The key is to be natural, light and subtle initially, and of course respectful. You also want her to feel comfortable and safe around you. If done correctly, along with a fun, flirtatious attitude, touch will help establish her perception of you as a potential romantic partner, not a buddy who is fun to talk to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oawbsa/subtle_light_playful_touch_is_crucial_in_building/
83,oawcbx,1625056286,Toxic partners and toxic advice.,"I'll never understand why some women (and men for that matter) like to openly preach toxic dating advice.
By toxic of course meaning, emotionally manipulating your partner, cheating on them, leaving them bankrupt, etc.

It seems like these types don't understand the concept of accountability and consequences.

You screw over the wrong person someday and that could end very badly for you. And it's so dangerous to preach out this toxic dating advice, or practice upon it without considering how it will inevitably backfire.

84,oawchq,1625056304,How to tell if a guy is playing hard to get or just not interested? *LONG TEXT*,"
**Background story**

I (21F) for a few weeks had been thinking if I should approach this cute barista (26M) at the cafe I go to. So last Saturday I finally did it, I slipped him a note that says

&gt; ‚ÄùHey cute guy from [cafe name], [my number] text me!‚Äù 

and then basically ran out of the cafe. He texted me later that night saying 

&gt; ‚ÄúHey, that was pretty cool, I would like to meet up some time, let me know when suits you‚Äù 

**The date**

And so we went on a coffee date yesterday, at another cafe, for about two hours.

We had a great conversation, found out we have a lot in common, lot of laughters and flirted quite a bit. About being approached he said he was very shocked, in a good way, bc it‚Äôs never happened before and he never thought I‚Äôd even notice him. So I assumed he‚Äôs interested, also bc of these two reasons

1. I chose to give him my number instead of asking for his number bc I wanted him to have a choice in case he‚Äôs not interested, but he did text. 

2. And on the date he asked for my name and said ‚ÄúYeah bc now you‚Äôre [cute girl from the cafe] on my phone‚Äù

I had to leave to work so we ended the date with a hug, he suggested that we watch the quarter final of Euro 2020 together on Friday night and of course I said yes.

**The problem**

1. He always takes quite long to reply to my messages, like often 12+ hours. But I try to think on the bright side, I understand that people aren‚Äôt glued to their phones 24/7 or maybe he‚Äôs just that busy. So I also try to reply after like 2 hours or so to avoid looking like I‚Äôm pushing too hard.

2. Last night after the date I texted him saying I had a great time and thanked him for the coffee, asked if it‚Äôs okay that I reserve a table for Friday night. But he said he will have to cancel bc he forgot that his friend already invited him over to watch the match together.

I know I‚Äôm probably overthinking, but it‚Äôs very confusing for me bc now I‚Äôm constantly doubting if he‚Äôs actually interested or is he just acting kind and friendly?

85,oawdbh,1625056386,My fwb ended things after I confessed my feelings for him,"
I had started a fwb with a guy friend of mine who was very chill and I felt comfortable with him. It was exciting for me, I‚Äôm very inexperienced with sex and I thought this would be great because I would be able to experiment with someone who understands what I‚Äôm comfortable or not comfortable with. And while we did try penetration once, (we didn‚Äôt get far, it hurt me) we did have a great time just doing foreplay and all that. But then I caught feelings I tried to hold them in for a while until I just confessed out of the blue thru text. he did take it well and says he treasure our friendship. But I asked if he wanted to continue the fwb and he said that while he‚Äôd want to, he just feels someone‚Äôs gonna get hurt and just cut it off. And to say I feel hurt is an understatement. I understand this was a possibility. But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling awful. He made me feel wanted and like I was someone who is sexually desirable. But now I just feel like‚Ä¶loser. I feel like and idiot and I feel so insecure now.

The date went really well, but straight after she disappeared completely and I was really worried. After about a month of not hearing for her I sent her a deep text message expressing my concerns and she eventually replies.

He reply basically said that she‚Äôs in a really dark place right now and her feelings for me made her scared. She‚Äôs hung up on her ex and because she started to feel something for me she panicked and thought the best solution was to cut off all ties to me in attempt to not hurt me. The lack of clarity hurt me more but at the end of the day I can‚Äôt really do much about it.

Anyway, she‚Äôs in a dark place right now and I don‚Äôt want her to withdraw herself because I‚Äôve been there and it‚Äôs a dark and lonely road. 

I remember when I was in a similar position to her and when i was in a really dark place she was a friend to me when I needed a friend the most. I wanna be able to help her the way she helped me.

She thinks that she‚Äôs being kind by isolating herself. She thinks I want more than just a friendship and she cannot reprobate those feelings so she‚Äôs even cut off our friendship.

I sent her a long message explaining to her how much of a good friend she‚Äôs been, how I don‚Äôt expect anything more than a friendship and how I‚Äôll always be there for her if she needs me, but i think it‚Äôs too late and our singular date has scared her off.
