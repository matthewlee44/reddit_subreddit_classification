Before he actually told me about his feelings i invited him to hangout with me but after he told me about “his feelings” I feel awkward and everytime  I think about potentially dating him i feel sick in my mouth, I really have no feelings for him and Im like why the hell did he have to tell me something like that?

I've been using dating sites on and off for about a year and am finding a pattern that I'm not quite sure how to handle.

I've clearly stated on my profile that I don't want children of my own in the future and I'm looking for a man aged between 30 and 45.

I am getting many men aged over 50 that are messaging me ANGRY that I don't want kids and that I want a man closer to my own age.

They message asking me why and then hurling abuse at me.

What is wrong with men these days that can't handle a woman knowing what she wants?

3,mmnj9i,1617871716,The questions unanswered,"At least once a week, a woman asks something along the lines of ""Do guys like when girls message firts""? or ""Do guys like it when they get a compliment?"" etc...  
So obviously the answer to all those is ""Yes, yes we do""  


Buy I'm wondering..always thought, why is that a question that puzzles women in the first place? its like asking ""Do you like it if you receive $1000 in cash?""  


only reason I can think of is, women dont actually like those things -getting the first message etc- and and they don't imagine any one would.  


Or, they receive so much of attention, emotional and physical reach out that the idea of being on the giving end for once is so foreign.

7,mmo72y,1617874856,Unfortunate circumstances &amp; timing. Feeling embarrassed &amp; annoyed at myself.,"Using a random username, for obvious reasons.
This might be a tad long so I'll try and keep it to the point.
On mobile so format...



I don't drive/ have a car at the moment because my test was cancelled twice because of covid, and they haven't started back yet, and there's no information about when it will - which is extremely frustrating.



Anyway, I matched with a girl on bumble about 2.5 weeks ago. She lives about 10 miles away. She's moved here from another country a few years ago. She loves seeing the sights and she drives.


I hadn't been on a first date in nearly 8 years, so I was a bit nervous. 

We met up for 2 dates and they went well, she said she enjoyed both and she agreed for a 3rd - the first date was her choice, it was nice. I was instantly attracted to her on the first date and moreso on the second. We texted a fair bit between dates too and it seemed to go well. I made her laugh a lot over text and on dates and there was some flirting too - though to be honest I probably could have done more in this department and I'm kicking myself now - I'll explain more below.


Second date was my choice - my country is still in lockdown, nothing open except essential business, shops, transport etc.

I wanted to be able to take her to somewhere she hasn't been before or even to take her out for dinner and maybe a drink but I couldn't because of lockdown. 


There's limited places I could meet her because she had already been to some of the places I thought about but also I don't drive so I couldn't take her to most and transport there and back would take forever - I didn't want to get her to pick me up and go somewhere - she mentioned when we first talked that me not driving wouldn't be a problem but she didn't want to be a personal driver so I wanted to show her the best I could that I'd take whatever transport I could to meet her and be independent that way.



Anyway, I feel like I couldn't be as flirty because we were just walking and talking but with covid and social distancing rules I didnt feel like I could be my flirty self and express myself physically, even though the conversation was flowing I was hesitant on the touchy aspect of flirting - sometimes she was giving me the eye to just kiss her but covid, man, just made me second guess whether I should have or not.


I had told her that me not being able to drive had annoyed me because I wanted to be able to take her somewhere different to where we are or I could have even drove to see her and went for a drive and a coffee or whatever at any time between the dates, instead of texting, which I think would have been more personal and would have allowed her to feel more comfortable and it may have felt a bit more intimate too.


Anyway, she went quiet/ ignoring me for a few days, only texting once a day or something - I knew something was up and feel like she met someone else instead. But I asked her if she was still interested in that 3rd date.


She told me last night she doesn't think so, she said she liked me and my company but she didn't feel a ""sparkle"" and didn't know whether she should keep looking for it with me and didn't want to give me false hope or waste my time.


I still don't entirely understand whether that was a cue for me to say ""sure 1 more date"" or just accept it as a loss and move on.


I can't stop thinking ""if my driving situation and covid wasn't a thing that this could have worked differently and could have been something special.""


I get it was only 2 dates but, we talked a lot about pretty much everything and something about her made me want to better myself.

I felt that sparkle that she said she didn't feel so I'm a little confused and sad about it all.


What do I do? What can I do? 


Fwiw:

I replied to her message last night saying I was disappointed to only find out her thoughts after the several days of silence but I'd kinda expected it due to her silence.

I did tell her I liked her and her company and told her I did feel that connection and thought there could have been something. I told her I enjoyed the time we spent and I appreciated her Sharing with me some of her personal stories and family memories, which I could tell at the time were difficult for her.


I told her I respected her for letting me know where I stood and hope that she finds this sparkle she's looking for.


Tldr: don't drive, covid- think it's messed a chance with a really great girl and I can't stopped thinking about what could have been.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmo72y/unfortunate_circumstances_timing_feeling/

10,mmoesw,1617875859,I think I have fear of being abandoned,"Hi, i am a 17 year old spanish guy and i have a problem with my now ex (excuse me if i have bad grammar).

For context we had been dating for a year when she started acting weird, she talked less, she didn't want to go anywhere and when i needed help with a problem or something she just didn't care at all (we used to talk a lot about the issues we had on our lifes and I was always ready to give her some advice or do anything I could to help her feel better) until one day she told me that she thought she needes some time alone, after a week or two she broke up with me, I honestly felt really bad but i still loved her so I tried to be supportive, and to be a good friend, I talked with her about what i was doing and tons of different stuff but she took hours, maybe days to respond and all her vocabulary turned into ok, oh or good, literally nothing else, i tried to go and talk to her when i saw her irl but she told me she didn't want to talk and a few months ago she vanished, blocked me on all social media, ignore me when she sees me irl and just ignore my existence, like I was never there, I felt really bad again and tried to reach her, ask her whats wrong but no respond.


After she broke up with me it took me some time to get rid of the feelings I had, but i still considered her an important part of my life and I didn't want her to just dissapear from one day to another. I'm angry at her, everytime she appears in my mind and i remeber all that happened i can't express it with words but its like an overwhealming feeling, it is too much and I just try to do something else and distract myself.

I'm not angry because she left me, I'm anoyed that after all the time we knew eachother she didn't care to just stop talking with me, she wasn't there when my parents started beating me up, she wasn't there when I started my music proyect on YouTube wich has been a dream of mine since i was a child and after all this time all she needed was to take a few seconds or her time to say hello, or watch the music i made, just 3 minutes of her life to listen to what i have been dreaming of since always, but it has been 6 months since we broke up, she didn't care about anything involving me, i was there every single time she needed help, even when I was dealing with bigger problems I just try to fixed myself from all the shit i had been dealing with so i could make her feel better every single day but in the end she just vanished, and all the kind words vanished too, i thought i was important for her too, i just needed some text, to ask me what i was doing or how's my day been, but the text didn't come, i know I wasn't the best but everytime I noticed i had made a mistake i did all i could to fix it and try to not do the same a second time, i try to be a bit better every single day.


Things are hard right now with the exams and college getting closer but I think I'm in love again, she is sweet, kind, and cares about my feelings, my hobbys, my music and my life, and i think about her tons, slowly the feelings of love are fixing the bad things that came with my last relationship but now i am so scared that the same might happen now, i didn't tell her my feelings yet because I'm terrified that she might disappear too, and I'm super nervous because she has been silent for two days now. 

I don't know why people treats others like they don't care about other human beings, i personally think that the most important thing in the world are the bonds we make with each other but what if I'm not enough? What if I'm not worthy for others? I have so many things in my mind and some help would be awesome to have, if you have read all of this the only thing i have to say is thank you kind stranger, i hope everything is going great in your life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmoesw/i_think_i_have_fear_of_being_abandoned/

So, one day we were having this conversation over text about our past bad relationship experiences, and we talked about what we both wanted in a relationship, we wanted the same things. So i decided to admit to her i had feelings for her, i eased into it and didn’t throw it all on at once, i just told her how i really think she’s special, and that i was beginning to develop feelings for her. She said she unfortunately isn’t ready for another relationship yet, (her last one ended around 5 months ago) so i kinda back peddled and said oh no me neither, i just felt like you deserved to know how i feel, i don’t expect anything from you, and she said that just for now she would like us to remain great friends, i gleefully agreed and laid off from things like that so i wouldn’t scare her away. Anyways we’ve still been talking over text pretty much like normal, but since i told her how i felt we haven’t hung out in person. We’ve made plans to 3 times, all 3 times she ended up flaking on me last minute. I played it cool like it was nothing and cried my eyes out. Anyways, what i would like to know is, have I No chance of a relationship? Have i ruined out friendship? Is she nervous, or just uninterested? Do i give up, or remain persistent? The last thing i want to do is push her away, and as much as i am burning with desire for her, i really am okay to remain friends as long as i don’t lose her I’m happy.

15,mmoupi,1617877784,What keeps you dating?," I think a lot of men erroneously assume that having someone will somehow provide them with all the things they feel they're missing in life. That somehow dating a woman is a solution to their problems and I have to say, it really isn't. I've personally been disavowed of the notion that spending my time with some random woman I met on the internet is going to better my life in any meaningful way. That isn't to say that I reject the idea of dating one so much as it's to say that it really wouldn't make that much of a difference.

I have family, friends, a career and a handle on bettering  my mental health. I have aspirations and I'm hoping I'll have a dog real soon. My question is what dating someone is really going to add to any of that? I enjoy my own company, I enjoy the freedom of being able to do what I want, go where I want and say what I want.

To redirect this to be a bit more general, I just have to wonder if other men have ever stopped to seriously ask themselves why they want girlfriends or if being single is really that much of a burden?

20,mmpk1e,1617880661,Am I being too needy? Or should I end it now?,"Long-term single mom here. I have my daughter full time, I recently (about ten days ago) met a single dad through a dating app. He’s handsome, makes me smile, we have great chemistry. He works full time but coincidentally when we met, he has had this week off. 
We’ve seen each other 4 times in person and talk on the phone every night, along with random phone calls during the day he will call me just to say hi and let me know what he’s up to. 
Outside of this, I don’t really hear from him. He doesn’t text regularly, I get it-we’re adults. Not everyone is a big texter so I’ve appreciated when he calls to check in. But 6,7,8 hours go by til I hear from him again. He’s social, more social than me because he doesn’t have his child full time where as I do. 

The thing is, I’ve dated one other person since my baby daddy and I split and this was last year. This guy treated me like an absolute queen. Bought me flowers, fixed things around my house, always wanted to be with me and hear from me. We didn’t work because he became a little too obsessive-like wanted me to move in with him and his two kids in months. At the time, I wasn’t ready for all that. 
But I’ve taken parts of that relationship and it made me realise how good I can be treated especially since I came from an abusive relationship (baby’s dad). 

When I’m physically with this current guy, I feel at ease. When he calls me and we talk, I feel at ease. But, when we’re not together I feel on edge. I don’t know if it’s my gut telling me to get out. I don’t know if I’m just not ready, although I 100% thought I was. I don’t know if I’m just being insane and don’t understand what it’s like to be seeing someone who isn’t thinking about me all day. I don’t hear from him but I see he’s active on Facebook, even if I’ve sent him a message just checking in to see how his day is he won’t reply for hours but will be online. 

I’ve been cheated on in the past. My child’s dad was emotionally and verbally abusive. So yes, I do have trust issues but I very seldom let them come to the surface. And I know from the other guy I dated, I do not lack trust if I’m given absolutely no reason to.

25,mmq4si,1617882923,Am I the only one who doesn't understand 'Hard to get?',"I (M23) hear all of these dumb ass rules about not texting back too fast, or seeming too free/having too much free time. There's also the old 'wait three days after you get their number' shit.

I just don't understand how someone not being interested in you is appealing. Like, if I see a text, I'm gonna reply. Sometimes I'm on my phone and it will be right away, sometimes I don't see it for 2 hours. My favorite conversations in OLD have been when we are messaging back in forth.

I'm not usually a talkative person, but if I like someone, I'm gonna try to talk to them. Almost nothing seems less appealing than a girl not reciprocating interest.

People say you seem to desperate if you respond too fast, yet expect someone to case after them. And when exactly does 'hard to get end,' when are you allowed to admit that you're interested. No one ever talks about that, just to act uninterested to seem more interesting, but sooner or later they will get sick of it.

I guess this was more of a rant than a question.

I've been in a relationship with this girl for a few years now and we've been through a lot together and I trust her when she says she loves me because she's proven it. I have no reason to doubt her, but I still get jealous of her when she talks to other people. I don't want to be the typical boyfriend and forbid her from having contact with other people, but I'm just worried. I'm a boy myself, and I can guess what the other guys are thinking, even though I don't look at any women other than my girlfriend. she is not even close to many boys, but only to me and her supposed boy ""best friend"" , who she has known for more than 10 years probably. I understand i can't get her to stop talking to him, but I'm just jealous, and I don't know what that's due to. maybe it's because of the insecurities I have and the fact that I literally don't talk to any girls except her and I expect her to do the same but when she doesn't I get jealous. She has told me that I have nothing to worry about, because she never is and will never look over him as  something more than a friend and I trust her, but at the same time when they spend time together, I'm jealous and I don't like it. I never told her what I think about it because I don't want to manipulate her, I don't want to ruin her friendships with others just because of my insecurities. My insecurities should be my problem, not hers, and I need to work on them for a better bright future. I also forgot to say that we're in a long distance relationship, which probably also has an impact on everything. Maybe I'm just jealous because I don't have the chance to spend time with her, but other people do. I don't know what to do, so I want an advice because I don't want to act like an asshole every time I'm jealous and just fight, because if we keep going like this, nothing good is going to happen, and I don't want to lose her. what am I supposed to do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmq9d9/my_jealousy/

So - I’ve been ‘dating’ this guy since February, we have been on 5 dates over the course of 2 months, slept together 3 times. We text most days, with 2 days silence in between here and there.
We are moving nice and slow. He has a daughter which he takes care of every second week - hence why we only catch up every 2 weeks or so.

Anyway - we were meant to spend a couple of days together over the Easter break (Sunday and Monday to be exact), but he texted me on Saturday morning saying he had a sore throat on Friday night and thinks he may be getting sick - but that he would let me know.
I check in on him later on Saturday, he says it’s developing into a viral cold - so we cancel our plans. I did other things (caught up with friends etc instead).

Last texts were on Monday saying he’s sick, I asked if he needed anything and he replied saying that he is sad he is not seeing me (but didn’t acknowledge my offer to help).

It’s now Thursday night. I haven’t heard from him. 

I see two options: 

1. Do I leave it and let him chase me? (traditional approach)

2. Do I reach out and see how he is? (compassionate approach)

I honestly am 50/50 between the two. What do you think, lovely people of reddit?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmqk9q/two_schools_of_thought_traditional_and/

&amp;#x200B;

as the title said, I want to know how to find your personal keeper. 

I´m not the guy who loves to make party that much and dancing all night long.

  
For me there is no reason, to go to a club, when you have a positive mindset and being happy without all this ""let´s go out for a night and then hating your life for the rest of the week"" mindset.

So IG I wouldn´t fit to a girl who makes party all night long, but as I noticed after tried to date a friend, I´m not able to be in a relationship with a girl how lays 24/7 on the couch, even if she is in shape, put have no power to do things. Instead of being play bowling, go for a walk etc. she had no power and were just laying on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl once in my holidays and we did activities in the hotel together, so I asked her at the volleyball if she would go out with me to a bar. She accept, but said everyone goes to bars and clubs. I know a place where you could see the whole city and the beach. So I went with her to this place and even if she were for me not miss Beautyqueen with 1M follower, she was the ""keeper"" the girl that I would never let her go if I could.

* There has now been some kind of belief that it is because of that “confidence” was what women found attractive when in actual fact that was just the charm, because of the looks, because the woman found him attractive.

* An ugly man, cannot “leak confidence” in the same way an attractive man can and be perceived in the same light. His looks are always going to be distracted from his confidence and he is always going to be judged on his looks no matter what.

I’m F20 and being a virgin is kind of frustrating at this point - I’ve learned to self-explore my sexuality (especially during quarantine), have toys and know tons of sexual health etc.

But I’m really scared of trying FWB or just fuckbuddy -arrangement for my first time without knowing how I react. I’ve dated guys, and some of them led to me attaching way too much and having my feelings hurt. I wouldn’t want to risk to experience the same thing again, after having sex for the first time. 

There’s a 50/50 chance I might react just like “eh, that was okay, but way overhyped” OR then basically attach to the guy due to hormones and stress whether he’ll text me later or not. 

I’ve made out with guys and it didn’t really leave any “attachment” to me, but it was purely physical in the moment, but sex is totally different, or is it? 

I guess I’m getting desperate at this point but I’ve heard many girls doing it just to get it out of the way and later regretting it.

38,mmsldt,1617890919,First Date Advice,"Female 21, male was (supposedly) 26.
So I was talking to a guy through text on a dating site- his texts seemed really eloquent and intelligent, and we even seemed to share a lot of the same niche interests and likes and dislikes. 

We had pretty good back and forth with questions to get to know each other, so I offered to exchange numbers so we could do a phone date. Well, first of all he sounds a bit younger than 26. And he would word vomit. His voice was erratic, fast and he was all over the place- kind of like a person on speed. He would ask me if I knew about vlad the impaler- when I said no, he proceeded to ramble about the mythology behind it and stuff- and about a unicorn that ate hearts, and how he thought werewolves ate hearts. 

He would ask my favourite kind of dog, and when I would respond he would jabber on about how huskies are his favourite because of their blue eyes, and how his uncle was retired military and had a British shepherd, etc. I tried making a light joke about how he sounded off/rambling to try to redirect and he said it was because he was nervous....then right back to it. 

Whenever I said something, he would respond with an emphatic “mmmhmm” and then ask me oh did you know....and went off again. I said like 10 one word answers during the conversation, I’d previously tried to joke about it to give a polite signal...he seems slow as well, when he asked what kind of medicine I was considering, (I want medical school) I told him family medicine and emergency medicine. He responds “family medicine, like....a family doctor?” I said yes, and he goes “emergency medicine...like working in the ER?” Like come on really? 

I made some excuse and hung up but that’s like the worst conversation I’ve ever had. He texted me after and said he really enjoyed talking to me, and had a good time. I kind of gave a vague answer that sounded like I liked it and went to bed. His texts after the phone conversation and today are the same- eloquent, thought out, intelligent. It’s like two different people- one adult and one teenager off the walls. He did say he had adhd and he’d been medicated for 10 years, which lead into a whole ramble about his childhood and such..I have adhd as well, but I definitely don’t speak like that. 

He sounded really immature and not like you would expect a 26 year old to hold a conversation. I thought first date conversations are supposed to be calm conversations with good give and take, asking questions like what do your parents do, etc. He did do this over text and he seemed very good and intelligent, but the phone conversation was like an unmedicated hyperactive kid rambling and a bored teacher giving one word, disinterested responses praying he would shut up. 

My mother thinks he could have just been really nervous, but at the same time she thinks such a drastic difference in his texts and speaking shouldn’t be ignored and it could be catfishing. I’m trying to decide between eventually doing another phone call to see if it’s more of the same or just cut it now- we’ve only been talking a week, so it’s no real loss to me either way.

43,mmtk2a,1617893691,Should I [32M] cut my losses here? (Post first date),"I matched on Hinge with a girl three weeks ago. Talked for a few days, suggested we meet up for a date. She disappeared for a week (saying later that she needed a break from online dating), but upon returning gave me her number and said she'd absolutely like to meet up. The next week she couldn't meet up as her sister was visiting from out of state. As such, we scheduled for the following week.

We met on Monday and got drinks. The date seemed to go pretty well. Our personalities clicked, we had easy conversation, and laughed. It lasted about three hours. We joked about some future plans early on in the date, but that's about it. It was mostly just getting to know one another. The four quarter of the date was a bit different. I felt it losing a bit of steam, for me just due to being tired on a Monday and the alcohol setting in a bit. She opened up more about her family, and did mention that she's been single since November and has been on some ""awful dates"". A bit of a red-flag for me given that she hasn't been single for a *terrible* amount of time after a LTR (I know that everyone is different).

The date ended late, and as such I didn't send her a text upon getting home (about 11:30pm). She didn't reach out either. The following afternoon on lunch I did send her a text thanking her for a fun night and dropped a subtle inside joke from our date about march madness. It was something like this:

**ME:** ""Thanks again X for a fun night. I hope you ended up showing your coworkers up in your fantasy bracket!""

**HER:** ""Thanks! I didn't end up winning anything but you can't win them all lol &lt;Shrug emoji&gt;

**ME:** ""I won $10 but my buy-in was $10 so... &lt;Smile with tear Emoji&gt;

My typical approach with post-date texting is to keep it brief anyway, wait a few days, then re-engage and look to schedule a second date. My vibe for whatever reason though is telling me she's just not that interested, otherwise she could have sent another text. Comparing her with past dates, if the date went well I'd typically have a text from the girl thanking me by the time I got home, then there'd be light texting, and I'd reach out a few days later for the second date. With her, I'm not feeling the same energy.

Is she playing hard to get or should I let her reach out to me?

**TL;DR**

Date on Monday that went well on paper (lasted three hours). We had good chemistry with lots of laughter/mutual interest in the other person. She's only been single for a few months after a LTR. I picked up the tab. I initiated the post-date texting the following day, but the convo fizzled with the ball in her court. 

Do you think I should leave this one alone and wait for her to get back to me? Or should I send a text tonight checking in and see if she's reciprocates? My gut is telling me she might be ghosting and hoping I get the clue based on her not texting me back, and I don't want to come across as needy so I can hold on to a bit of pride. She knows I am interested based on me following up with her, etc. I also ended the date saying ""let's do this again soon"".

Reading the book Models by Mark Manson (only halfway through buts is a book every guy who struggles with women should read, seems like a game changer for me) and had an eye opening experience reading it. He talks about how people know other’s intentions implicitly, and if you’re just talking to someone expecting their time, or sexual favours, or an ego boost from them, due to you own low confidence, instead of just to genuinely enjoy their company, they can tell, and it’s unattractive as shit.

I’m 23 and a virgin and I think I’ve been doing this all my life. Only talking to girls I like to desperately make them like me rather than just for the joy of knowing them. But for one brief moment in time I didn’t, almost got somewhere, and I didn’t even mean it. I was at a club and my friend was trying to force me to approach girls all night since he knows how bad I am with women. Pretty fucking drunk, and fed up of never getting anywhere, I followed his lead and done whatever he told me for do. After a couple of hours of this (with equally hilarious and cringe worthy results) the ‘tutoring’ ended when he ended up flirting hard with a girl he’d himself been talking to. I was standing a little away from them, drunk, lost in my thoughts, kind of wondering to myself how the fuck it was so easy for him and I just got kind of got laughed off by everyone, when her (very attractive) friend who was standing next to me struck up a conversation. I just started shooting the shit with her, joking around, thinking I’d be polite at least and just talk to her since we were both alone and our friends had left us. I had no more ‘game’ or whatever left in me and didn’t even think about this once as trying to get with her or whatever.

After about 15 minutes of this I realised we were getting along really fucking well. We were just laughing, joking around, and we went to grab a drink together. I made a comment pointing at our two friends about how they were halfway down each other’s throats within like 10 minutes and how they hadn’t wasted any time. She turned to look at them, I saw her brain working something out, and then she burst out laughing hard.

Turns out she wasn’t even with the girl my friend was talking to. She didn’t know her whatsoever. She was just a girl who had been standing near me, and struck up a conversation with me cause I was alone. In my drunken state I just assumed she was the other girl’s friend and started talking to me to be polite. Instantly my brain froze; holy fuck, a girl is talking to me just for the sake of talking to me! I think after that I must have got a million times more awkward and lost in my head, desperate for her approval, and I kind of watched her interest lower even though we were still joking around in the same way. I had switched in an instant from just talking to her for the fun of it, which made her interested in me, to trying to get her to like me, which put her off.

I always wondered about that night. I came back to it a lot, why in that one little moment some random girl actually seemed interested and went out her way to talk to me, and why it all of a sudden switched. And it’s cause I just tried to get to know her at first. I had no ulterior motive. It was my brain switching to that anxious, desperate for validation and completely unconfident side of me that put her off. And from now on this is how I’m gonna try approach all of my dating life in general; just wanting to talk to people for the sake of knowing them. That one little moment, and that girl I met for maybe half an hour, looking back with hindsight and some new knowledge, told me absolutely everything I needed to know about where I was going wrong with women. I was just too caught up in my head at the time to pick up on it. It’s kind of poetic to me in a way how I was there wondering that night what my problem was, and it’s like fate decided to smack me with a situation told me exactly what it was, and I just didn’t pick up on it until a long time later.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmtw7i/a_brief_encounter_with_a_girl_in_a_club_a_couple/

I feel like when I go on there, or even in other personal experience with friends who wanted to be more than friends I felt a little guilty because I had no physical attraction to them. I remember a distinct occasion where a friend who while he had a great personality, extremely funny, I just didn't have any physical attraction and it felt really awkward cause he kept flirting but I just respond to it because he had sent me photos of his face before and he had seen my own and I just held no physical attraction to him. I just end up swiping on dudes that I only find really attractive and also seem funny and charming. But I always see or in my own personal experience especially on grindr guys tend to seem to feel really let down when I don't respond, this might sound very vain of me but I can't have a relationship without a strong sexual desire. I tried that before with a man whom I did genuinely love, but I just couldn't imagine myself having any sort of sexual interaction with him which is a need of mine. Are my expectations to high?

49,mmuasq,1617895835,Strange behavoir of my ex-partner,"I just have a question. I was dating a guy for over 3 years. We had a major problem that we couldn't continue the relationship (religious problem) and couldn't overcome it! We did love each other so much but when this problem was being raised every single time, it was screwing all this love (we both didn't have any benefit from each other or even have sex - decided to have it after marriage). I was living in Denmark at that time, and he was living in Germany and we were travelling to each other every few months.

Anyway, after almost 3 years of knowing each other, we decided to end this relationship and become good friends. I stopped talking to him for almost 8 months and during that time he was trying to chat with me (in the first couple of month of break up). Until I found him sending me on my birthday good wishes so I replied and we started talking again. He was sometimes asking one of my family about me, during the time we were not in contact.

I talked with him again and the conversation was very cold, I sent him a postcard and a parcel and get only thanks from his side. And when I disappear again, for two weeks or a month he asks about me and sends my family!

My question is why he does contact me and care/ask about me and even send my family if I don't answer although when I answer him, he has a very cold conversation with me (very short replies, end calls fast, no priority in his daily life, etc)?

So just for some context. I was recently rejected twice by my coworker we are both in our early twenties. I must be honest, her initial rejection was very kind and mentioning another guy she’s interested in. I like a man appreciated her honesty but had some idea that she thought I wasn’t serious and attempted again which logically resulted her to reject me again this time quite aggressively and bringing her friends into the picture now. I took it personally and asked her for some space. I’ve been reflecting a lot lately and the whole thing really wasn’t her fault but she was trying to be kind and she didn’t even owe me that. I feel like sh** &amp; I haven’t seen her since I got her number. What do you women think her and her friends think of me now? I don’t want to approach her at work as I have a feeling she might be afraid of me or make a scene. Will it forever be awkward from now on? Also, if you women were in this situation what would you appreciate the guy (me in this situation) to do? I’m using this experience to improve myself and not mess up things for the next gem I meet in life lol (also never asking out a coworker again). I really appreciate you taking the time to read. 

TLDR: rejected by same coworker twice, took it personally and I think she’s been avoiding the same shifts as me due to fear",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmusnw/taking_rejection_personally_womens_perspective/

59,mmwzak,1617903307,Just stuff to consider before jumping into a serious relationship these days!!!,"Okay I have posted this reply in multiple forms and I truly believe this works.

For men and women.
1) work on yourself!! look deeply into your flaws and hang ups WE ALL HAVE THEM IT IS JUST THE STRONG ONES OF US FACE OUR DEMONS INSTEAD OF PUT THEM OFF WHICH KILL OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND HURT LOVED ONES LATER!! 

2) just be calm and collected and stable when around people. Treat them with understanding and empathy and love.

3) stop buying the drinks and gifts. I still have trouble with this one but it is sientific that women and men appreciate some level of individual independence in any relationship no matter what.

4) don’t go all in at 1st chance they have to want to be around you too you can’t force this no matter how nice you are there is a level at which you look desperate and that is a fatal flaw and pretty hard to turn around.

5) if you feel you have been friend zoned and don’t want that, you have 2 choices. 
A- Just distance yourself from the friendship and cut ties 
B - choose that this is not the person and you will have a good friend going forward. Keep in mind Friends don’t buy each other gifts very often these days.

6) There is an easy way to flirt but not go to far. And that is being understanding and empathetic to any issues a possible partner would show and then when a topic is brought up that you incorporate a form of flirting do it quickly and move to the next subject. Do not linger on flirting it becomes creepy.

7) always be clean cut and smell nice. Keep a clean house and bathroom and car. And by clean cut I mean dress nice. Tattoos are cool and I have a lot but I dress as if I can jump into an interview at any given moment. Aka business casual.



Above all else once you have faced your demons and can be the stable voice of reason 1 or 2 things happen they want to be around you more and that goes in the best way possible or 2 they show you they are just using you for a friendship and that is where you get to choose.

****For Women and Men****

If either men or women find a person who is wishy washy you do not want to be with them. 

Example = I have had a relationship where my ex would shut down and not talk about a subject that was tough. If I asked if something was wrong she would tell me she was fine yet stomp around the house like a person who was pissed. 
If I asked what is bothering her too many times, like 3 or more through out the day, she would get even more upset. I would ask what can I do to help and she would say ""I don't know"". I would tell her I am worried because I love you and I cant read your mind and I dont like seeing her upset or hurt. Yet she would not do anything to tell me what was wrong. 

I once asked her what she would like to do about our children's birthday and she could not help make the decision even though she is great mother. 

DO NOT DATE OR GIVE ANY EFFORT OR ENERGY TO THESE TYPES OF MEN AND WOMEN THEY HAVE MORE BAGGAGE THAN THEY WANT TO ADMIT AND WILL NEED TO WORK ON THEMSELFS BEFORE ANYTHING WILL WORK FOR THEM IN A RELATIONSHIP! This is also why I say independence is a thing in a relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmwzak/just_stuff_to_consider_before_jumping_into_a/

- He initiated contact everyday and we saw each other usually twice a week; met his friends, had him on social media etc 

- He was very emotionally reserved, and said it had to do with his culture and how he was raised. He alluded to some childhood trauma but never provides details. 

- They ENTIRE time we were together, he knew he was going to be out of the country for an indefinite amount of time but claimed it would only be for a month.  He neglected to tell me until two weeks before he left. 

- The night before he left he broke off our arrangement because he “wanted to have fun and be free..lol” yet essentially begged me to remain in contact and continue to date him when he got back while this convo was going down 

- I was extremely hurt, he kept trying to contact me and I blocked him. We didn’t speak for a month. 

- After putting the pieces together, I suspect he knew he’d be gone ALOT longer (due to covid and an immigration document that needed to be approved before he would be allowed back).... which he only recently revealed to me) 

- It’s been four months and he’s still out of country. I caved and unblocked him, we are in contact with eachother and speak daily. He often reminisces about the “good times” we shared, and has said/implied, he didn’t know how good he had it with me. 

- I miss him but have conflicting feelings. So combat my emotions and keep my expectations low, I’ve intentionally remained at arms reach/ made myself unavailable on the days I feel low and sad. He’s tried to call too. 

- He blows up my phone, reaches out to on different social media platforms, and indirectly asks about my response time by making statements such as “it’s been awhile” and will often ask where I am and what I’m doing 

- I’m Christian and he is Muslim, he said in his culture that being in a relationship implies you’re getting married ASAP. He said he isn’t ready to get married and is planning on getting “serious” next year when he turns 25. 

I’m so confused by this all. I genuinely am very into him, and I know he feels the same way.

So this is my story. I dated someone a couple of years ago and it was an emotionally abusive relationship and I got of it pretty hurt and drained. I didn't date anyone for years and didn't see anyone casually either and also turned down any guys that showed interest towards me. Recently I thought that it's enough and I should get out there and figure out what I want. Fast forward, I downloaded bumble and met a guy that I thought I had a good connection with, hooked up with him but he turned out to be an ass (he made rude remarks about my body after we got together and that shit I just can't tolerate). I was pretty bummed and then met another guy which I posted about a few days ago (he seems really busy, takes two business days to respond lol). 

The problem with me is that I get too emotionally involved in the process as in though I have a ridiculously busy job, I would still make time to respond to the other person. I get super hyped about what I'll wear blah blah blah and even kind of just think through conversations etc before meeting someone. It's probably cuz I'm really new to this. But the thing is that because I take one guy at a time, I think I get somewhat invested atleast more than I should be, which I've come to realize results in disappointments more often than not. But at the same time I don't have the mental capacity to be speaking to multiple guys at the same time.

79,mmzw9p,1617911344,"Date bailed on me last minute for today's date, unsure how to proceed","For context, we've been on two dates prior, which consisted of just hanging around and talking for 5+ hours. I felt both were very nice dates, and we hugged for the first time after the second.

So this starts from the beginning of last week. That Wednesday I asked her if she wanted to hang out that weekend. She said she'll let me know if she's free. If she is, then yes. Fast forward to Friday night, she's drinking (nothing I have a problem with lol). For the first two dates, she'd always tell me Friday night that she was free and down to hang out that weekend. 

Saturday noon comes around, I say ""I take it you're busy this weekend?"" she said yes, and that we can do something the following week, she'd make time during the week. I agreed.

Tuesday comes around, and I ask her what days work best. She said wednesday or thursday. I said thursday would work best. I suggested she come over and introduce me to superhero movies (she's really into super heroes). She seemed excited when she said yes. Today, Thursday comes around, and she seems busier than normal. Hadn't snapchatted me for a couple hours (not very normal), and mentions being tired from cramming work in. I believe her when she says this. I ask if we're still on for today, she says she should probably nap and try for time next week. I responded by saying that's understandable, ""lmk when you're free next week"". She just said she'll be free after next tuesday cuz that's when she has her final exam. 

Final info: She frequently starts convos about small stuff, which gives me the impression that she's at least somewhat interested. Has been this way since we started talking almost a month ago. Often replies very fast to my messages, as I do to her.

Wondering what I should do now. I want to ask again on tuesday (what we both said we'd do), but at the same time I fear she lost interest and doesn't want to let me down. Idk what to think

80,mmzx7l,1617911416,I think I might’ve been ghosted,"Hey all,

I (24M) met this girl (21F) while I was working at the gym (I’m a personal trainer) and in my attempts to sell this girl for training, I feel that we’ve really hit it off. She ended up not buying because her mother didn’t want to pay for it, and from then on we started talking more.

We’ve kept talking and and went out together. It was pretty fun. But last night we were talking on the phone. She’s very politically conservative. I don’t really mind honestly but I am not a political person myself. It became a tad difficult to converse because it was mostly about politics. Since I don’t particularly study it, i might’ve come across as ignorant to her. 

This morning I asked her to hang out this weekend but I haven’t heard from her, even though she usually responds quickly. Should I just move on and keep focusing on myself? I’m not really hurt or anything. I don’t feel a strong need to date or get a girlfriend because I enjoy being alone and bettering myself, But still. It’s fun to date but dates fall through for me pretty often so I just usually keep my expectations low.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmzx7l/i_think_i_mightve_been_ghosted/

86,mn0lqj,1617913325,"I really think I just met the man I feel is a ""One"" but he's moving far, far away very soon and I'm absolutely devastated. This feels really serious for me and I don't know what to do. How to deal?","30F, at this point in my life, I know what I want/don't want, and how rare it is to find someone who deeply, deeply feels like ""the One"" (I believe there are MANY possible Ones, but, that they are very uncommon to find. I've moved around a lot and dated men of all cultures and backgrounds and heights and ages and let me tell you, when I meet one who's a click, I just...know). 

And I know this sounds insane, but we only went on two dates. I can say that just within that time I absolutely deeply and surely felt that this guy was a keeper, I laughed more than I have in maybe a decade, talked more freely than I have in years, felt giddy and connected and we have a freakish amount of common interests. Felt like I was 18 again. He's even in the career field I've been wanting to switch to. I know he liked me back, he made it very obvious. We both are probably a bit socially awkward, and we've both moved around the world a lot in our lives.

On the first date (we met through Hinge), he told me he's trying to move to Alaska really soon. Me being me, I was just like OH WOW COOL! and it didn't sink in. Then the second date, he made it more clear that soon is in like...2 months. We had an amazing time that day, then when he dropped me off, there was that moment in the car where it just felt like, ""damn this is fast but ok a 'lean-in' is happening"". But, I pulled away, and just said I can't since he's leaving and I don't want to end up hurt in 2 months. Am I right to be irritated that he had an active Hinge account while having plans to leave soon? 

The next day, I texted him to see how he was feeling about things. I am NOT the kind of girl to fall fast, it's VERY rare for me to get giddy about men at all these days, and I am also NOT a clingy person, usually I'm very distant. But since there's a time limit, I needed to know. I basically told him I really like him, really want to keep seeing him, but that I've gone through too many painful goodbye's in life and just can't handle another one soon. I also said I'm a very open person and really could consider moving anywhere (I didn't say to Alaska, but I let that hang...). **Should note that he doesn't think he's going to spend forever in Alaska, I would think only like 2 years max?? Then I guess he doesn't know where to. I'm also in a boat right now where I don't exactly have a place I call my home.

He expressed that he felt sad that he's on the edge of moving and that we met now, and said he's also had some hard good-byes that happened because of either him or another her moving. And he said something like ""You're really kind and you deserve someone amazing, blah blah blah,"" which honestly kind of hurt.

I feel I *found* someone amazing and I absolutely can't stop thinking of him. I felt like throwing up the whole next day, just thinking that fuck, this is so rare to meet someone like this, why do things have to be so shitty? But, his answer tells me that either:

A. He's not THAT into me, not enough to want to keep meeting and somehow consider a relationship past when he moves to Alaska. I really do feel like he liked me though. 
B. He was unavailable from the start and just, wants to move to Alaska and not have baggage (kinda like A I guess).

It was left at that, just a hard text convo with no solution and we mutually decided to not see each other again since he's leaving soon and we don't want things to be painful. 

I just am dying inside to somehow see him again and I haven't felt this way about anyone in a decade. My insides just hurt. I can't stop thinking about him, about how naturally we clicked. And at 30, I'm scared about this not happening for another 10 years now, and I feel I couldn't meet up with someone else for a while after this. I'm also a person who believes a home is found in others, not in a geographic place, so hell, idk, I've spontaneously moved places before and have dreamed about Alaska for a while as well and part of me is like...would I consider that?

I don't know if there's answers, but it would just...help to hear from others. Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn0lqj/i_really_think_i_just_met_the_man_i_feel_is_a_one/

I am doing this currently. This is because I had people finding personal information about me. I do have a unique name in the country I live in, which apparently made it easy to find me. This resulted in people finding personal information, like where I work for example. Since then I started going by another name online till I was comfortable enough to share my own name. 

Because of all this I am using this nickname/fake name on Tinder. I am verified and of course I put my own pics and age.

I progressed things, kissed her, and slept with her, only slept by her side.

She mentions her ex while laid next to her, the nasty comments he used too make to her, about her body.

Give her some reassurance and hinted it would be nice to wake up next to her, again, someday.

She took me to my exs a few weeks ago to collect my stuff, she mentioned in passing if I were to get rid of my 'bits of fluff' and fancied commitment, to let her know..

Last weekend, she came out with a story that she invited a guy round, she passed out on the floor, and werent fully confident she wasnt drugged. She ended up in bed with him, however, they still talk. I lightly touched on if it were for attention.. due to them still talking. However, on visiting an extra toothbrush has appeared at hers..

I left it there, no questions about the toothbrush. Out of the blue she accused me of jealously, which I denied, and replied with, I just thought you had more self respect, shes adamant, they're staying friends and have ""aired it out""

My mindset is now to avoid, but I want to let her down gently even as friends, feel like I'm picking up the pieces after her, she's becoming too overbearing not letting me input into conversation, the text monologue is a running commentary rather than a conversation, my last visit to hers, I clocked over an hour without inputting more than 3 sentences, of her endlessly telling me stories.

96,mn1jw6,1617916034,Is there a chance that my ex (18M) will come back to me?(18F),"My boyfriend and I (both 18) had been fighting for a little over 2 days. It started because I called him selfish and immature because he was not following the rules and regulations associated with COVID-19 (he was inviting his friend over to hang out while my boyfriend's sister was developing flu-like symptoms). Things got heated very quickly, and he told me to not talk down to him. Insults got more severe and eventually told him that my love for him was decreasing. He was obviously hurt and didn't respond for a couple hours. I decided to text him and asked if he could call so I could formally apologize. He simply replies with ""Nah, I'm eating dinner"". I told him that it was important to work out things like this before they escalate, and to call me when he was free. Five minutes later, he calls me and tells me ""You have five minutes."" I apologize for what I said, and he says that what I said was absolutely horrible. I start to tear up a little bit because I felt a lot of remorse for what I said, and he says ""I've got to go now, bye."" and hangs up on me while I'm crying. He doesn't talk to me for the rest of the night.

The next morning, he asks to FaceTime. I tell him I'm doing homework and will be available in an hour. After I finish, I call him and I explain how it hurt that he hung up on me while I was crying. He told me ""I shouldn't have to stay on the line when you're crying over something that you brought upon yourself. On top of that, I had my friend and family waiting for me."" I told him that I felt like I wasn't a priority, and he says that I'm wrong. We end the call, but continue to text throughout the hour. I also bring up the fact that it hurt how cold he was being on text with the whole ""Nah, I'm eating dinner."" He proceeds to call me insane and doesn't talk to me for a couple hours. During that time, I had a fight with my parents, and it was quite a bad one. I told my boyfriend about it and he said ""I'm so sorry baby, is your friend available? I'm going to the hot tub."" and he left me for half an hour. When he came back, I told him that it hurt that he would leave me when I was upset and needed him, and he told me that he couldn't be there for me 24/7 to talk to, and that his friend was there. We proceeded to argue, and I exaggerated, saying ""What would you do if something bad had happened to me in the time that you were gone?"" (i admit, not the best thing to say on my part). He says that that was the worst thing I could ever say to him, and he ignored me for the rest of the night.

Meanwhile, I decide to check up on his sister (13), because we have a good relationship and she wasn't feeling well. She asked me if there was anything going on with me and her brother and I explained to her our fight. She consoles me and tells me that he loves me and will come around. We then start exchanging funny pictures of him to lighten the mood. I sent a picture of him smiling, with the caption saying ""You turn me on baby, I can't wait to see you again!"". She laughed at it and I didn't think anything of it.

The next morning, I get no response from my boyfriend for the entire day. Eventually, I send him a text saying that his silence was speaking volumes. He tells me that he will call me when he gets the chance, and doesn't answer after that. Fast forward a couple hours and he calls me. He is livid, and tells me that his sister told him that we were talking about our fight, and that I had allegedly sent her ""intimate photos of himself"", which was not true. I tried to explain that she was exaggerating, but he said that he didn't think that his sister had any reason to lie about this. He was quite pissed off, and said that he needed a few days to think over things. He then ends the call. Two minutes later, he calls back and tells me that he will save me the pain and decides that it's best that we break up. He said that what I did was unforgivable and that he could never look at me the same way. I try to tell him that everyone was stressing out in this situation, and that we should come back to this when we were more level-headed. He tells me that nothing I do or say is going to change his mind. He says goodbye and hangs up, and I haven't heard from him since.

Obviously I am quite hurt from the situation. I felt like this was a minor issue that could have been solved had we taken a couple days to clear our heads and take our time to listen to each other's concerns. His sister has since blocked me from all social media, however he has not. I really love him, and he had constantly told me every single day that he loved me, and that there was nothing that we couldn't work through because he would have nothing if we broke up. He would say every day that I was his most favourite person in the entire world. He has also not deleted his profile picture, which is a picture of the both of us hugging.

It hurts so much to think back on all of our memories, because I still love him and feel like this could have been resolved. Last night, at 2 in the morning he texted me letting me know that his sister took a COVID test and tested negative. I have yet to respond. Is there still a sliver of hope that things can still be changed? He is a relatively stubborn person when it comes to his opinions and arguments, but in my heart, I felt like he really loved me throughout our relationship and I feel like if someone were to really love someone, they would try their best to fix the situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn1jw6/is_there_a_chance_that_my_ex_18m_will_come_back/
