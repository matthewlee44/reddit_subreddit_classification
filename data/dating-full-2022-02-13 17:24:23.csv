So the main question I have is, how can I, a 21 year old male who has just gotten into adulthood, date and maybe build a relationship with a woman. I want to know if I’m searching in the wrong places, or if maybe it’s not an appropriate time for me to date, or if maybe I shouldnt even think of dating and maybe let nature run its course.

So, I’ve just turned 21, graduated and started working full time recently. During weekdays, I basically go to work, get home, go train (I’m passionate about my training, I train tuesday, thursday, saturday and sunday, if it makes a difference), come home, meal prep for the following day and get to sleep (I’m dedicated to getting ~7 hours of sleep everyday due to functioning well at work since Im new and more importantly for recovery purposes for my training). By the time I’m done meal prepping, it’s already 930/10pm and I have to wake up at 6am. 

In today’s era, or more specifically in my age group/generation, people tend to use social media, dating apps, chatting, etc... to find people to date. I used to do the same back in my school days, and i was successful in getting to meet new people. Not saying this narcissistically, but I’m 6’2, fit and I get compliments on my looks quite often, so looks is not the issue here. But nowadays, I just can’t get myself to go on social media apps like tinder, or sliding into a woman’s DMs on Instagram just to meet her. Everything seems to be based around that. Apart from the fact that I don’t have much time to use my phone during weekdays, it all just seems pointless and superificial. But okay, let’s say that I do put in the effort and manage to fit in time for texting, at what time do I get to meet them. Sometimes I ask myself, maybe I dont need to text that much and things would be fine in meeting just on the weekends, but I’m not sure if that’s the case in today’s day and age when almost everyone’s always looking at their phone chatting and posting stories outside everyday, unlike me. Or sometimes I ask myself maybe I need to approach slightly older women who may be not so much invested in social media and have a similar routine to me, unlike most of the people my age, I have no clue, that is why I’m writing here.

Another factor that I think is an obstacle is the system of the country I live in. In my country, people tend to live with their parents until their late 20s, then move in with their partner when they can afford it (property here is super expensive). Then I see other countries where it’s normal for people to move out (maybe college dorms, etc...) early and live alone / with a roomate. If that was the case here, I think it would be easier to do stuff with people I’m dating during weekdays, such as cooking dates at the appartment, etc...

A bit about my past, I’ve only had one short (and toxic) relationship when I was 19, and other flings during my teenage years, but not too many serious bonds. I don’t go out clubbing/partying anymore, mainly for three reasons. 1) I don’t want to drink/use substances, been there, done that. 2) I only have 2/3 close friends that don’t go to clubs/parties either. 3) It’s not as enjoyable to me anymore. (Which I think is another factor to not getting real life exposure to women, but I dont really want the every weekend clubbing girl either)

I used to be able to meet girls at college, college events, etc... but as soon as adulthood/worklife struck, I feel clueless.

By no means am I trying to rush and just find someone to be my girlfriend, but at this point I can’t see the end of it.

Am I missing the point, am I looking at the wrong places? Honestly, I have no clue, which is why I decided to write here. I’m sure I may have missed a few things, so if maybe you want to know something that I havent mentioned, just ask me in the comments and I’ll reply.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158756,public,self,How can I date as a 21 year old guy in 2022?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sro9pl/how_can_i_date_as_a_21_year_old_guy_in_2022/,no_ads,0,,,

My Mother has been in a long distance relationship (LDR) for roughly 13-15 years. Throughout the entirety of the relationship, he's always claimed he's going to come see her, but of course never does. He's manipulated her out of thousands of dollars in gifts and money. (At least 20k-50k) He's supposed to be an executive chef or caterer &amp; claims to be some multi millionaire, but can't seem to stop asking her to send money for their 'savings for trips when they're together' etc..

Even with the many times she's offered to go see him, he'll go off grid and then come back, claiming that 'God told him to, or God came to him in a dream and told him that it isn't the right time or a family member will mysteriously end up in the hospital or something etc.' (My Mom is hyper religious, so it seems as if it's just another manipulation tactic. I've also found him on Facebook, tried calling police in other states to get information, ANYTHING I can to even verify that he is who he says he is. 

I myself have had such a rough time dealing with it, because I grew up in a single parent household and for years I watched her struggle while he claims he can help, but never did and never does. For years he's done nothing but try and control the relationship dynamic I've had with my Mom since I was a child. It has done nothing but make me have a disdain for most interactions with her, I can hardly have a good conversation with her &amp; I feel like all of the years we could have bonded as Mother and Son were wasted.

I've lost YEARS trying to get her to see straight and realize that this isn't the person for her. Our extended family doesn't even know that she's still talking to him and they suggested she break it off, 10+ years ago.. I understand the sunken cost fallacy, but when is enough enough? 

Basically.. I just want to know.. Is it even worth trying to 'help' anymore? I've tried for years, done nothing but be effected by the situation in a negative way. Do I cut her out of my life?

I have so much to tell her about how I feel. Do I send it or is there any other way out of it?
I do want to be with her.

We had a bad break up in the past, but in the end it was mutual.

So here goes the letter:


*So, I have a few questions and concerns.
This all might seem very exhausting and repeating to you. But each time I'm hanged by a thread and not actually told anything.

We've been together for 2 years. We've been in a 'relationship', meaning 50-50. It crushes me everytime I have to do your 50 too. All I have ever wanted is for you to be involved in this.

I have requested, I have asked, I have demanded. But recieved nothing. I'm tired of asking anymore. I have started to come to terms with your behaviour and started to accept you as what I can see of you. But I can't help but ask myself whether your behaviour towards our relationship and me has something to do with me, if I'm not worthy enough, if someone else was in my place, would you act different? would you be more involved? would you actually care more? This brings me to the question.
Do you feel any pressure or obligation to be in a relationship with me, given our past? or you really want to be with me, genuinely?

It physically pains me to even think about a scenario where you might be taking me for granted. 

We have a relationship. Its not romantic by any means, not from your end atleast. Romance is a two way street. What we have is platonic from your end. No matter how hard I try to steer our relationship towards being romantic, I feel its not being reciprocated, at all. You have hardly done anything to open up and let me in. It is difficult, I know but if you don't give me a chance atleast, what am I doing here and what for?

If you say you want a friend in me, you do. But if you ask me, I've tried it, sounds good, doesn't work.

Prior to our relationship, I was single and hoped for getting together with you. I had certainty, thinking freely. Life hasn't changed much, It still feels like I'm the same single guy except for birthdays or some important days where I get texts from you which has a teensy bit of your soul which actually feels something for me.

Even after two years I have not been able to figure out your love languages. You have done sooo little to help me out. Why?

When we we're kids, I liked you so much, I even do now and probably will continue to do so. But as we grow, our expectations change. I remember telling you that I am entering into this relationship with zero expectations, because at that time I only had my unaddressed trauma of us with me, I didn't want to feel heartbroken again I guess. But two years is a lot of time and I grew some expectations in our relationship, with you and with us. 

I wanted and still want to feel loved. Currently I don't feel it, just a friendly chat on a daily basis. But I'm scared to carry expectations with you and even more scared to even bring those up, because of fear of getting ignored or forgotten.

You used to tell me to communicate in the beginning, even ecouraged me to do it,  now when I'm trying, why have you stopped doing it? Why can't you open your heart up to me? Do I make you feel so uncomfortable, suffocated and unloved?

I have admitted my love to you time and again. I have never expected you to give a repsonse in return. Because those are my feelings. You are entitled to yours and no one can force it. I choose to do whatever I want with them. Until and unless you shoo me away, I don't plan to stop. I chose to let those out to you and only you. 

But do you have any idea how much it hurts me when you say that you're too broken to love someone and don't actually talk me through it and I haven't been able to help you with it. It pains me to think that I might not be as important to you as you are to me, makes me feel insufficient and who might never get loved by you, ever. I know I cannot demand that out of you, not my place, but still .

Tell me, is it wrong for me expect the same kind of love in return that I give to you?

We stay apart, we can do very little about it. But when you say you don't like to chat anymore, when it's the only way of communication left to us, I just don't get it. Though it's better now, but still.

Why can't I speak with you more often? why do I have to wait weeks and months to talk to you that too for a few minutes? Is this really okay with you? Do I need to get used to this arrangement?

 In the last two years, I can literally count the voice calls we've had on my fingers. How is that okay?  Why can't I get a heartful of you voice? How difficult might it be to find time have a phone call? 

I've asked for you try and have video calls. Ignored. Why is that? 

I don't want to be scared of you, your thoughts, your behaviour not knowing when you might freak out, panick.

I don't bring up the past, it may make you uncomfortable. I can't talk about what I think of us for the future, it'll scare you out. I can't be overly romantic it'll freak you out. What do I do then?

You ask me to be normal. Even I want to, but I don't know what you definition of normal is. I do what I feel is normal.

 I don't want to constantly feel like walking on eggshells and talking to a wall, with little to now response. I don't get a feedback whatsoever. How do you suggest I not feeling like this?

In the past two years, I've grown more fond of you, have loved you more than I ever did and more than I could ever tell you. If you just opened up to me more, I could love you more. You are the one aspect my life that I'm absolutely sure and certain about. 

But thing is I don't know where I stand in your world. I've never been told.

Bottom line is, I don't think I'm getting enough out of our relationship, making it very skewed and the major problem is I have to ask for things which should have been natural in the first place. When I have to ask, I'm in a way forcing you to do something which is not your nature and out of your comfort zone. I want you to be comfortable and at peace, with me.

In conclusion: I want more. I don't think I'm being unreasonable. I can't hope that someday magically some switch in you will flip and you'll suddenly change.

I'm doing this, venting all out to just let you know how I feel. You may think I'm still holding on to the past issues. Fine by me, we address them, we move ahead.

Second question: how could a guy create this initial emotion?

Background:
I am a guy in my 30s, single and didn't have much dates or relationships. I have troubles to understand why: I am not a model, probably quite an average look, but otherwise I have the feeling I am pretty good and shouldn't struggle so much to find someone: I studied, have a very good job, friends (guys and girls), I do sports and activities, traveled and go out (unfortunately much less since covid).

Most of my life have been a love/sex desert but everytime I found a girlfriend, the relationship goes well and she was not understanding that I was single most of my life!

When I look on the advices here, they are pretty basic (shower, dress well, take care of yourself, have a job, go out, ask women out) or won't help me on the short term (work out)

Only one friend had a very strong opinion about why it is that hard for me: she said I would be a perfectly reasonable choice for many women looking for a relationship... but I lack something which would make a woman emotionally invested in me at first.

She said that reason plays a very little part of the choice when someone chooses a partner (I am more reasonable than most people), and even less for women nowadays (women are more independent and safe and they have more choices). For her, online dating is, for example, just about emotion.

As my friend said, I am not sexy, adventurous, ""threatening"", mastering a popular skill, a charismatic leader... some people find me funny but I just once dated a girl because she found me funny.

I'm a 27M living in a large metropolitan city. I met this guy about a year or two ago and we hit it off as good friends. I've since introduced him to my friend group and he's fit in with everyone splendidly.

There's a girl who I've known for several years who I've liked. Her and I have talked about this, and she doesn't feel the same way which I respect and acknowledge. We used to be really close but we've become a lot more distant. The only time I really ever see her is at inter-friend events or when she comes to these parties that I throw.

Recently, my friend has started dating this girl--they met at one of these such parties. I'm happy for them and they seem really happy. However, I've noticed I feel a little uncomfortable around them. It's especially difficult when I'm a third or fifth wheel. I don't want to feel this way as I would love to maintain a friendship with them both, but I can't just push my emotions down into a pit and expect said emotions to go away if that makes sense. It's even more complicated by the fact that the two of them are so intertwined with my friend group now... any time I go and hang out at some event, chances are they'll be there as well.

So, I'm 26F, living in a foreign country for almost 2 years now and single for almost 5 years. During the first months I didn't want to meet anyone new due to Covid-19 and stuff, and I was still adapting to the new place and all.

Cut to a few months later when I decided to try... At first I used Facebook Dating, I meet someone but didn't click (I was the one searching for topics for our conversations and he thought that talking about trips and shopping would wow me...) then went to Bumble and I had several matches but either they stopped responding or just didn't respond at all. The few with which I matched, we went on dates but we wanted different things or had different views of a relationship. 

Decided to take a break and try meeting people in person, but I'm awful at that (I'm shy, anxious, specially around new people). So in December I decided to try again and this time it was worst!! Several matches but no conversations even when I made all the effort! So last weekend I decided that if nothing changed within the week, I'd close my account. So today I did. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, I just want to know how people meet other people 😅 I know it seems foolish but sometimes I think that when I was in my teenage years it was way easy!

He asked if I wanted to chat more in his car after the date while my car warmed up. I said yes, and while I was in his car he kissed me which I was ok with.

I was ok with it until he was shoving his tongue down my throat and trying to shove his hand down my pants. He stopped when I told him to , however I was still disgusted that a guy “looking for a serious relationship” was doing this on a second date and in front of a shopping mall where there were families.

Yesterday she went out to the bar until 2 with her friend. The week previous she went on for about thirty minutes over boy drama she had when she was younger, which was fine but I don’t think any guy likes to hear about past people she wanted to sleep with. I don’t have nervous thoughts or insecurities but this all just seems like too much. I try to be respectful and not talk too much about other people or put her in uncomfortable positions. Maybe it’s more a fact of being incompatible since I don’t like going out with random people drinking and she thinks that’s fun.

We didn't talk about work before meeting up. I found out he works for a call center, while I'm a corporate executive. I didn't say this out loud, but I realized I make at least 4x as much as him. 

I realize this is all going to sound like a humblebrag but here we go... I really don't mind being the breadwinner in a relationship, I already did that with my past relationship and never felt resentful. Honestly I'd love to find a man who wanted to be a stay-at-home-dad. I grew up super poor and I'm most comfortable with other people of the same background. I generally live pretty frugally but splurge on experiences. And I like to spoil my loved ones. Gift-giving and quality time are my love languages. 

He insisted on paying for the first date, which came out to about $40 all in, but I could see some stress on his face when the bill came. 

So for the second date I asked him if I could treat him, in the name of gender equality, and he agreed. 

He also asked me a couple questions about my car and where I live, and I tried to be low-key. He has seen my car now, but not my house. I'm pretty sure he realized that I have more money but I doubt he realizes how wide the gap is. 

**So my question here is,** is it better to broach this topic and get it out into the air? Or just to pretend I haven't noticed the disparity? When it's ""his turn"" to pay should I specifically suggest activities I privately know are low-cost/free without talking about the costs (like ""I really want to go to this art museum"" and I know it's free; or ""Honestly I'd love if you cooked for me at home"")? 

I just don't want him to feel emasculated or inadequate. I'm fine paying for the majority of the dates and especially anything boujee I want to do, I don't want him to be stressed about the finances of dating, but not sure how to say that without sounding condescending.

Hi all,

So I have recently been seeing this guy for the past month. We are both 25. He's the first guy I've really liked in 3 years that isn't just physical. We've gone out on 3 dates and he invited me over to his.

We are always super giggly and talkative in person, so it seems in that way he might like me. However, on our second date he did tell me he's not looking for a relationship at this moment(getting over an ex) , so i mentally pulled back and then later that night he kissed me and told me he thinks I'm very cool.

I am holding out on sex for a few more days cuz I'm treating PID.

I gave him head when I went over to his that he said 'was up there' as in good. (just for context)

He's the one who initiated most of the communication in the beginning, he'd text a couple of times a day and we used to have really interesting conversations.

Nowadays, it's kind of him sending me a vn once a day, and I've noticed that it's been hard for me to match his energy in terms of not saying too much. We(He) keep shifting the day /and are supposed to meet up at his on Tuesday. Maybe this could be a reaction after I told him that I need to wait a little before I can have sex with penetration. Everything else was wow apparently.

I guess I'm just lonely and intellectually we are a match, which is so hard for me to find.

Last night I was at his place and he asked me if we could be dating exclusively, which I thought we were anyway but it was nice that he asked me directly. I asked him what that exactly meant to him and he said that he wants to date and to, if all goes well, end up being in a relationship (by boyfriend and girlfriend standards) but he wants to take things slow as to not rush into things and make any mistakes.

So I met this girl and we’re both in our last semester of college (21). We’ve been dating for about 2-3 weeks now and it has been going amazing. We’ve both become so attached to one another and hanging out every few days…sleeping over, getting brunch. And our chemistry and communication is simply amazing. 

But she told me the other day that she might be moving to a different city post-grad. She isn’t 100% sure, but there is a chance. It hurt us both when she told me this and we just held each other - upset and anxious at even the thought of this ending.

I totally understand where she's coming from, but this really stings me after we've spent 2 months getting to know each other and spending lots of time together. We had so much in common and had incredible physical and emotional chemistry. I found out from her not long after we first met that her boyfriend died unexpectedly in a boating accident about 8 months ago. They had dated for 3 years and were talking about getting married when he was killed. She told me that she missed him deeply and was traumatized from his death, but was ready to start again, and as we got deeper into our relationship I definitely saw her as a long-term partner. 

This morning, however, she sent me a text right after we spent all day yesterday hanging out at the beach, having a great day together. She told me that I didn't do anything wrong and I'm an amazing guy who she would definitely want to keep dating, but that she isn't over her boyfriend's death and doesn't want to hurt me by continuing to date me when she isn't over him. I was devastated to hear this, but not totally surprised given how strong their relationship was and how they were on the path to getting married when he was killed. I told her that I respected her choice and hoped the best for her in the future, and that I would always be available if she wanted to talk. I'm still very sad that the past 2 months has led to this, and wish that there was a way for us to keep dating, but I realize that all I can do is move on and not get hung up on what could have been.

I could use some encouragement or something right now, because I feel like the wind's been knocked out of my chest. I have aspergers syndrome and dating is a huge challenge for me, but she was accepting of my differences and I didn't feel like I had to put on a ""mask"" so to speak when I was with her.

Before the pandemic started, I always went with this girl on chemistry projects, just because we were the only two left alone. Back then I was very cold and closed, so we didn't form an eternal friendship or something like that. we only got together exclusively for those jobs. now we return to normal classes, and on 02/02 (my birthday) we stayed talking for 2 whole hours because the teachers were busy. It was a very nice talk, I enjoyed it and it was a good change of scenery, because I always talk with my group. I kept thinking about her for a bit, and without realizing it, I spent the whole week with my heart racing, looking for an opportunity to get close to her without seeming weird. a few days later, she came up to me just to say goodbye. It was short, but cute. and last Monday, she approached me saying that she was alone. I invited her to talk to me and my friends. We had another good chat for about 10 minutes, her parents came for her and she gave me a hug before leaving. shortly after she came back because she made a mistake, we chatted a little more and this time I had to go. I hugged her again for a little longer

now the hints i mentioned 

1) She asked me what I was going to do on Valentine's Day, and then she said out loud and half jokingly that she has a week to get a boyfriend

 2) She told me that she was trying to be my friend in chemistry sessions, and that it hurt her that I was so cold. obviously I already apologized and explained what was happening to me, but she keeps joking about it (no bad intentions)

 3) when she came to say goodbye, it was just for me. completely ignoring my friends. even they noticed that it was something strange 

4) On Monday she told me that I had to congratulate her on Valentine's Day, for our ""friendship"". I am not an expert, but it is suspicious that someone asks you for congratulations on friendship when that day is mostly for lovers

 5) We've been making a lot of eye contact, and I've noticed her looking at me in some classes. Even when we speak, we both fall silent only to look each other directly in the eye.

6) When she came to talk to me on Monday, I invited her to talk to the whole group, but she said ""only with you. only with you I feel comfortable""

I plan to give her some chocolates on Valentine's Day, and tell her that I want to know her better.

So I (31M) met someone (29F) on hinge back in mid January. After talking for a couple weeks we went out, and have since had 3 dates each a week apart. All went great and we plan on seeing each other again. Only kissed, no sex yet if that's relevant.

I hadn't really brought up Valentine's day since we both have busy schedules due to work and school. I happen to have Tuesday free, which we talked about but she's busy which I expected. Most likely I won't see her again until Friday or Saturday, but we do text every day.

Here it goes-
I met this guy about 7 months ago, he was from out of town, visiting for the weekend. We hit it off really well, slept on the first and only date we had, and we were both surprised by how easy it felt to be with each other. Oh and also, I was planning to move to his town before I had met him, I was in the process of switching jobs. I told him that on the date, just for the sake of conversation. 
After he left, I didn’t think much about it, it was just a hookup in the end. But he pursued me, we kept in touch, always knew what was going on in each other’s lives, sexted here and there. Basically we were both into each other and every now and then he told me how he was waiting for me to move to his town.
Anyway, switching jobs took me 7 months. Now when I’m finally only 6 miles away from him, he tells me he’s seeing someone. I don’t blame him for that, there was no commitment involved between us and we both knew we were on dating apps. 
However, I frigging like him, and I know he likes me. He told me he still wants to see me and any guy will be lucky to have me. 

I want to go for him. I’m sick and tired of waiting around. I’m not getting any younger.

I’ve know this girl from college (before Uni) we had some classes together, never really spoke to each other. 

Now we’re at the same Uni and we study the same course. At the start of this academic year, I saw her out of the blue at a society meet and greet and we had a long conversation with each other (mainly an overdue catch up about life). 

As we’re on the same course, it made sense to do a group coursework with each other plus 4 other friends of friends. 

Now in person teaching and real lectures have resumed and essentially as I’m spending more time with her, talking, bonding and just getting to know her, I’m feeling more attracted to her. 

We tease and joke each other quite a lot during our conversations and make each other laugh. 

It’s Valentine’s Day on Monday and we’re going to meet (she agreed to meet) at the library for a study session. 
I have two Nightclub tickets for a Valentine’s Day special event, and I’m going to ask her if she wants to go. 

Here’s the kicker though, during a conversation we had, the topic of relationships came up and she said: 
“I don’t think I could have a relationship with someone on the same course. They would have library dates and stuff and that would be way too cringy. Plus, the guys on this course only care about money”

I said: “what about me?” 

She said: “I dunno about you though?”

Keep in mind this was a lighthearted convo not too deep at all?

I'm a 20s female and I've been talking to a 20s guy for a while now. I think we have great chemistry online and we talk everyday and I think I caught some feelings. but the problem is that we live in different countries. it's not impossible to meet if we wanted to, but it makes things harder.

we actually met online years ago, we got talking as friends and grew apart. we kinda ""found"" each other again recently and I know I've always had a thing for him and I suspected he did too.

we've been flirting with each other, hinting at dating, but nothing will happen before we meet in person.

for background, he knows I've had a difficult past and that I was hurt badly by my ex, so he doesn't want to force things.

my question is: where do we go from here? do I continue talking to him, letting my feelings grow for him from afar? but what if we do meet and there's no chemistry in person? or should I tell him I'm ready to meet and arrange things?

Well my coworkers wanted me to go over to that table and buy her a drink. (I had already decided prior I was taking an Uber home) Eventually one of them ordered 2 lemon drop shots and after trying to get me to take one over to her one of the guys I work with took it to her and said it was from me. After a few mins she called me over and we did the shot together. Chatted for a few minutes then I chatted with another guy in her department before I went back to my department. 

My coworkers seem to think that based on how the shot went down that she’s not interested. I’m not 100% sure how to read what happened and feel like it was almost inconclusive. 

I had fun, which I guess is the important thing. I’m glad I was intoxicated as it made me less nervous and it didn’t hurt when the shot didn’t go exactly as planned.

I used to enjoy having friends when i was younger but today it doesn't feel the same, i'm emotionally dead inside when talking to people and everything is calculated. The same is true for my own family members to some extent... i like them and i want the best for them but i can't help but being closed off.

I think i can live without having friends but i would at least want a girlfriend which seems alot harder to achieve in my current life situation.

I've almost never been in contact with girls in my life so i have no experience, i know that girls love confident men but i just can't fake it... If i manage to get a date with a girl i would be constantly worried about what i should or shouldn't say and how to behave ""normally"". Being physically intimate terrifies me and i can't imagine myself being confident in that moment.

I've tried things to show interest in random girls in public that i don't know but it's always nonverbal and it never leads anywhere because i don't go further, also i'm not sure how to gauge their interest level, sometimes i think they are creeped out and looking back to see if i would attack them and sometimes i think they could be interested. I thought about trying dating apps but it would be awkward to have nothing to talk about unless i specifically write in my profile: ""No social life, doesn't do much, few life experiences."" i would kinda feel like i'm ripping them off.

Option 1: This girl who I met last week after a mutual friend introduced us to each other. I don't normally like someone this quick but we were chatting loads between Saturday (when I met her) and Wednesday and the conversation was flowing well. The three (me, this girl and the mutual friend) of us went out clubbing on
Wednesday night (I decided to go out spontaneously after she messaged me “come out tonight and look your sexiest”) and we got very drunk. I may have been very overprotective of her on that night, and told the mutual friend that I fancied her. Since she's been a bit quiet with me. I was going to get the three of us to revise tonight and ask her to dinner for Valentines then but they haven't showed up so I don't know where I stand. I bought her chocolates to give to her too and obviously now these do not have a recipient unless I see her by chance tomorrow morning, which I won’t as everyone on my course is doing an online test.


Option 2: This other girl who kissed me in the club (on a separate occasion, about 3 weeks ago). I never kiss or really chat up girls in clubs as I'm there for a good time out with friends but from what I remember we got along very well but obviously we met at the end of the night so didn’t get to know each other that much. I was much less drunk on this occasion. Her friend (who l don't know) was really overprotective of her on that night and I assume forced her to air me as she blocked me right after. Yesterday, she followed me again so there's clear intention that she wants to go out with me for Valentines but it seems kind of shady and I don't want to pay for a meal and not get a good date with someone who actually cares about being there in return.

Hey Reddit, I could use some advice on my situation..I can't seem to find a similar thread.

So I (31M) met someone (29F) on hinge back in mid January. After talking for a couple weeks we went out, and have since had 3 dates each a week apart. All went great and we plan on seeing each other again. Only kissed, no sex yet if that's relevant.

I hadn't really brought up Valentine's day since we both have busy schedules due to work and school. I happen to have Tuesday free, which we talked about but she's busy which I expected. Most likely I won't see her again until Friday or Saturday, but we do text every day.

Should I do anything about Valentine's day? We never directly talked about it, I've never been to her place so I wouldn't even know where to send flowers or whatever, but it's too early for that anyway. A simple text seems pretty lame. Maybe just text her &amp; plan something slightly romantic next weekend?
