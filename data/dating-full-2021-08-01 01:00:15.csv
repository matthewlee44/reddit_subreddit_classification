It’s been about 4 months into this journey and while I’ve healed from my last experience, I’m still feeling moments of loneliness and feeling left behind every now and then. I look at my life (I have an amazing core group of friends, a well paying job that I enjoy enough, supportive and present family, no debt and a sizable amount of life savings) and I feel like I should feel blessed and happy. Of course there are things for me to work on, I’m still studying to stay relevant in my field, applying to jobs, learning how to work out and picking up a new hobby. I do feel blessed and satisfied most of the time, but sometimes I look at my life and realize the only thing missing is that one someone to share my happiness with. I’ll go out and see couples walking about or hear from one of my friends that has found their person or is getting married and soon after this wave of loneliness hits again. It takes me a while but I eventually convince myself that a man/partner is not needed to revert back to baseline.

I was wondering why this wasn't included on any app, even though they ask loads of personal questions like your job, income, education, race, height, age, whether you want/have kids, etc. 

The replies were a mix of a few things:

* Women don't want to talk about their weight and the apps are designed to pull women in. Without women there are no men to profit off. $$$.
* Many people would not be able to do the mental analysis to figure out that  a woman who is 5'10"" and 150 lb is not overweight but actually still pretty trim. ie. The weights would get misinterpreted.

The first point maybe can't be avoided. But for the second point, what about an app that features BMI? If you enter your height and weight, it's trivial for the app to calculate and display your BMI. Then if you want to date someone with a similar body size you can search or filter by BMI, same as you can search or filter by age or anything else.

I know people like to talk about how BMI is not accurate because a bodybuilder would be calculated as overweight, but let's be real. There are very few ripped massive bodybuilders messing up BMI readings. Most people with a high BMI have a lot of body fat and that's it. 

Eg. For me to get to a BMI &gt;25 lean would absolutely require steroids. One of my most buff friends who women compliment on his physique all the time has a BMI of 23 and he's muscular and lean as fuck. So I don't really buy it when people say their BMI is 40 but it's because they're ""super fit.""

There is an obesity epidemic out there, not a bodybuilding epidemic, and if you care about that then it's relevant to consider in finding a partner.

If you are threatened by men seeking loveless relationships and one night stands, then turn to Facebook and ask yourself why so many beautiful women make themselves so available. 


Look traditionally women give sex to get love and men give love to get sex.


But why pursue love. We all seem to seek it but when caught in its grip we do whatever it takes to be released. To be lost in the fog of love sickness is it really fun. To hurt and painic at every perceived slight at every act of indifference. Venus had chains on her ankles and cupid had arrows.  They were the most feared of all gpds. Love creates slavery and pain. It makes you ridiculous to everyone who bears witness. It reverses every condition, cowards become lions, and lions will abandon any cause or person for love. The rich go broke and the pour reach for the stars. The sick are instantly cured and the healthy waste away. Who want jealosy of the very air your mate breaths. Perhaps you are too old to remember its taste, or to jaded by those forgettable loves. Then look to the teens and see the scars they bear and inflict. Only an idiot seeks it. It unfits you to everything else. And reduces you to a state your enemies will pity.

Got out of a 6yr relationship which was also my first one so I'm not experienced with this kind of thing.

I met this guy through Tinder and we haven't stopped talking since we matched. We both deleted Tinder a bit after we matched &amp; started texting too. I tried to let it die down because I felt that it wasn't going anywhere but he got the conversation started again so I decided to give him a chance. He finally invited me over to his place after a month of just texting but all we did was watch a movie and then he drove me home. I'm not the most forward with asking for sex &amp; I guess he wasn't either, but it was still a nice time because he was a gentleman.

The next day he still texted me so I guess he was still interested. But then he randomly told me that he hooked up with a girl he just met and how great it was &amp; I was fine with it because we're not really dating. I just wanted to move on from that conversation but he kept trying to drag that topic on and told me he was horny and had to get it out of his system. He also then opened up for the first time about his ex to me which was nice, but I'm still a bit confused. We couldn't get far on our date but you hook up with someone you just met?

Anyway, I stopped talking to him again because I don't want to just text &amp; wait around till he decides he's available for me to hang out with him &amp; go nowhere again. But he always initiates a conversation with me &amp; I can't help but reply because I do like him. I'm just reluctant now that once I do sleep with him, he might stop texting, even though I have a hunch he might like me too?

I guess I'm here for a guy's perspective? What are your motives for bragging to your potential dates about other hookups?

Thing is, she doesn't give off any signs that she isn't happy with the relationship and/or is unattracted to me, yet for some reason I can't help but worry i'm not good enough.

There sure are some underlying things. She seems a lot more put together than me and pretty much has all of her goals set out. I, on the other hand haven't really thought so much about my future.

I am also naturally a very anxious person, probably because i come from a pretty broken family background and have spent my childhood stepping on eggshells around my mother. I imagine i unintentionally bring some of that stuff into romantic relationships lmao.

Point is, I find myself worrying far too much that my gf doesn't like me as much as i like her, and that I have to kind of prove that i deserve her love.

This is a great opportunity to help men understand your feelings or thoughts about why they strike out or why you simply aren't interested.

Hello mysterious internet people, my name is [redacted] and I have been single for a few years. I've had a girlfriend for about 3 months around 2019 and the relationship was mostly sex. It definitely wasn't perfect for reasons I won't go into. Anyways, I've been single for all my life except for that short 3 month stint. I've tried to put myself out there. I frequented a bar that I grew very comfortable at, I've tried complimenting random women, I've tried becoming more comfortable having conversations with strangers, I've tried dating apps and cold approaches but nothing really seems to work. Although I do feel more happy doing those things.

When I cold approach women I sometimes get numbers or some means to contact them but it doesn't lead anywhere. I don't feel like my situation is entirely hopeless but I've had a complete lack of luck in this area in my life. Older, non-relative women tell me I'm handsome, foreign women tell me I'm handsome, I've had a small number of hookups which I am very grateful for and a decent number of girls around my age have shown some amount of interest in me.
For whatever reason I haven't had much luck actually taking any of those women on actual dates or being exclusive. It has affected my self-esteem a bit but I challenge myself to go out there and keep trying.

This leads me to my question: What is the deal with women these days? I don't think this phenomenon has so much to do with men choosing not to date, because I'm sure there are more men willing to date then females choosing not to. I honestly believe that women are going through some unspoken change where they are avoiding men. I try to be responsible. I go to school, I work full-time, I've started focusing on my mental, emotional and general health. I notice there are alot of memes that are passed around that say ""men ain't shit"" but I want to think that I step up to the plate and try to be the man that I ought to be and the man a woman would want. I know I'm not entitled to a woman or sex but it would be nice to find a healthy relationship with a cool girl or at least date more.

There are lots of posts from men all over the internet that lament this same exact sentiment and many of those men all come to the same conclusion: The men who don't date lack status, wealth, looks, height. OR that since women have more options, they'd rather chase ""the top 'whatever' percent of men."" I strive to be a person who looks at things realistically and I want to cut through the Bull and ask you females straight up; what is it that you want? I know that girls have ""types"" and ""standards"" and that's good but unfortunately many guys fail to reach those standards. Honestly, nobody wants to be forever alone and humans have a desire for love and understanding. It's only natural that things be easier right?

Hi guys, I’m in a little bit of a predicament. This coworker and I have been talking, and we really seem to have a lot in common. She started texting me first, and that then started to develop into sending each other voice notes back and forth. She told me that she loves talking to me, and loves me voice. We’ve sent each other good morning/goodnight texts. I even asked her out (to a zoo date and dinner after), which she said “yes absolutely” to, while she even began planning other things we should do together. So, I definitely got the vibe she liked me. But the other night (around 12:30AM) she we were having a conversation and she said “well enough about me, tell me something about yourself.” And I asked “would you like to know anything in particular? Or just something random? :)” she stopped replying and I then followed up with a “I think you fell asleep, but I just wanted to say goodnight!” And I have not gotten a reply since. Would it be excessive to send another text? It’s been about three days and I haven’t gotten a response. I HATE to double text people, but I’m not sure what’s going on here.

I told my bf of 8 months I love him, and well his reaction honestly devastated me. I knew there was a big chance he wouldn’t feel the same but all his actions made me think he would honestly. He always tries to look out for me and makes me feel safe and happy. We are two very different people but still. When I told him he told me he couldn’t say it (although he has been tempted to) because it means to him that he loves you as much as his own family. I understood that it just still hurt. Made me feel like all my confidence went out the window, I was constantly second guessing myself after and never brought it up again after. He could tell it hurt me but I can’t blame him he just wasn’t ready. But that was about two months ago and sometimes I find myself feeling like he never will. 
I have a bad sexual abuse past from my ex along with another instance during high school that involved sexual abuse  and we haven’t talked about yet along with other things caused from it that make me get anxious about our relationship. I feel bad but I just feel like I can’t fully open up to someone who doesn’t love and that I trust completely. I never show this to him because it’s not his baggage to deal with . He’s honestly the most respectful man I know and I love and admire him for that. 

I hate that I can’t get it out of my head that maybe he can’t love me because I haven’t opened all the way up to him because I’m scared of further rejection. I honestly never wanted to say those words to anyone again because I was scared of how I’d feel if the person I love can’t reciprocate it or if they’d feel like I’m too much to deal with because of my abusive past. I don’t want to rush him or anything it’s just it hurts because I really do feel like I put myself completely out there just to get hurt again.

Also all of the girls that I ask out always say that they have a boyfriend and it’s really annoying, I mean it’s either that they just aren’t interested in me or that the person they are dating do a way better job at attracting women. So how do I get a girlfriend, when should I confront a girl and talk to her, what do I say to her, what are the best places to look for girls especially for a gamer like me(and please don’t say online because I’ve tried that and it was a complete waste of time), and lastly how do I get a girlfriend who is exactly my type without her saying she has a boyfriend??

And well, as most people might have been thrilled, I feel kinda cheated. 

So long story short, I went on a trip with my friends and my crush was there. Later in the night, we all started drinking heavily (he was sober btw), keep In mind I hadn’t eaten all day. My crush kept handing me shots, and when I said no, he would tell me he would take me to my room since I couldn’t handle it. So I kept drinking, and progressively getting super drunk, and well he got kinda touchy :| 

(also side note, I was kind of scared to drink with him ever since we were at a party, and his best friend came up to me to ask me if my crush kept forcing me to drink). 

So I blacked out, the first time it was like for 10 minutes and I remember him standing me up and taking me to my room. I gave him a goodbye hug and he forced himself into my bedroom, “because he had to make sure I was fine”. Then everything kinda got blurry. I just remember memory jumps. Like him carrying me or him hugging me. I do remember in one moment, in where I tried to kick him out, and he pushed me into a wall and then felt his lips on mine. This is kinda weird because I remember the feeling yet I had my eyes closed like I wasn’t really there. 

He carried me and placed in my bed besides him and started touching my butt and I remember telling him to stop that I didn’t like that. He then got on top of me and kissed my neck. It went all blurry from there, but I remember feeling his lips against mine twice, before I started shaking and calling out for my friend. I really don’t know why I started calling out for her, but I remember being terrified. (Side note, I remember him asking me, when he was on top of me, if I was scared :p)

He called my friend and we called it a night, but I was left confused. Did or did it not happen. When I began sobering up, I remember telling my friend, I think I had my first kiss. But then when I asked my ex crush what had happened, he said nothing happened, that he only took me to my room. I have been so confused, because yes I did black out several times, but I remember my body yelling out for help when I was uncomfortable. I also remember, me telling him off when he was being touchy, plus my bed smelt like his perfume. Yet he denied everything. He never told me what happened, or my friend, which is his best friend. And to be honest I was going to brush it off like a dream, until he told me that drunk people always do what they want to do sober, but little does he know I am an asexual.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,931018,public,self,I don't know if we kissed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovno43/i_dont_know_if_we_kissed/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

But even though it might not be that often that I think about it, it still creeps up every now and then so it is an issue. 

I will happily date and stuff, meet people and go out on dates but, I’m not actively dating for marriage or security. I date because I know what I want and would love to experience life with someone else, and to grow as a person and finally give all that love I have to someone else. 

I know that marriage is something that is something that a lot of people strive for, but for me, I dread it. Mainly because my dad died, 11 years ago now, he was an alcoholic and while he did rehab many times he kept relapsing and knew he wouldn’t make it and even told me so. 

Even if I did meet someone who I completely fell in love with, they could ask me to marry them and I’d probably say yes. But the closer it gets, I’d freak out, because I know that my dad would not be there to walk me down the aisle. He would not be there for the father/daughter dance. While I realise I’m luckier than most as I have a stepdad who practically raised me, it would still feel totally wrong even going through with it knowing he wasn’t there. 

Even though my stepdad and brother have both said they’d walk me down the aisle, I’d still feel incomplete and a huge amount of sadness, and if people see a bride breaking down on her wedding day, that wouldn’t be a good look. I have completely dealt with his death and moved on, but this is just something I feel I may not be able to do. Not a lot of things make me cry, I’m quite a strong person and am pretty much classed as the therapist/strong girl among my friends. So I’d absolutely also hate to see my family &amp; friends to see me in such a state. 

This is one of my skeletons in the closet, no one knows how I feel about this, it’s just something so close to my heart I couldn’t share this with people who know me as they’d see me differently &amp; damaged. This is what scares me about dating, cause what if I meet that one person, and it happens, I could communicate my worries, but eventually, the guy would get tired of waiting.

So, I invited a coworker (lets call her Tina, 32 y/o) on a coffee date at my place. We have been joking and laughing a lot at work in the past couple of months and she would ask for my advice several times each day, which she had not done in the months before \[I suppose she did so to be near me and get my attention\]. Anyway, the date went well (at first). We hit it off, she was super bubbly and relaxed. We were sitting on a huge lounge sofa facing each other. At some point during the date I moved closer, so while we were still facing each other, we were close enough to touch. I playfully slapped her hand or knee when she would tell me something funny or goofy and she seemed receptive to it. At some point I just kept my hand on her lower leg and gently rubbed it while she was talking. I kept it there for maybe a minute. Again, she was smiling and laughing and did not seem to mind. Anyway, about 30 minutes later she abruptly decided to leave. I asked her if I had moved too close, but she denied. Anyway she was basically out of my apartment within 60 seconds. I was somewhat shell-shocked, as I did not expect this at all. On previous dates with other women, this had never happened.

The week after the date, we were in home office, but the two of us had 2 Zoom meetings. She would no longer give me flirty eyes, but rather a """"I do not care about you romantically"" look"". She would not smile or laugh at my jokes. She was a stone-cold professional, but not angry or dismissive! I thought it was over. 2 weeks after our initial date, the two of us had to meet in person to talk about some work-related projects. So, I suggested ""lets meet at 3 pm"". I did not specify where and I assumed it would be our office. Anyway at 2:30 pm she texted me saying ""I will be at your place in 25 minutes"". When she came in, she was back to her bubbly self and flirtatious and all. I ordered some food and we were talking private stuff before we started working on the project. During the project work, she would be flirtatious and laughing a lot. After I came back from the bathroom, I noticed one of her buttons on her shirt has opened up showing a little bit of skin and bra. Anyway, since this was now a work meeting and she acted so cold the week before, I did not want to make another move on her. I did touch her arm for a split second at some point out of reflex and she did not seem to mind.

So, long story short, I do not know what to make of it. I am somewhat scared to make another physical move, since it went so bad the last time. Does she just need more time?

**An Important detail**: we’ve never met, just talked on Snapchat and Facetimed, because he lives 400 miles away from me. He found me randomly on social media. It had to be just a fun way to connect with someone far away.

We’ve talked for 2 months in total now, we like each other’s company but realized we can never actually meet. and I disclosed to him that I think of applying for a college semester exchange and one may be in his state.

He got super happy, was like “you better home here” and said stuff like “if you came I’d definitely want to take you out”. We’ve been flirting a lot and he always compliments me and seems genuinely interested, although sometimes bit sexual (suggestive pics, but I guess that’s normal for young guys, he’s 24?)

The next days he doesn’t really text as much as earlier or put effort in the conversation.

She went rogue for 3 days so I contacted her asking what’s up. She blew up and said how she’s got a lot going on and needs to take some time for herself. She repetitively said “I want to stay good friends” and “Just because we won’t “talk” doesn’t mean you won’t be my friend”.

A month goes by and it’s her birthday so I text her “happy birthday”. Nothing. I thought okay maybe she didn’t see it.

Few weeks go by and I was going through some old stuff and came across something of hers and wanted to text her and see how’s she’s doing so I say “Hey it’s been a bit how are you doing” thinking okay if she doesn’t respond I’m just not going to contact her she clearly doesn’t want to be friends but then bam she blocks me.

I used to not think of this stuff when dating but have anxiety disorders now (OCD, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder.. (yes they are treated and on meds and I have a therapist, and Girlfriend is aware of that)......

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah I need to figure out how to stop my mind from feeling anxiety if I don't say every last thing and ""get it all out on the table"" so to speak of all my dumb issues.....very annoying:) I'm sure for her and me.

Therapist says ""you don't need to tell her every last negative or issue you have"".......but my mind says ""if I don't then she will leave etc if she finds out I wasn't 100% honest about every last thing""......I love anxiety......:)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,931485,public,self,Dating and Anxiety Disorders: Feel like I need to reveal every last negative aspect I have to new girlfriend: Advice?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovsy5u/dating_and_anxiety_disorders_feel_like_i_need_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Dating profile is good and has been peer-reviewed. I don't think I give off any red flags. Communication has been varied. One match constantly texted. Another liked long conversations. The others, I messaged sparingly (if at all) after setting up the date. So I can't place blame on how I communicated because they were all differently paced.  

That said, I think this last one was a wakeup call. She may have been a perfect match and honestly, exactly my type. Except...she had kids. I'm in no way ready to be a dad. Probably not for another few years. Was I really going to try, just because I've had a string of bad luck?

So, I was married for 20 years and right after my divorce I was sitting at a neighborhood wine bar and met a woman who lived a few blocks away.   

I was newly separated and we started dating.  She had been divorced for a few years already and had dated quite a bit.  

I’m fit and super easygoing.  Very loyal and very affectionate.  She and I became serious but now she brings up marriage often and gets really pissy about it.  

Last night we had a major fight over it.  We were at a friends for dinner with multiple couples and I walk in and I could tell things were awkward and that I felt I was being talked about.  So, I asked what was up?

GF says, “Well I was telling them to ask you what we are doing for our anniversary and when are you going to marry me?”.   She had been acting mopey and pissy all evening so I knew what was bothering her.

I clammed up and just wanted to leave but didn’t drive so I was seething.

Finally in the other room I ripped her ass about putting me on the spot like that.  We said some pretty ugly things to each other and I didn’t stay with her last night and we haven’t spoken or texted today.

We get along and the sex is amazing -but I’m wondering if I just need to cut and run.  I’ve asked her to move in together, buy a place together, whatever but it isn’t enough - she wants to get married.

I can’t take these recurring bouts of pouting and fighting. 

What’s the dating scene like out there?  I meet people pretty easily - but the thought of dating again seems daunting.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,931548,public,self,4 Year relationship and recurring fights over marriage.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovttus/4_year_relationship_and_recurring_fights_over/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
