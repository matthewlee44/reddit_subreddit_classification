Due to biology and all that jazz. But with feminism on an incline its difficult to find a women who shares my views. A women feels like she should be allowed to sleep around if the man is doing it but its not the same. I can sleep with many women without being emotionally attached to them or loving them etc. Women can lie to themselves all they want but if shes sleeping with another guy she loves him and is attached to him to some degree. In this day and age women always try to compare these things and say they dont get attached but the tolerance a women develops for a man shes sleeping with requires some form of attachment. Her allowing a man to woe her up until the point that she opens her legs to him is a whole emotional process for women but for a man none of that stuff is required. I don't want to settle but I want a women who understands that a woman sleeping around is not as bad as a women sleeping around.

I texted him when I got home and the next day and he responded but didn't try and continue any conversation. He's in the medical field, so has been in school for a while and I was like maybe he has bad social skills?

So I waited a few days... and I texted him and asked how his weekend was and tried to start a convo.

We're meeting in person for the first time soon, and I have to travel several states to see her.

She's great. It's so easy to talk to her, I have fun with her. The way she talks to me, smiles and me and looks at me makes me want to fucking kill myself -- in a good way. In short, I'm falling for her. At the same time, I'm being very cautious.

She's older than me, and is still a student pursuing her bachelor's in an area that doesn't make much money. She's in her last semester. Both those things are okay with me. Then I found out she comes from a poor family. That's still okay with me. Then I found out she has like no money, and is *probably* supporting herself via credit and is building up debt. I don't know how bad it really is, but it doesn't sound good. On top of that, her parents drag her down with toxic bullshit because they're not even independent.

I learned about her money situation only because I had asked, and it seemed like she was very embarrassed to tell me. I try to be an honest person, and sometimes it is difficult, but I told her that this was not good, it makes me worried, and is overall a ""red flag."" It was hard to say, but it was necessary. On top of all of this, I'm starting to question her judgment and reliability because money is really fucking important in life and it doesn't seem like job-hunting has been a very big priority for her.

A little bit about me: I'm in a good career, graduated from a damn good uni, and probably get paid comfortably to the point where I don't have to look at my finances for the most part. Thanks to the pandemic, I work remotely which is the only reason I can see this girl. If I were to switch jobs, things would be even more difficult. I also have friends! Good ones too.

... but I'm also very much tfwnogf. Never had a girlfriend and this is definitely influencing how I feel about this situation. Dating has not been very nice to me, especially with the pandemic. Apps are complete garbage, and I hardly get any matches anyway. I've been doing the whole ""just focus on yourself, bro"" meme because of this. I'm so tempted to say ""fuck it"" because she likes me A LOT, and I've never felt this before in my life.

I've been thinking about this situation so much lately, and talking to my therapist about this too. Overall, I'm trying to do what's in my best interest. She really fills my emotional needs -- I think. Practically speaking, I'm very worried. Money is important for me. The future is important for me. Having a PARTNER is important to me. Being able to take vacations together, travel the world together, and not be dragged down by each other. I want someone to help make me the best version of myself, and vice versa. We can all have our bad times in life, but I need to know she is practically reliable.

I moved to a new area recently and met a guy on an app. We talked for a bit and he seemed interested, but has never been a great texter. Which is okay, but I can't help but compare him to my ex (I know I know) who was a great texter, especially in the beginning. We were constantly chatting and I could tell he was really interested in me. This guy and I went on a kind of lukewarm first date, I think he was a little nervous, he didnt' show that much emotion. However we ended up attending the same religious event later that day, well actually I had told him I was going like a week ago so I think he may have went because I was going (which is sweet!). He was much more fun to talk to at the dinner after the service, showed a lot more character and emotion! 

However, he is still a pretty shitty texted. Like will take two hours to respond, which okay, sure, but what are you doing that's so important you can't respond to a text lol? And just in general I don't get the vibe that he is super into me. I think he is a little awkward, hasn't hugged or touched me at all, or complimented me.

Currently I'm in a relationship, and have been for the last 8 months... but before January, I had been single for 3 years. Not truly single of course.... I had been on dates with quite a few men, I had dated 4 or 5 different people for short bursts of time before things got too serious and someone bailed or got cold feet. I was convinced that the dating world was a problem, and that I was the ONLY ONE who could see how miserable it was. I'd come home and cry about how i'd be alone forever, and badger my siblings to be honest with me about why I wasn't ""marriage material"" or why I wasn't worthy enough for love. I grew resentful of the whole dating platform, I played the blame game by trying to stick it on men as being the problem, and then I blamed dating platforms, and then I blamed myself for not being skinny enough, or pretty enough, and then I blamed society for making me feel that way.

It took me a while to realize that every date was an opportunity to learn a bit more about the real me. Over the course of a year before I met my boyfriend, I really analyzed the process of my dating and came to some really uncomfortable conclusions about myself;

1. I'm not a perfect 10, let alone a 8 or a 9. I'm perfectly average, and perfectly suited to someone out there... but in my early twenties... whenever I got rejected I would take it so personally that I would automatically assume that the person I was on a date with was an asshole. This was due to the fact my parents made me feel like no one would ever be good enough for me. If they didn't want me it only made me want them more, as if they had simply made a mistake and would soon fall madly in love with me. The harsh reality was that often those men simply didn't find me attractive enough, not just in looks, but in other aspects like how I dressed, how i was shaped, how I spoke, my goals, my personality, my beliefs.... and instead of accepting that people have every right not to want me, I refused to see myself as anything other than a total catch and would be fiercely angry over it. I thought I deserved a relationship that was found in story books and movies. I thought that winning at life meant getting the whole package that you see in celebrity magazines. The guy with the striking good looks and emotional sensitivity and wonderful bank balance. But I never realized how unsustainable those standards would be. I didn't realize that I had an average job, and had a nice... but average body, and a nice... but average face. There was nothing supermodel about me, I didn't have a successful business to boast about or a charisma that draws people to me. Yet, I was looking for that in men. It was essential for me. It took me a while to notice that I was actually quite a clingy person to my partner, I was someone who needed constant reassurance over the fact they wouldn't leave me. I couldn't handle my own emotions and I made up stories in my head about them cheating on me. I was someone who was trying to have a perfect exterior despite struggling to ever feel worthwhile to someone. I believed someone would just have to ""accept me"" and ""work around my flaws""... but also be perfect and put together themselves. I hurt many good men by viewing them in this way, and it sucked to accept that about myself. I made quite a few changes in my life for the next few years, starting with how I placed value on people, and I also asked myself what I brought to the table.... and increased my own value by developing better communication skills, hobbies and independance so I could bring forward a life that someone would be eager to share with me, instead of me just fitting into theirs like a puzzle piece. 
2. On the opposite side of the coin... I also realized I often dated a certain types of people in order to get the approval of the other women in my life. I was a people pleaser to the extreme. I was hanging out with friends who had some of the most terrible and shallow outlooks on romantic partners. They would make fun of men who were balding, or pity the guy who wasn't making 6 figures, or who was too short or too stocky.  They would date multiple people at once and laugh about the anxiety they would cause these men just to gain some sort of upper hand in making them jealous. So I asked myself... would I date someone who had friends like mine? Would the ""good man"" that i'm looking for be excited to hang out with the people I surround myself with? Do potential partners look at me and think ""yikes, if thats who she surrounds herself with... she must agree with them to some degree"". After an embarrassing evening where I caught my date grimacing at my friends as they took selfies and ignored his polite questions.... I ended up dissolving these friendships slowly out of my life, and actually ended up friendless and quite afraid of how empty my social circle was until I engaged in hobbies and group events that better suited my interests and goals. Now most of my friends are married mothers or career driven women with long term partners... and they are a much better support system as they share my values. But it wasn't easy to accept that I was surrounding myself with people that did not share my values, and therefore hurting my own chances of finding the person I wanted.

So while the dating world is savage and cruel in many ways, and while it felt like everyone I met just wanted a quick lay or a ego stroke... something that helped me find my current partner was to accept that I was the other half of all my dating decisions. I was the one choosing to go on dates with people who didn't represent my values, I was the one saying yes to friendships with people who had no interest in the goals I had in life. I was the one dating certain types of people in an effort to impress or show off. I failed to recognize that I came to each date with my own set of flaws and failed to recognize that I'm not everyones cup of tea. I also realized that there are factors in life I have control over, and that being surrounded by unhappy people, or having an ex clinging on to your life like a bad smell will often come across to people as being a red flag... and that if I expect someone else to have good, healthy friendships, and be free of baggage regarding their past partners... that surely should also apply to me.

In short, become the partner you want to have... and that person will undoubtedly show up.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,995753,public,self,The hardest part about dating is accepting the things you find out about yourself.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkfj3z/the_hardest_part_about_dating_is_accepting_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Honestly one of the qualities about her that I like more but since we have started dating I have been openly accused of being too basic for not entertaining the conversation. I don’t see a problem with having PDA. 

In fact, since I began talking with her she has made comments about many limiting beliefs that I would otherwise have held onto that now I don’t care about. These beliefs have actually turned around to empower the situation to press in the opposite direction so as to prevent the conversations from developing further. 

I appreciate nuanced discussions in terms of what we do and do not like in our relationships and my partner has gone into detail about where they could see areas of improvement with myself. This wouldn’t be a major concern if it wasn’t a 24/7 problem but to be honest it isn’t. 

She wants to push to have more activity in her sex life without a complete idea of what that will look like. For the most part her image is pretty spot on with a few details that really put things together. 

I personally want to enjoy things at a pace that allows for me to take in details without having to worry about performing. The act of exploring the various facets of the conversation itself is enjoyable and this is what I like about when we are together.

This doesn’t mean that we have to live out every possible discussion or be as eccentric as possible. There is definitely an enjoyable area of the discussion and a direction that doesn’t add to the conversation at all.

So even if she is basic but that doesn’t mean she is any lesser because of it. That’s her niche. That’s what she does. I would be hard pressed to find anything she says to be completely unbearable, and as of yet she hasn’t but has tried.

Hi. I [M24] have been seeing someone [F23] for a month now and I would say things are going pretty well.

My boyfriend is 45M. My marriage ended in May 2018 because of his severe chronic alcoholism. Exh moved an hour away shortly after he moved out. 

I did not date anyone or do any dating for a year after that because i knew i had nothing to offer. I had to heal. So i stayed single and worked on getting divorced. 

After my one year was up in May 2019, i started online dating for the first time in my life. What an eye opener. I'd rate the whole experience about 6/10.  The only benefit to OLD is access. I am a busy professional in a rural area. So yeah. 

I went on about 10 dates with different people. Of hat 10, i dated one for 6 weeks, another for 3 weeks, and then one for 4 months. One ended up annoying me and was too intense, one wasn't over his ex, and the 4 month one, he simply didn't have the time for a relationship and I ended it because 1) he wouldn't and 2) i didn't care about him because of the lack of time investment. 

So a year of online dating was up in May 2020. I reflected and decided that it was more toxic than healthy and adjusted accordingly. I got rid of all my profiles and started using ONLY Zoosk at the suggestion of colleague. It's not free so people have skin in the game, and it skews older. I got far less matches, but the ones i got were decent. 

so in May 2020, my only profile was on zoosk.  The summer of 2020 i became disillusioned with it all and by September i was ready to delete that profile and cancel. The reason was that i created a fake profile to see how people lied about their intentions. And gosh, do people lie about their intentions. The abyss looked back at me. 

During this time, a few people had messaged me. I did not reply because i was DONE with it after looking into the abyss. One night i was in bed, and this voice popped into my head. It said ""You aren't being fair"". So i logged back in and looked at the messages 2 men sent me. They were decent messages and they had clearly looked at my profile. I messaged both back. After talking to J for about a week, he took me out to nice restaurant and had a great time. 

That was a year ago come October 1,and we have been happily together ever since. 

The lesson i learned is that you and them, have to want the SAME thing, at the SAME time and WITH each other.

(he is usually a flirty person)

one day i got drunk and went to him,i intiated first kiss and then sex and we fucked.. next morning he sat next to me and said “soo what are we gonna do now,are we contuing this or? I didnt try anything earlier because i liked you as a person also and i dont know if at this moment relationship would be possible” (because he is going home)
I didnt know what to say so i just said “to me its whatever its up to you,but if you are gonna fuck other girls forget about it)
After that night,i feel like he is avoiding me,doesnt call me out anymore,when we are in the same company he flirts with everyone etc. and that gets me really mad..

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me she hadn’t really been in a relationship and had never even held hands with anyone. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

I feel and believe she gave me some signals that she likes me. I'm not good at understanding them, very good at misunderstanding.

On one occasion a few of the people decided it was a good idea to lay 4 people in a hammock, so i was the one that made the hammock roll around, so all of us fell to the ground. She were laughing so hard, and looked at me. 

The night went on, and i started singing karaoke, and tried to get her attention. She looked at me there too. 

And then, the bomb hit and i froze completely. The time stood still, and my heart were racing super fast. She said to me, ""I'm horny, what you gonna do about it"" Then a friend of mine pushed me towards her and we started chatting.

Sorry for long message. I appreciate if you read it all tho. 


Basically, I (18) knew this girl (22 or 23yrs old I forgot) from work about 3 years ago. She was my manager (not a top manager but like above me, yk?). We rarely talked but we had a good relationship. We are both from the same country (not Western Country), like most of the workers so we connected off that. We talked now and then but I didn't care much about getting girls so I never pushed for it. I was too busy with school and work. One day she complimented my cologne and I kind of just ignored it. I laughed it off and went back to work. As yall know, a compliment sticks with a boy for a looooooong time, so I still remember that compliment. She transferred to another store but would come back now and then and would say hi to me and the rest of the workers (not everyone but the ones she considers friends), even though we rarely talked. Then a year or so after, I transfer to a different store and she just happens to transfer there at the same time as me. It was just a coincidence. We were both happy to see each other because we were in a completely different store and it was comforting to have a friend in a new and strange work environment. We talked for our whole shift and it seemed like it was going great. Then for the next week and a half, we would take our lunches together and sit in her car and talk about life, school, etc. We would hang out for most of our shift while still doing our jobs. The thing is, when I'm off, she does this with other boys there as well (idk what exactly but similar to what I mentioned since the guy was bragging that he has her in the bag). So I assumed it is just her being nice. Because of that, I kinda ignored her and stopped taking lunches with her. She would sometimes ask me but I would make an excuse like ""manager won't let me"" or ""I have to study."" But when I'm working, I would randomly look around and I see her staring at me and she quickly looks away. Even after doing that, she would wait for me to clock out so we can walk together to our cars (we work similar shifts). Also, I know I said the convos would go great but that was only the first week or so. She seems to quiet down when she is around me yet she is the one that is ""inviting"" me to go with her on lunch break and she's waiting for me to clock out. Yet with other boys, she's laughing and making jokes. Sometimes she would laugh with me but I would have to carry the convo and move it along so it isn't an awkward silence. I just need advice so I don't look like a fool and ruin a decent friendship.

TLDR I asked a girl for her number but I ended up signing up for an ocapella group instead.

I just wanted to let the internet know. Also any words of criticism or encouragement?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,996455,public,self,I am an idiot,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkmplh/i_am_an_idiot/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Do you think sex is better than masturbation or is masturbation better than sex? What's your gender and why?

I am now starting to think masturbation is better than sex.

Reasons:
- When I was younger the idea of sex fascinated me but as I got older and I've seen plenty of women naked, the naked female body is basically no big deal to me. 
- I can pull up any porn vid 24/7 and see a woman far more beautiful and physically than any I will practically date perfect under perfect lighting/camera conditions in the prime of her life.
- I am attracted to slim/athletic women and most people of course are overweight.
- Your hand can be tighter and better controlled than any vagina (unless maybe she's super young) or you're talking anal, and while anal is tighter, well then you get feces involved and the smells/grossness.
- I can sit on the couch and masturbate in a comfortable position, while virtually all sex involves inherently uncomfortable/awkward body positions.
- I don't have to worry about pregnancy, disease, or people claiming I assaulted them 10 years from now if it's just me.
- I don't have to worry about people getting emotionally attached if it's just me.
- I don't have to worry about the pace or making sure the other person is happy (women orgasm more difficultly than men on average).

What do you think? If you think differently what's your counterargument?

I remember reading many articles claiming that male sexlessness is in part rising because many guys are preferring porn over real women. I used to think that was crazy, but now I'm not so sure. If other guys are thinking the way I am maybe it's true.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,996467,public,self,Is masturbation better than sex? Or is sex better than masturbation?

I’m 21 years old and I’m a trans man. I’m passable I’d say but there’s a lot of things getting in the way of my dating life, mainly where I live. I live in a very small town (more like a village) where everybody knows me and my family. It’s caused me to resort to online dating which has given me a bit of success but ends up with me being ghosted or the convo going nowhere so I end up pulling the theoretical trigger and just unmatching. 

Now there are definitely things I need to work on, mainly my physical health. I’m not fat per say but I have some chunk on my bones I guess haha. But that and a few other things I know are things I need to work on, but also just getting out there. Unfortunately it’s hard because of the pandemic and stuff, not to mention I don’t have many friends I can go out and do things with. 

So I’m here to ask you wonderful people, how do you guys, gals and everyone in between in the lgbt world (mainly transitioning people but others are welcome to respond), how do you put yourself out there? What do you do to get out into the dating scene? What activities or places should I go to meet new people and potentially find a person I’m interested in?
