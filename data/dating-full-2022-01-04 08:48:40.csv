First 5 months were just casually dating and the last 10 months we've been together. Due to the pandemic there is not much to do outdoors in our area, so we have been confined to stay at home. She lives a 1.5 hour drive away and we both work full time and only see each other during the weekends. Since the start I always loved taking care of her.

Since the start of dating each other I always thought of her when going somewhere and if I would see something she would like I would bring it back as a small gift. I would do this once every 2 months, just whenever I would think that she would like something. Whenever she comes to my place I always make sure that I have all the snacks and drinks in my house that she likes. She only has to say that she wants a snack and I'm already up making it for her. She often tells me that she can also grab it herself, but I really don't mind doing it for her. Whenever she wants a drink I'll get it for her while I grab something myself.

Whenever she is at my place, I cook lunch and dinner. In the morning I'm already thinking what she would love to eat and which things she really likes. If I don't have it I'll go grocery shopping to get the things in house to cook that dinner. I love cooking dinner and I don't mind doing it often. However when I've started cooking for around 15 minutes, she asks if I need any help. By that time most things are already done and I'm already cleaning the things that I have used for preparing. So in that case, I don't need any help and she continues watching Netflix, which is totally fine with me. The first times she came to my place, which was 2 months into dating, she cooked meals and helped to clean everything around the house. All I ask for is that she sometimes spontaneously will say that she will cook dinner for me that night. Whenever I mentioned this she says to me that she helps me most of the time when I'm cooking.

Occasionally I go pick her up after work on Saturday (she works from Tuesday - Saturday) because she doesn't want to drive to me. Then I bring her back on Sunday evening or Monday evening after work (I work from Monday - Friday). Don't forget that she lives 1.5 hour drive away. She does have an own car, which her mom and I gave her as a birthday present. She has gotten her license and that care since June 2021. Before that she didn't have a license so I always picked her up and brought her home.

The more often she was at my home, I noticed that she wasn't cleaning her mess anymore. So whenever I got home I would see all her stuff (clothes, hair ties, shoes, jacket, makeup wipes, bowls) laying around the house and I had to start cleaning it. Since she is there only in the weekends, I also do her laundry during the week with my own laundry. There are not many times that she did her own laundry on her own initiative.

The more the relationship progressed, the more I had the feeling that she was putting less and less effort in. When we were still dating she would challenge me more on a sexual level. You know the drill, a sexy pic here and there and some naughty texts. Usually she wore lingerie when she came to me. This has been decreasing over time and it makes me feel unwanted and unappreciated. The only form of affection which I'm noticing is that she cuddles up against me whenever we're sitting on the couch. I have talked about this numerous times and expressed my feelings towards her. She says that she has a lot on her mind with everything that is happening at home and the stress that it brings. She also said that it's not easy because she lives with her parents and her 2 little sisters of under 10. Every time she promises that she will try to think more about it and nothing changes. We had this talk over and over and I'm getting tired of it. We had our first talk about this in May 2021.

Fast forward to a few days ago. We were done with the dinner that I cooked and I wanted to clean the table. She was cuddling up against me and I was ""not allowed"" to leave. So I broke myself free in a play-fightingly way and accidentally grabbed her hand too hard where her ring pressed against another finger. Nothing bad, nothing was bleeding, it just hurt a bit. From that moment she was really distant to me and didn't really wanna talk. Asked her if something was up and she said no. Of course I knew something was up. Not much later I brought her home and we she didn't speak much for the 1.5 hour car ride. Asked her a few times what was up and if she wanted to talk about it. Then she explained to me how she found that I have changed and was acting unbothered. That I was uninterested in her and didn't care anymore. She gave me the example of that I don't register her when she talks to me sometimes. I explained myself that sometimes when watching a video on my phone that I zone out and that the same things happens to her when I'm cooking and she's watching Netflix. That I also was calling her a few times and would not get a response. And defending myself that I not cared I mentioned all the things that I do for her.

That was apparently not the smartest thing to say cause at that moment she totally shut me out. The moment I got home she started to blast me via text that I have totally ignored her feelings and was downplaying it. Whenever we had an argument she would always be very silent and cry when she was with me, but via text she would say everything that she wanted to say. Now she is really hurt by what I said. I said that I never intended to hurt her feelings but it was just a defense on that I didn't care.

Lately it's getting too much for me and I don't know if I should stay. Really need some advice here.

To be honest, I’ve been on a good number of dates with different girls over the past 5 months but (this is gonna sound terrible or weird so I’m sorry) I didn’t really vibe with any of the girls that i wouldn’t talk to them again after our first date. The dates themselves were alright, but I wasn’t interested enough to ask them out on a second date. 


I began to wonder why I felt like this. So when I first started talking to the girl I’m currently focused on now, I decided to try something new, which was to stop using the app and only focus on this girl until we finally go out, just so my mind isn’t thinking about anyone else or the next date if this one doesn’t go well. Also because our DMs had me really interested in this one girl in particular, we had a great connection online so I just wanted to focus on making sure we kept that same energy in person and I will say it was the greatest date I’ve had so far. In brief It was such a great time that I didn’t notice how fast the time went by I mean we really vibed with each other and she seemed really happy. 


She was also the first girl to hold my arm while my hands were in my pocket and I don’t know if that means anything but it never happened to me before with my previous dates so it definitely hit different. She was asking questions, showing interest in what I had to say, occasionally getting close and being pretty physical by just randomly touching my hand to see how big they were or buttoning up my jacket, yknow that kind of stuff. All in all she texts me when she gets home and I’m happy because we’re still kind of joking around and talking about how much fun the date was and I’m thinking this is going great, buuuuut here’s the other side of the story  


So before our date she would reply 2-4 times a day and now she replies once a day, maybe twice. She did apologize during our date about how long she takes to reply but I never considered it a big deal as I know people are busy with their lives or just don’t feel like texting, plus she’s visiting her family in another city so it’s completely understandable, but I’d be lying if I said It didnt bother me. I really enjoy talking to this girl and I’m never gonna tell her to reply faster, but I’m just worried she isn’t as interested as I am or isn’t looking for a relationship, even though I felt that’s what she probably wants based on our conversations and interaction during our date but I don’t know if what I feel is even right or not anymore.


Im really committed to having a relationship with this girl. However I’ve never been in a relationship before so I don’t know what to do. She already agreed to having a second date when she gets back in town so should I tell her I’m sorry if im bothering her and just wait till she’s back? or continue texting her to keep the momentum going and to further show my interest?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1147339,public,self,Need guidance/advice,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvrvlf/need_guidanceadvice/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I’ve dabbled with tinder but no one’s really kept me interested with small talk. 

I matched with a guy [M24] last Wednesday as he was in my city on a night out. Just to put this into perspective: he was in my city for one night, his home town is 90 miles away from me and he is in the navy so actually works and lives 412 miles away from me. 

Since last Wednesday, we’ve talked non stop. We have the exact same sense of humour, outlook on life, we like the same music, etc. I feel like I’ve known him forever already. Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to meet before he went back down to work yesterday, as I’m isolating due to being covid positive. He said he would love to travel to see me on the weekend I come out of isolation. I’ve agreed as I’d love it too - we’ve just totally clicked. 

Anyway, fast forward to this morning I’m looking through my photos and videos on my phone to delete stuff because I keep getting pop ups about my storage. And I watched a video of me and a friend back in November and a guy in the background caught my attention. That never usually happens but it was a gut instinct to look at him closer. Yep, sure as hell, it’s him. So we’ve been within 5 metres of each other before and never noticed each other and I feel like this might be fate giving us a second chance to meet.

First time on this sub, I hope it's the right one for this sort of thing.

So, I've been on Tinder for 6 months or so and never really found any potential match. It's kinda depressing for me because the girls I've been hitting it off with suddenly vanish completely either from the conversation or the platform we're talking on.  
I don't know if it's because I'm the type of guy who wants a serious relationship or if it's because I'm trans or if it's because I'm introverted (my best guess is it's because of all these three). Most of the girls I matched with were all heterosexual, there doesn't seem to be any girls that are willingly to date a trans man, and I say this because they seemed uncomfortable with my gender.  
They're all nice and often tell me that whoever ends up with me will be incredibly lucky, I appreciate that, but I also feel quite alone, I feel like nobody will ever love me for me.

I don't say this vaguely, I mean, I've matched with pansexual girls before and even a bisexual girl, but they lost interest because I'm extremely introverted and am unable to carry conversations by myself.   
I mean, I practically no longer have many girls left on the app, Tinder has forced me to go global after all. I admit I only swipe right on people who have descriptions, but still, I don't want to force myself to be shallow when what I truly care about is the person's personality.

I've tried other dating apps before, no luck there either. I don't know what to do. I miss being in a relationship, but above all - I sincerely want to try a short-distance relationship.

Does anyone have any advice they can spare? I'd highly appreciate it.

I ended a long-term relationship at the end of September. Poor planning on my part but my partner at the time and I had already signed a lease with a move-in date for October 1. Yep, despite breaking up, we still moved in to said lease, which is my current living situation. My ex and I live in the MIL suite downstairs while two of our friends live in the main home upstairs. We have separate bedrooms and essentially co-own our dog together. The living situation has worked out thus far in that we live amicably and maturely in the shared space.

I am a 27 year old male and normally pretty confident with women but this girl just swooped me of my feet and I don't recognize myself anymore. 

It started on New years eve when I was DJ'ing on a party of one of my better friends. She came to the DJ-booth and asked for a ABBA song, normally I kinda ignore those people asking for a specific song but she was really cute and I thought okay why not. I didn't really talked with her afterwards and was just doing my own thing on the party.

Fast forward to the end of the night, she asked for my phone and the next thing I noticed is that she has put her number in my phone, asking me to come to another party where she was going next. I went home instead and texted her the location of my home, she replied that she lives closeby and before I responded she was already at my front door.

She stayed for the night (and the whole day after) and we had great sex. We also had a great connection and it was genuinely really fun to hang the whole day with her. We are still in contact but it seems to me that she is not that much into texting. She replies like once a day and it looks to me that she is not really trying to keep the conversation going. The thing that confused me the most is that she keeps mentioning however that she wants to have sex with me again.

The problem here is that I do have the feeling that she is mostly interested in the sex and just wants me because I am masculine.

I've (F28) been single the past six years not for lack of interest, its just never been a massive priority for me or I haven't met someone who its worked out with. But because of this, I feel very rusty in relationship. I've done a lot of work on myself and finally feel ready to have a relationship with someone and build something.

I've been seeing someone (M32) the past six weeks, we get on so well, he seems kind and genuine and says the same about me, the feeling is mutual. Because of Covid we've only been on 3 dates but have chatted on video call for hours at a time and I really enjoy his company. I've dated a lot and its never worked out with anyone. Though its early days, I feel like this has been really promising and I've enjoyed getting to know him, he even said himself that he had a good feeling about me. Things had been going really well, he had hinted at doing things in the future together, going on trips, meeting his friends etc.

He has been quiet the past week and he let me know that his ex had been in touch, he seemed really upset about it and it hurt to see him get hurt, he says he is over it but he has been more distant this week which is understandable.

Also this week he is isolating and it was his birthday so I decided to send him flowers and a balloon, he seemed to like them and I was kind of embarrassed sending them but in that kinda I'm blushing and really like you kinda way. I've never sent a guy flowers before so I though it would be nice. He seemed to like them and said thanks but now I'm worried it was overkill.

I haven't heard from him much over the last day or two and he hasn't answered my call. I'm wondering if its a case that he's not into me anymore. He might in a funny headspace with his ex reaching out, or he might just be sick and need space. Either way I realised I was overthinking the situation, I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve and so I realised that I could do with some space or even a slower pace. I also thought that it best to give him space too, I think I've made it fairly clear that I like him but now he may be in a different place.

 I reached out to him to tell him I think some space would be good, between us for the next week or so, because I think its gone too fast and because he might appreciate space after his ex getting in touch.  I haven't heard back yet

I've never posted on Reddit before but I read the sub all the time so I guess I'm just looking for some clarity, or advice?

Today, I created this account not to preach but to share a bit of my story. 

Why am I doing this? Most post I see on reddit is how sad single people, whether it's a complaint or some form of judgement. So, I wish to share a probably not so different than usual story of a single person who is ok with it. 

I (27F) have been single all my life. I joined the dating pool at 25 then the pandemic hit. At this point I usually get asked a lot of questions, and you can too in the comments. 

Before starting to explore dating, I hated myself so much. I had anxiety. Years of being told negative stuff about your body doesn't help, you start believing them. There is also having to work hard to finance grad school and other goals. I'm not well off, and neither is the region I'm in (to be vague about things)

Dating has been fun. I enjoyed meeting people. But, sometimes things just don't work out as you hope it would. Nevertheless, I gained good friends. 

What I think kept me happy despite the singledom?
1) I am aware why I am single. I know the reason why I started dating later than most and acknowledge that I should be more forward with my feelings.
2) I focus on working on myself. By this I mean, taking care of myself. I am not a runway model but I addressed my lack of self-esteem with self-care routines to look attractive and presentable. 
3) Not forcing things. I know people who jump at the first chance to change their relationship status but forcing things to be brings more stress than joy. This also come with the recognition that dating is not like the movies. There is not meet-cutes, no cheesy lines at the perfect moment, and life also happens. 
4) Focusing on my own lane. At my age, people are having kids and getting married. Meanwhile, I don't have a date on Valentines haha but that's ok. I cheer for them happy couples and continue trying my luck out there. 
5) I relate to the sadness of just wanting to have someone to cuddle or hold hands with or to call after a long day. However, I am also really secure on my own. 

When the time comes, I just know that I'll have so much love to give. For now, I'll try to books dates, meet new people, and have fun.

I've been through 5 relationships, had sex with 4, and I have more success than my close friends but I still feel stuck. I'm never talking to multiple girls at a time so my options are limited. I wish I could also atleast be able to get sex while outside of a relationship. 

One of my exes is pretty unnatractive yet goes to parties and has done stuff with 3 guys since we broke up but I haven't had sex with anyone else since she left. She barely even has any friends but gets around simply because she's a woman. I dated a wonderful girl for over 3 months but she was a christian and wasn't intetested in sex (which I fully respected).

I started having success in college. I met my most recent ex there and I've noticed a couple girls gave me some signals but I was taken at the time. So, maybe I'll do better when school starts again.

I've been going to the gym for 2 years, changed my hair, started a skincare routine, changed my wardrobe, grew my confidence, learned new hobbies, earned money, and bettered my self in every way but it's still not good enough.

I feel like what I'm lacking is a huge social circle. The thing is I honestly don't like most people, I don't make friends with girls, and I don't go to parties bc I don't know of any and don't have anyone to invite me.

We've gone on one date which was the first for both of us and were going to go on a second date soon. We're not officially dating but we've been texting and calling each other every day. Were both very introverted people and we both act very maturely for our ages if that helps.

She told me she wants to take things really slow with me because she wants to do things right and not mess up what we have because this is the first time someone is first interested in her and not the other way around. She said she doesn't know how she feels about me or us but she said she is interested in me and sees potential in us and us being really good together in a relationship. She doesn't ever get asked out so this is all new to her and I have no problem with taking things slow and I've told her that I don't mind waiting as long as we spend time together. She also said she wants to see where my priorities lie because she's now part of my life.

she is extremely smart like she has a 4.0 GPA and is the leader of a lot of clubs at her community college (she's dual enrollment) and is way smarter than me at school since I have around a 3.0 GPA. She wants to go to a really famous school that accepts the best of the best students and I'm fully supportive of that and I want her to get in so she can further pursue her education and most likely she will get in. I myself am going to apply there as well as others close by to it because it's close to home for me and more realistic for me to get into. She told me she doesn't care that I'm not as academically smart as her because if I was it would just be boring between us because we would be doing similar things.

My biggest fear is that if she does get accepted for this fall and we end up dating that she may leave me before she goes to college or breaks up with me a few months into her being there because she found someone else that she would be able to see every day. If I don't get accepted then we would be 25-30 mins away from each other which isn't bad but we may only be able to see each other once a week if that and I don't know if she would want to do long distance, but I would be willing to drive down there if I had to. I tried to ask her about this by saying if she does get accepted would she still want to keep getting to know me and talk to me and she said she doesn't know and that college will be a new thing for her and that we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

I just really like this girl, we've both told each other very personal things about our life (she's shared more with me) and we're both into a lot of the same things and we communicate well together. I am very honest and patient with her and her feelings and she really appreciates that because she said not many guys are like that at all.

I'm just really scared of getting my heart broken because I'm an emotional person that has his heart on their sleeve or it being like she's the one that got away because I wasn't smart enough. I really like this girl a lot and I feel that I have a connection to her because I rarely find girls that I'm interested in or are interested in me back and accept me for who I am so I'm scared to lose whatever we could potentially have in the future.

I'm a big overthinker so I would like to hear other people's thoughts and opinions or advice on if I should continue this or what I should do. Thanks.

We've known each other for close to 2 months but didn't seriously start talking until about a month ago.

But then randomly one day she didn't talk to me like usual. Like I recieved 2 texts from her that day.

So I was finally like ""idk what happened but obviously you're not feeling it anymore so please just come get your stuff from my house"" and she responded with ""i didn't say that. I said I need to figure stuff out"". 

I sent her a text saying I wasn't cool with being put off to the side while she does this and she never even opened it and it's been over a day.

But when I do I get no reply. Even when I ask a question. So I back off, I think maybe his feelings were different than mine and try to move on. Then he randomly texts me, we end up hanging out, have a great time, then the same thing happens. 


  The most recent incident was over Christmas. I sent a merry Christmas message. I got no reply, just left on read. Later on Christmas Day I asked how he was since he had told me he wasn’t going to be seeing his family. Didn’t even open the message. Four days later he randomly snaps me. It’s just this weird back and forth and I hate it. Yesterday I asked if he was busy (I was going to invite him to walk with me on this pretty trail in my neighborhood). Half the day goes by and he just says “hi.” I say hi, and again, I get nothing back. 


  I feel like he’s playing games with me. It’s this continuous cycle and it’s frustrating. When we’re together he says little things that suggest we have a little relationship going on. I start feeling comfortable then feel the need to pull away.

AITA for refusing to communicate with my bf's parents/not wanting to talk to them?

We've been dating for almost two years and are doing long-distance (425km or 264mi). We see each other frequently.

I'm in my senior year (19f).

My boyfriend (20m) is a wonderful, sweet man. He's constantly checking in on me (to see if I've eaten or drank enough water throughout the day) as well as my mental and psychical health. I have a lot in common with him, such as hobbies (video games and books). Always making an effort to communicate about issues in our relationship and prioritize me. He is currently enrolled at the Institute of Technology in his hometown So we're not spending as much time together as we used to.

His family, on the other hand, is not so lovely. More specifically, his mother and father. When I visit him (once or twice a month), they send me a lot of red flags, which I took personally.
1. I've had a bad case of acne for as long as I can remember (something around 7 years old). I was bullied at school for it, and they made me feel worthless just because of my face. In fact, I'm well aware that I'm not attractive nor beautiful. My face is riddled with acne scars, active acne, and large pores. That was something I had to accept. I'm attempting various methods of professionally removing it, but nothing seems to be working.
My boyfriend's parents simply cannot accept this; they are constantly bragging about my acne to my boyfriend when I am not present. 'Is she even washing her face?' or 'Does she realize how bad she looks?' This caused so much damage that I stopped talking to them. Our conversations are limited to greetings and farewells.
2. However, that is not the end of the story. They live in the big city, have secure businesses, and have everything you could want. A luxurious vacation? That's all there is  it. A new, nice car? Boom, take it. His mother, like me, is from a small village. When I'm around, she enjoys talking about money and how wealthy they are, but not in a 'friendly' way. I was uncomfortable because I am middle-class and simply cannot afford her way of living. They also live with Grandma. She's an elderly, elegant lady. I adore her; she's my shining star, and I regard her as my own grandmother, as mine died when I was a child. Despite our age difference, we maintain good contact. As far as I know, she dislikes her daughter-in-law as well. They are constantly arguing over trivial matters because boyfriend's mother believes she knows everything.
3. His mom believes that her son should have a model or his girl best friend as a girlfriend (she was also critical of his previous girlfriend, claiming that she was too ugly and fat to have him after their first meeting). I chose to ignore it  because I never met her before, and I thought that she might be correct. But now I realize it was most likely a made-up story. In terms of his girl bff, they've known each other for about 6 years? I'm not sure. But I know they're no longer in contact because she was jealous of our relationship and tried various manipulation tricks to break us up (she pretended she knew he'd cheat on me, specifically with her, while we were together at her birthday party). Remember that they were not'sexual.'
His parents adore her, despite the fact that they are well aware that they are no longer friends. 'Oh, she's so beautiful now,' they say. 'She got her dream job.' Blablabla.

At first, I assumed they were just being cautious. It's not strange because I was unknown for them. After a while, they're still wary, but more intimidating than before. When I have to speak with them, my stomach sinks and my heart palpitations occur (unironically). I'm extremely shy in person (also diagnosed with BPD), and they make me feel bad simply because I don't want to talk to them for more than a few seconds ('good morning' or 'goodbye'). My bf is assuring me that this is fine with him and that I don't need to be concerned about his parents'. But I still feel bad about it, so AITA?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1147638,public,self,AITA for not wanting to talk to my boyfriend's parents?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvyggr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_talk_to_my_boyfriends/,no_ads,0.0,,,

So here's my story, I am currently 18 and my girlfriend of nearly 2 years, she's about a year older than me. She ended up having a rough childhood which caused her to be held back in school and has a spotty relationship with her dad because of other things. Anyways, We got together end of our junior year near when COVID hit. We didn't get to see each other for months after because of protocols and because my sister has an autoimmune disorder. Now this is where I'll begin to explain where my worries come from. My mother's side is very liberal, in fact most of the family is hippies and has no military service besides the drafts for WWI and WWII. On my dads side, his youngest brother just finished up his 6 years with the Army Rangers overseas. I saw the effect it ended up having on my grandparents to not know what is going on most of the time and it's something that bothers me especially now that my girlfriend is gone. She told me about a week before college started that she didn't want to do more school and that she felt like a failure to her dad. Her dad is a big mans man so it's not hard to see why he was hard on her. But she ended up making the decision to join the Navy. At first, I wasn't that bothered by it because I didn't know how it all worked. But this girl man, I fucking love her, I had bought her a promise ring to promise I'd be here when she gets back, I told her I would protect her, but I'm just scared at what the military does. My uncle lost a close friend in bootcamp because she was sexually assaulted by and officer and nobody believed her, so she took her own life. There's a fear of that combined with the fear of knowing I cannot protect someone I care about or be with her during these tough 10 weeks ahead for her, it's barely been a day since she got on the plane to leave from San Diego to the Great Lakes Camp and I miss her so much, I was just hoping maybe people in here have been through similar and can offer me some sort of support because I don't know anyone who's had to go through it like this personally... if you read through thank you and have a wonderful day, also thank you for your service...

tldr; girlfriend leaving to bootcamp in Greatlakes, promised I'd protect her and help her, but been a tough mental and emotional burden for months leading to today, could use some support on how to keep busy or deal with this

I haven't had any other dates in the past 4 months, it's just been her.

I've always struggled with self-esteem and low confidence issues ever since childhood. I'm a natural introvert, but was very shy all the way through most of my 20s. I've always had a decent amount of attention from women but, having low self-esteem, I always just figure they were being nice/friendly and after a while, they just gave up and moved on lol. Well, that was never the case apparently. They actually WERE interested, but I just assumed I was never ""good enough"" or ""there was no way someone like her was actually *interested* in me. So whatever signs, no matter how obvious they were, I never reciprocated out of uncertainty.  Which, greatly hindered my dating experience - or lack of... 

 Boosting my esteem and confidence has been a huge work in progress, and a very active work in progress the past 5 years or so and, has drastically improved, like a LOT. I'm still on the shy side but, I guess what I'm trying to say is, since I am so horrible at picking up on signs, I miss so many opportunities that guys with more self-esteem would have picked up on. Actually, I think I can pick up on the ultra obvious signs but, it's the subtle ones I struggle with the most. Which I think the majority of women give off. 

Overall, I have a limited amount of experience talking to women I'm attracted to. Ironically though, I get along quite well with the very outgoing and very chatty women who give me a ton of attention, as it puts me at ease and allows me to just be myself and am so much more open. Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of women are overly outgoing in that sense. Maybe I'm wrong, idk. I still have that mentality of ""shes just being friendly"" or ""no way she's interested in me,"" and that's killing me in the dating world lol.

Story time:

The other night I was at a wine bar I frequent a little too often, alone. This very pretty woman sits next to me with a to-go pizza and decides to have some wine. We glanced at each other several times before she initiated a conversation. She literally did not stop talking for a solid 3 hours. I always look for certain signs and I think she did the most obvious. She completely adjusted her self and was 100% fully facing me - legs, feet, body, etc... and was fully into me. Fast forward a bit and I have my hand between her thighs to keep them warm - she put them there, btw. At this point, I'm positive she is very into me so, we close the place out, walk to her car, make out a little, etc.. She tells me she wasn't wearing a bra and puts my hand on her tit. I can't remember what I did next but, I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything ha. We end up parting ways but, I'm almost positive she wanted me to come over. Me being me, didn't know how to respond to that so as usual, she gave up and called it quits. Oh yeah, she was MARRIED with a husband of 25 years (who was in Hawaii.) Looking back, I think she was wanting to cheat. In some ways I'm glad nothing went further but, this is just a typical example of my dating life in a nutshell. Being 33, all my friends are either in a serious relationship, engaged, married, or constantly play the field (hookups) and I feel so left out. Plus, I genuinely want to find someone to be in a long term relationship with. 

Now to the original question... 

What are things you do, or say, or ways you tend to act towards a man you want to talk to you/approach you? I'm mostly talking about the more subtle things.

so im just wondering what i should do with an unused birthday gift i got a (female) friend with whom i am no longer in contact with.

we were coworkers and good friends (at least i thought we were) for 4 years and what ended up happening was that over time i really fell for this girl but when i finally told her how i felt she told me she only saw me as a friend. so after that, i figured id give her some space so we could resume our friendship but i basically never heard from her ever again (see below comment that fully explains that situation).

anyhow before that and covid happened (and before remote work) she commented to me one day at the office that she liked my new watch (a retro casio, model a168 in silver) and that she had always wanted one in gold when she was younger in school/college abroad but couldnt afford one (she was raised by her grandmother and extended family because her mom died when she was young and her dad wasnt really in her life). her grandmother had also recently passed and she was seeing a therapist at the time i had recommended to her (and who i had also seen but thats another story) because she was going through some tough times because of that and a break up (again see below comment).

anyways i was kind of moved by that (how she wasnt able to get something as trivial as a inexpensive watch due to her difficult childhood) so i got her the watch as a birthday gift and me being the romantic/idiot i am put an engraving on the back saying “el tiempo dira cuanto te quiero” (time will tell how much i love you in spanish) and my name on it. remember i went to do the engraving during lunch one day and it ended up an odyssey to get it done (the place was on the other side of town and traffic there was horrible, the elevator in the building was broken, so i had to take the stairs up to the 20 something floor and again when racing to get back to work lol). the thibgs you do for love right?

anyways, because of what happened and covid as well i never got a chance to give it to her and honestly given i havent had any contact with her for more than a year and a half, i was just wondering what i should do with it?

because of what happened i think its probably best not to give her the gift anymore  or contact her because we’re not really friends anymore obviously and because she’s in a relationship too i think. on my side im completely over the whole thing and wish her the best even though of course that whole situation hurt (moreso because i lost her as a friend vs the romantic rejection), it’s just kind of weird still having it.

theres a (cute) bartender at a place i frequent that ive noticed has a similar watch (silver like mine) so i was thinking about asking her if she wanted this one and telling her the story next time i grab a drink there. this way i can get rid of this thing and the gift is actually used and makes someone happy. plus if im lucky maybe she’ll think its sweet and she can introduce me to one her regulars (a cute hopefully lol).

anyhow thanks in advance &amp; apologies for the long post.

Things started off strong with conversations, we literally were texting and having phone calls pretty much all day everyday, morning to night. And it’s dropped a bit. To where I’m getting a bit concerned that maybe there’s a lost in interest. I asked him directly if he was losing interest and he says he isn’t. So that clears that up. But I can’t help but feel insecure maybe? (I know, I know, it’s my issue and I recognize it’s something I need to work on). But it would really help if I knew this happens normally when dating someone? Where texting/phone calls or conversation is really strong and then it dips…. I guess where I’m coming from is if we hadn’t been on the phone so much in the beginning i wouldn’t question it, but bc that’s how things started I got used to that being our way of conversation and now that it’s not so much I’m worried he’s going to move on or lost interest.
