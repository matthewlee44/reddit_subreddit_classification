Someone with SCT may not be able to process information as quickly as others and may have a hard time with schoolwork, decision-making, or social relationships. They also might:


Get overwhelmed by too much information at once

Need more time to make decisions or give answers

Often miss social cues

Need to read information more than once to understand it

Miss nuances in conversation and have trouble keeping up

Have trouble following directions and routines

Have trouble finishing tasks on time or in a reasonable amount of time

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I seldom participate in group conversations because I just can't keep up with what everyone is saying. I can never figure out what to say when talking to someone so I go to keywords like ""Yeah"" ""Cool"" and ""Oh wow"" very often. It makes me come off as boring and not fun to talk to...Which I am. I heard of the ""just listen"" advice but the majority of people don't want to talk to someone who just listens. They want someone to engage with their conversations. Someone who can give them the correct input when talking about something. Someone who can joke around and have fun while having small talk. I can't do any of that. And if you think I haven't tried hard enough- you've greatly mistaken because I have inputted every piece of advice I've heard from someone and it has impacted my life positively. But after someone knows me for a while they realize that I'm not mentally up there with them. So keeping friendships is hard and dating is especially hard...I just don't know what to do.

I mean, I'm very understanding of why people may not want to date me. I can't make them feel happy. That's a good reason right there. They would also have a feeling that I am like a child. Would you want to date someone who mentally acts like a child? (I'm asking adults. Not incels with weird fantasies.)

Despite me being very understanding of other people and why I can't be their love...I still wish I could be. To love and be loved in return. There's still a part of me screaming ""Yes I want that"" when I know it's inherently selfish to do so...I just, wish I wasn't like this ya know. That I didn't have to deal with this condition that's holding me back socially

Ps. Fuck incels. If they applied themselves to their social skills and how they looked it wouldn't take them over a month to start dating someone. While I actually have a mental condition that is holding me back socially. I can barely even keep friends because of it. I am living proof that if you apply yourself to your social skills, dress well, and actually take a damn shower, opportunities for dating and making friends comes to you. Yes, I date opportunities come to me all the time. My social skills on how to make a good first impression are phenomenal. Wondering why? Because I actually put in the effort to make myself better socially. So for the first few days, life is good. It's just due to my mental illness that things slow down and people think I'm stupid or dumb and want to drop me. The majority of incels don't have mental illnesses. They just have problems with confidence which can be fixed. I am massively screwed by something that's not of my own doing. I just needed to put that out there.

In November I organised the 1st date and we went bowling and had takeaway afterwards. Chatted alot, had a laugh and a great time and truly think she did aswell. I didnt sleep with her but didnt care as I really enjoyed being in her company. At the end of the date I asked for a second date and she said yes with a smile. She said she would give me a kiss but she still had the spicy taste in her mouth from the takeaway.

She organised the 2nd date two weeks later which was to see a movie in the cinema. Again chatted alot and had a laugh. Although I think it wasnt as good as the first date. I asked her for a third date and she smiled again saying yes. Again didnt sleep with her as we were both up early for work the next morning.

Few days after the 2nd date I went on a holiday with few friends which I had planned months before even meeting her. Texted her a bit while on the holiday. And a week after the holiday (left it that late to make sure I didnt catch Covid) I asked her out on a third date (in early December) to go ice skating as we've talked about it on the 2nd date. She replied the next day that she had to isolate as she caught covid at work (works in one of biggest hospitals in Ireland 🇮🇪 ). 

Two weeks later I asked her out again and she replied two days later that shes limiting her contacts to make sure she remains covid free so she can go home for christmas. Which I replied thats it was understandable and to enjoy her christmas.

After christmas she put up on her Instagram story of a hike in Ireland and we chatted a bit about the hike and how I planned to do it and I told her about the exam I had to study for on first week of January and planned to do the same hike afterwards. After the exam I asked her out again... but this time no reply and left on read. Which I knew after a few days was a bad sign.

I posted a picture of the hike on my Instagram story (she saw) and the next day I messaged her (remaining hopeful) saying she had better luck than I did on the hike as it was fierce foggy the say I went... again no reply and left on read.🤕

A month has gone since the ghosting and I'm still thinking about her, ""what did I do wrong"", ""was it to do with the 2nd date"", ""was it to do with lack of communication"", ""was she not interested anymore"", ""did she think I wasnt interested anymore"". 🤕

I'm very respectful towards women as I've grown up with sisters and didnt push towards anything as I didnt want her to feel uncomfortable at any moment and truly think she liked me and enjoyed being with me.

I am decidedly anxious attachment. The book recommends being upfront with this, not playing games, and being open and communicative with your interests and needs as early as possible. If someone has secure attachment, this will not scare them off, supposedly. 

I understand the impetus to address the fact that I had anxious attachment early, but I feel like even in people with secure attachment, presenting issues too fast too quickly is going to scare them off as much as it would an avoidant attachment style.

Background: I've gone on three dates with a guy. When we first started texting I had covid and we couldn't meet, so we texted a LOT—multiple long messages a day, voice messages, double texting from him, etc.—and I loved it. I only got attached after our first date. After our first meeting, in which I cooked him dinner, texting slowed down. Less intense texts, still pretty frequent, occasional double texting and voice messages. Anxious as I am, he seemed less interested, but still asked to hang out Saturday (our first date was Monday). Good time. Got dinner, went stargazing, saw shooting stars. He triple texted the next day asking to hang out. Watched a movie. Went to bed. No sex, but conversations about sexual preferences in which we didn't communicate super well. I tried, but he seemed uncomfy. We're both gay guys, so there is a strict top/bottom divide. 

After that, he seemed less interested than even before and significantly less texting. No ghosting, but expected it. Asked him and yeah, it's because he thought we were both bottoms. Thought that was that, but he's still seemed pretty uninterested but claiming it's class keeping him busy. Regardless, there is a huge difference between initial texts before we met and now, even if he is still asking to hang out. 

I'm torn between letting it go or having a conversation on our next date in which I lay out my needs and ask point blank if he's interested. To a mutual friend, however, he still said he ""barely knew me"" even though we've had the typical deep date convos.

My question is, is four dates too early for this conversation, or is that exactly what the book is saying should be okay?

Our banter was good, they seemed genuinely interested, I made them laugh, we flirted, we had tons in common, they said they'd love to go on a date. 2 days ago, they gave a time that they were free, I sent them a plan, they called me fabulous, said they'd look in the evening, and nothing. I asked them since about it and nothing. 

I've been ghosted a bunch before, all after I ask them out and they say yes, but this one frustrates me. I feel like this is as good as I thought it could go before the date, and it still didn't work. What makes it most frustrating is that I spent a huge amount of last month on OLD, just to see how much success I could have, and that was the best I got. I've never failed so hard at anything before.

Yeah, I'm extremely young (21). Yeah, there's a million more out there. Yeah, there's thousands of rants on here about the same thing. Yeah, I'll get over it in a week. Yeah, there's other, perhaps better ways to find people.

When I first interviewed with my manager, above all my credentials, me mentioned my work as a model instead of any of my related work to the company. 

On my first day of training, we were at the front desk going over my tasks and duties and held eye contact for a long time, I felt the intensity. I noticed his hand move to over his zipper, from being from by his waist and becasue I have brothers I know exactly what this means. Upon taking the leap to look, he was let's just say, a happy camper.  

He follwed up this momment by going on a monolouge disclosing that If I ever need anything, I can call or text him whenever I want. He assured me all resources were at my disposal and such. This rambling went on for about 5 minutes. 

As the day went by, he would say, ""I have to go check on 'my girl'"" or  I just wanted to see how 'my girl' is doing. 

His brother loosly does work for the company and I met him on my first day, and he introduced himself as my boss' brother along with his name. The look he gave me was one with an eyebrow lift and wide eyes, to which I could interpret of me being attractive or rather his brother's type. Soon after they were in a room together, my boss came check on his ""girl"" and let me know that his brother spoke of me, when he reassured me of a name of another manager, who I took for as his brother. 

He remembered how to spell my name, and often typed it in for me instead of allowing me to do it on paperwork. My name is a bit usual in the spelling, so I noted this as him caring and studying my name. 

He is gives me light little touches. I believe he did this a few times on my first day, but now that I've been here for a while, he still does this upon greeting me or walking by me, touching me around the waist briefly or lightly resting his hand on my shoulder. On the first day, I was walking through one of the swing gates and he placed his hand on top of mine and it rested there for a minute.  

 I noticed one day, he had asked me if I had checked into the media of our company's site, since the last day I worked I told him I would pull it up. I decdied to be honest and responded 'no'. To which he responded ""No?"" and the rest of the day, he was sort of distant, he walked around my desk instead of walking through it and passing by me. The comments became silent for the day, and him reassuring me of doing my tasks now came in a bossy undertone. 

There are a few more, but I believe these are the most that stood out to me. 

I tend to have a sort of delusional aspect of approaching dating/romantic life, whereas, If I don't pay attention to things like this, they don't exist. 

We have  female clients and I've seen him be friendly with them but I honestly haven't payed much attention to their private interactions, away from the open, which seem to be friendly, but not swooning.

So basically through my entire life I've never been in a real relationship. I've had 2 4-6 week things that weren't quite relationships but were more than dating too but only one of those girls I ever had sex with. I went from losing my virginity at 17 to not having sex again til I was 24 which was the 2nd 4-6 week relationship. After her I hooked up with a few girls over the next 2 years (just 3 over than span) from dating apps...and since then I've been not only not having sex but basically not dating at ALL for the past 6 years.

So to explain the Truman Show thing....I am a weird dude. Found out recently I'm likely on the autism spectrum. I don't connect with women very easily generally. Over the course of my life, there's been a few that there has been somewhat of a connection with. Basically every single time I meet one of those people there's some BS between the two of us. Either:

1.) I met her on a trip or she meets me on a trip and we live no where near eachother.

2.) She's moving out of my area in the not too distance future

3.) She's already in a relationship

It's almost absurd how often this happened to me back when I was trying. Over the last 6 years I haven't been trying and haven't even found any of those types of connections just naturally. I basically gave up on dating and life in general.

So fast forward to present day. I've basically given up on life. Just feel numb to it. Stuck in my bleak hometown area that's tiny with little going on. I randomly decide that even despite an injury I have to take a rock climbing trip in January to Las Vegas. I was spending 17 days in Vegas then 7 days in Utah before coming home. On my last 3 days in Vegas I get Hinge notification that someone liked me. It was this incredibly beautiful climber/circus aerialist girl. We had a date on my 2nd to last day in Vegas and it was the best date I've ever had. We literally just sat on a bench outside at night and talked for 3 hours straight getting super deep and super comfortable with eachother right away. I had a moment where I could have kissed her but opted not to as she had Covid a week before (she was cleared for work that day but it still felt wrong). Turns out that was the worst mistake of my life as she later told me she was open to me kissing her there and I think if I did none of this next stuff would have happened. Anyways, she convinced me to extend my stay by 4 days and go on a short trip with her and her closest friends for her birthday to a climbing area in Cali. I accepted the invite and paid $220 to change the flight. Over the next week when I'm in Utah and away from her something changed in her. Our convos were excellent but apparently outside of the convos she was having MASSIVE anxiety. She hadn't been wanting to date or even be touched by anyone in 6 months she told me and she thought she was ready for it but then she eventually told me she wasn't and she pushed me away the first day we were together after I got back from UT even despite me going on that trip with her. She said nothing was going to happen and explained that stuff to me. I began the process of detaching myself from her and was feeling truly awful as I truly honestly thought this was what meeting a soul mate was like and to have a dating history with a complete and utter lack of romance or love for my entire life it was utterly devastating to have someone I finally connected with like her also push me away like everyone else. Anyways long story short the trip went fine and on the way back we had a LONG 3 hour heart to heart starting with how I felt she pushed me away and it felt bad. She said she didn't push me away (lol what???) and then got really sad thinking that I wouldn't want to be in her life because of that. I put my arm around her and pulled her close and she started crying saying she didn't want to lose me. After that we kept talking about deep shit and eventually got to revealing our deepest darkest secrets about sex and stuff and we connected even more than ever before and that night (my last night there). I told her some fucked up sex shit I'm into that I never thought I could tell anyone and she liked me more because of it! Back at her place we cuddled for 3 hours watching Netflix. We spooned hard. She pushed her butt into my crotch. I rubbed her stomach gently with my thumb as my hand rested on her belly. She stayed up 2 hours past her bed time so it wouldn't end. I thought I was back in and had made her feel better about us.

In the morning I told her last night was fun (referring to the whole night like the convo and dinner) she took it as me referring to the cuddling and said ""Wait, what? We just cuddled...thats a weird thing to say about that"" and then I told her I just really felt peaceful finally after a lot of inner turmoil. She then said ""you know you're friend zoned right?"" and it caused me to crash back down to Earth yet again. On the way to the airport I told her I wasn't okay with being friend zoned but that I also wanted her in my life no matter what (I've never found anyone male or female that is so like me - again I'm weird AF - and so easy to connect with). She was a bit confused by that but I think she understood. I brought up a possible LDR thing and she shot that down and even shot down simple zoom dates.

Anyways...point of this is. After living a long life of failures and connecting with unavailable people. I gave up on it and quit and was happy not having my heart crushed over and over again. This girl then comes literally out of no where and reactivates that entire dating aspect of my life and I was psyched thinking THIS TIME its going to be different...this time she's actually going to want to touch me and I'll finally have someone to embrace and give my love to. I was so convinced of this because of how easily and deeply we connected. But STILL NOPE.

It's like there's some person controlling the dating aspect of my life and literally just forcing me to never be able to experience romance or love. I have a LOT of love to give and a gigantic hole to receive it in but I never EVER get anything and it really makes me want to give up on life.

She works on Fridays and every weekend, I work every weekend. She's only interning here for hours toward her master's, and she'll be leaving in June. She seemed really interested in me (not noticing it was time for her to go home while talking, having extended conversations, sharing things and finding a lot of similarities in our likes and dislikes, ""Omg no way!"" Kind of things, etc, laughing at all my jokes and so forth) and I don't find myself interested in people very often so I was like alright this woman is amazing I gotta ask her out. 

Well, when she was going home I caught her outside and asked her if she'd be interested in letting me take her to dinner and she smiled and said ""Yeah hit me up"" so I messaged her later to follow up a little and she didn't answer. I see her the next weekend and she's like ""I felt so stupid, I don't even have messenger on my phone and I didn't give you my number"" so anyway she had me put my number in her phone. I texted her later ""Hey, sorry if I made you feel like I was pushing you to hang out earlier. I'll be honest, you're one of the most awesome women I've met in a long time, and I was excited to get to know you more after I asked you out hahah. I know you are beyond busy with work and school right now though, so anyway I didn't want you to think I was trying to be pushy lol. And I feel super neurotic for texting you this, if I know anything about you so far though you'll probably read this and laugh. Hopefully.""

She replied  ""Awwww thank you!!! &amp; hahahahah yes you hit it right on the head definitely laughing!! I didn't think you were being pushy at all!!! Yeah I'm busy but I'll find time definitely so don't worry!!""

I've tried starting conversations with her through text, with direct questions like ""How's your day been? "" but she doesn't answer. Now, she literally works 7 days a week, has school as mentioned, and has 30 or so clients on her caseload. I can't figure out if she's genuinely busy, and I'm just overthinking or if she lost interest and feels like it would be awkward to say it and is just hoping to let things fizzle out, or if she's interested  and just isn't the type to talk to their love interest much.

The rational part of me, so far is working on the assumption that she's just genuinely incredibly busy, and is interested based on the interactions we've had.  The anxious wreck part of my brain keeps going back and forth on ""maybe you made her lose interest"" ""what if you said something that made her change her mind""  and mostly that's because I don't find people I'm interested in romantically that fit my personality type and I really like her so far. I just don't want to fuck it up, and figured you guys might be able to give me opinions on if I should just accept that she's probably lost interest, if I'm overthinking it, or if she is still interested but wants to keep it casual.

You meet the women of your dreams, but you don't realize it because you are numb to dating, you became a selfish prick.

However, she is actually just giving you her all and all the love she has, but you see it as fake and covering up something.

Hi everyone! 

I (20F) have been “talking” with a guy (26M) for almost a month now. We had been friends for about 6 months already. I discovered a whole side to him and we have clicked in a way I never have before. We recently had a few days where we spent a LOT of time together and he finally got the hint that I liked him a bit more than friends. He asked me out and we had an AMAZING date. Honestly. His personality is the best ever and I’ve really never dated anything like it. He’s sweet, hilarious, and incredibly respectful. The date was so easy and it just flowed. We actually met through (irl!) e-sports tournaments and have everything in common: from ideals, mindset, to passions &amp; hobbies. I also really care about how this goes because we are part of the same (large!) friend group. I’ve never had more chemistry on the first date in getting along with someone/having fun, even just doing the stupid small things. The night ended with anime, geeky movies, and cuddles until I fell asleep on his chest on the couch. It was like a movie. He has told me he had an amazing time after every time we’ve hung out and he asked me out again at the end of the night.

But…
During the last part of the night he asked to kiss me. I said yes and it happened. Okay… we were both kind of tired, but it was awful. It felt like he opened his mouth really big and tried to use tongue immediately. I couldn’t even feel his lips and it somehow felt like our mouths just didn’t “fit.” Maybe it was just nervousness or he was just smiling? He said sorry and tried again. It was the same awkward thing where it just felt like I couldn’t even meet his lips. It wasn’t even that his breath stank or anything like that. When he dropped me off we were both joking about a “re-do” next time. I know y’all will probably just say communicate and try again but I am in my head about it, and don’t  know how to explain my “kissing style” if he asks. I have never experienced a bad kiss like this and just want to know how it could get better, and how to possibly help that. I have always been told I am a good kisser but this felt like a wall. It makes me worried that there isn’t going to be sexual chemistry in that sense, which I feel is really important. But our time together was absolutely amazing, and I know I definitely want to go out with him again. I am super worried on how to respond if the kiss is that bad the next time though. What do I do?

So I hear all the time about how men deplete their savings when they meet the wrong women and I'm a modern gal you know like I make my own cash and I contribute I got my own place so I kept dismissing this as a ""oh the man is old"" or ""This happened back in the day but not nowadays.""

I remember one of my single guys friends was dating around and told me he wanted a girl that was smart enough that he wouldn't lose his savings for her and I laughed it off like he was paranoid. AND THEN I found out that one of my friends had 30k saved up, dated a girl for a year and now there is only 6k in there?! Like how does that happen?!

This is a phenomenon that I've just never experienced before. Like with one of my exes, his bank account and investments actually GREW after his time with me!!! I want someone who will spoil me too though!! Not 24k after a year spoil but like...I want someone who would be willing to so that I can be the one who prevents him from making dumb decisions like draining his bank account.

I've had two boyfriends (there was one before in high school but I don't count that one because there is no financial responsibility yet), the first one I dated for like 6 months. He never took me out on dates, I think we went on 2 total and they were free events or events that we had tickets to.

And then the second one took me out occasionally but he was chronically unemployed. When he did have a job, he took me out on dates, but even then he was really reserved about money when it came to using it on me specifically. For example, after 4 years, I hinted at the fact that I wanted an apple watch maybe as an anniversary gift or something because I use my hands for work a lot so I'll use it everyday and appreciate it a lot. I know it's expensive so it didn't really bother me toooo much when he shrugged it off. BUT THEN after we break up after ONE WEEK of contemplation he buys himself a $5k necklace?! How do I get the type of guy that would spoil me before he spoils himself??? Because I'm the type that would drop hundreds on a birthday for him and do nothing for myself I just want someone who would do the same.

So to the boys would would spoil his women, WHAT SIGNALS CAN I LOOK FOR?!

It has good tea I swear.)

I  (21F) met this dude (24M) off of Tinder 2 months ago, and we were planning on meeting the following Friday. That afternoon, I asked if he could hang out, and he said “tonight’s not going to work,” but then he hit me up at 11 pm that same night when I was out with my friends and asked if I could come over. I left him on read because that was rude, but we resumed talking a week later.

He continued showing interest, and we would sext &amp; have some substantive conversations over snap and text.

Then, about a month ago, he was very eager to meet (double texting &amp; all), but my mom was in town, so I told him I couldn’t meet with him. I really wanted to meet him because his personality seemed fun and he is very handsome. I made my interest very known to him.

The following week after my mom left, I tried to set up a time to hang out with him multiple times, but he was dodging me. We would text in the afternoon to arrange something—getting my hopes up—then he would ignore me until around 10 pm and say “sorry i was busy.” also, one of those days, he flat out dodged my question asking when we could hang out and continued the conversation as if I hadn’t asked that question. also, his texting frequency decreased significantly that week.

The following week (last week), I was assertive, saying “my school started, and i need to know if you still want to meet up because i’m very busy and have to plan,” and he finally agreed on a definite day. We hang out, and it goes super well. He fed me home cooked food, we watched TV &amp; talked for hours. It was very giggly and flirty, and we were clearly both attracted to each other. We made out for 30 min but didn’t hook up because we were both tired.

before i left, he asked “are we going to hang out again?” and i said yes, and he seemed fairly excited. we were even talking about future plans like going to the gym together (we’re both into weightlifting).

he texts me 20 min after i leave to make sure i got home, and we continue to have some banter over text. i alluded to our next hangout, and he still seemed up for it.

the next day i was super busy because i have evening classes. he snapchats me “where are you” and i don’t reply because i also took a nap when i got home. he then also texts me “where are you,” and i replied when i woke up from my nap. i thought that was a little odd.

the following day, my dad is in town for my birthday, and i snapchat the guy from a restaurant. he asks “are u on a date” and i responded about 30 min later saying “yes but with my dad lmao,” and he ignores me for the rest of the evening.

i pretty much didn’t hear anything from him at all that weekend except “happy birthday” which was nice, but it’s just kinda weird that he was ignoring me even more out of the blue. especially because he was acting kinda jealous??

this week he was ignored most of my snapchats. as much as i wanted him to initiate the second hangout, i thought “what the hell,” and asked him (yesterday) if he was available on friday. he replies “Depending on some pending things I might be free you got something in mind,” and i say “leg day and dinner. just let me know asap because i have to get back to my friends about friday plans” because i wanted an answer &amp; also want to spend time with friends. he replies “Ok, remind me Thursday night I should have an answer by then.”

i’m sorry, what??? am i going crazy, or is that just weird? i’m not going to pry information out of someone wtf. i really like him, and this has been causing me stress, but it feels so disrespectful of my time (i'm a college student w/ an internship &amp; studying for the LSAT). whether he is or isn’t free, he should let me know, right? i haven’t sent him a reminder because i feel like a clown chasing someone who is most likely just more interested in other people. i also left him on read on snapchat (just a convo about tv shows) because i don’t know how to respond.

I'm a very late 20's guy. About a year ago I met an incredible woman and fell harder than I ever did. She was everything I was looking for. Cute, funny, smart as shit. 20 minutes into our first date it felt like we'd known each other for ages. We talked all day every day for 9 months and never ran out of things to talk about. She's a resident physician and busy as shit but she made time for me every single day starting from the day we met. 

We talked about everything. We talked about marriage and kids and life goals and I really felt like she was the one I was gonna marry. She spent thanksgiving with my family and then ran into her high-school at Whole Foods 4 days later and was gone within a week. 

So I did the only thing I could think to do and put myself right back out there. It was kind of a delayed hurt. For about a week after she left, I felt like I had learned so much through that entire experience and was ready to meet the one. After a week, the hurt set in but I was determined to move on. 

I've been on about 20 first dates, a handful of second and met one girl I've been seeing for about a month. I feel like she's someone I'd really want to be with but I can't stop comparing her to my ex. I'm having a really hard time getting away from comparing everyone I meet to my ex. I've met a couple really sweet girls since we broke up but I psychologically ruin any potential by immediately comparing them to my ex. So I just decided to ignore it and push forward with this incredible girl who checks every box I have and then some. But I still can't stop comparing her to my ex. And my ex was far from perfect. But it worked really well. I'm busy with my career and she was busy with hers and we made time for each other.

She seems to not be able to fully let go out of her narcissistic ex/baby daddy. However, there are good things she wants to take things slow and establish healthy boundaries between us. She went a week without talking or texting me until today. I asked why and she claims it was due to her crippling anxiety. I also cannot tell if she likes me or not. When I flirt with her she doesn’t flirt back like at all or even really attempt to flirt with me. She claims this is because she is demisexual and it takes awhile for her to actually like someone and be attracted to them. She is also a single mom and due to her abuse has no established work history really and it just be difficult for her to find good employment. I have states I do not really want to financially take care of someone and she says that she’s gonna get a job and support herself. However I worry dude to her crippling anxiety she may not be able to hold one. Also it may be difficult for her to find a good job because she has face tattoos. Am I over thinking?

I asked her if she wants to break up and she said she didn't know, she said she doesn't want to hurt me because I have nothing besides her(true, I have no firends and family to lean on it's just me her and her parents I've been with them since October of last year due to my aunt telling me to pay 1k a month or leave) and she wants me to be happy, I've told her I want her to be happy even if it means that I'm not, I told her that I love her, that's what I really feel, that I want to spend my future with her, and when I asked her what she wants she says she doesn't know, that she doesn't want to hurt me, so I told her she needs to think about it, I'll try harder to be more friendly/approachable (when we go to her family friends house I usually just sit on the couch because I feel weird/awkward, this is apparently being portrayed as standoffish without intention, I'll gladly have a conversation with anyone who wants to talk but I'm just not one to go out and start a conversation) I also told her she needs to make a decision, if she doesn't know if she loves me anymore and doesn't see me in her future then I need to know, again she says she doesn't want to hurt me, so I told her of she doesn't make a decision, I will, and that will be us breaking up and going our separate ways because I won't let her be unhappy so I am because I'm not that selfish.

I don't rely know what to do, I think I've done all I can but I don't know, I genuinely love her, I want her in my future, her mom gave me the ring her mother was proposed with and asked me if I wanted to use it to propose to her daughter, and I told her yes. I'm committed to be with her but if she's not gonna be happy I will gladly break up with her to be happy. I've told her even if we do break up, I'll still be there for her, she asked me why and I simply said because I love her.

Tl;dr girlfriends friends/family pressuring her to break up with me, she gets embarrassed going out in public with me sometimes due to my awkward/antisocial behavior, and says she doesn't want to break up with me because I'll have nothing/be homeless living in my car

Alright for some quick context, I had very briefly casually dated this guy back when I was 16 in 2017. I am now (20F) and he is (22M)
We were good friends back then and kind of owed it to ourselves to see if we could be more. However I couldn’t make myself have feelings for him, despite him being a pretty good guy. I suppose the chemistry wasn’t there on my end. So I chose to end things on a friendly note. 
He took it mostly well and we sort of lost some contact over the years.
Fast forward, he comes back from his LDS mission and tries to get back into contact with me. I don’t mind as he was a good friend. However he kept making some comments that led me to believe he is hoping to try and date me. 
For instance I was on tinder a while ago and I guess he found me on there. He took a picture of my profile and ended up DM’ing it to me on Instagram saying that he swiped right. I kindly brushed it off and played dumb saying that hadn’t come across his profile and that it was a crazy coincidence. When I indeed did see his profile and swiped left.

Let me make it clear that I have no intention or interest in pursuing anything romantic with him at all and in general at the moment. I’m not emotionally unavailable, and I’m still in love with another guy. I also don’t want to waste his time in giving him false hope again when I know I don’t feel anything remotely romantic towards him.
That being said I’ve made it clear I’m only looking to be friends. However he is very persistent. He continuously asks me to hang out. But only specifically to go to the Hot Springs. 
My mom first pointed this out to me and she asked why it seemed like he was only ever inviting me to the Hot Springs. And she was right, he hadn’t tried asking me to hang out and go eat or go to the movies or go bowling some thing that friends do. It was only ever The Hot Springs which is a 2 hour drive from where I live.

I had previously turned down his invitations because I’m genuinely busy with work and my parents are going through a divorce process so I try to help out at home and ease the tension as best I can. But just last week he asked again and I thought why not. It will be a nice break from everything.
He tells me that he’s planning on going on Saturday in the evening. In my head I think that there shouldn’t be any conflict with my schedule as I work on Saturdays and I get off work around 3. 
So I tell him that I just need to make sure but it was a yes for the time being.
And before I knew it he texted me to say that I shouldn’t worry about buying my ticket. I was confused because I never expected him or anyone for that matter to pay anything for me as flattering and kind as the idea was.
So I quickly reassure that I can cover it and it really is no problem. But then he tells me that he just bought my ticket. Though I’m sure he meant well, I was a little annoyed because I wasn’t even sure that I wanted to go in the first place but also I needed to make sure that my schedule wasn’t getting in the way. Oh that my parents didn’t need me home. I internally say but thank him anyway and proceed to go about my week.
That was until tonight, he had texted me to check and see if I was excited for Saturday I said I was and I asked what time he was going to leave and he proceeds to tell me that he’s going to come pick me up at 1 seeing as the reservation he made was at 3pm. 
I of course I’m very confused because he had told me that it was during the evening I’m thinking this means at earliest 4 o’clock or 6. I have been out of PTO because I’ve been helping at home so I have no time that I could even use to get work off.
I communicate my misunderstanding to him and he proceeds to tell me that I could’ve told him earlier and insinuated that my “playing hard to get” was getting a little out of hand. 
This of course made me a little mad so I reminded him that he had made the choice to buy my ticket before I could really confirm that I was coming.

I know he's attracted to me bc he told me he thought I was cute and has flirted with me innocently in the past. He's very polite about it though. He also told me he wanted to meet me as we live at a distance. 

I told him I would definitely meet up with him but I realized my interactions with him may have come off a bit passive or reserved not giving off a huge indicator of interest which I am interested in him. 

After he asked me that I told him I liked him and am attracted to him but that I'm just shy at first. He responded with I like you too from what I know about you. I agreed since we dont really know each other too well.

Why do you think he asked that question given that he was probably wondering if I was into women and if I was interested in him? He's also handsome and I know he probably gets attention from women but he seems a but reserved in spite of it and he told me he's an introvert.

I went on a few dates with a guy who would just pull me closer to him and make a move, which I actually enjoyed…. But then communication sucked so I stopped responding to him after a while.

Dating wasn’t allowed in my family until your twenties.
I can’t express love without feeling awkward.
When my partner tells me they love me and I say it back they sometimes think I don’t mean it even though I do. So there’s clearly something wrong with me. I can see that I can’t show it too well but it doesn’t mean that I don’t love them. You can’t be expected to change overnight, it takes time.
I can feel that my mum wants my sister and I to be married within our twenties but I don’t even have the basics down lol she’s doesn’t give advice on these type of things, actually she doesn’t even talk about relationships to us or if either of us are dating because she’d really prefer we weren’t.

When it all started I saw him once a week, we would go out somewhere on a date and then we started going to each other’s place. Today I see him 1-2 days a week, this month it was 5-6 days out of 31. Most of the time I see him after his work (late at night), sleep over, spend the day together and either leave that night or sleep over again and leave in the morning.

I would get lucky if I spent 2 full days with him, IMAGINE 3 days!! I would be so happy. He’s a full-time university student and works part-time. I understand he has a busy schedule and all this, but he clearly prioritizes me below his friends, job and studies. He sees his friends more times out of the week than me. We have never said “I love you,” only “I like you.” and I never really confronted him about his time, but he did say to my face, “I don’t have time for you.” because he constantly feels the need to work hard, study and be the best.

So how am I supposed to make this a serious relationship, when it seems so casual. Sure, he compliments me, pays for food, is physically present (kisses, hugs, have sex), but it’s like I have to fit around his schedule. Most of the time he changes it or cancels. Because of that, he gets me excited to see him, changes the plan to a later date (or cancels the same day!) and I become disappointed (mix of anger, sadness and confusion). I know only I can control my emotions, so how do I like, disconnect? It’s also my first relationship.

I know there are those who are in this exact situation or have been, what did you do and what is the best approach here? Do I be understanding and give him space, while not getting to know him as much as an individual or let this go? He also has abandonment issues and doesn’t want me to leave, but like how do you expect me to stay when you barely see me? I don’t expect this to change at all when he graduates school in two years.
