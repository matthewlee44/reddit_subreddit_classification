1,o3l1s0,1624123392,Are coffee dates a horrible idea? I'm noticing a trend where they never go anywhere.,"So I've noticed this recent trend with myself.  I get a match, we chat a bit, and I ask them out for coffee usually around 3pm-5pmish.

Every single time it feels like a job interview.  The last woman I went out with greeted me with a handshake, and I sat down adjusting my shirt a bit, and then she asked ""So what do you do?"" as she sat across from me.  They ALWAYS sit across from me.  If I try to sit moreso close to them, it feels weird since our chairs are bulky.

I then started talking about my job for 5 minutes as she sat there quietly judging.

The dates usually end with a type of hug I give my aunt.

So here's the real problem:

I noticed that these dates set a very anti-romantic tone.  Like even if there's a second date...our convos build upon what we talked about on the first date...which is usually work related stuff, so naturally the relationship just never progresses into anything other than 3ish dry dates that don't work out.

One of the women I went out with, I knew every single dry fact about her life.  Enough to write a 10 page essay, but I knew absolutely nothing about her humor or anything on a deeper level.

She then broke it off saying our personalities are different, and I'm thinking ""I didn't even see your personality outside of the 11:30 am Tuesday morning coworker chitchat.""

So what are your thoughts and experiences with coffee dates?  For me, it's like they force me to be an acquaintance with someone as opposed to a potential lover... but maybe I'm doing something wrong?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3l1s0/are_coffee_dates_a_horrible_idea_im_noticing_a/
2,o3l1th,1624123395,"A guy strung me along for 7 months, only to tell me he ‘only wants to hook up’.","I met the guy on Bumble. He was cute, funny, smart. A bit younger than me but I didn’t mind that. 

We had a few socially-distanced dates, but were never able to get too close because of Covid, and I was nervous about contracting it. He was very patient and understanding. 

I expressed that I was in the market to date somebody, not casual sex. He talked about how he didn’t like one night stands, and he “wasn’t able” for them. 

Six months go by. Almost seven. I think, ‘woah, this guy has been so patient with me. He’s been so kind. Finally, we can meet normally now that vaccines are coming out and we can actually get close’. 

I had been referencing our next date for quite a while now. And then I suggest Wednesday for our next date. 

To which he replies - after almost SEVEN MONTHS of texting me everyday - that he ‘didn’t think it was a date’ and we were ‘just hooking up’. 

Are you actually joking me? I told him to fuck off. 

A few weeks later, and suddenly he’s trying to start up a conversation again.

3,o3l4uc,1624123615,How does someone change so much when they are out the relationship?,"How does someone who treated you so amazingly during the good times treat you so horribly during the bad time

I fully just cut my ex off today, after 2 months of genuine torture of wanting him back then realising everything is not my fault to then actually trying to be civil and him then treating me horribly, it’s over and i don’t feel particularly upset or anything considering how he treated me during the end I just feel confused.

During our 2 and a half year together honestly I felt I was so so lucky to find someone like him because during the good times and the times we weren’t arguing he treated me so well like he was understanding, kind bought be flowers all the time and presents, then gave me paragraphs on how he loved me ect and so much more. But I never realised this until actually last month after the breakup he was as actually in fact very very manipulative and he gaslighted me so much whenever I came to him with a problem about him and how he acted one time that made me upset he would ALWAYS say it’s a misunderstanding or you’ve got it wrong so some other similar stuff. And I remember one specific time I first came along the term gaslighting and I mentioned he may be doing it and I wanted to work on it with him so he can stop doing it and I wanted to help him be better, but after telling him this he was like that’s such an awful thing how can you say that then he was like I can’t be in a relationship with someone who thinks I do that and I actually ended up apologising for telling him that. But yeah anyways I’ve been noticing how much it happened now that we’ve broken up and I’ve got distance from him. That being said I am not saying o treated him great either because I didn’t and I was quite unstable during the relationship which I now knkw is largely due to my PTSD which is 100% not an excuse but it’s the way it went and I have apologised many times to him. But I’m trying to Make a sense of what happened and I just don’t understand how someone could be so amazing and perfect to the point other people say what an amazing partner he is to you and I felt like that as well but then during the arguments was manipulative and never took any responsibility for his actions. Like did I make him into a bad person by treating him badly first? or was it all a lie and he was never a great person? or was it something else. I just don’t know and I’m so confused and trying to make sense of it I don’t know if I’m just making things up that didn’t happen and I’m blaming him because i subconsciously don’t want to take responsibility.

8,o3lihn,1624124606,Some people need more time then others to decide if they're attracted to you and it's important not to push it,"I used to have more casual sex until I met my ex. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't enjoying myself as much or why it always felt so wrong or got weird. When I met my ex through work/tinder, I initially rejected him bc I felt better off as friends. He genuinely liked me for me and we talked every day and hung out once a week. He never once made me feel sexualized or pressured. This went on for months until finally a different friend of mine pointed out I had a crush on him. I let my ex know and we dated and literally everything about the relationship was ideal, especially the sex. Obviously it didn't work out, but that's because we grew to be emotionally incompatible. Maybe someday we will reunite, but I've made peace with the sailing ship.

He taught me how important friendship and moving at a snail's pace is for me. And how important it is to have a partner that is willing to respect that. Now I identify as a demisexual.

So I've begun gently dating again and it's really frustrating. I've only been out of my relationship for a month now. I've been so clear with these men that I'm only meeting people for the sake of it and that I am not sexually or emotionally available at all and won't be for a long while. I'm trying to have fun with some new friends while process my break up. I feel I can manage both just fine. I've even explained the definition of demisexual. I've made it clear that my boundaries are firm. No one seems to get that.

So I've been using tinder and bumble to meet these people. I know we both swiped right, so the assumption of attraction being there is fair, but.... Just because I thought you were cute in your picture doesn't mean I think you're cute in real life... Sorry :( .... Sometimes it's the little things like a person's voice or the way they dress or if they make me feel intellectually stimulated or if they can find that sweet spot of non PC humor without sounding like an actual asshole or if they are a creative type or if they are into health and fitness.

Maybe I'm wrong for this, but sometimes I will hang out with a dude and find him unattractive. Despite not being attracted, I want to continue hanging out because I think they're cool and like them as a person. Perhaps the context makes that unfair, but I just like making friends. 

Some of these people seem to think that just because we're hanging out means they can just go in for a kiss. Like dude we just met! I told you where I'm at! Just because you are feeling some kind of way doesn't mean my boundaries I communicated with you about is out the window. 

Was showing a guy my sketchbooks the second day I met him. Walked away to use the bathroom and he was FLIPPING THROUGH IT WHEN I GOT BACK. YOU DO NOT DO THAT *EVER*. A sketchbook is like a diary. That is my brain on paper. The dude was helping himself to my brain. Now I didn't tell him not to do that, so I let it slide bc he isn't an artist and he wouldn't have considered it to be that way. However, at no point did I hand my books to him to touch. I was flipping through and *choosing* what I wanted to show him. I ended up telling him ""I don't like it when people touch my sketchbooks, but I'll let that one slide. Just don't ever touch or look through this particular one as there are things I have never shown anyone and never will."" This idiot thought it would be cute and flirty to try and snatch it from me and tell me ""what do I gotta do to see it? The more you say I'm not allowed to makes me want it more."" So basically his idea of flirting was by threatening to violate my boundaries. GROSS. He ended putting his face two inches from mine to ask if he could kiss me. Gag. Hard pass. 

Had a similar experience with another dude who was quite out of shape (I lift weights and run 6 miles 5 days a week after my active job). I'm not one to body shame, but I am attracted to people who put the same amount of effort into their bodies as I do. I would have thought he was cool, but he kept commenting on my body and appearance despite me making it clear where I'm at. He'd even interrupt me to make comments. I admit I tried to ghost him after the second hang out. Personally, I don't see an issue. Dude was creepy and annoying and I don't even know him or want to know him. He continued to text me for 3 weeks demanding to see my art and finally I messaged him nicely telling him I wasn't interested. He wound up saying he didn't even think I was attractive. GOOD!

Another guy who I actually really want to be friends with seems to really want to date me. It's hard bc I want to be real friends. I had just praised him for not making me feel pressured or hit on at any point and that he's so far the only one to seem to understand that I'm legit only wanting to be friends and not date anyone. Later that night he asked me on a date and he sends good morning good night texts every night. He's so so sweet, but I'm not ready and I'm becoming so overwhelmed. 

All this was a bad idea. I just wanted to talk about what I've learned this week and show the new drawings I made and share what I'm imagining up for my next project and make dumbass jokes. I want to hear about other ppl's lives and what their observations of the world is and what kind of music they like and see how their faces light up when they talk about their passions and their friends. Everyone I've met doesn't seem to get that. I feel so hounded.

Anyway... Please don't flip through people's sketchbooks without permission. violating boundaries isn't a cute way to flirt. Please don't try and kiss people you don't know unless it's a sure thing. Maybe ask to kiss before your pizza breath riddled mouth is only a couple inches away from theirs. Please don't excessively comment on a person's body. Most importantly, please believe someone when they say they aren't ready to date and just want to make new friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3lihn/some_people_need_more_time_then_others_to_decide/

12,o3ln1e,1624124900,Nothing worse than getting rejected by someone who's personality you actually like,"Usually, I don't find getting rejected on dates that hard, cause 90% of the time it's someone who, if I thought about it, I couldn't really see getting along with well enough to want to date. Then you really can say there was no connection.

But there's nothing worse than getting rejected by someone who you had great chat with, similar interests, who you'd wanna be friends with if it weren't the fact you want to date them. Then it makes you realize that it can't really be about anything other than your looks and if that if you aren't insanely attractive, it's barely even worth trying to date, no matter how well you get on with someone :/

For us average-looking folks, we have to literally dazzle a person with our personality and make a connection to be given a chance, whereas if you're attractive, you're given a chance connection or not. Like I've lost all this weight this year and realizing I'm just about attractive enough for the occasional hookup or date, but not a second date makes me sometimes just want to end it.

He only had two pictures on there, both with no one else in them. The guy seems great but some things he has told me, are not adding up...

\-He told me that he was born and raised entirely in the United States. However, he has a very thick foreign accent. I have nothing against accents or foreigners, but I wonder if he's telling the truth about who he is.

\-He told me that his parents own a small corner grocery store and that he's currently a resident physician. He then proceeded to tell me of multiple properties that he and his parents own in giant cities. I'd easily estimate that it would cost millions of dollars to buy all those properties, and I don't get how he and his parents could afford that if indeed they own a small store and he's a resident physician (keep in mind resident physicians do not make big bucks). He also claims they leave those properties vacant/don't rent them out. I'm wondering if he's trying to lure me with wealth (not that I'd be lured by it)

\-I asked him which residency program he worked at. That residency program has a web page where it lists names/pictures of each resident. He isn't on there at all.

\-I asked him who the director of his residency program is. He gave me a generic, first name of the guy who apparently directs it. A google web search indicates that there is NO ONE with this name at that entire program.

\-I'm in medicine too so I asked him about typical things that any resident physician should know. He didn't know them. 

\-Impossible to find on any social (insta, fb etc)

He has a very common name, so a google search of him yields thousands of results. However, none of them are him. If I google his name in conjunction with any detail he told me-part of town he lives in, program he works at, no results.

He also looks VERY different from the pics on his dating app. I'm not even sure if it's the same person, but it might be.

I'm low key terrified now. I can't think of any other way to verify who he is.

Typically small talks, but hopefully the conversation drives on without an end. With my ex when we first met and during our relationship we texted everyday and sharing memes and stuff so we always had laughs and something small to talk about daily.

I connected with someone from hinge back in Dec and chatted occasionally until around March and we basically ""disconnected"" due to me not having the courage to ask her out to meet up and also due to her busy work schedule during the winter months. She told me she wanted to ask me out as well, but she was basically working 7 days a week. 

3 months later in June, out of nowhere she reached out to me which I didn't expect. We chatted a bit and discussed a possible hike together with no date set. I reached out yesterday to see if she has plans for later that night and she didn't. So I asked her if she wanted to meet up and go for a walk around a park which she agreed. 

We met and up and talked in person while walking and I could definitely tell she was laughing and had a good smile at times. Later that night I asked if she has plans for the weekend which she did have something on the sunday afternoon, but asked if she wanted to check out a farmers market in the morning. She agreed to meet up on the sunday morning as from what I can tell maybe she is interested in getting to know more of me and to spend more time together and getting to know each other more. 

I haven't been texting her like crazy as I know it is important to not show off as clingy and to respect her and give her space.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3nu04/when_is_it_okay_to_text_frequently_or_daily/
29,o3nuq0,1624130838,"I am a 28-year-old virgin who has never had a girlfriend, I feel like I’ve waisted my 20s","Hello everyone, I feel lost in my life right now. As the title suggests I’ll be turning 29 soon and have never been in a relationship with a girl. Firstly I wanted to say that I’m not gay, I am attracted to girls and enjoy regular pr0n featuring women. I’m also a total weeb and enjoy hentai as well. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and have Asperger’s Syndrome which is a social disorder and form of autism. I was hospitalized back in 2013 due to college stress, having thoughts of suicide, and a number of other reasons. I have been on anti-depression medication ever since, I am a complete social-wreck, despite this, I was able to graduate from college with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and currently have a fulltime job. I grew up in a household with an abusive father who beat my mother, this caused my mother to have an affair with a coworker who is now my stepfather. My stepfather is not a bad person but he’s been a big source of a lot of anxiety in my life. My parents divorced when I was 10 and I lived with my mother. We’ve been moving every few years or so, so I was never able to maintain lasting friendships growing up. I feel all this has had a severe impact on how I view relationships and has made it difficult for me to form a relationship with a girl.

As I mentioned before, I have Asperger’s which is considered a social disorder and a learning disorder, because of this, I had to work twice as hard as the average college student to get my degree. Now that I look back, I miss college life and wish that I would have spent more time socializing and less time studying. I didn’t live on campus when I was in college, I lived close enough to drive to school. I feel from a social perspective now that I’m older that I wasted my college years. After college I continued living with my mother and stepfather, I was able to find a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant which I stayed at for 5-years (way too long). Luckily, due to not living on campus, I was able to graduate debt-free and now have $30,000 saved up, but I’ve missed out on a lot of social-opportunities. I spent these years soul-searching and tried learning a number of different things such as: making 2D art, making a YouTube Channel, Streaming Video Games on Twitch, Studying Japanese and becoming and English Teacher in Japan (I studied a bit of Japanese in college and studied abroad in Japan), learning to make indie video games, went to community college to try and get a 2nd degree in Computer Science, writing a book, and 3D Modeling. I couldn’t find a spark with anything, I feel that I’m not good at anything. And then the pandemic hit which made me feel even lonelier. Now that the pandemic has ended and companies are hiring left-and-right, I’ve finally been able to find full-time employment at a Warehouse, though it’s not utilizing my bachelor’s degree. I’ve been with the company for around 2 months and a few weeks ago a male coworker got upset with me for talking to his girlfriend, I didn’t know they were together at the time, I thought she was new and just wanted to introduce myself and ask if she needed help. I ended up reporting the guy to the managers. Apparently he’s already been in trouble for being too lovey-dovey with his girl at work which decreases their productivity. I can’t help but feel upset whenever I see them together as it makes me think of the whole ‘girls love bad boys’ stereotype which bothers me. That incident was the last straw, I try to be sociable and make friends, and then I almost get into a fight because of this.

Due to my heavy focus on studying in college and my soul-searching post-college which lead me nowhere, I feel like I’ve wasted my 20s. And I’ve tried speaking to girls at anime conventions and using dating apps such as tinder, but I never find any success. Girls at nerd conventions aren’t interested in me and I never get any hits on tinder even when I buy tinder gold, still nothing! Mind you, I don’t have much of a social-media following to link to my dating app accounts, but I’m not unattractive, I’m 5’8 and 176lbs. I’ve been trying get some exercise throughout the pandemic by walking on my treadmill for an hour each day. And I’m getting about 12,000 steps or so each day at my warehouse job. Like I said, I feel that the recent incident at the guy at my job was the last straw for me. I’ve been picked on for my whole life and I’m going to be 30 soon, I’ve yet to ever have a girlfriend, and I still live with my mother, I need to change something.

I’m thinking about buying a Gym membership to get fit and to become more attractive to women, I mostly want to get into weight-lifting to build arm-muscle and try to get a six-pack. I’m also looking up some apartments around my area so I can live on my own and become more independent, though I feel incompetent and don’t know anything about living on my own. I’m a total shut-in nerd but I’m thinking about getting out of my shell to go to night clubs to party and hopefully meet some women. If things continue to go downhill I’m thinking giving up on finding love and losing my v-card by joining a group on Fetlife or something or going to a brothel in Arizona. I desperately want a girlfriend and experience love and hopefully move out with a potential significant-other and grow into a man, I still feel like I’m mentally a child.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3nuq0/i_am_a_28yearold_virgin_who_has_never_had_a/

So I went on a date with this girl about a month after my ex ended our 4-year relationship. The date went well and we went back to her place. I had no expectations for the date, just wanted to have a fun date. We ended up going back to her place but I was just playing it safe. I could tell from her body language that she wanted to sleep together but I had reservations. We eventually went to her bedroom because she wanted to cuddle. Then she took a majority of her clothes off to get into bed. We were laying there and I knew what she wanted but I still felt weird from my breakup situation. So I explained where I was at, how I was recently in a long term relationship and may not be ready for another one. She understood but then still wanted to have sex so I obliged.  We still talk and after are just friends.

He shares a photo of himself and im like cool. 

Then down the line he wants to know what I look like. I was like...a description or a pic? And hes like description would be fine if thats what youre comfortable with but my photo is here even though its a little jagged (something align those words).


So i gave him a description.and asked him what his goal was for our communication.

 He calls me adorable and says this:

Well you sound adorable!
Polite and kind encouraging
I just got divorced so my heart is not looking for anything right now
Hopefully i have been that for you to you

He went on a two comment comment about his issue with people only being nice due to ulterior motives.

I mentioned how guys are never concerned about how you look unless they want something more. And he tells me that he was just curious about who he was talking to.

35,o3oo83,1624133230,"2nd date with (23f) went well but there was a small ""fight"" that I'm(25m) not sure about... wondering if I should take this as a red flag.","So me and this girl met on hinge, which I see as more the serious relationship app over bumble and tinder, but still anything goes. 

She's artsy and has pink hair, smokes weed, doesn't work right now, lives with her grandma, and is very independent. I am unemployed too and living with my parents. We both are college educated and pursuing our art. 

I say all this because I think because of our backgrounds we aren't as materially ready for a serious relationship like other people our age might be who are better of in their career and finances. 

The first date was awkward as kinda expected, but in a cute way I'd say. We went to a thrift shop, then got coffee (I paid) then just talked in her car for a bit because it was raining. 

We texted a little after, but honestly I thought the connection just wasn't there and it kinda just died. Then a week later, yesterday, I was surprised to get a text from her asking me to get drinks. Some alcohol I thought would maybe get us somewhere chemistry-wise and it did.

As the guy and someone who is older I personally want to treat my date at first and so I paid for all her drinks again even though she sort of asked me out here. I didn't mind and hoped she would perhaps offer and she did for the third drink but I still covered it. She also drove us to the bars and also smoked me out so I thought it was all good. 

Drama happened on the way to the second bar... we got in her car and we're driving to bar 2/3 when suddenly her radio just died and she got really upset. I made jokes like I'm bad luck, and tried asking her more about the radio and why it might've happened. This is my way of caretaking, and I felt weird to be in this position so soon with a stranger basically. But she was really upset by the situation and obviously it was nobody's fault and I personally couldn't even take it too seriously because we're like on a date. If it were me I'd just stay composed and figure it out later. But eventually she said like ""I'm getting really irritated by your questions"" and I think something else to that effect. I wasn't bombarding her with questions I was just trying to make things less awkward because she seemed so overwhelmed and seemed to have some deeper issues with it because her dad is a mechanic but never helps her with these things or something. Then she had another issue almost at the same time where a friend was texting her and obliging her to an errand that she couldn't take care of because she was with me. I tried suggesting what she could say to her friend to get out of it but she then said ""I don't need you telling me what to say."" Again, just trying to help. I thought she was handling these sudden issues poorly for being with new company and I didn't feel like it was good for me to stay around and personally wanted to leave. We got a little personal and it felt really weird because I don't know her that well but I was consciously trying to deescalate, but I did feel attacked though didn't show it. Eventually, she found parking by the bar, got mad at the guy who parked in front of her, and then walked like 10ft in front of me to the bar. 

I bought her drink at the bar, which I'm not sure I wanted to. But at the bar things got better and then it was an okay date. She still seemed prickly at times and I didn't know if I'd upset her with certain subjects, but I was able to joke about it a little with her and felt maybe it was fine.

But I don't like paying for drinks for someone like this. I did it because I wanted to as the guy during the initial dates, but then I felt like I was doing it out of guilt because she got mad at me, or because I wanted her to feel a little taken care of if she really can't afford a new radio for a while. But regardless it felt all really dysfunctional. I knew nothing was my fault and didn't want it to look like that me paying meant I was responsible for any of the drama that happened in the car. It was a tricky situation. 

I've been out of the dating scene for a while so it was great to be out and with a pretty girl who I could relate to but I felt really tested here. The rest of the date was fine and it ended nicely. I admit I have a thing for these types of girls and feel sorry for them and think they can change with my help but I don't want to obviously go down that road in a dysfunctional way. I don't want to tolerate another episode like that. I get some people just don't know how to act when they are emotional but I was thinking, jesus lady, grow up a little. I'm wondering if she just needs more friends who can be real with her and help her feel more capable which I think I can do without having to lessen myself or pay for things for her. I think that'd be fine for me and perhaps help me grow too but like as far as dates go I'd say it was the kind you'd hear on those radio shows about dates gone wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3oo83/2nd_date_with_23f_went_well_but_there_was_a_small/

I only really focus on one person at a time, and if I’m “talking” to someone for more than a day or 2, it means I actually like them and could definitely picture myself going on a date with them and being in a relationship with them (based on what I know about them so far) and it seems like most people don’t view it that way at all.

Hey ya'll   


So I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but it's something I'm curious about. It has been my dream recently to buy and build a tiny house, I have the finances to do so and am just waiting for things to work out logistically. One of the things that I have been told is that if I do this, potential partners may be dissuaded by it. I'm 26 and Male and am sick and tired of living in the city in an apartment I can't afford and would make a killing living in a house that I own and working the job that I currently do (Research in a Government Department). It is something that I have always known I wanted to do and it sounds like so much fun too. So my question is this: If someone you were talking to, told you they were living in a tiny house on their own land, would your interest in them still sustain?  


I have seen a ton of people out there join tiny house nation so it is a popular thing, I'm just wondering what the public perception might be?

I (21m) met this girl(20f) at my retail job. I went out of my way to introduce myself which is something i never do. We talked for a minute and went our separate ways for about a month. 

She started to sit across from me on my breaks. The break room is a pretty good size and usually not crowded so there is plenty of empty places to sit. The first two times she did this she would just sit there not on her phone or doing anything else really.  

I had seen her in the break room a couple of times before and she was always buried in her phone she was kinda in her own world. 

The 5 or so time she started doing this i started convo with her. I got to know her pretty well over the course of a few months but i am so shy and nervous that i didn’t make any moves. She seemed even more so than I was so that put me at ease. 

We would always talk about family, school, and generally about each other. She would always follow up on little details. We both started getting comfterbal with this snd did this just about every day. Usually going over our scheduled break time. 

One day she started talking about guys who liked her in the past but she didn’t like them for what ever reason. Struck me as odd and from here on out she started asking weekend plans and stuff like that. 

I finally asked for her number and she happily gave it to me. I texted her the next day. But every time she would text i would wait 10-20 minutes to respond to make it seem like i had things going on. I stoped the convo at various points for an hour sometimes two as i was very nervous and afraid she wouldn’t respond if i said something super boring. At around 7 or 8 I would just end the convo by not replying as i go to bed around this time. 

I would always text her the following afternoon, until the third day to which she didn’t respond. I assumed that she want interested but i convinced myself to ask her out anyways. 

She told me she didn’t think she could because she had a brother vulnerable to covid and hasn’t gone out/hung out with anyone and avoids going anywhere but work and home. I then asked her if she had even gone out with any one and she said she hadn’t in 5 years. 

I took this as a rejection and told her if she didn’t want me to i wouldn’t talk to her anymore. The last think i would want is for her to be uncomfterbal. She told me not to do that as she really liked our relationship. I agreed and we didn’t text until i saw her at work next. 

Avoided her the whole day until she came and sat down on my break. She was more dressed up then normal and shot me a cute wave before she sat down. We talked for like an hour and a half.  She had her hair done wearing perfume the whole 9 yards. 

That night i texted her and told her i needed to get over my feelings for her and i needed space to do that. I told her she was my friend and i dint want to cut her off if she didn’t want me to. She said she understood and would respect it but then said she felt she should of told me a long time ago but she was into someone else. 

The next time i saw her she looked upset and it seemed her feelings were hurt. I tried to apologize but she didn’t really want anything to do with me. She told me she wanted to be vague where as the last time I saw her we talked for a long time.  

Ive still never really seen her talk to anyone else so idk if it was just that she trusted me or if i was the only one who talked to her. Usually i don’t have to many women(even friends) that go out of there way to sit down and talk to me. 

Long story short it turns out she does have a bro with health problems. I don’t know if that was a valid reason not to go out with me or she was just using it because she didnt want to go out. 

Im confused why she doesn’t want to speak to me anymore because if she only wanted to be friends wouldn’t she want me to get over my feelings?

Tl;dr: things with this lady seemed to be going well until texting. This has been a pattern for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3qbmi/miscommunication_on_my_part_or_dissinterest/

52,o3qh5d,1624138676,A bit of advice needed (m 22),"Hey reddirors, 

I need a bit of advice on how to really start.

I'm in a small city (Luxembourg) and currently in an internship at the bank of Luxembourg and I didn't really bother with dating in uni. (I had a bad experience (my fault) (heterosexual)) and concentrated on getting a lot of other things done in the meantime.

Anyways, I've been here a while and I realized that I'm really not that good at meeting people. (I did theoretical physics, if that's any indication to the stereotypical level of the social contact I'm used to)

I'm pretty in shape (relatively speaking) and I realized I'm pretty charismatic in a work environment and have several projects I'm accomplishing well, but I noticed that I'm missing some human contact.

I'm pretty introverted and I don't really go out too often, though I'm pretty good 1 to 1 (and can make a killer mojito) , I still can't really go up to someone and start a conversation out of the blue. I don't really have any good role-models and I don't really  know what to expect from meeting people nor how to go about it, I kind of stumbled into a relationship early in uni and I didn't try for a long time afterwards.

Honestly, I need a bit of help with this, I don't really understand what to do, how to start nor how to really be social with like more than 4 people. 

(No, I haven't been active on the reddit, and yes I've read all the books you can advise.)

Anyways, I honestly love people, their stories, and I often have a habit of diving a bit too deep at times which I think push some people away (a pity since again, I love stories, learning from new people, new experiences and all that), and I have really good friendships with people older than me, but I can't seem to make any deep contact with girls my age and I don't really understand why.

Anyways, I hope you guys could give me some advice or at least how to get some good experiences.

Thanks and keep well,

[Break]

PS. Yes like all guys, I get somewhat insecure at times and do fall back on life experiences and achievements since that's what I have for self worth, honestly. But since almost everything I ever did was probably initiated by me since, as I said I'm not that social, I also have a hard time telling people about my life without feeling like I'm peacocking. So I try to focus on more mundane things and on the other person. Which makes me uncomfortable when they say 

""yeah I like travelling, I've been to 4 countries, where have you been?""

 how can I reply with 

""35, but I really want to hear about your experiences?""

60,o3qukq,1624139868,My Vaping Dodged a Bullet,"I met a guy on a professional networking site and what began as a professional exchange of information blossomed to  continuous conversations for 5 weeks. 
Interestingly, said guy was in the process of relocating for a job to my city and state which made me turn somewhat of a blind eye to his quirks since I really enjoyed the conversations. 
We finally met for the first time last week on the day of his relocation. Physically, he exceeded my expectations ( s/n: we video chatted but I could only see from the neck up as he was conscious of his COVID weight gain) but with it being the day of his move, mentally he wasn’t prepared to meet and was awkward enough for me to later send an email saying, hey it was great meeting you but there was no emotional connection for me and gave feedback on what I thought did/did not go well. 
His reply offered a differing perspective and he asked  if we could meet later in the week. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and agreed to meet a 2nd time. His initial email reply mentioned two things that he didn’t like and I was keen to hear more but honestly willing to overlook the first date as being a time of a hectic transition. 
We met again for the 2nd time at my place and he shared he didn’t like that I used profanity and a vape. 
Now, I was aware early on he didn’t curse but was told he didn’t judge people who do. I had a couple of drinks the day of our first meeting but liquor or not, Im not a mouth sailor and thought even if I had used 5-10 obscene words, to someone who doesn’t curse, that could’ve been excessive. I took on board that feedback as I’ve been on the receiving end of someone who cursed a lot and it can be a turn off. 
As far as the vape, we were in his dad’s car that 1st night and he had a couple of questions about what it was and I told him it’s less harmful than the food/alcohol he ingested and the air pollutants in the city. 

He shared both of the things he had issues with he was willing to overlook as he liked me. Ok, cool. Overall, the 2nd meeting was refreshing and we agreed to a 3rd date today. He was to pick me up and later asked my thoughts on a no vape rule in his car. I was rather taken aback by his ask but agreed to respect his space and I suggested I drive my car. I picked up on the disappointment in his voice as he wanted us to ride together. 
I called him back a short while later and told him I’m uncomfortable with changing who I am so early on and basically, if I cant vape, we can’t date. Had I bended to this rule in the car, it would’ve extended to my house and my feeling conscious of my vaping in his presence would made it uncomfortable for both parties. 
I am 36 and he’s 43 but overall, I felt a sense of him wanting control. I definitely know I dodged a HUGE bullet but found it interesting in my 7 years of vaping and dating, never had a guy who was turned off. Cigarettes, I could understand but vapor, never!

Flash forward to now and I’m single, and I get a follow from her on Twitter. Which is weird cause my Twitter isn’t linked to anything, my @ is completely different from what I usually use, and I don’t follow anybody I know from it. Alright cool I didn’t really mind and we caught up told her we should hang out sometime and flirted. Overall I was feeling really good about the everything. The day after that she never texted me back. I then realized that she had me blocked on Instagram for a long time(still is) which just hit me like a truck. After college I never texted her again and it’s almost been like 2 years now and she hits me up out of nowhere only to find out she has me blocked?? Also worth noting that she hasn’t been active on Twitter since 2013 which set off alarms in my head but she’s the type of person who doesn’t really show off anything on social media or post so I really didn’t think anything of it, but I sort of felt like that maybe wasn’t her on Twitter cause it’s just sus so I tried adding her on Facebook and Snapchat to let her know hey was that you on Twitter and just ask why she blocked me on Instagram. She blocks me on Facebook but adds me back on Snapchat. I’m like at the point where I don’t really care anymore. I’m just more exhausted about this entire situation.

But it's also not that I don't want to text him. I want to communicate with him and I feel happy when I see a notification from him, but I just physically can't get myself to respond in a timely manner.

He hasn't really said anything about it but he's usually the one who reaches out first and I feel really guilty about it.

He seemed genuinely interested in me, we had similar senses of humour and just clicked. He also seemed eager to see me and it felt like things were going well between us. 

Then all of a sudden, it feels like he’s gone cold. The last date we went on it felt like he was being very distant with me, and now he takes ages to reply to my texts and it feels like he’s not really putting effort in. At first I tried not to overthink it, and chalked it up to him being busy but it’s continued even when I can see he’s active on social media. Admittedly I’ve started leaving his messages a bit now too, partly out of my own vindication and then also because I’m losing patience with him. 

I sort of made a rule for myself that if he wants to see me he has to ask me out. I’m not going to try and force it if it’s not going to happen. It’s a shame because I do like him, but I’m also annoyed. I don’t understand people who behave like this.

So I was dating a girl that I met when I was 17, she was 16. We begans a friends and then we dated. I turned 18 and she turned 17. It was a lovely relationship, I loved it with all my entire heart. 

Played games together, watched videos together thanks to certain apps.

She resides in Mexico and I am in the US, Texas to be exact. I have family in Mexico so I never cared she lives there.

Both of our families don’t know we are dating.

The problem begins when, since our relationship is entirely LDR we sexted a few times, then I find out that was serious in the US. I deleted everything because I found out it was wrong, so I got rid of it and with this I meant pictures.

I am pretty sure I have a kind of anxiety health issue so I was feeling like dying inside of guilty and fear. Reading through posts of people saying how this has ruined their lives entirely and I was dying inside.

I couldn’t resist the anxiety and broke up with her so I can feel okay. I was feeling really bad because I absolutely love her.

She is turning 18 in literally 2 months, but I still did it. Our age gap is like 1 year and 6-7 months. I am is from 2002 and She is from 2003.

I have been single for about a year and a half now. I hop on and off of the major apps for a few weeks at a time. I could go on for days about how shit the apps are... Tinder has never gotten me a sing date, but maybe I'm too old. POF is so full of bots it almost not worth the time, and OKC is not much better. Facebook has a new app, and it's better, but only because the bots haven't gotten to it yet.

Ghost 1.
About 3 months ago, sitting on my couch one evening and the phone chimes. FB messenger. It's Angela, a girl I met on POF 5 or so years ago and we dated for 2 or 3 months back then. She kinda faded away on me. Just kinda stopped responding and telling me she was too busy. I remember being kinda bummed about it. She was petite red head and pretty cute. My crazy radar was flashing a little through the entire relationship, but it wasn't full red.
Anyhow, she hits me up on FB and asks how I'm doing with my new business and how are things with the kids and girlfriend. I tell her the kids are teenagers, therefore  assholes, and that I don't currently have a girlfriend. Things escalate from there pretty quickly. By the next day she is asking if we can meet up. We chat for a few days. Some of it a bit sexy. She asks me to come over and help her assemble some furniture in her new apartment. I agree, and I head over to her place the following Friday. 
Her new place is very nice compared to the dump apartments she was in when we dated previously. She has gained about 40lbs since I saw her last. (She had another kid, 4th baby, with 4th baby daddy. Lol) She is still very pretty and not what I would call over weight. We chat, and assemble her table, and have some laughs. She wants to give me the tour of the house. Last stop... Her bedroom, with a brand new giant California king bed. We sit on it. We start to make out. One thing leads to another and we have great sex on her brand new bed. (I should mention that all of her children were gone except one who was napping during our escapade.)
We continue to chat and talk for another week, and we have a date night in which I spend the night. Again we have great sex. I get up and leave the next morning. We chat for another week. Talking about a future date to the casino. 
Here is where things get weird... She claims to get sick, and diagnosed with COVID. I got tested and was negative. Her texting falls off. She stops responding completely. Not even looking at my messages. I try texting for a few more days without her responding or even looking at my messages. I give up. We are still friends on FB, I see her post here and there still, so I know the COVID didn't kill her. GHOSTED!!!

Ghost 2.
A few weeks later, I meet Brenda on FB dating. She was pretty hot in her pics. After chatting for a few days, my crazy radar was going off again, but I can deal with a little crazy for some tang! Texting gets hot and heavy quickly. Before I know it we are taking video showers together. She asks me to come over and help her pack as she is moving to an apartment from a house/roommate situation. We didn't do any packing, we made out on her porch, until things got too hot and she jumped my bones right there on the porch. Rode me like rodeo clown while her neighbor mowed the lawn on the other side of the hedges. 
We chat for a few more days. Still hot and heavy. Then she says her moving help bailed on her, and she asked if I'd come help her run a few loads to the new apartment that evening. She obviously made sure one of the first items unpacked was her bed. We have wild sex in her apartment full of boxes. 
The next day, is a Sunday, and I have things going on and kids to take care of, so I couldn't help her again. She absolutely blew up over texting and said that I used her to get my dick wet and to never text her again. No problem... My crazy radar was flashing pretty fast with this one, but I would have totally continued to see her for a while if she hadn't gone nuts on me...  GHOSTED! (Maybe this one isn't technically a Ghosting)

Ghost 3.
FB dating again... I send a message to a girl who looks familiar. I can't place it. We match, and it hits me. I took this girl on a date some 8+ years ago. For whatever reason, it didn't go any further then that first date, but I remember her being cute with a sweet ass, so I hit her up again. I ask if she remembers me. She says no. This doesn't bother me. Our encounter was breif and our lives have taken us a lot of places since then. We chat for a day. She tells me that back then she was just divorced and kinda on the run romantically back then. Not in a state of mind to be dating really. Ok... I ask her out. She accepts. We talk for a few days about what to do on our date. We finally agree on the aquarium. She has never been to our local aquarium and it sounds like a fun date.
Date day arrives, we meet at a local supermarket and she rides with me into the city. We seem to hit it off. She is easy to talk to, quick to laugh and smile, she is beautiful and seems to have her shit together. I like this one! We spend 3 or so hours at the aquarium. Laughing and talking. We walk the piers and gift shops for another hour, having fun and being silly. It's fun acting like a teenager. Things seem to be going well, so I we go do dinner back in our part of town. Mexican. We have a lovely time and I drive her back to her car. I get a real good hug when I drop her off. I'm happy. That went well. I'd like to see this girl again.
When I get home, I text her to tell her I had a great time and I'd love to do it again soon. She agrees, said she had a great time too and that she is free next weekend. Over the next day or 2 we plan a hike with our dogs. She is on board. Sweet! Wednesday comes and I text her after work to see how her day is going. She replies that is isn't good, and she doesn't want to talk about it. Ok. I can respect that. I tell her I'm sorry she is having a bad day, if I can help in any way, I'd be more than willing. Nothing.... Crickets... I text her the next morning. Good morning! I get a short response. I wish her a better day. Nothing.... Crickets... I wait until Friday afternoon, without getting a single message from her, to ask if we are still on for our date on Saturday. I get a short response that she can't, she had ""finals"". I say ok. Maybe I can take you to dinner after your done. Nothing... Crickets... I text her this morning. Nothing... Crickets... I go to FB to see if she is posting, maybe something personal is going on and I can get some insight from her feeds. She blocked me... I have no idea why. This one hurts a little.

76,o3sr1g,1624146043,Why does the excitement die so quickly for me (24/f),"I’m not affectionate with the people in my life but in a romantic situation, I’m very affectionate, open and positive. I don’t have trouble attracting a guy but it’s hard for me to continue talking to them.

It usually goes one of two ways. We meet (however most commonly through friends, either in person or online), we exchange numbers, we text and set up a date. Or they get caught up in the conversation and we end up texting. I get bored and stop.

The minute I realise he doesn’t have one of qualities I look for in men, I’m turned off. For example the most recent guy I spoke to promised he’d do something. He didn’t follow through and acted as if he wasn’t the one who suggested it in the first place. I brought it up of course (in a light hearted way) to see his character and whether he genuinely forgot. 

He instantly realised, said he knew he said he’d do it but didn’t and went all apologetic. I’m put off completely now, he’s flaky, doesn’t stick to what he says and unreliable. The conversation is dying out and I’m spotting a pattern. I’m speaking to someone new but I’m taking it very slow. I want to know his true intentions before anything. Whether it be a friendship or relationship.

Do I have to train a man to act normal and decently? I’m trying to make male friends because I have none. The whole thing feels pretentious and it makes me loose respect. 

Can you spot something that I’m doing? I’m not looking for the best of the best just someone decent I can trust with my feelings. How can I get into a relationship with someone who’s doesn’t know how to be a decent human being? Is this all just some sort of game I’m not aware of.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3sr1g/why_does_the_excitement_die_so_quickly_for_me_24f/

If you think that the date **did** go well, do you take the initiative to be the one to follow up?

Last night I tried talking to her about how I feel and she gets quite and changes the subject. I asked her at that time if we are dating and she didn’t give me a direct and seer and quickly changed the subject. We both did drink a bunch though. I saw a text flash across her phone from a friend stating “so are you dating now?” She read it to me and said “what does that even mean I mean we are going on dates” then laughed and replied to her friend but I didn’t see the reply. 

She has been very forward with me in all other regards asking me to kiss her, asking for a second date, asking if we can sleep together, but she seems closed off emotionally.

84,o3tj11,1624148676,Advice- Maybe it’s all in my head,I’m a female (18) about to be 19 and the dude I have been kind of talking to is (23) about to be 24. So like for the past couple months we have been flirting at work you know like work wife and work husband type of thing. But at the end of May I moved away to my college town which is like a 1 hour 30 away. When I told him about me leaving he was all sad and finally asked for my number. This whole month of June we have pretty much spoke every day this week. It seems weird to me because I’m not the type of person who speaks to people this much. We have both shared intimate things about ourself one of them being that I am still a virgin. Which I regret ever doing because now I think he is only talking to me because he wants to be my first. He send very mixed signals from him always being the one to start majority of the convos &amp; complementing me to the next day calling my his cousin or like friendzoing me. At this point I’m kind of thinking maybe I should cut it off. No matter what happens I know for sure I won’t let him take my virginity in case I’m really am right and he was just keeping me around for that. But at the same time I genuinely see him as a good friend of mine. Part of me thinks that maybe he wants to just be friends and see how I grow and maybe come back in my life. I only have two years of college left and I’m not in that party college mindset. I grew up pretty quickly so I’m a lot mature that’s one of the reasons he started talking to me. However when a guys says i’m more mature then my peers that gives me major red flags. He has said that he is going to come see but I also don’t want him to come see me and then try to pressure me into having sex with him. But then I’m like this man is 23 like he gots to like me a little to be texting &amp; talking to me this much. I don’t know if anyone believes in zodiac signs but I am a Cancer and he is a Sagittarius. What do you guys think? Should I keep him around in my life or maybe cut it off? Also I’m really not looking for anything serious I am so young and I still think I have so much growing to go through. But I feel like maybe keeping him in my life might not be the best for me. I just don’t want him to think he’s going to hit it. Sex isn’t a big thing for me but I know for sure I don’t want my first to be to some man who might drop me after especially since we have a connection now. If it was like a one night stand I wouldn’t care. I also told him that’s why I wanted to do and he was like I shouldn’t but if I don’t make sure you are on the same page with them.

85,o3tj8e,1624148697,The loss of a soulmate,"21M
Ive had a very rough upbringing, im been treated badly, abused mentally, taken advantage of, forgotten, betrayed. The whole nine yards. Ive always felt maybe i deserve it, because my whole life has consisted of it and i never knew better. But then i met this wonderfull girl in highschool who showed me so much. She was the first serious relationship i had ever been in. I was ecstatic, i couldnt believe for once in my life, someone actually wanted to be with me. Not me trying oh so desperately to find connection, so much pain and disappointed growing up. I can safetly say that's been the highlight of my life these past 21 years, we bonded, were there for each other, shared everything, and always told each other. ""Always and forever will i love you"" the first 16 years of my life i was so depressed, shut in, introverted, and suicidal. I thought there wasn't going to be a future for me. But just in the nick of time, this wonderfull girl entered my life, gave me time, love, passion, kindness, and hope for the future. I do believe that this wonderfull girl saved my life. She was there for me in my darkest times. Loved me for who i was, and i did the same for her. She was my lifeline, the reason why my heart was still beating, she breathed new life into me. She showed me that there was hope in others. Hope that not everyone was going to leave me behind and not look back. I would have gave my life for this girl if need be. For the first time in my life, i felt genuinely happy, i felt as if nothin else mattered but her, i would protect her with my heart and soul and wouldn't let anything bad come to her. But we both got sloppy, both of us stopped putting in the effort that was needed to support a relationship over the course of almost 4 years. And it drove her away, without warning. Without a goodbye note, without the sweet words of ""Always and forever will i love you"" and to this day, it haunts me, my only thoughts are ""what could i have done better?"" ""If only i could go back and change"" ""im diferent and better now"". I was young and reckless and diddnt know better on how to treat a woman in the long term, i was never taught, and i never thought i would make it that far. Every day i regret the decisions i made, could have made, and did not make. My heart and soul long for this person, they were my everything. I feel lost, abandoned again. More depressed then ever. Because whats worse then not knowing the love and affection of another that you long for so desperately?

89,o3u3q5,1624150729,How do you convince yourself that you’re worth dating?,"It’s a bit of an odd question to ask, I know. I (21m) haven’t really tried to date much the last two years because I don’t really see myself as worth it. I don’t honestly feel like I add anything meaningful to people’s lives. 

I’m funny, and I’m a very loving person. I’m creative, and my brain works way differently than everyone else’s (to the point where I’ve never raised my hand in a classroom, because my train of thought is so derailed from everyone else’s that I often feel like an idiot) so people tend to be intrigued by that as well. I also only look for relationships, because casual sex is a turn off for me. Oh, and I tend to be a hopeless romantic. 

In the past, I’ve had three girls I went crazy for. All three of them got to know me, wanted to talk to me all the time, and eventually things progressed and we started dating. All three at some point or another told me I’m a keeper. But all three also ended things with me in really shitty ways. The first one wanted to sext, and then after we finished, we went to bed and I woke up to seeing that she blocked me on everything. I’ve never seen or heard from her since. The second girl kinda did the same thing. We were going to have sex, and after I stripped naked, she looked at me, turned cold, and asked me to leave. I didn’t hear from her again after that. Things with the third girl didn’t progress nearly as far. We had maybe kissed a couple of times and gone on a few dates before she ended things by ghosting me for three weeks. I talked to her about it, and she said she didn’t want to date me anymore, but she wanted to stay friends. I just kinda slammed the door in her face (metaphorically) after that. 

For a long time, I’ve blamed myself, internalizing the ideas that I’m not attractive, and that I did something to push them all away. Since then, I’ve talked with friends about it and opened up about my experiences with them, and they’ve helped me realize that neither of those ideas are true. My self confidence is honestly the highest it’s been in the last 3 years. I’ve lost 30 pounds rather effortlessly through working in construction. I’ve rediscovered my passion for making art. I genuinely feel good about myself. But yet I still have this overwhelming feeling that I’m not good enough to be with anyone. Like I’m just a doormat to every girl around me. It’s only when I think about dating that I feel like I’m worthless.

So, good people of Reddit, how have you picked yourselves up after shitty dating experiences? What ultimately retaught you that you are worth being loved and appreciated? I’m not asking because I want to rush into a relationship and find love immediately. I just want to try some things out so that I feel 100% again, so that when the time comes I’ll be confident enough in myself that I’ll be willing to date again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3u3q5/how_do_you_convince_yourself_that_youre_worth/

91,o3u6nv,1624150999,I have trouble gaining interest but none at all when it comes to hurt. ( M 27 )," 

I'm going to warn that I'll likely seem upset with this Post, and I kind of am, but you'll likely see why soon enough.

\----

Simply, I've never really had trouble being hurt by people but I do have massive issues with being liked by them, especially women. I'll wonder about the why's myself but that's not what my Post is about.

it's about my last three ""experiences"" with people who ""supposedly"" liked/had interest in me. (Mostly). &amp; It's about how I could not be hurt by everyone, evidently I don't know how to do that.

\---

so to start this off I'll speak of some girl who, like the other's, supposedly had interest but then said interest abruptly and reasonlessly dies. This lady was quite gorgeous but never did she say much. I guess that should have been a signal of disinterest, but she also claimed that she has issues following what people say. So I guess I can't say for certain. For days we spoke, and she proclaimed her interest in me, which I found nice.

What wasn't so nice was how the day before my birthday she abruptly starts talking to me, sends me some pictures, and before I can even respond and as I get ready to look nice for a picture for her she says that she doesn't like the vibe between us and that we have nothing in common. (I'm wondering how a person can decide that when they offer none of their interests or likes, personally, but oh well)

So be that I guess.

\----

This second one is a bit more fun; for you all maybe. A bit after that first woman I start talking to another, and this person was quite a bit more forward than. Advances were made by her, and I reciprocated.

Plans were made to actually get together, and we traded intimate photos in addition to words and a few others things. We spoke and interacted so much, I don't think I've spent as much time on anyone within a day.

However, as with the last, a day came and all came to ruin again. Turns out she was still in love with another and didn't actually like me at all.

In fact, she said everything was only because she was bored.

...So be that too I guess...

\----

This final one's honestly just bullshit, I'm sorry for being vulgar but damn, this one's today-fresh so the pain is rather strong still, and I don't like the three stings of it either. (You'll see the stings I speak of soon)

So a bit after that second girl I start speaking to another, not for long I'll admit, but it's about the closest I've been to a proper relationship. Last night we made plans to hang out for a portion of today. whihc honestly gave me sincere happiness, I've been in a city for quite a few years and haven't been able to make any friends or anything. So I guess it gave me some hope, you know?

However, here comes the first of those stings I was talking about; I wasn't the only person she invited over that day. She actually had another person over at her place for the morning. which I can't say made me feel the greatest.

How ever, supposedly this guy was so creepy that it made her not want to meet me today. This was the second sting, and it was understandable I'll give it that, I don't hold the ""not wanting to meet"" against her, the reason is sound. (I will say thought that I'm not appreciative of another's actions ruining plans of mine)

So Instead of meeting we just text for a good portion of the day.

But then comes the third and final sting, she spoke about still being interest in some person in a different town and that she wants to date them, not I.

...

...

***Sigh***

So be this too....

So I’ve been seeing the same guy at the gym for about 5-6 months but we’ve barley spoken to each other. At first I didn’t really find him attractive but then after seeing him almost everyday and I’ve taken interest. 

The first time I saw him, he seemed to look at me a lottttt more than I did to him. It felt like eyes were always on me. I then stopped going to the gym but than started again after a month and saw him again. 

We both seemed to make lots of eyes contact but then it felt like I was looking at me a lot more. However, I once brought my mom to the gym and she asked me if I knew him because he had been staring at me but I didn’t even notice. The only times I feel like he’s looking at me now is when I’m farther away. He’s either looking at whatever’s near me or at me. 

I also wanted to add that he seems older than me so I’m not really sure what to do. He also seemed to take an interest in another women so I gave up. At first I thought he was just shy but I see him speaking to everyone there so idk.

There was one guy in high school, sort’ve, but I didn’t really think of him in that way, and I had a lot of personal stuff I was dealing with. So it didn’t happen. 

I want to preface this by saying I’m in no way humble bragging, or anything like that. I’m pretty, I have no qualms about what I look like. But looks aren’t important to me, neither mine nor a potential partner. I’ve found a wide range of all kinds of different people attractive, and personality has a lot to do with it. So I’m not hung up on that sort’ve thing. But I’m genuinely a good person. I have an extremely strong moral compass, I always do the right thing even when people aren’t watching because I do things based on my own morals and not what I want other people to see. I’m nice, but I’m not fake and I’m extremely honest, but I always try to be honest in a way that doesn’t hurt people. I love animals more than anything. I’m maybe too sensitive.

I’m really logical and I look at all sides of a situation and put myself in other peoples shoes. I take pride in communicating well.

99,o3v6ms,1624154710,Coworker crush who lives in another state leaving the company - what should I say?,"I (30F) started a new job at a large company in January. Our team of people in my function is spread across the country - my job is leading our function in Texas. My first week at the company,  I was 90% sure that my coworker (32M) , who worked in NYC before the pandemic but had moved in with his parents in Connecticut, had the hots for me. I like him and have developed feelings.

On Friday, our boss announced that, after 8 years at the company, my coworker crush will start law school part-time at the University of Connecticut and work part-time at the company in the fall, before leaving for law school full time.

I haven't said anything to him yet about it because I was sad on Friday and couldn't figure out what I want to say. I'm confident that he at least found me attractive and we've been flirting and it feels disingenuous to just say ""good luck - nice working with you!"" I'm in a lot of fear, though and overthinking how to approach a conversation that I want to have Monday.

I've definitely dropped some pretty obvious hints that I like him, but have also held back from talking to him as much as I'd like to, because I've been freaked out and in fear about the potential repercussions of getting involved with a coworker and regretting it. Now, that's obviously not as much of a problem, but the fact that he doesn't even live in the same state and I've only talked to him on a group Zoom once a week has also made me fear that having feelings for him is crazy.  He had previously said back in April that he didn't want to go back to NY and wanted to move somewhere warm and I had been hoping he would move to Texas because he works with our corporate leaders and our corporate HQ is in Texas. With my job, I can't leave Texas.

The way he's interacted with me over the past 6 months, doing favors for me, despite the fact that he's more senior, and messaging me in a way that my friends confirmed was major flirting, confirmed he had a crush or was at least attracted to me. He and I have been the only ones on the team who've attended our team chit chat Zoom every week since I started and has seemed nervous when we've spoken directly. Also causing me fear, however, is that someone told me when I said I was single to ""watch out for \[crush\] - he's a player"" and when I said he'd hit on me my first week they said ""Yep, could have predicted that."" After that, I leaned back a little.

I had just messaged him Wednesday to say I'm glad he's watching the bachelorette with us. He said he liked our weekly team chit chat Zoom calls and I mentioned how I really liked them to get to know everyone - including him. He responded likewise and asked me how it was going so far and if I was still glad I joined the company and I told him it's honestly been overwhelming at times but my boss is great and he reassured me it would get easier as I get more settled.

I don't know what to do - I have to acknowledge the news that he's starting law school and am genuinely happy for him - he should be doing something bigger than he currently is. I want to at least acknowledge that I'll miss flirting with him, especially since it seems like there's been so much flirting that it would be remiss not to give him the ego boost that I was into him, since I'm confident he has found me attractive. I welcome thoughts on this, because I'm clearly all over the place and in a lot of fear.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3v6ms/coworker_crush_who_lives_in_another_state_leaving/
