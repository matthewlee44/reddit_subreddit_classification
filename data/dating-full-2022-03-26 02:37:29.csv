My circle is small and they never want to go anywhere like a bar or anything. One of them is in a long term relationship from high school. 

I’m a 21 year old straight male, 6’4, go to the gym slightly introverted but have been talking to people more and more each day asking more questions not just being a robot but actually trying to converse with cashiers and stuff. I had a girl laughing last week but she wasn’t interested in giving me her number. 

Additionally I think trying to pick girls up at the gym would be strange cause a lot of them are with someone else like another girl or guy (maybe guy friends too) and I don’t want to make people uncomfortable to be in the gym cause I’m the weirdo trying to get a number/date. Pretty small gym too. Honestly I think at the gym girls need to approach guys cause it’s so tough to tell. 

Appearance: You couldn’t tell unless I had my shirt off. I’m slightly over 200lbs with abs and it’s tough looking muscular at 6’4 for me. Most my mass is on my torso and upper thighs and butt 😭 so calves and shoulder/arms struggling. 
I don’t think I look like an f-boy.

I (F early 30s) have been talking to this guy(M early 30s) that I met off a dating app. We have been talking(texting/calling/video calling) for about a month and have not met yet. He recently had to move out of the city we both live in to a town about an hour away. I really really like this guy and I’m so excited to meet him. But his life is very hectic right now and he’s going through a lot personally/with his family which is the reason he had to move.  I was so into this guy that I kind of naturally stopped looking at dating apps/ stopped going out on dates.

I’m having a hard time being patient with his current circumstances and it at times is so difficult to just kind of wait and hope things calm down soon. There is no concrete timeline for when things will calm down. At times I just want to give up and move on because I’m afraid I’ll never meet him but by continuing to talk to him I’ll get more and more attached.

What do I do while his life stabilizes? Should I go low or no contact? Should I just move on? Should I talk to other guys? I really like this guy and I don’t want to lose him.  But at the same time I may never even meet him. 

TLDR: I met a guy online-haven’t met IRL. There’s no end date for his current circumstances that have made his life somewhat hectic and unpredictable.

It’s been incredibly traumatizing and as a result I’ve retreated so much into myself and haven’t wanted to date. However, two months ago, I met this amazing guy. Only thing is, we are SO different. He’s a 34 yr old single dad living in the country and I’m a 26 yr old living in the city. We have nothing in common. But we hit it off from the start. I’m very cautious about opening up but he kept pushing me and telling me to trust him.

He says, “we’ll see.” Fast forward to now, two months later, I’ve fallen hard. We text everyday all day, he calls me before work which means he’s literally calling me at 4:30 am, he calls me after work, and we’ve taken 3 trips together. I started having the dtr talks this week and he keeps saying “we’ll see” and that he wants to take it slow? I am so confused. I would’ve been fine taking it slow from the beginning but it’s never been slow. He asked me to be sexually exclusive from the first time we started talking. He told me early on that he only has sex with ppl he’s in a relationship with - we had sex the second time we met. He made me feel like I could trust him and I’ve told him so much. Yesterday morning, he made an off handed comment saying I was good for his ego and that hurt a lot. He’s been cheated on and burned in the past and he told me that’s why he wants to take it slow but I feel like this is the opposite of slow. I told him I’d rather be friends if he doesn’t see a future but after the ego comment, I told him I think we should stop talking. He told me I’m overreacting. I don’t want to be used, I feel so vulnerable and hurt. Am I in the wrong here? Should I apologize? We’ve only gone two days without talking and I already miss him a lot.

My Girlfriend[18] and I[19] Have been dating for almost 10 months. Now we’ve always been pretty different. I happen to be a fairly extroverted person. I get sad and depressed when away from people for to long and I become rejuvenated and euphoric around people. Wether it’s 2 hours or 9 hours it always gets my mood going.

She is introverted. Very. She needs a lot of alone time (from my perspective). Typically this involved getting home from school and scrolling through tik tok or instagram for 4 hours. She gets drained around people easily and just needs time to unwind. Fair. 

Right now we’ve been doing okay. We had two periods in our relationship that were rocky,

1.) back 6 months ago I had a drinking problem. I would become emotional and cry over everything. She tried to make me leave her room once but I didn’t because I was drunk and was anxious. I don’t remember what it was but it was probably something stupid. 

2.) 2 months ago I initiated a break. I wasn’t happy or fulfilled and needed to figure out what I wanted out of the relationship. For weeks prior I was bitter and angry. I felt unequal and that she was getting her needs met but mine weren’t. 

Now as I said right now things are good. But as of last week, things might not stay that way. 

My girlfriend is a senior. She’s finishing up high school, all AP classes. Exams out the wazoo. She took a babysitting gig last week, 3 days a week 330-645. She’s doing rehearsal for a musical. Thats going on until may 1st and it’s till 3 pm most day, 5 pm on Tuesday. She also has a group thing on Thursdays, 630-830/9. Plus homework

She’s an extremely busy person and its amazing to see How hard working she is. She’s a truly driven and amazing individual. 

That being said I am somebody who loves to be around their SO. I’m a bit physical touch person. So for me I’m happy seeing my SO 5-6 days a week. Now for her that’s to much. Fine we have to compromise that’s okay. So we had a good thing going. 3-4 days a week. I was happy with it. Now that things are picking up we’ve slowed down to 2 days a week. As time goes on I feel more and more distant from her as I see her less and less. I would say i could ask her to text me butttt, that alone time I talked about earlier? Yup. Typically she gets home and says “hey heads up I won’t be texting for a while”. I get texts in school all day but she vanishes when she gets home. Now her telling me she won’t be texting is because I used to get upset about it. So we agreed she should start telling me “hey I’m gonna go for a bit” as it made the anxiety and sadness way easier to deal with. 

That being said now that we are at 2 days a week, I need more. I need to hear from her. I feel distant and it’s hard to maintain happiness in a relationship like this. I know some people can do it but that’s now how I am. And that’s okay, I’m happy the way I am. I’m just not sure what to do. I want to see her more but she’s so busy and stressed (justifiably). I want to text her but she goes away when she gets home.

She called me tonight super lovey and excited because we’re going out tomorrow. I was fairly quiet as again I’ve felt distant. She asked what was wrong and I was honest. “Honestly I just feel a bit distant. You didn’t do anything wrong at all your busy and that’s okay, for me it just makes me feel a bit distant, but I’m really not mad at you I promise”. Those were my words. She got so sad and so fast. “I wish I could make more time for you” she said “your fine you’re doing all you can” I replied “I mean clearly not” she said in a sad tone.

Reddit, I need advice.

I love this girl to bits. I’ve had plenty of relationships but this has been the longest, strongest, and most stable one I’ve had. I don’t want to end this but I’m always really having a hard time coping with the lack of visitation for the next two months. I mean even texting me more would help but she’s expressed before she doesn’t like it. Im at a loss. I want to find a way to keep myself grounded in this relationship because when we’re together, it’s great and amazing. It’s just the time apart that kills 

TL;DR: I feel distant from girlfriend because girlfriend very busy with school work activities and other such things. Seeing her twice a week and it’s not enough.

We have a healthy relationship - solid communication, good balance of together things and solo interests, lots of laughter and affection. I feel like we’re on the same page about many values and big picture things.

My hang up is that he occasionally uses cocaine. It’s like a special occasion thing. Otherwise, he doesn’t really drink, smoke, or use other substances. 

I’m weirded out by it. I’m fairly straight-edge. I’ve drank and smoked weed socially in my early 20’s, but don’t like how I feel under any influence, so I presently don’t use substances at all. I’ve dated guys who drink or smoke a bit, maybe the occasional mushrooms, and it’s been fine. I’ve never been exposed to harder drugs.

Cocaine frightens me. I’m not sure if it’s due to ignorance and just some arbitrary line I’ve drawn in the sand, or if it’s actually a legit fear. So I’m not sure if it’s really a matter of principle or not how opposed I am to it.

I’ve talked to him about the cocaine use. From where I stand, it doesn’t seem to impact me other than the discomfort. He’s open about when he’s done it, respects that I’m not comfortable being around the use, and is willing to discuss how I feel.

I have this notion of it being horribly harmful and addictive, but he’s not snorting coke on a regular basis. It doesn’t feel fair for me to tell him what to do with his body, especially when there’s been no impact on me or our relationship. He’s a pretty healthy guy, balanced with a good job. Doesn’t seem like there’s detriment to his life.

I am extremely shy and suffer from mild anxiety, which causes me to get a bit nervous and ramble at times.

They were NOT inappropriate, but I can see how they came across as too much. 

At the end of the date, he admitted he found it too intense. I completely apologized and I explained that when I get nervous, I sometimes get overwhelmed/excited. We talked it out and agreed to give a second go, with a potential date this weekend. I said to him, “If I am less ‘intense’, would you like to give it a second go?” And he said yes. I agreed to be less intense and he promised to be less sarcastic. 

We ended up kissing. Since then, I’ve backed off and he has backed off. We still text every day.

I asked if he would still like to do something this Saturday evening (I only asked once), as my friends have also invited me out, and he completely ignored the question, but responded to everything else we talked about.

 I screwed this up, didn’t I? I’m a bit confused as we agreed to see each other again, but I think that was the end of it, too?

I don't usually go on Reddit but I feel I the need to turn to the general masses for help here. I work at a gas station in my town. About two weeks ago I met the most beautiful girl I've ever laid eyes on. She told me who her brother was, who was someone I had already been friends with for years. Then gives me her name and tells me she's ""leaving for Florida in 10 days"" so she can take her mind off school and go have a good time.

I said screw it and looked her up on Facebook and added her on there, figured I may as well. Sure enough, she DMs me instantly and tells me we should get a drink before she leaves. That same night, she invited me to a fire at her parents place, which ended up being an amazing night. A few days go by where we stayed in contact, mainly DMing on Facebook, asking each other how our days were, cracking jokes, etc. 

The second I got off work on Wednesday, I messaged her a ""wyd"" and she said she was starving. I asked her if she wanted to get food with me, which she agreed to, but then proceeded to ghost me in the same day. 

Fast forward to Thursday. I didn't message her the entire day, and right as I'm leaving the gym at 5pm she sends me a ""wyd"" and calls me telling me she wants me to come hang and that we can go get a drink and some food. We go to the bar, play some pool, have a couple drinks and a good time. Then head back to her place. She lives with her parents so her brother and his friends were there, we hang out with them for a while, and then we all head out, roughly around 3am. 

I'm not even home for two hours when I get a message from her telling me to come back over. I went back over there and hung out with her and her friend who were both drunk from the night before still. It's around 7am and none of us have slept, we are all passed out in the living room. I couldn't sleep on the recliner so I went upstairs into her empty bed. She noticed, and then called me on messenger asking me if I wanted her to join me. Without a moment of hesitation I said ""yes come here"" Long story short, she joins me, we make out and cuddle and I confess how I feel about her, how she's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, and how I'm in love with her. She tells me she really likes me, and says I'm an amazing person, but that she feels bad, mainly due to the fact that she's moving for a while. As sad as it makes me, I did my best to tell her I support her decision and that she always has a home in my arms to come back to.

My question. How do I proceed? It is so tempting to message her everyday but I don't want to be too clingy. She has her own life to live. I just want to be a part of it one day. Now she's moving for God knows how long, and I am left with an aching heart.

We met on a dating app, and everything clicked nicely in person. Found out he was in the midst of getting divorced (she cheated on him), which was ok with me because I wasn't looking for anything serious when we met. We dated for about five months, and then I moved cities for career reasons. It was hard to leave- I ended up developing strong feelings for this person, and felt that this could be a person for me- but I knew that our relationship wasn't going anywhere due to his divorce situation at the time.

After I moved, we remained best friends for a good two years. These were hard years for both of us, and we talked on the phone frequently, providing emotional support for each other. We were able to see each other in person a couple times on various trips. There were of course a lot of complexities with navigating the physical aspect of our relationship when we did see each other, as it felt hard to define boundaries and our relationship- or, we just failed to define them.

Nonetheless, the friendship was and has remained strong. We don't text/talk as often any more, but we have a solid catchup on the phone every 1-2 months. I know that I'm still an important friend to him, and he is an important friend to me.

A while ago when we were catching up, he mentioned someone he had been seeing, and it really upset me. I was jealous. I told him that it upset me, and he hasn't brought up his dating life since, and I haven't either. I've sort of adopted this *the less I know, the better* internal monologue, but that is hard, because it feels ingenuine to our friendship. There have been a few times I've brought up guys I've dated, and he has never had a strong reaction to that. I don't understand how me talking about my dating life *doesn't* bother him, if we've been physically intimate in the past, and he continues to reach out to me for emotional support.

There's a lot of layers to this, but here are some main things-

I've admitted to myself that I do have lingering hope for something more with him, but due to the paths that both of us are on, I don't foresee how it could happen logistically, if that was even something he wanted. And, I picture a scenario where we continue with our friendship the way it is, and then at some point he tells me he's getting married or something- I'd be happy for him but also heartbroken because part of me wants to be that person. I know I wouldn't be able to keep a relationship with him if he was seriously committed to someone else. I don't even know that he *isn't* seriously committed to someone right now because it's easier not to talk about! If we don't talk about it, no one gets hurt. I think he'd tell me if he was, but I also know he doesn't want to lose my friendship.

So, I've been grappling with what to do, if I should do anything. Do I tell him how I feel? Is it time to let go? Do I just leave it be?

It’s probably a me problem. There is a scene where Jo from Little Women just always gets to me. The one in the attic with her mother scene. Jo March : “Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they've got ambition, and they've got talent, as well as just beauty.

But on the other hand some of his body and behavioral language just bugs me out so much and makes me feel like trash. Like couple times I texted him I missed him and he ignored it, so I stopped sending texts like that of course although I do miss him a lot. And then today I wanted to hold his hand and he averted and put his arm around me instead. I was like ""Why don't you wanna hold hands"" and he's going all capricious at me like ""I don't *wanna* hold hands"". What the hell is your problem man. And when we kiss goodbye it's a whole ordeal with him averting my lips and going for my cheek instead, like dude you were having a blast banging me just 10 minutes ago -- and will again in the future mind you -- why is kissing goodbye on the lips so dislikable? It's just such a shit feeling when someone you've known for a while and who also trusts you acts so disrespectfully? Especially with this kissing thing I don't understand it. I asked him ""What are these half-assed kisses? Don't you wanna get horny again?"" And he was like ""No"". All defensive-looking and zero elaboration so his ""No"" ended up being like, completely uninformative and evasive. Maybe my question was just worded poorly and he misunderstood it. But it's very difficult to wrap my head around why someone close to you wouldn't wanna kiss you goodbye on the lips after a date.

I was drunk in a bar, and he got me a water. Thirty minutes later, I was unable to walk or move. When getting escorted back to my room, he tried to stay with me, but another guy prevented him from doing so. I’m pretty sure he roofied me. I’ve always known what his intentions were, but I’m not turned off by what he did. 

If anything, I have feelings for him. No other guy has liked me that way before. Maybe there have been other guys who liked me, but none have ever been so overt about their interest in me. We’re still social media friends, and my hope is that we can get married and live happily ever after together. Another thing that didn’t help was that at the same time, a guy that I really liked had a girlfriend. He kept the fact that he had a girlfriend from me, and I was so disappointed. So I redirected my feelings for my crush onto this other guy. I feel like my original crush didn’t fight hard enough for me. Isn’t that what love’s all about? Fighting for someone, even when it’s difficult? 

Given how confident he was with me, he likely has done what he did to me before. It disgusts me if he has done it to other girls, but he did tell people that I was the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, so hopefully he only does bad stuff to me. I admit, I’m a virgin, never had a boyfriend before either. I want to have sex so bad. I know he’ll likely hurt me really bad, but he said that I’m the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen. He told mutual friends this. 

I want to get married to him and be financially dependent on him. I want to be pregnant with his children, and have lots of babies with him. Knowing what I know about him, he has some abusive tendencies, but not to worry. I won’t let him hurt our babies. I’ll redirect his anger and frustrations on me. No one has ever loved me before, and he’s the best I can do. I don’t want anyone else, just him.

I know it’s wrong. I know I should be disgusted by what he did. If a friend told me this happened to her, I’d tell her to run for the hills. But I don’t know.

But this past week, he's been asking to come over and hang out even though we already have a set date this weekend. I declined. I make plans ahead of time because of my busy schedule. I have hobbies and a social circle too.

We've talked on the phone a few times and it always involves a lecture or him questioning who I'm with. I live alone so I'm usually....alone. I tell him that and he acts like he doesn't believe me. I've been straightforward from the beginning. First, I have no reason to lie to this guy that I don't even know. And second, it's really none of his business.

He's mentioned repeatedly that he likes women who know what they want, implying that I don't know what I want which is false. He says that he's used to meeting women who are ready too commit and that they usually end up having sex almost immediately. I told him I'm not interested in sex but he keeps mentioning it. He's trying to manipulate me into letting my guard down and it's not happening. I honestly don't feel like talking about this with him anymore.

First, thank you for all the comments and well wishes. I thought my original post would be well received but never imagined it blowing up like it did.

We’ve gone on many more dates since my first post. I am still head over heels and we are going very strong. I still can’t keep my hands off of her. We still kiss or make out every elevator ride without company. I don’t see that changing anytime soon.

 I asked her to be my gf a little over a month ago and she said yes. We’ve seen each other every day for the past week and I still can’t get enough of her. We tell each other we miss each other even after a day or two apart. I feel so close to her.

This past week was her birthday. We celebrated and had an incredible time. I took her to her favorite restaurant and then had some fun activities planned afterwards. I had a lot of hotel points saved up from work and surprised her with a three-night resort trip to Cabo. We’re going to plan it this week. 

She met my family this past weekend. We went out with my parents and brothers with their girlfriends. It went very well. 

Today she told me she was looking out text convo up in the message app and typed “baby” instead of my name. I’m still melting thinking about it.

Coffee shops may be a good acception.

I’m also into video games and geek culture and so I’m sure places like comic con may be good places.

But the thing is I want to meet women in places where I can go frequently.

But another thing too is that I live in a small town which means that even when I go to a coffee shop or whatever, chances are is that I’m going to see women farrrrrr older than me.

I only recently started dating, and I'm in my late twenties. I've had hookups and flings, but never a real relationship and have started to date properly. And I'm just finding, that dating really sucks for women.

I would consider myself a demisexual women so a mental connection and hitting it off is important to me above all else. I've been using dating apps, and I'm just finding several aspects difficult. For one, this generation seems extremely comfortable talking online, but not in person. I find that I'm the same on or off, perhaps even more vulnerable and open in person, and more reserved online and have difficult sharing. I find that a lot of this online banter translates poorly when we end up meeting in person. Sometimes when I meet up with people they can't even look me in the eye! Second, I don't think I'm a bad looking woman, but I am definitely not a stunner either, and I make an effort to post natural and what I consider accurate photos of myself, but this is generally not the other way around.  I realize that maybe makes me sound shallow, which I don't believe I am.  I just see it as being more transparent, but in doing this I find that I don't get a lot of initial interests, and I'm wondering if maybe it's because people think those are the best of the best photos I'm using? They aren't. I'm actually very photogenic. But I know that and so I don't want to use photos where I look great because I don't feel like it's truly representative of myself in person, and could set people up for dissapointment.  It's not about being shallow, it's just about less people even considering to open up a conversation with me because of how they think I look. I am also direct and I don't like playing head games or hard to get. I'm very up front about my feelings and I think honesty and transparency are important, so I don't appreciate the vagueness that I find a lot of men use, and give you just enough to think they \*could\* be interested.  

People say dating is meant to be fun, but so far it's just felt like let downs, dissapointments, and work. Sub-par and mediocre, or atleast for what I was expecting. Do men also feel this way about dating? Is it work? Do people actually have fun dating? Or do they push through the first few dates even though they suck to see if they can actually get somewhere? I know a lot of women who didn't enjoy dating and say they just have to endure the beginning. Do guys feel like they have to endure the beginning? It seems like they have more initial interest, and it takes women longer to develop this. Why does dating suck for women? Am I the only one feeling this way?

Truly my experiences haven't been great. I was ghosted by someone who texted me for two weeks saying regularly that they were eager to see me, but when we made plans they ghosted me. I should point out that they ghosted me for our second date, and it was after the first date they seemed eager to see me again. Not uncommon though, I know. Someone else thought it was okay to tell me straight up that they thought I was autistic, made snide remarks about my clothing choice, and slap my ass. I've generally been let down, and I guess I'm struggling with my expectations going into everything because it seems each time I lower my standards, but I still have to lower them each time yet when I meet the person.

Am I just a lofty dreamer and a hopeless romantic?

I recently went on a date that was ok, and it was the best of the lot. I didn't feel like I had to work as hard as I normally do when going on a date and I felt more at ease.  Again though, it felt a bit like a letdown when we did meet, and that our conversations before us meeting up led to dissapointment. Should I keep going forward with this?

Not being allowed around their friends/family, being referred to as a friend when being introduced to people, having to straighten my hair to look ""presentable"" on the rare occasion that I'm introduced to a family member. 

What steps can I take to avoid this type of behavior going forward? Its extremely difficult to assess racial tension because I'm not meeting their family right away. If we bump into them accidentally while out on a date then I'm able to pick up on it right away but there's usually no other signs that I'm able to pick up on in the early stages.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I am trying to take a step back and turn things off a bit before I let her down, but without being rude. I am fearful that maybe I have already hit too hard.

I've always been hopelessly in love with her. Now, she's broken up with her ex. We're good friends, however there's so many mixed signals it's driving me crazy.

Bit of backstory - even when she was in a relationship there was a connection. I wasn't the only one who noticed. I've had people ask if there's something going on, I've had guys recommend I ask her out. There's an obvious 'synergy' between us.

Since she broke up, there's been mixed signals. We text or call each other most days, we're both quite into fitness and she's started joining me on some of those hobbies. We're good friends, however she's refusing to go for drinks with me with an excuse of saving money.   She genuinely does have some financial pressure atm, but she's always going out drinking with her girlfriends etc. so it is an excuse. \`I would normally take this as a hint and move on, but she'll flip flop and kind of tease me with the prospect of doing it in the future. Otherwise she can be *very* flirty. It's almost obvious to me there's something we could grow on, but there's an invisible barrier preventing things from progressing.

I'm not sure if she's rejecting me, trying to take things slow (she has a lot going on in her life atm. Inc. financial strain and a relatively recent messy breakup), or I'm not being direct enough ( i'd become very used to hiding my feelings from her and I've not been very direct since her breakup out of concern of me working with her, not wanting to rush her etc. because of the former). Recently I've noticed she's been kinda flirting with other men and also obviously not giving me any attention in group settings.  I've been getting really hung-up over her and i need some closure. I want to tell her straightforwardly I like her, she must know this at this point, but I need closure. I'm fed up of the games.

Thing is here is where I need advice: I don't want to be that fucking guy who's fallen too hard, missed bad signals or made excuses for them, and kept pushing. What if she's just annoyed at me for not accepting her hints? I've never been in a situation where I need to clear the water is this way. I want to respectfully tell her, being sensitive to the fact she might think she's already given me enough bad signals and continue our friendship if she doesn't want to take it further.

I’ve (f24) been speaking to a guy (m22) let’s call him Johnny, for over 7 months now and I’m really, incredibly attractive to him. However, for about a month he has been giving me mixed signals and not texting me as much as he did in the past. It’s always me initiating conversations and asking to meet up etc. Since a couple of weeks, the ghosting has become overbearing and when I confronted Johnny about it, he said he’s really busy with work and university but that didn’t stop him in the past from texting me everyday. Now we can go days without texting and he just doesn’t seem interested. When I asked him if he’s still interested in me, he said he is but he doesn’t think he’s a relationship type of guy and prefers his alone time. We haven’t done anything sexual yet but after every meetup (we’ve only met twice) he says he wanted to do this and that with me and seems to genuinely want to become intimate with me. 

We met online and never face timed before meeting up and I have a feeling he thought I was more attractive in my pictures compared to in person and is trying to end things by simply ghosting me…. But then denies losing interest and says he’s still attracted to me. I’m literally so confused at this point. He doesn’t want to be exclusive, however at the same time when I brought up the idea of us going on dates &amp; meeting other people, he said he doesn’t like that idea. Last week, I had enough and downloaded bumble and matched with a guy and we both clicked off really well and planned on meeting the next day, however, the morning of meeting up with him, I felt incredibly guilty because it felt like I was cheating on Johnny (even tho we aren’t in a relationship &amp; he had been ghosting me) so I told the bumble guy that we should reschedule. So we decided to meet the coming Thursday, however I ended up telling him that I don’t think it feels right to be going on a date with him since I still have feelings for Johnny and it feels wrong to go on a date with him since Johnny clearly stated that going on dates with other people doesn’t sit right with him.

I have also lied to Johnny multiple times before, for example.. I wanted to meet him a couple of weeks ago and end the situationship we had going on, however he said he couldn’t meet me since he’s busy but I told him I’m going overseas and would never see him again so he finally gave in and met with me. Then a week later I messaged him and told him I really want to continue speaking with him and apologized for lying but he said that left a bad taste in his mouth. However, if he wants to end things because of me lying to him then why doesn’t he just tell me? Why isn’t he communicating with me? And isn’t he also lying by saying he’s still interested in me when it seems like he’s not? 

We’re going to meet soon to talk about this in person but I genuinely don’t know if this relationship can be saved. I’m scared to lose him but I know I haven’t treated him the best because I’ve lied in the past as well (on information about myself since we did meet online and I’m a private person) and I promised him I wouldn’t lie again but I did.
