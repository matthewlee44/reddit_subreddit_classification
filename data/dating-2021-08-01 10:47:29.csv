0,ovv164,1627834598,"So, how the heck should I be feeling during the dating process?","21F. Never been in a relationship in my entire life.
I've only just dipped my toes in this ""dating"" thing.
But because I'm such a newbie, now I'm overthinking things, since I don't actually understand how I should be feeling during the early stages of dating someone.

I met a great guy, recently. After a week of messaging on a dating app, we went on our first in-person date. It was easy and time passed super fast. I only planned an hour, but the date lasted three hours! It was mostly ""getting to know you"" small talk. 

Now we have a second date planned, and we're texting in between. However, we only send messages a couple times a day, because he replies very slowly. Again, the messages are pretty basic small talk. 

I'm beginning to overthink things, because I'm demisexual, which means that I only feel sexual attraction to people whom I have an emotional intimacy connection with. So, right now, I can tell that he's super physically attracted to me. But I seem to either:
A) Not understand what early attraction should feel like 
B) Not feel attracted to him 
C) Both?? 

We've only known each other for just over a week, and yet, I'm overthinking things because I have no idea how I should be feeling towards someone who I'm dating. And currently, I think I feel little to nothing.  

Here's what I have so far: 
-I think he's got great qualities
-I want to know him on a deeper level, but it really hasn't happened yet, and I worry it won't happen 
-I think about him all the time 
-I'm comfortable and can be myself around him, in person 

But I don't feel the ""butterflies"" or the ""spark"" or the ""physical/sexual attraction"", I don't trust him yet, either. 

So many of my friends tell me, when they're dating someone new, ""Wow I feel so physically attracted to him, I wanna kiss him all the time, blah blah blah"" 
And so many stories are like ""love at first sight"". 
But I feel nothing of that sorts.

She wants to be only big friends and spend a lot of time together, but also she looks like she wants a relationship. She invited me to her home alone, which was the first time she did it. She is very shy and never lets anyone in. Texts me all the time and shares very much. She is planning trips with only two of us and so on. I know the ""she is playing with you only till she finds another guy"", but what should I do? I still kinda like her.

Anyways, we have had a few dinner dates and catch ups over the last few months. Recently I've noticed some hints and things he's been saying or doing that seem like he's not interested anymore. Like for example just tonight, he told me that I message him to frequently and that I don't drive which he says he is sick of having to pick me up, for dates or catch ups. I don't drive cause I haven't learnt yet. 


But as for the messages. He says I message a lot when he's busy with work other things he's doing. I don't expect a reply straight away, but he does reply when he can. In the beginning he would message me all the time, even when he's supposed to be busy. He would message me while I'm at work etc.  A lot of flirty messages all day every day, back then he loved talking to me often.

Now he says he will message me when he's ready and I should wait until then. 


I've asked if I do fit into his life, but he seems to dodge the question a lot. Mentions his life plans. We even talked about our future previously.


 I've told him I'm very interested in him still, but he seems lately to not reciprocate those flirty messages. Or much else


I guess I already know the answer... But damn it hurts.

10,ovw3al,1627838003,I didn’t fucking listen…Should I wait?,"TLDR: I have feelings for a crush, she just broke up with her BF of 5 years. She likes me back as I heard from one my friends (who is a girl) that is friends with her, but she is not ready to talk to anyone else yet. I took this as a rejection and feel terrible. My friends say I should just take things slow with her, become closer friends with her and wait till she is ready..My question is should I? Or should I just move on? I would really hate to pass this up as I think me and her are very compatible and that this can work with some time, but I’m not even sure if it’s worth the investment all for it to come crashing back down on me. 

I’ve read every post I could on here about this situation before I took the leap of faith. I knew what I was getting myself into, but any chance for love is a chance I’ll take.

I 23M have a big crush on one of my friends 21F, she just broke up with her bf of 5 years. Have not known her long, maybe half a year now, but within that time we have become fairly close. We always get along, I always make her laugh, we have the same interests, and we hold the same core values and life goals. We all hang out with the same friend group and do fun stuff all the time. A friend of mine that is girlfriends with my crush, told me she (my crush) likes me as well and can see us together; more specifically she likes the way I hold a conversation, my intelligence, my jokes and that we hold similar interests and values that she didn’t have with matched up completely with her previous relationship. 

I was going to tell her how I feel yesterday, but was informed by my friend that she just wants to focus on herself at this time, which I get 100% as she is still emotionally upset from her previous relationship. I took this as a rejection, as I’ve heard when girls say that “they wanna work on themselves” or “aren’t looking for a relationship” is verbal judo for “im not looking for a relationship with you”. Not sure if that applies here tho, as my friend told me that’s not what she means or was saying last night.

I’m not trying to pressure her at all into anything, nor am I trying to be a rebound to her. I fell pretty bad I’m coming out with this now at this time and don’t mean to put her through more bs than she needs. We’ve talked about her relationship with her ex before together, she said she has thought about breaking up with him for over a year and finally did it, I figured she was mentally over him, and that it was a good time to let her know how I feel. 

I would like to stay friends with her whatever the outcome, even tho I know that will be very hard on my self. Just not sure if it’s worth it to wait around. Feel the answer is sadly No.

Fast forward to today - I needed to use the computer quickly and his iPad was sitting there so I grabbed it. Honestly I didn’t have the intention of snooping at first, but Safari was open with the search history displayed on the side. I should have just closed it but I couldn’t help myself and I looked. 

Just a few hours ago he watched several porn videos while googling his ex girlfriend at the same time, according to the history tab. At this point I was enraged so I looked further and found he’s been watching porn almost daily, even on days he didn’t want to have sex with me. 

I don’t know how to feel about this. I understand that porn is relatively normal for most people, but looking for pics of his ex really bothers me. 

I’m not sure how to bring it up with him because I wasn’t supposed to be snooping through his stuff, obviously. That one was a breach of trust on my part.

""the girl in the pic is a family friend but also an old gf from years ago, we haven't been together in years but my mom made that artwork of her so I still have it in my apt. I'm still friends with her and see her sometimes around the holidays. she's really good friends with my sister too and was one of her bridesmaids at her wedding.""

I've told him it's strange regardless esp when I'm trying to have sex with him and I said if he still had feelings for her it'd make sense. He said he doesn't see it that way and it's just a nice pic his mom took and gave to him as a gift after their breakup...

I'll say that it sounds like he cares since he explained much more than I needed to know (the holidays, sister connection/bridesmaid) but isn't it still weird?

25,ovxuy1,1627843794,This guy made me want to give up on dating,"I had a pretty close friend, Anna. We had been friends since we were little kids, but just within the last 6-8 months we started hanging out quite often.

She told me she had a single cousin, Kevin, who was “such a good guy”. I told her i wasn’t really interested in a relationship, and i thought she respected that.

She invited him to hang out with us (without me knowing) and he was WEIRD. I don’t know if it’s just because he was overly nice and it’s almost like it was creepy, or what. It was awkward hanging out with him, and after the fact she gave him my number.

I’m not a rude person and i always feel bad so i did text him, but i told him out front i wasn’t ready for a relationship but we could be friends. He seemed to be understanding, but kept overstepping his boundaries hard core.

There was a time that her and i hung out at her house, with our kids. I specifically asked her to not invite him this time because i didn’t want a random man around my child. She promised she wouldn’t, but he ended up showing up anyways.

I only stayed for a little bit because i was helping her do something, but during the time that i was there, he took it upon himself to discipline my child for taking her child’s toy. It made me seriously uncomfortable because for 1.) he had never met my child before this. 2.) him and i weren’t dating. 3.) he is not my child’s father. He could have said something to me and i would have corrected my child, considering we were all in the same room.

After i left, i didn’t text him back, and he went and complained to Anna. She confronted me and told me i was being over dramatic about it because it’s not like he was being “mean” to the kids. But my thing was, i asked for him not to be there since my child would be around, he still showed up (don’t know if she invited him behind my back or if he just decided to show up on his own) and the fact he felt he could take matters into his own hands with a child he had never even met.

I stopped hanging out with her for the simple fact of never knowing if he was going to be around or not, and it sucks because we were hanging out quite often.

I ended up just completely ignoring him until he finally went away. Anna is still mad at me over this, because i didn’t “give such a good guy” a chance.

28,ovy36m,1627844530,(Tinder) What am I doing wrong?,"19m here. Two weeks ago I installed tinder when I was drunk. I created what I’d describe as the worst possible profile - I had two photos: the first was a generic selfie, and the second was a meme. I had no bio, and didn’t customise the profile at all beyond the initial setup. 

That night, I ended up with 15-20 or so matches. I had decent conversations with most of them but I was drunk so I didn’t really know what was going on. The following morning I deleted my account and uninstalled the app.

Last night, I thought I’d give it another try. I put more effort into the profile (although the photos were still selfies), and I had a short bio basically just saying that I’m a student, etc. Nothing special, but A LOT better than my last profile. However, my experience couldn’t have been more different. As of now (around 18hrs since I created the profile), I have a grand total of four matches (after swiping right on 80 or so profiles). A major contrast to a few weeks ago where I had 15 or so within an hour. 

One reason could be that my account technically isn’t new; I registered using my Apple ID for both accounts, and I heard that tinder only deletes your data a few months after deleting your account. Maybe I benefited from the new user ‘boost’ a few weeks ago, but not now, because I used the same email?

Or at least that was the case until I found out she was 17. Her 18th birthday is in November, my 20th in October. 

Typically I wouldn’t go for someone under the age of 18, although the age of consent where I live is 16. 

This is simply due to the fact that 17 is still quite young - and this may be someone who would struggle to commit to a relationship at this point in their lives. 

The other reason is a guy who is of legal age such as myself dating someone under 18 can also look bad, and some people may not approve. 

However, this girl is different. And I don’t say that blindly. Apart from being beautiful, we share similar interests, she shows genuine interest in me and my life, our conversations flow really well, the list goes on. 

There is genuine respect and interest for one another, and I personally think the age gap in this context isn’t too much of an issue.

35,ovyr9s,1627846732,Is this weird or…? Need a bit of advice here,"

So i’m currently dating this girl for approx. 2 months now. She’s extremely sweet and kind to me, to the point where it’s almost to much… she make me cookies, i even have her housekeys, she gave we welcome home gift after a trip and what not. So everything is going smooth tbh, we’ve talked about getting serious but we haven’t made anything ‘official’, as in actually bf/gf. 

So to the point here, she is bisexual, and have had sex with a few girls, also her best female friend. Now these 2 are extremely *extremely* good friends! They met each other through Tinder actually. I’m honestly super fine with it, i think her bestie is a really nice girl. Now i’ve not asked too much about this friend tho…but i’m starting to question what the hell this all is. Because i’m really getting the feeling they’ve sort of planned to get a ‘shared’ bf. 

Seriously, this girl is trying so hard to spend time with me. Like i’m just trying to date the other girl, but she have multiple times told me to come over after her and the girl i’m dating have been out drinking and stuff. Middle of the Night. I feel like they really really want a threesome, which would for some guys sound cool (it sorta is), but not when you’ve barely dated this girl you’ve tried to get serious with, it seems weird she want me to become such good friends with her own friends, so early on. And also, they’ve both been really pushy about going on a trip with me, just us three, and share room also. Why would the bestie want to be a 3rd wheel so bad? Doesn’t make sense unless she think she can get some as Well imo

And after all this, i’m also questioning, if they still have sex and idk maybe have feelings for each other or something? Because after my friend told me that i’m basically dating a girl, that already have a girlfriend, i really thought that was true and went wtf is this.

I only met 1 woman that I liked, but I moved away shortly after meeting her. Most dating websites seem to be clones of Tinder, so I don't see them working out either. What's the alternative here? I've seen people give the advice that people with this problem should join a hobby group, but it doesn't seem appropriate or practical to do that. You can't just lurk around hobby groups or meetups so you can hit on girls. That's creepy behavior.

45,ovzjlo,1627849325,It really depresses me to know that no girl has ever had a crush or been romantically interested in me,"I didn’t think I was that unattractive or that repulsive to women.

There’s never been a girl that thinks, “I hope he talks to me today”. No girl that has felt butterflies while speaking to me. None that talks to her friends about how cute they think I am.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t know if it can even be fixed. I think about this a lot and it honestly makes me cry sometimes and makes me just stay in bed because of how sad I feel. I can’t even look into the mirror without being reminded I’m so repulsive to women by my face alone my personality probably will never make up for it.

46,ovzjvf,1627849351,[M27] Looking for opinions (mostly from females but all are welcome) on how to approach a young woman I have noticed," Alright so I'm not one to post things online so sorry if this gets bumpy. Just curious about what the general consensus is on walking up to a stranger and finding out if they are single. And if so, would she be interested in meeting up. Normally, in any public setting it probably wouldn't be a big deal to me. Grocery store, Target, local coffee shop, etc. are all pretty normal places that would be relaxed and somewhat more comfortable. However, my dilemma is that the only place I see this young woman is at....the gym *insert Sting sound effect*. This is where it gets hard.
     I've never thought that the gym is really the place a lady likes to be approached. Maybe I'm wrong but people are there to workout and go. I mean aside from the college kids who like to stand around and talk, but for the most part it's place to work frustrations out or have ""you"" time. I generally just leave people alone. I don't mind of people want to approach me, I'm perfectly fine and am not bothered buy some small talk, but that doesn't usually happen. 
    As for her...she keeps headphones in for the most part. And wears the look that makes a person unapproachable to most. I've been told that I wear same look as well and I know for me it's not that I hate the world, I just get in my own little zone and don't think about it. ( I've been working on myself in that aspect and consciously making myself smile at people in a friendly manner when we make eye contact ). 
    She keeps to herself as I've only ever seen her carry a conversation with one person, who she apparently knew from work. After seeing her around the gym for a few weeks this was the only time I saw her speaking and acting friendly. Up until this point any time I saw her or made eye contact I just got like a blank stare. She does seem to hang out near where I'm at in the gym. And I've turned to see her looking over at me a few times. Not saying that means anything just noting because I'm extremely observant and just kind of watch things going on around me. 
    A few weeks ago we passed each other and we both locked eyes and smiled. First time that she has returned the courtesy. A few minutes later I noticed she had the headphones out so I just wanted to see what would happen if I spoke. As she was walking by again I just made eye contact and said, ""Hey, how's it going?"". She replied with ""Good"" in a friendly manner and went to get her things to leave. 
   I know all of this seems to be kind of elementary as far as social interactions go, but a bit about me: 
As of last year I'm out of a long time relationship and have not dated around or asked a stranger out. The last one was somebody I knew for a long time and we were great friends prior to the dating thing. So I guess insecurities have something to do with it. Along with not wanting to creep anyone out or make them uncomfortable/irritated in the one place they go to to blow off steam. I just put myself in their position and how it might come across
   Aside from her physical appearance which is the first thing anyone notices, (never heard anyone say they noticed someone's personality from across the room) she seems to have a lot self discipline and drive. And she carries herself with confidence even though she seems kind of shy. 
   So there it is, my dilemma.  I am hoping to get some advice from other women on how they would handle it if a guy was trying to show interest in them at the gym. Or any men who have been in my position. How'd you approach it?

58,ow0jcm,1627852538,What to do after a misunderstanding with a friend?,"Don't know if it's the right place to post it. 

So... Here's the story. 

I've met a girl through university, a few months ago. During the first lessons together (actually mostly group work with other students) I had the impression that she was trying to have eye contact with me. Repeatedly, and across several days. I was thrilled, because well, I found her pretty. But some time later (actually, very few days) I've discovered she had a boyfriend, so I thought ""well maybe I've misunderstood"". So we've become friends, or I'd say good uni colleagues. 

Unfortunately... I may have developed a crush for her, that I suppressed due to the fact she was in a relationship. We've hang out with the groups, never alone (although there have been moments in which we were alone). 

About 10 days ago, while we were with a mutual friend, I've found out she was not longer in a relationship (I've asked) , and I thought I could have a possibility, at least in theory. 

A few days later (a week ago) we were with two other friends having lunch together. And we were having again that eye contact. Prolonged (15-30 seconds), sometimes as a ""nod"" because in the table next to ours there were some let's say ""curious people"", but I really felt it was like we were looking each other, attracted. 
Later, we were alone in her car (she was bringing me back home), and before saying her goodbye, I've asked her if we actually looked each other, or it was just my impression. 

And, as you can imagine, the answer was that it was just my impression. 

I said her goodbye, and went home to devour myself into self-deprecation. 

How could I have been so stupid to see what I wanted to see and not reality? 

Since then, I've tried to contact her but she has been quite cold. I fear I might have embarrassed her, and the friendship (or at least the good relationship we had) is gone forever. We can not see each other for about a month (for holidays we are in different regions), and I don't know if I've ruined everything. 

What to do? Ask the mutual friend for advice (he knows her better, they did their Bachelor together)? Try to explain to her? Wait for a bit? 

I feel really miserable. It was the first girl I've felt interested to since my break up during the first wave of lockdowns. I fear I might have had too many ""fantasies"" of a relationship with her in the previous months that led me to see what I desired. 

I'd like to at least still be friends, but at this point I don't think she wants.

Please help?,"I have taken 2 years of a break after a 5 year relationship before going back into dating however I am finding it increasingly difficult to even meet with a guy that isn’t trying to hook up on the first date. I genuinely want to have a wholesome time enjoy the growth aspect, doing some kind of activity together or dinner and then we go back home and enjoy and saver every minute till the next time. I am typically very upfront of my intentions because I value time. My ex- would always tell me I was too complicated or too serious and needed to relax which I can but come on, if I am looking for a long term relationship doesn’t it make sense to just get to know the person first? 
It does not help that my single friend says Chivalry doesn’t exist anymore.  It’s very disappointing.
It seams to me that a mans role of being the gentleman to a lady has completely vanished from our society.

Has the foundation of dating with the goal of finding a long term relationship become based of how you are physically attracted to one an other or how addictive the sex can be with that person? 
Also am I the only person that feels dating apps with the swiping feature make it feel like playing slots at the casino? Where the person automatically falls into this voids of repetitive motions eventually loosing sight of the fact that this is a game and it should be fun, and that once you win you stop?

I understand that we come with some kind of baggage and it seems quite unreasonable to not be honest about this things. I do my best to be open minded but I can’t understand something if the fear of being vulnerable exist and prevents some from exposing them self. 

My personality can be a bit shy at first but after a few meetings I tend to warm up to people. I can be goofy, kind, caring, have nurturing tendency. I enjoy cuddling and rejoice when we greats new memories and over all my idea of a relationship is someone who’s personality I like. I don’t care much of how they look as long as they are healthy or take good care of them self. Growth in a relationship is the kind where we confront obstacles side by side, or have a safe space to have open discussions. I feel like this is bare basics but maybe I am asking for too much.


I honestly I am very curious to know what is going on and am very open to read different points of view.

68,ow1kxb,1627855990,Am I being dramatic?,"
So me and this guy have been talking for months now. It was pretty much a situationship. So ofc nothing too serious since we are not in a committed relationship. He told me I was the “only one he was talking to”. I never really believed him but my friend messaged me today and told me he started talking to her in a flirty way. 

Even though I know we are not in a committed relationship and I’m fine with him talking to other people..since I have no control over that. My only exception was not to not hit up my friends. The only reason I have this standard is because it causes drama that I don’t want to deal with. He also knows about this standard and agreed to not let me down but now he fucked up and now I don’t want to keep talking to him because I’m disappointed in him.

So my question is ..am I being dramatic for this since we are not committed or are my feelings valid? Again, let me just say it’s not necessarily the act he did it’s the promise that he wouldn’t talk to my friends that got me upset.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow1kxb/am_i_being_dramatic/
69,ow1lfy,1627856039,Should I go on a date after getting a bad haircut?,"OK, so this week I made a really huge mistake and went to a hairdresser even though I have a skin problem on my head (one-third of it is bald, so the hair from the other two-thirds needs to be long enough to cover that bald spot). Long story short, she messed it up and now I have like 3 centimeters wide bald line above one of my ears.

The thing is, that before this I agreed with one girl that we would go to the cinema together next week (we haven't met yet or seen each other's photos). Even though she told me that she doesn't care how people look and that she's more interested in personality, I am still scared that she will be in shock/upset from that thing.

Should I tell/not tell her now and move the date? Should I ask her if she wouldn't mind that haircut? Or any other tips on how could I handle this awful situation?

79,ow1wab,1627857063,"My disability/ies, mental health and autism knock down my self esteem. How do I build confidence if the conventional avenues are off limits?","&amp;#x200B;

I've been unemployed a while due to my mental health and I've not had much job security in my whole adult life. At this point it's a negative feedback loop. 

I'm autistic ('high functioning') and (severely) Dyspraxic. So not in a wheelchair but struggle with a lot of motor co-ordination things that are a snap for most, and high functioning not in the sense of 'no difficulties' but in a 'theory of mind is developed enough to empathise with people and be painfully aware of my limitations'.  

I have the full rigmarole of depression, anxiety (GAD including social anxiety) and OCD although I'd say anxiety and OCD. I'm treatment resistant to those but essentially situationally depressed...it depends how we define depression. It doesn't matter too much.

People seem to think I'm gay because of how passive I am and the 'feminine' vibes I give off, which I think really is just insecurity and sexist to assume is feminine/homophobic to assume is gay. It is true however that I don't have a super strong sex drive unless I've just been working out. It might be true that I am a 'nice guy' not in the pretending-to-be-friends-so-that-I'll-get-laid way, but lying \*to myself\*. 

I think I come across as a helpless child or at the emotional maturity of a teenager, in how I act and how I write, and have a complex about this as obviously most adult wo/men don't want to date somebody who gives off a vibe of childishness or delicacy. (I'm flat out confused whether I'm even straight or bi lol) A part of me thinks this is a defence mechanism due to trauma, or symptomatic of my mental state, perhaps. 

  
I have a lot of anxiety around finding reasonable employment and some difficulty finding suitable work. I can't do entry-level minimum wage stuff like Subway because of my butterfingers, I'd drop glasses as a bartender. Before COVID I was going to do TEFL but that fell through. 

Despite all this, I've managed to maintain friendships and hobbies, some of which I'm passionate about but can struggle with juggling sometimes. I've also kept in reasonable shape; sometimes I fear I put too much emphasis on not getting fat or building muscle actually...as I have a disordered eating history.

My basic insecurity  is that I struggle to accept I'm disabled as it's a source of shame and given they're invisible, a lot of people just assume I'm lazy or stupid. (IQ shouldn't matter but when I'm not depressed/in anxiety state it's in the 130s.) I actually find spending too much time as seeing the sheer struggle with the average, able-bodied, perfectly confident, neurotypical dudes being inadequate, makes me ask, how would I have a chance? Obviously this is a toxic line of thought to go down but very easy to.

As such, I haven't even \*tried\* Tinder in over 5 years and OLD literally never. 

I have very limited but not zero interest from women IRL, and online it's mostly older women (40+) for some reason, e.g. Facebook friends who got to know me. I don't really chase so much as talk. When I put up pics of myself I'm surprised that they get some positive attention, the last ones have had c. 50likes  


My confidence has been quite knocked by a recent maybe-ghosting. I kinda liked them and thought we 'clicked' but I just wanted to meet up, not necessarily as a date. I think I was either too honest or complained about something stupid and since then they basically leave me on read.

There's a possibility of meeting a friend who likes me whenever they're vaccinated (they live in another country). If we don't click and I have to let them down I will definitely have to change my 'forever alone' routine. They're cool though so I'm looking forward to meeting up. 

On their end it would be unfair of me to date them from pure desperation.

Currently I'm in a self deprecation and self criticism spiral which is painful for my friends to watch,  so I'm going back to therapy soon before I even set an account up, but I wanted your advice on how I would sell myself and find that necessary Confidence despite the frankly dense baggage I come with. Is 'fake it 'til you make it' useful here? It seems like I'd have to do a lot of faking...

She mentioned how he just moved here and has no friends. I figured she was full of shit but I brushed it off because it’s not like we were a couple. 

A few days later I asked her out on a date and she said yes. I picked a day and she told me that day doesn’t work for her because she’s hanging out with her “friend” and then she has to work for 14 days straight. I don’t have the energy to argue so I said ok. A few minutes later she admitted that this “friend” is actually a guy she’s been talking to but that I shouldn’t worry because she sees no future with him because he is moving to Arizona. 

I wasn’t upset about her hanging out with a guy or even mentioning him even though that was weird. I was upset that she lied about it at first. If she came clean about it from the get go I would have been annoyed that she brought it up but I would have brushed it off.

87,ow2dps,1627858814,Seeing him happy while I’m depressed and miserable,"My ex broke up with me over a month, it was out of nowhere and he did it in such a shitty way. It left me feeling unlovable and not worthy enough. Anyways, as soon as he broke up with me he started posting on his ig story like there’s no tomorrow. He posts his friends, drinking, partying, having fun with his friends 24/7. I’m just confused bc whenever we were together he wouldn’t post us like the way he does with himself and his friends now. I don’t understand why??? Every thing we have done he’s doing with his friends and he posting it. I can’t help but feel sad bc I don’t know whats wrong with him for to leave me. Don’t get me wrong I’m glad he’s okay and happy but it just sucks seeing how meaningless I am to him.
He discarded me once things were getting a bit tough with us. Whenever we would have arguments about hurtful shit he’s done to me, he wouldn’t take accountability instead he would tell me how bad of person he is and how shitty his life is. I’m bipolar and he knew that but he never really made an effort to try to understand my illness and my issues even though I did the same with him whenever he had issues with anything. Instead he would constantly bring coke, molly and shrooms and booze around me. Ofc I understand he wanted to have a good time but it was constant. So the drugs would fuck with my head a lot and whenever I would come down from the high I would get really really low and act “crazy” according to him so idk if he really loved me or not. I’m having trouble picking my head up and moving on because I genuinely feel like a terrible person. I didn’t do anything to him at all I loved him so much I never cheated I was extremely affectionate and loving.

89,ow2fmw,1627858981,What is the point of dating if it's always a net negative in your life?,"I haven't had a serious relationship in almost 5 years now. But those 5 years have been the best of my life. I think this is because I spent the previous 10+ dating people who were total drags on my life. I loved them, I wanted to be with them, I wanted the whole marriage and kids, but boy they made me so unhappy, and I never realized it until I swore off relationships after my 3rd serious one failed dramatically.

I still date, it's OK. I hope one day I'll meet someone who works with me, instead of against me, but now I am smart/strong enough to just end a budding relationship when I start seeing the negativity in the other person and their negativity towards my life and what makes me happy. I'm so sick of loving things passionate and being told how awful they are because they aren't things 'successful and popular' people do. So sick of the shallow obsession with projecting an Instagram image, vs actually living life and pursuing your dreams. So many of these women I date are closet alcoholics or have other deep self-destructive issues, it's heartbreaking, but I don't let that shit into my life anymore. I don't care how 'awful' it makes me, I have the right to be happy and with someone who wants to be truly happy with, not pretending to fake happy for social media.

I've done a lot in the past 5 years. New hobbies, new job, new business, tried new things, gone on trips. All stuff I was never able to do because before my exes would just crap on everything I wanted and downtalked me because of their own insecurity and unhappiness. Yet in dating I just keep attracting these same negative people. If someone dumps their shitty life on me on date 1 or 3, it's guaranteed that they will want to see me again. Are they happy and positive with their life and doing things like me? Nope, won't see you ever again. I have zero interest in being someone's step ladder out of their misery anymore, which is exactly what my exes were trying to do with me, and them blaming me for not boosting them up so they could look down. I remember when I got a 20K raise, and I took myself out to dinner because my gf at the time basically told me that she thought it was pathetic I didn't get more and refuse to celebrate with me... she made less than half what I did... 

It sucks that I feel like I am forever alone now, but I'd rather enjoy my life than be with someone who makes life miserable for me, who is negative and unsupportive and basically expects me to give 200% of myself to them because they only give 50% on their best day. And who feels the need to be an asshole to me when I accomplish something great or do something new that I really enjoy because they are threatened by it.

Stay single. Stay strong. Nobody owes you happiness but yourself, and anyone who refuses to allow you to be happy needs to get the boot out of your life. Friends, fuckbuddies, or serious partners included. I still date, I still have sex, but I refuse to take anyone seriously again until they actually demonstrate that they care about me, and not merely about using me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow2fmw/what_is_the_point_of_dating_if_its_always_a_net/

92,ow2hqh,1627859188,Feel really bad about getting blow job from girl with bf?,"So it’s honestly it’s been weighing heavy on me, but this girl who is my cousins friend came clubbing with us and previously she’s been pretty touchy, but I figured she was just drunk and it was nothing. She had been twerking and dancing with me the whole night, we get to our hotel room and we’re both super drunk. Me and my cousins husband (who we’ll call bill) go get something from the store and that takes about 30 min. So before leaving this girl is pretty drunk she’s flailing around but by the time we get back she’s just super talkative and stuff.

Long story short she wants to smoke weed with me and bill but my cousin said she gets paranoid, and she just forced herself on the balcony where we were at. At this point bill tells her that she can only smoke weed if she sucks my dick, bill and her go back and forth, I ask her to leave multiple times, and I’m pleading with her to leave until she said she’ll suck my dick. and she tells me to pull my pants down. I remember telling her if she was sure she wanted to do this she just said pulled my dick out, and midway through she starts crying and that made me want to puke bc I felt like she got pressured by bill, we were both drunk and I felt like such a scumbag and like I violated her. 

At this point everybody is figuring out what went wrong, my cousins didn’t think it was that big of a deal and we go back to sleep. And then while everybody was asleep this girl comes over to my bed, she starts getting cuddly, she puts my hand on her boob and we sort of just start fondling each other. Then I don’t know how but I started fingering her, she was giving me a handjob, then we would stop and start again, bc she would just grind her butt on me. I asked her repeatedly if this was ok and if she wanted to do this  and she said she was horny, and that we could fuck as homies. She kept asking me if this was cheating, but I said it’s whatever you want it to be, until after the 10th time I just said it’s not and she stopped asking.

We kept jacking each other off, feeling each other up and whatever for like 2 hours until she finally gave me a blowjob, she said that she wanted me to cum on her, I came on her boobs and face, but she was opening her mouth but I didn’t want to cum in her mouth tbh and that was that. And what’s even weird is that I came super hard and while cleaning up she was like “ya my bf cums a lot like that too.”

And after I came I had this realization like wtf did I just do and at this point it was like 5am but she still kept trying to keep going. It was to the point where I acted like I was asleep just to see if she would stop and she kept humping my leg and licking me while i was “asleep,” and I sort of felt a little bit violated so I told her to stop a couple times and she wouldn’t but finally I said it firmly and she did stop. 

I just feel bad bc I feel like I took advantage of her even though I gave her multiple outs, I asked her multiple times if this was ok, and I didn’t want her to feel coerced after Tim basically convinced her to suck my dick in the first place. And then I don’t think it was cool for her to keep humping me, licking me, making out with me, while I literally just laid there, so I think it was just a bad thing from both ends. 

If I could do it all over again, I wish I would’ve just forcibly carried her out of the balcony, but I just feel terrible about the situation. I just feel bad and empty now. She FaceTimed her bf in the morning and I can’t imagine the guilt she probably has and idk if she’s going to come clean or what.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow2hqh/feel_really_bad_about_getting_blow_job_from_girl/

Do you think it will stay this way because people are for example more cautious? Or do you think it will be completely different and people will enjoy their freedom even more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow2mby/do_you_think_it_is_going_to_be_more_difficult_to/

99,ow2whs,1627860670,"""You don't need a relationship to be happy"" ... no, not like that.","It's always so funny when people say that famous line ""You don't need a relationship to be happy"" and when you actually start being happy single they start questioning your mental state and and tell you loneliness is bad and you should find someone and wonder what the hell is wrong with you. But interestingly, when you're unhappy being alone, they tell you to just suck it up and man up and just be happy alone and focus on yourself, you know the drill. And when you're actually happy and finally don't need anyone and enjoy your life, then they bug you about being alone, tell you loneliness is unhappy and you should find someone and that you NEED someone...... EXCUSE ME WHAT THE F.... seriously, fuck off.

It's almost like they actually don't want you to be  happy and ""advice"" they give you is only to make you miserable for god knows why. What is wrong with people...

Oh and you can clearly see it not only in real life but this sub too. When someone vents about being lonely and wanting a partner, you bomb them with ""just be happy with yourself bro"" but when someone proclaims they don't care about relationships anymore and are living happy single life, you try to tell them relationships are great and that they should get one.... 

LoL....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow2whs/you_dont_need_a_relationship_to_be_happy_no_not/
