I'm honestly in love with this person. They're so caring, smart, capable. I adore everything about them, but our sex life is just... disappointing.

When we first started dating we'd be intimate every time we met, with a lot of experimenting, long foreplay, kinkplay, all the stuff I love in a relationship. I was so happy because normally I date people with a much lower drive than myself. 

As we've dated longer, we've both been put under a lot of personal and financial stress. Both of us were really fucked over by the virus financially, and now we're indebt graduate students working in a pub for less than living wage. We've also discovered that my partner likely has undiagnosed ADHD. These factors combined have ruined our sex life. We've gone from 2-3 times a week to 1-2 a month, with a two months where we weren't intimate at all (this was before we discovered the ADHD).

I've been trying my best to be patient and supportive for the last four months, but the quantity hasn't recovered and the quality has become very vanilla with me doing most of the work and always initiating. I always make sure they climax first, and do my damndest to slowly work up to initiating so it's never out of nowhere.

We've talked about it, and had many conversations on how the ADHD and the stress are affecting it, how we'll work together to make this area in our relationship work, but I'm really starting to worry that we're just not sexually compatible anymore. Maybe the first month was a fluke due to lockdowns and a new relationship.

I don't want to leave them, I love them dearly and I've never been with anyone like them. But I'm starting to feel more sexually frustrated in a relationship than I did single.

Any advice or anecdotes would be heavily appreciated.

I (26M) have been trying the online dating thing for over 3 years or so, and nothing has really come of it besides a few first dates that went nowhere. I despise online dating, but I'm just not meeting anybody in person and have no other choice.

Anyhow, I matched with an awesome-sounding woman on Facebook dating (of all places) a while back, we started casually messaging/texting, and I immediately knew I had to ask her out. I'm probably pickier than average, because this rarely happens. I asked to meet for Boba tea, but due to both of us having crazy schedules, we couldn't figure out a time for like 2 weeks. While messaging, she made an offhand comment about volunteering at a VBS (vacation bible school). I was dumped by an ex for not being religious, so this immediately raised the alarm bells (even though it might not even be a big deal), and I stopped messaging her. I also was starting to look for new jobs, and had a vacation planned.

Don't reveal too much about yourself too soon. Remain a mystery.

 

 

Rule #2

 

Girls are not the only thing in life. Have other things in your life that excite you.

 

 

Rule #3

 

Do not become so invested in any one girl that you cannot simply walk away.

 

 

Rule #4

 

Confidence attracts women even more than good looks. This is why you see fat, ugly, or dumpy guys with hot chicks.

 

 

Rule #5

 

Desperation repels women. You will attract more women when you don't care if you're attracting women.

 

 

Rule #6

 

Use the phone only to set up dates. Not to talk about weather, current events, how her day went, etc. Save that conversation for the date.

 

 

Rule #7

 

First dates should be short and creative. NO ""dinner and a movie"". Things involving some activity are best: pool, bowling, roller blading, mini-golf, dancing, etc. Keep it FUN.

 

 

Rule #8

 

Do not give gifts early in the relationship. Doing so makes it appear as though you are attempting to purchase affection.

 

 

Rule #9

 

Girls will test guys to see how much they can skate by with. Do not be tempted to give in. Speak your opinions, stand by your convictions, and don't put up with excessive amounts of BS.

 

 

Rule #10

 

There is no such thing as a ""soul-mate"" or ""the one"". It doesn't exist. There are millions of girls out there, though, and many of them have the traits you are looking for.

 

 

Rule #11

 

Don't put any woman up on a pedestal. You risk not being able to reach her. Women are people too... or so I'm told.

 

 

Rule #12

 

If a woman disrespects you or your time, particularly early in the relationship, don't hesitate to get rid of her. NEXT!

 

 

Rule #13

 

Never be the one that says, ""I love you"" first.

 

 

Rule #14

 

The challenge is part of the fun. Don't short-change the girl. Let her pursue you. The harder something is to obtain, the more valuable it is perceived to be.

 

 

Rule #15

 

If a girl cheats on you, she is gone. No exceptions.

 

 

Rule #16

 

Never date a girl who has more problems than you do.

 

 

Rule #17

 

Do not date girls from work. Work is stressful enough.

 

 

Rule #18

 

Dating is a ""numbers game."" Accept the fact that you're going to get rejected more times than not. Suck it up and get back out there.

 

 

Rule #19

 

Where women are concerned, pay more attention to what they do than what they say.

 

 

Rule #20
Realize that women are tricky, lying, manipulative, devious, scheming, sneaky, cunning, calculating, shrewd, and Machiavellian creatures. Love them anyway.

 

 

Rule #21

 

Bros before hoes. Any girl that can be stolen from your best friend isn't worth stealing from your best friend.

 

 

Rule #22

 

Stay away from your ex. Chances are that you won't be able to get back with her. Chances are also good that if you DO succeed in getting back with your ex, you'll wish that you hadn't.

 

 

Rule #23

 

Women communicate in two modes: the way things are, and the way they WISH things were. Whenever in doubt, assume it's the latter choice.

 

 

Rule #24

 

Women desire attention the same way that guys desire sex. Give attention sparingly. This is your currency.

 

 

Rule #25

I (male) met an awesome girl online which started as friends. Slowly became more than friends. Talking every day for the past three months, going to restaurants  traveling festivals we've had a real amazing time. Recently been hooking up  and having sex. Told her im really into her, she really  likes me said she would date me but she’s not there emotionally right now coming off a relationship, insists we are friends... we’re both exclusively seeing each other. I know how it can be. Shes is studying abroad  in a few weeks. Ya I know probably shouldn’t be this far already but  here we are. That’s half the situation

We  wake up one morning after a solid date, cuddling, talking. I try  initiating it, she said not in the mood right now. Not a problem. We cuddle /talk there for another 3 hours and a lot of time has gone by. all of a sudden start making  out, one thing leads to another I finger she moans, we start  going at it she’s moaning and saying things in my ear I finish. were laying there and then go get breakfast and i go home. no red flags or anything. 

On my way home she  texts me saying she didn’t want to have sex just then… and now i feel  horrible. she says she was  just trying to get it over with... which doesnt sit right with me anyway. Says  we need space. ok no problem. a few days go by I’m just trying to make sense and  collect my thoughts. First time in months that we go days without  talking. she wasn’t clear at all that she didn’t want to have  sex, and she communicated the opposite to me in the moment, that said her original communication was so many hours before it seemed irrelevant now. 

Says that she is past it and forgives me but doesn’t  know how to pick things back up. honestly neither do I. Is this just  too much of a muddy situation to move past? Am I getting played just  before she leaves the country? Any advice on how to handle this is  appreciated.

We met for food &amp; just talked for like 2+ hours. We seem to have a lot in common and to me it feels like we have good chemistry. The next day I texted her and invited her over for dinner at my place on Wednesday. 

Initially she said ""yes! Sounds like a good time."" So, that was that. We texted a few times jokingly throughout the day, nothing crazy (had a debate about the whole ""gif"" vs ""jif"" pronunciation) - all seemed good. 

But now today (Tuesday) she texts me ""Hey, so for tomorrow. I'm wondering if you would mind if we did something else. Or maybe we wait for the weekend and can grab coffee and take a walk?"" 

So since evenings aren't great for her (has to wake up early) we agreed to reschedule for the Sunday coffee + walk combo. 

So here's the point of the post; I'm curious if any women could chime in as to why she might initially accept and seem enthusiastic, but then want to not do it the next day?

Some of them come onto Reddit and post questions like “I’ve been dating so-and-so for 2 months and I haven't told her I'm a virgin, will telling her this turn her off?” or “how will women feel about dating me if they know I've never had sex before?”

I was a late bloomer and didn't have sex until I was 23. Yes, that means for my entire college life, I never hooked up with anybody despite going to a school with a very high ratio of women-to-men.

Also during that time, I was trying to remain a virgin until I was married. And, in order to achieve that goal, I thought that if I let everyone know I was a virgin, they would either(a) leave me alone if they wanted sex, or (b) or be turned on by a guy who wasn't going after them for sex, which I kept hearing from a woman as a common complaint about men. 

Oh, how wrong I was. 

Turns out, telling women around me that I was not only a virgin but actively trying to keep it that way AND acting proud of it made them like me MORE. Back then, I had lower self-esteem about myself (probably due to deny myself sex, LOL), but in looking back I can remember the various women either I had a crush on or who had crushes on me that were definitely sending me buying signals indicating they'd be down to take my v-card. 

And it seemed like the more steadfast I was about being a virgin, the more glaringly obvious they would be in wanting to take it. I remember going on a first date with a woman, and when I drove her back to her dorm and got out of my car to give her a hug and say “bye,” she said “hey - wanna come up and see my dorm room?” (Note: her place had a living space she shared with 3 or 4 other roommates; she took me to her room that had a big ol’ bed in it, and I literally kept thinking, “what are we supposed to do in here with this big bed in the way?? I think I should go home…” it wasn’t until I was halfway home that I was like, “Wait a min… d’oh!”) 

Another time, I invited a woman to my place for dinner and a movie (not knowing that that was usually taken as code for “you want to come to my place for a hookup?”). She said yes and actually suggested she could stay overnight… and I turned her down, again by accident, and took her back to campus once the movie was over. 

All of this to say: based on my experience here's my take on telling women you're a virgin… 

The more confident you are when talking about it, the less pushback you'll get. It's not about the fact that you're a virgin; it's about demonstrating confidence in the decision you initially made about it, and/or making it seem like it was a choice you made vs. being a virgin by default. 

In other words, you can have a nervous voice, slumped shoulders, or a shamed look in your eyes when telling a woman you're a virgin that gives off the impression it’s because no one wants to sleep with you; and the energy you're sending to her is begging energy, as if you're saying “please sleep with me - I so desperately want to experience sex!”

On the other hand, if you say it like you were the one choosing to remain a virgin, i.e. “Yeah I'm a virgin - I didn't want to rush it, and wanted to make sure the first person I did it with with someone I really connected with” - you face better odds. 

“But what if she wants someone that's more experienced,” you ask?

Reality check: any time you have sex with a new person, it's going to be a different experience anyway! 

Example: you might have sex with a woman who enjoys you licking a certain body (keeping it PG here people LOL). You spend six months perfecting your licking technique on her, then you break up. You start dating the next woman and think, “she's going to love having sex with me, I have this licking thing down!”… 

Only to find out she’s not a fan of being lick there! Turns out, she likes having her butt massaged, so you learned that for her… then you date another woman, and she hates being touched on her butt! 

The point is, the “being experienced” thing isn't as big of a deal as you being open to learning her and how she specifically likes things in bed. And also, I found when I finally did lose my v-card that the woman I lost it to was more than happy to teach me a few things.

I was in a toxic relationship back in 2018. The girl I was with had lied to me about having a boyfriend for a long time. She was acting weird at times, hot and cold. And I had asked her if she was taken, and she said no when things started. 

Anyway I ended up finding out she was still seeing him albeit very infrequently (barely once a month) because she was studying abroad. 

At some point, I was sick of the lying and her hot and cold, indecisive approach and hung up the phone telling her I was tired of it. I went completely silent and never looked back. She did send me some emotional texts telling me how hurtful it was to be ghosted but I was done and had enough. 

I then took those bad vibes and let them motivate me to work my ass off at work throughout 2019 which got me promoted and got me my dream job over time.

I mostly stopped going to bars and flirting around since, I’ve been single ever since never going beyond a few dates until I started feeling uneasy again. 

I also started taking investing more seriously and started accumulating capital overtime to become more financially independent.

I met a single mother a few years ago at a bar that was making serious money on her own. We talked and her mindset kinda stuck with me. She told me she didn’t feel like dating anybody anymore, going on dinner dates to talk about herself and all that yada yada anymore. And I feel the same too. Maybe she did flirt with me because she saw I didn’t feel like dating either… which is interesting actually. 

I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been since leaving the ex. My mind is clear and I haven’t been around bad vibes for ever it feels like. I do flirt around though from what friends and colleagues tell me (I was surprised I was since for me it was more of just talking. If I feel that that I’m being inappropriate in the slightest or they don’t want / feel like talking I’m out fast). Like I might strike up a conversation with people (not women in particular as I don’t focus on flirting just like talking with folks in general). I might add a compliment to a woman I find attractive for this or that reason, maybe she works well, has a nice smile, sunglasses whatever and then I’m on my way. 

But when it comes to more I usually don’t feel like anything unless I feel like the person isn’t toxic in the slightest and doesn’t expect me to be prince charming. And so I like not to see dates as dates as well.

I’m pretty sure I’ve developed trust issues since that one ex but I don’t particularly see why I would change my mindset as life is quite good now. I flirt apparently but in a chill and relaxed manner meaning that I just go on about my life right after, I like being genuine and don’t have any agenda if I do “flirt”.

I wondered why he didn’t just say that at first.

We saw each other 2-3 times a week and time flew by. In the span of those 3.5mo, we easily had 25-30 dates. Safe to say, we were insane about each other. First time I felt this way after the different women I've met on dates. In hindsight, this probably burned us out too fast..forcing her to end it. 

**Underlying** **Issue -** She got out of a real bad 4yr relationship in April! This trauma still haunts her and told me she needed to work on it. Over those 3.5months she slowly opened up about it to me as we got more comfortable. It was bad, really bad.

Anyway, I think the honeymoon phase for us ended around mid September and she asked for some space to work on herself and process things. (I was stupid and flustered. I was still riding the high...). I waited a few days, and we spent the whole weekend together. I **needed** to give her space but I failed to do that.

**That same weekend, we both confessed we were falling in love with each other. She was incredibly nervous/anxious to say it.** Which makes sense cause she was afraid/scared to be vulnerable again.

One week later she invited me to hang out with her friends for a night out. She was excited/nervous for me to meet them and kept asking me how I felt about them. It went really well but then 2 days later she ended things..

**The last conversation -** She felt that she was stringing me along and it was unfair to have the cake/eat it too. She still has feelings for me but wants me find someone who can commit now since she isn't in that stage yet. She mentioned that if we had met a year from now, we would have been exclusive/serious by now. I have the qualities that she wants in a guy.

I think she felt pressured by me to rush into a serious commitment. That was never my intention.

That day her words conveyed one thing, **BUT** her actions/body language conveyed a completely different thing. I didn't argue or fight it, I accepted her decision at that time. I believe she still has strong feelings for me but pushed me away because I became overbearing. I'm ready to give us both proper space and slow things done a lot more. In my gut, she's absolutely worth trying for.

**That day, at one point, we stared into each other's eyes for 3-4 minutes, no words. It was incredible because up until now we had poor communication but that moment revealed so much..**

* The metal pole bar almost never brings sadness. Only happiness, comfort, and joy. After all who here has said anything negative about the x-pole?

I've known her as an acquaintance for a  few years, and didn't really interact with her for a year during the  pandemic. I had a bit of a crush on her to begin with, but nothing too  strong. I think she did for me too. But now we see each other somewhat  regularly again, as part of a group of friends.

Now  she's always on my mind and I can't stop thinking of her. When I go  without seeing her for a while the intoxicating feeling diminishes if I  don't think about her actively, but soon after I see her again it's like  I can't get her out of my head and want to be close with her  emotionally and physically. I don't really know her that well as a  person, but we often make small talk when we meet amongst our friendship  group.

I think she likes me too.  She always seems to come over to me specifically to talk and has a big  smile and glowing eyes whenever we speak. The two of us often chat  together when amongst others, and I never get the impression she wants  to stop speaking with me to chat with others. I do feel there is a  presence and tension between us whenever we interact.

We  walked part of the way to our homes together the other evening after  being out with friends, and I think that's the longest we've been alone  together before. I felt super conscious of everything and hyper-aware  throughout. After saying goodbye, she  text me a few minutes later about  a trivial practicality from earlier in the evening, and said she was  looking forward to chatting with me again this coming weekend (I'll be  in a small group with her again), with a smiley face emoji.

I  feel so incredibly drawn to her, and I can't get her out of my head.  The problem is, I feel in no way ready for a relationship: I got  divorced at the start of this year, following a couple of years of  separation from my ex. I'm in therapy at the moment for anxiety, OCD and  other things. And once this is over, I'm starting to finally feel ready  to explore my sexuality after growing up in an evangelical context,  marrying young as a virgin and enduring a long and very hard marriage of  about 10 years. I want to explore my bisexuality for the first time,  and to have some sexual experiences that most people tend to have in  their late teens and twenties. I also plan to work on my career, move  away from the area next year, and to hopefully move abroad too.

So  it seems that it would be irresponsible to pursue her at this time, or  to lead her on in any way. And moreover, I really want to do these other  things for myself and to focus on them.

But  it really hurts me to be around her and know all this. The conflict is  really hard to manage. I want to pursue her so much, but then I also  want to finally start living on my own terms as a single man and start  pursuing some other goals that would not be compatible with being in a  stable relationship.

I also don't  know if I could be in a short-term, casual relationship with her. My  feelings for her are very strong and I don't want to hurt her or myself.  And we'd still have to to see each other in future when out with our  mutual friends.

I really don't  know what to do with this conflict, and I worry she might ask me out. It  feels like this is what's going to happen if I don't ask her first.  That would be both wonderful and terrifying. I'm finding it really hard  to deal with this internal conflict and my mind is all over the place. I  just want to focus on my therapy and pursue my personal and  professional desires and goals. But she's introduced a beautiful  instability and chaos into my life that I have no idea what to do with.

I honestly don't have any idea how/where to start and I kinda suck at writing with people online and find it sort of uncomfortable/awkward, so I don't really know if things like dating apps would be a good fit.
