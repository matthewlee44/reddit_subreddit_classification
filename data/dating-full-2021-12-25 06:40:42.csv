I guess I'm more accustomed to buttering up the other person with words and all before finally making it official. And by the time we would be officially together I can say or do couple stuff and feel reciprocated in a way.

With this girl we're starting off exclusive but it doesnt feel right to do all of that because we haven't created that connection.

For the past couple of years I (21M) have been trying to meet that someone special, but I either never felt a connection or I was rejected. This year I finally gathered enough confidence to go on a date after I moved to different country and the girl later said she was interested in girls, after that couple of girls just stopped any sort of communication after I asked them out and when I finally went on a date, I didn't feel any connection. I took a break and late November decided to give another shot and yet again I was faced with only rejection. I am young, also not a virgin, so there shouldn't be any pressure for me to be in a relationship, also considering that there are other ambitions for me of what I want to achieve. And so I thought if it would just be best for me, to take a break from dating for a while, at least until I have my life figured out as much as it can be? I am introvert and I enjoy being by myself,  but I also enjoy the feeling of having someone next to me, but the fact that I still haven't had much luck, makes me feel that it is time to distance myself from others and work on myself.

So r/dating, here is the thing.

A few years ago, I (M) met a girl over the internet thanks to a mutual friend.

I thought she was pretty funny and cute and I asked her out. She agreed and seemed enthusiastic. At the last minute she told me she was a busy and could not make it. I took it politely and asked if she wanted to reschedule. She never answered.

Until a few days ago I really did not think about her at all but I got back on fb for an unrelated purpose and saw that she was still active and looked up her profile.

She is even prettier than before and I believe I have a crush on her now.

For the context, we are both French in our late 20‚Äôs living in Paris. Our mutual friend and her are no longer in touch. After I met her I had a two year long relationship that broke off recently.

I am really thinking about sending her a text.

Is this even a good idea? If it is, how should I do it?

I would rather be upfront but I don‚Äôt want to come off as confrontational like she has to answer yes or no.

I am quite bad at small talking via text so I won‚Äôt feel super at ease with a ¬´¬†hey long time no see, what‚Äôs up?¬†¬ª kind of message.

Thanks!

Also, does it seem like my situation would work for casually dating someone? I‚Äôm interested in dating someone but don‚Äôt want a serious relationship with anyone right now.

I‚Äôd be open to sex, but I think I mostly would want to cuddle instead.

I think he‚Äôs more open to a serious relationship than I am. Obviously we‚Äôd discuss the boundaries of our causal relationship and make sure we‚Äôre on the same page, but would it be likely to end in a messy way since he seems like he‚Äôd be more into the relationship than I would be?

- one time when we were out drinking we were 3 beers in talking about dating in general and he said ‚Äúthe lowest age id go is 21‚Äù (my age at the time)
- that^ conversation soon turned into us talking about how work place relationships like that are hot esp when they‚Äôre kept secret
- he invited me out and bought me a few drinks for my birthday
- sex gets brought up often in our conversations but nothing sexual towards each other
- he tells me about women hes seen in the past or about how married women will be asking him to hook up
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


maybe im making it up in my head that he could like me, its hard to tell. but i want to get to know him more and hang out with him like i would with a close friend. 

should i shoot my shot? or give up on this work love fantasy?

A girl in my poetry class approached me on the first day and was really warm and inviting, she even seemed interested in whatever I was doing - looking over my shoulder, raising my hand so she can see what I‚Äôm writing, looking at my hair etc. She‚Äôd ask me so many questions to learn about me and basically open me up, we‚Äôd even text very often (almost every other day). Long story short, I asked her out, she said yes, rejected my romantic advances at the date and became awkward. I told her I had a good time still and asked if she‚Äôd like to go for another date via text which then took her 5 days to reject me again. 

I felt pretty hurt to be honest and I think she could feel that when she‚Äôd be passive aggressive. This means she‚Äôd talk to me like she usually does in class for a few minutes then pretended I wasn‚Äôt even there for the next hour and a half - she‚Äôd leave class without looking at me when we always say bye to each other. The conversations began feeling artificial and her facial expressions kind of came off as a fake front just to put up with me even though I had stop pursuing. She‚Äôd ignore my texts (they were school related) and I‚Äôd double text sometimes thinking she might‚Äôve not seen it and she‚Äôd be like ""ohhh dude my bad, sure let me give that chapter a look I haven‚Äôt even started studying"" when I‚Äôm reality, she‚Äôs the one to always be studying and is top of the class (not exaggerating her lowest grade was an A-). The whole ""friendship"" ended by her posting comments on a teacher board that outlined a website I was using for getting help with a test online which she then began texting me like ""hey, did you see what one mentioned on the online teacher board??"" She knew I was getting help because she asked me if I could help her for this other class that we were both taking online and I gave her my solutions. 

Overall, I feel like ass for cheating in a course when the pandemic started but more down how quickly a women (she was 21 at the time and I was 22) can switch on you, alienate you then proceed to embarrass you while ignoring you passive aggressively simultaneously.

She was an old friend in highschool, and I hit her up December 10. We chatted and we arranged to meet up the followig day

  I'm not what most would call a player, hence I was surprised we were able to have sex that day. It continued, we had sex for the next four days. I started to fall for her and sometimes I would get confused. We both came from a breakup, me 3 weeks ago and her 3 months ago. 

  She tells me that she isn't ready for a relationship, but she's open to the possibility of us dating. We both love making out, and holding hands. The sex is just amazing as well. Occassionally, when I'd drop her home she'd grab my shirt as if pulling me in for a kiss.

  Now I apparently made her uncomfortable on one of the days we had sex. And she distanced herself from me for a bit. So we didn't talk as much for a couple of days. Then I found one of her stuff at my house and I offered to return it to her. I dropped it off and I got her to open up. 

  I learned that I did something to make her uncomfortable hence why she was distancing herself from me. I apologized and I asked if she'd be okay with me taking her out for coffee. She agreed. 

  I go into this, thinking she'll be aloof, distant, uninterested, but she wasn't. It was like before and I was having a great time talking to her. Before I dropped her home, I stopped by a gas station and while I was filling up my tank, she leaned and rested her head on my shoulder. I was surprised, she told me she did it on impulse. I was glad that she still found me comfortable enough to lean on me, but again I was just thinking she'd want to avoid me more. All in all I think we both had fun.

  Now I drop her home and as I was saying my goodbyes, she leans in to kiss me, she tells me because she wanted to.  I'm stunned, I didnt even kiss her back. I didn't know what to make of it, in my head I was thinking she'd prolly want to be as far away from me as possible. So for her to kiss me, I was stunned?

  She's a great girl, she's fun to hang out with but I'm not sure what to feel about her, I'm not sure if the kiss meant anything or if I just want it to mean something.

So I'm a college student, 19 year old, never ever dated before, not even close to it. I recently began working out and taking care of myself, and also being less introverted. Everyone that I met in 2020, when college began, says that I've had a glow up in the past year and a half, but my attitude is the exact same: I've always been naturally negative-ish and not confident, unsure about myself all the time, to the point that I found it extremely weird and unlikely that a girl takes interest in me. And we believe that's what's going on now:

So a group of friends and I rented a house in the countryside for the weekend. The idea was to hike around the forests during the day and chill or party at night. One of my friends brought a small group along with her, and in that group there's a girl that I find kinda curious since I met her back in september, and we get along, but I would not call it a friendship.

One of my best friends, which happens to be a girl and has a very good eye for this things, took notice immediatly about this other girl's attitude. Accordinge to her, since day one she had an eye on me: we had a small chill session, drinking and talking, and this one girl kept offering me drinks (don't like it that much heh) and always laughing at my jokes (I have a dark sense of humour, even offensive at times lmao). We picked the songs together too, we have a very similar music taste. I was just having fun and not thinking much of it at the time. 

What I didn't notice was, according to my friend, that she always looked for my company, for me ""to be around"". This manifested itself when I was cooking dinner for the group. I was alone in the kitchen. I was told by my best mate that she saw me alone there and immediatly got up and started walking over to the kitchen. As it goes, one friend of hers stopped her and asked something, and as they were done talking I went to the living room to lounge for a while as the food was being made, and she stayed. This was the first day: she kept being friendly and open, but I didn't take notice of these small details. Keep in mind, my brain is fixated to the idea that ""why the hell would I be interesting for a girl"".

Second day, we went for a hike, nothing special. I completely turn into a kid when I'm surrounded by nature, so I spent all morning enjoying the forest. I noticed that she's similar in that way. We literally saw a cool tree and instantly decided to climb it and goof around. The rest of the day was similar to the last one, but the ""fun"" began at night. 

Some of us were having a small party with loud music downstairs. Me and my two best mates went up to my room to chill (I swear blasting Pink Floyd at 2 am hits different) for some time and I sat on the floor. We kinda talked about politics at first, then it shifted to questions like: is there a God? Do humans have a soul? Etc, etc. So around 2:30 am the door opens and... surprise! This girl I've been talking about comes inside and sits like 1 meter away from me. I didn't even notice, but in the span of a few minutes, she was next to me and laying her head on my shoulder. I was like: yup, what the fuck. But I guessed she was a bit drunk and tired, so I shrugged it off. She stayed there talking with us about these things for a solid 2 hours, until we all went to bed. Funny thing is, she refused to leave my room and I was confused about it. I went down to my mates' rooms downstaris and they were having a talk about what had just happened. They think she might have wanted to do something, and that I was too ""autistic"" to notice. I didn't believe them, so I went up again and she had already went back to her room.

For the next day, we had another day of hiking, nothing of interest: she kept being friendly and funny around me. During the afternoon, as it was raining, some of us decides to bake a cake, but we ran out of milk, so I offered to go and buy some in a nearby store. I was about to leave and the girl comes by and says: ""Hey, I'm coming too, if you don't mind"". Keep in mind, when we noticed we were out of milk, she refused to go to the store. My guess is that she didn't want to go alone and was waiting for someone to volunteer first. 

Again, I was stupid enough to not notice this, and ask one of my mates to come with us, so the three of us went down to the store. After buying the stuff, I kept working on the cake while everyone chilled upstairs. She stayed with me, helping me out, and at least we got to know eachother better as we kept an eye on the cake. That night, we did the ""chilling in my room"" session again, but she didn't stay as long as last time with us. And that's about it, we left the place very next thing in the morning.

Well, that's it then. My friends insist in that she was hitting on me, but I'm just confused and not know what to do next, I want to keep it natural. What I do think is that she wanted some kind of privacy with me.

I know for sure that she likes me since she is always eager to speak with me, she finds new ways to spend time with me, and she makes an effort to go on dates even though she has strict parents.

I am getting her a gift for Christmas based on an inside joke we have, nothing expensive by any means. But I also want to give her a card in which I tell her my deeper feelings to her.

Through 7th - 11th grade, my self-esteem and confidence had been dropped by a certain event that happened in 7th grade. But when someone as caring, sweet, ambitious, and beautiful as her genuinely wanted to spend time with me, I couldn't believe it. And I think my confidence started to rise again because of that.

And the card will say exactly that, but obviously written better, but I am a bit worried it may come across as too insecure or needy or might produce some unintended feelings. But also while I was writing the card, I literally cried, so at the same time, I feel it is the most sincere gift I can give her.\\

This trip has shown me how much I love my bf but also how mean he can be.

To make him feel more comfortable with my family I tried to put on a movie that his family watches during the holidays and brought him a cookie recipe bc he said he would like to help in the kitchen while we play board games.

Like I said, originally he was not supposed to stay the entire week but his plans were changed, I told him he could still go home if he wanted and I‚Äôd catch a ride home with my aunt/take the train, I even checked in with him bc I have spent a week with his family before as well and I know the homesickness that he may feel (especially during Christmas).

She lives 2.5 hours away from me and we‚Äôve been doing a lot of hotel meets every week for about 8 months.

As it was a long distance relationship, around 4 months in, I jokingly suggested she should find a job in my city and we could maybe live together and see each other more often. This just came out of me as it was during the honeymoon phase filled with excitement.

She took this seriously and started to look and apply for jobs nearly everyday. She had interviews which we attended together and she eventually got one which starts in January 2022. The job she got is a job she‚Äôs been trying years to get which is related to her masters degree. She didn‚Äôt want to lose this opportunity.

So around October 2021, she kept looking for houses for us to see, we were looking at buying a house as she refused to rent as she thinks it‚Äôs a waste of money. I‚Äôve had so many people say DO NOT BUY WITH HER as it‚Äôs WAY TOO EARLY. So I told her I don‚Äôt think I wanna buy, and of course she was upset as she felt I wasted her time and led her on, and also she didn‚Äôt want to lose her new job opportunity, but I had to suggest I prefer renting first then eventually she accepted.

Then I told her I feel I was being forced into buying a house and moving out and I also said my parents are getting old and I‚Äôm the only child. And said I didn‚Äôt want to leave them and feel like I‚Äôm abandoning them. She was hurt the second time as she felt I led her on and kept changing my mind, and she wasting her money and time on the trips for interviews and the effort she put in.

I suggested her moving in with me and my mum, she refused and said she wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that.
So I eventually decided to rent a flat with her from next week. It‚Äôs one hour away. We couldn‚Äôt find anything decent that allowed pets as she has 2 cats near my current home, so this one, that‚Äôs one hour away was the best we found at the time. Minimum term is 6 months, max is 5 years.

Now my dad is going back to live abroad next month, he came back 4 months ago after being away for 2 years. And he hasn‚Äôt lived with us for around 5 years as they‚Äôve separated. My mum and dad are both getting old. My mum keeps saying she has muscle weakness and my dad finds it difficult to walk sometimes. Dad is early 70s, and mum is early 60s.

I feel sad about this whole situation and I‚Äôd like to spend more time with my parents. My plan was to come visit every week but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the same as living with them.

The move is scheduled for next week. We‚Äôve spent a few days in the new flat last week building the furniture. And now I‚Äôm spending Christmas and New Year with my parents before I move in.

I‚Äôm not 100% happy about moving out because I still want to spend time with my parents as they‚Äôre getting old. And I still feel my GF forced me to move out with her.

Does it sound like she has forced me?
Is she just using the new job opportunity as an excuse to make me feel bad?

Never experienced what it was like to even feel something for someone, never held hands, never even came close to doing anything with a girl.

Being alone has become a normal part of my life, so much so that even imagining myself with someone feels wrong and unnatural. So, how does someone socially inept and inexperienced find people?

Background: I met a girl on OLD 4 months ago. Smart, funny, attractive, (kinda rare) niche mutual interests: she is great. Not sure of its relevancy, but this is her second relationship, my fourth. We hit it off so well, and grew close over the first 3 months. Now, I‚Äôm back home for break and we have been texting every day, with calls here and there, since we are too busy and far away for more than that. She was going to visit me but shit hit the fan (so-to-speak) for both of us right before she came down, so we decided it‚Äôs best to focus on dealing with our own situations. 


Okay, now here‚Äôs where it gets confusing as heck: about a week and a half ago, something shifts right after she told me she was going back home for her birthday and Christmas (her bday is in the days leading to Christmas). Suddenly, she‚Äôs been treating me completely differently. I know it‚Äôs harder being (temporarily, until break is over) long distance and that she is going through a rough time, but she takes around two days to respond now. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at first. I know she‚Äôs struggling, so I just sent a simple text every day or so between her responses, letting her know I miss her, hope she‚Äôs okay, and I‚Äôm here to talk if she needs it. I tried to consider her feelings and emotions right now, and I think she‚Äôs fallen into a depressive episode, so I wanted my messages to seem as low pressure as possible.

Cue the chaos (from my perspective): It‚Äôs her birthday, and I‚Äôm so excited for her. I call her up around noon to try to make her day a bit brighter (she told me her family kind of disregards her birthday and combines it with Christmas, which makes me sad). No answer. Sent a follow up text telling her I just called to wish her a happy bday, hope she has a great day, and asked if I could call her later (‚Äúit‚Äôs her freaking birthday, yo!‚Äú - we got into Breaking Bad). She responds late that night (I fell asleep) saying she‚Äôs been sleeping and depressed, and doesn‚Äôt want me to see her like that. She asks if we can talk when we are back in the city where we both go to (separate) universities. Now I‚Äôm in full internal panic mode. *Something isn‚Äôt right*, this is not like her at all. So I text her back, concerned about her and also now confused on where we stand. First and foremost, I tell her I‚Äôm sorry she‚Äôs going through such a rough time, and ask how I can best support her through this. I also ask if she means through all this that she feels differently now, but I ask in a way so she knows I‚Äôm asking to be on the same page, not that I feel like we are on a downturn. I sent that and left it, and told myself I would give her space until she‚Äôs ready to talk, because trying to force it won‚Äôt change whatever reason is behind this. No response. 


It‚Äôs now Christmas Eve, an undisclosed but short amount of time between her birthday and the 24th, and because i take this time of year to show the people I care about that they are meaningful to me, I decide to call her. It‚Äôs Christmas Eve for crying out loud! No answer. So now I‚Äôm feeling a bit shattered on the inside. Of course I love and value you myself, and I try not to ever equate my worth to anyone else‚Äôs behavior toward me. I‚Äôm only human, though, and I couldn‚Äôt avoid feeling worthless, for the moment. I felt sick to my stomach all day, could barely eat and found it difficult to engage with my family and enjoy the holiday spirit. It‚Äôs simply that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, and I‚Äôm worried, and completely powerless to it all.

Finally, the moment described in the title. It‚Äôs 9 pm yesterday (same day, Christmas Eve), after a long, confusing, and heart-twisting day, I get a notification: she‚Äôs shared a tiktok video with me. At this point I think I was so flabbergasted that I went through all stages of grief at once, with feeling completely worthless and subhuman for the night. I got an hour of sleep last night. I‚Äôm not worth a response on where our relationship stands on Christmas Eve, but a cat video on tiktok is a perfect ‚Äúgift‚Äù to send me at 9pm on Christmas Eve? I literally cannot explain this behavior rationally. This is so unlike her, though it‚Äôs only been 4 months so who knows? But I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just wanted to be a part of each other‚Äôs lives during the holiday, even if we couldn‚Äôt be with each other. 


How should I proceed? I feel awful if I don‚Äôt send her a text wishing her a merry Christmas, especially if she‚Äôs truly going through something so tough she‚Äôs shut down and I‚Äôm projecting some hidden insecurities by being (internally) upset and questioning how she feels about us . But part of me has those thoughts of ‚Äúwhat if she met someone else‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if she doesn‚Äôt like me anymore‚Äù. We both agreed at the beginning that transparency and communication are key, and we have stuck to that since the start. Apparently now I‚Äôm just left to suffer in my own head. 


**TL;DR** Met awesome girl at university, things were amazing for 3.5 months but now halfway through winter break being apart she hit a rough patch and suddenly completely changed. Now barely responds, didn‚Äôt pick up her phone on her bday or Christmas Eve, and when I texted and asked her to communicate how I can support her through this and how she feels about our relationship, no response on Christmas Eve except sharing a single tiktok video about cats at 9 pm. I‚Äôm feeling so confused and unsure of how to proceed, and whether or not her actions are because of me. Should I text her merry Christmas in case she‚Äôs just simply having an awful time and shut down, or am I being too generous with my energy based on the way she‚Äôs acted toward me?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140596,public,self,My [M22] girlfriend [F20] seemingly believes I‚Äôm worth exactly one TikTok video share on Christmas Eve,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roffv0/my_m22_girlfriend_f20_seemingly_believes_im_worth/,no_ads,0,,,

I recently moved away from home to pursue a graduate program. Before I moved, I matched on a dating app with someone I know through family friends. I‚Äôd liked this guy for a really long time and so it seemed amazing that maybe he liked me back. I‚Äôd never talked to him too much but had seen him at various get togethers, and he seemed kind, cool and collected. I‚Äôd never considered him a friend or even been friends on social media, so when he messaged me on a dating app I assumed he wanted to get to know me in that kind of a way. 
We went from talking on the app to texting pretty much everyday, but I had a really hard time telling what his vibe was. I tried to suss out the situation early on but that seemed to make him really nervous, so I decided to try being really patient and we kept the conversation super surface level. From what I know, he is a bit reserved about his feelings or may have been really nervous. The flirtiest interactions I had with him included me asking him for music recommendations or inviting him to visit my new city. 
I thought two months in that we were starting to get comfortable enough and I was thinking about asking him if he wanted to FaceTime or something since we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a long time due to covid. But he ghosted me, and when I checked in with him to see if maybe I‚Äôd said or done something to make him uncomfortable he said no I didn‚Äôt do anything but he thought we were just catching up as friends. 
Obviously, I was hurt and disappointed by this reaction. I didn‚Äôt respond to his last text claiming that we had been catching up as friends and have muted his posts on social media and have hidden my IG stories. About a month after all of this, he friended me on Facebook, and ever since this happened he has been liking many of my photos on IG, but otherwise has not texted or said anything to me. 
Does this mean anything, or is this him trying to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with me? If these interactions are meaningless, I would love to move on.

I'm probably a 6.

My standard for girls are pretty simple, she has to weight less than me.

I date from -7 years, +7 years from my age range.

For some reason, on Tinder, I swipe 90% of all girls because they are all super bomb shell.

The other 10% weight at least 300 pound. 

for Reference, I weight 150.

In the Rare moment where I see a girl who isn't a super bomb shell, I get match about 1/15 of the time.

But for the 95% of swipe which are super bomb shell, I get match 1/300th of the time.

Since about 1/20 match lead to a date for me, I'm thinking it would be way better to only see girls with the bottom 25% of likes.

This way, I would maybe swipe 30% to 40% of them, based on my personal preference and I would have a way higher matching rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend so much time swiping, that I'm about to use a bot to 100% swipe and unmatch people I don't like.

I'm (21M) in a relationship with a girl, (18F) we are dating for 4 months. It's all great, the best girl I've ever had (and it's my second serious commitment). It's a long story about how we met, how it's all started, but it's perfect, we met when I gave up on dating, and especially online dating. She approached me on the street, and so it began. I sometimes can't even believe that is happening. She is very loving and caring for me, as no one before in my life. And it's all mutual. We have a strong affection, love, and we can't imagine separating and want it to be serious. Of course, we are monogamous and all feelings are mutual. We love each other, care about each other, and have very deep emotional connection. It's only getting better and better.

Sometimes we can't see each other for 3-7 days, because I'm out of the city, because of my work, or her studies, or we are both very busy, or ill. When we can, we see each other every day, and we had long streaks doing that, seeing each other every evening and spending a night together, and as we progress, she is staying overnight in my place for 2-3 days even, without going home. So we try to see each other as much as we can because we start to miss each other if we skip one or two days.

The question is, sometimes when we can't see each other, we don't talk much, or we don't talk enough. And even if we skip a day without texting, I start to think that she changed her mind about me, that she doesn't love me the same way anymore, or I think what could I have said or what I did wrong? All of those thoughts are gone once she texts me, I feel huge relief and it's all good again. She told me she feels the same way, absolutely same way, and feels huge relief when I finally text her. It's mirrored situation. We agreed on talking more when we can't meet irl. I sometimes can't bring myself to text her first, and probably she sometimes feels this way. It's probably our insecurities.
