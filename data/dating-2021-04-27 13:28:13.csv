0,mzvela,1619548836,My boyfriend is becoming distant.,"For the past 3 weeks my boyfriend has been really distant with me. He used to compliment me everyday, told me he loved me.. etc. but recently he’s been closing himself off. I cry all the time. I have severe depression and anxiety. I always need reassurance. But now he just stopped and I don’t know what to do. He told me he has “given up”. Like I don’t know what that means because he hasn’t broke up with me. I constantly tell him how much I love and adore him but he told me that I’m a kiss ass and that I should stop. I think it’s weird that he doesn’t want my affection after all this time. I’m probably just going to break up with him, but I need advice on how to handle this situation. Should I talk to him about it? Or will distancing myself from him make it better? Maybe he needs some space?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzvela/my_boyfriend_is_becoming_distant/

I have spent so much of my time working on myself, loving myself, dating myself. But I’m going to be honest, it’s LONELY. And I feel even more lonely right now being in a new city during a pandemic where I don’t have many friends to turn to, and I have depression from the semester being online and being so isolated all the time. I’ve started actually putting myself out there this year and it is so exhausting because I feel like nobody sees me for all that I am. It really fucking hurts. I hate having this mindset about things but a lot of the time I start to question if there is something wrong with me because I see my friends and family in happy relationships and marriages, getting everything they want and me seeming like I am not getting those things despite how hard I work.

4,mzw2ub,1619550655,"I'm afraid, and i don't have hope. I just need to share this.","This is combination of ""i need advice"" and ""venting"".And this is what you already heard but not from me...

I am alone in romantic way all my life ; I am 27 years old man, average looking, with high education (university degree). And I tried Tinder. Well, first experience with Tinder seems good but at end that was disaster. My heart was broken, and i needed time to start feel normal again and move one. I saw her like 7-8 time, she was caling me first etc, asking favour and at end she just put picture with other man on Facebook and people commeting like ""you are cute couple"", ""i am happy for you"". Just few days after out last call. I was broken, not becouse she didn't want to be with me, I was sad about the way she did that. I try to kiss her on third date, she refused. Jesus, what a pain. But i didn't show emotion and i was act normal. That was like 3 years ago? And i needed like few months(like 9-10) to feel good again. And i went on 3 date in like 2 years. First girl was realy nice, but i didn't like something (don't judge me please, it was not easy for me to say i don't want second date, i felt realy bad lik I'am bad person). Third girl was nice, but she didn't want second date and i said ok and i moved on. But that is fair, she said she is not interested and i'm fine with that. 

And where is problem now, why i need advice. I meet girl. I felt realy good! I felt like somebody is listening me, not judging me, like she is realy good person. I meet offcourse girls in my life, i find someo of them like realy good, but thay don't have ""that something"". I feel like she has ""that something"". We spent like 4 hourse on first date, and that time passed quickly. I asked if she wanted to see me again, ans she said - she realy had good time, i'm good company and that we will hear each other. I don't want lie, my biggest fear is that she will say in next few day like - i chanded my mind, or i meet somebody else,or even to put me in friendzone... She is girl ond Tinder, and offcourse she have lot of offer. Offcourse i want to say to her I'm afraid of that. And where is problem? Becouse of my fear, I'm afraid i will ruin something. I don't expect that she will felt in love in 5 days, i don't expect that she think about me right now. I'm not that stupid. But, she has all that what i looking for loooooooong time. And i have fear. When i sended messegess, my fear was thet she will say  - you are good BUT... I don't know what to do. I realy don't. It is much easier when you don't care about, you don't think about lot of things. It is hard to intrepert messegess and emotion. That is drains my energy. I know that i'm not only person with that ""issues"", but i cant talk with friend about that. They can't understand that, not becouse they are bad, but they allways say - why you care, there are other people. Yes, but it is realy hard to find person ""right person"". I cant fall in love easly, but when i love, i love with all my heart...  And i don't know what to do. If i try something on third or I dont know which date, I can lost her. If i don't try or i wait too long somebody can be with her. I hide my Tinder not, I'm not visible becouse i don't want to talk to other girl and I think it is not fair to go to multiple date. Maybe I'm wrong, but i can't do that. I have feel that i don't rescpect to her if I talk to other girs in moment after date. Offcourse, we saw each other for only 1 time, and that mean only that - 1 date, nothing more. We offcourse have right to talk to other people, but i can't do that. I'm realy afraid that  she now don't talk with other about date :(

&amp;#x200B;

I have big big big fear. After long time, i cant say i meet girl that which won my heart fast. Offcourse, that is just begining and ond second, third date i can find that she is not right for me.  but intuition, which has guided me well so far, tells me that I should wait a littl. But I'm not sure is that just hope in my hearth.

I know that people here maybe have same problem, that somebody here  feel worse than me.

6,mzwqvq,1619552466,Can I cancel our meet up or will I look like a flake?,"This guy and I started talking at the beginning of March on okcupid.  He’s not much of a social person and neither am I so our texting is very sporadic and I don’t know enough about him yet to feel comfortable meeting him.  But he says he would rather talk about deeper stuff like that in person and not text.  

So, thinking of how I’ve spent all 29 years of my life single, I figured I’m just going to go for it and suggested a weekend to meet.  Weekends only work for him even though they don’t for me so I had to request a Saturday off for this.  I instantly regretted it though and I want to cancel it.  I did leave it open and said if I can get it off, would he want to meet and he said yes.  So I suppose I could just tell him something came up.  I’ve got two weeks to tell him but I feel like the sooner the better.  

I don’t want to sound so flaky but I suggested this date last Saturday and aside from him stating that it works for him, we’ve only sent one text to each other.  I can’t really ask him anything I want to know because he doesn’t want to do that over text so I don’t really know what to say to him and apparently he doesn’t want to text because he’s not texting me.  I kind of feel like it’s going to be a waste of time to meet.  That and I don’t know, still, if I want to date.  I can’t get weekends off to see him and he lives like three hours away and I don’t want to drive that far.  The more that I think about actually dating anyone, I think of how I don’t mind being single and how being in a relationship would actually be kind of burdensome for me because I don’t really want a break in my routine.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzwqvq/can_i_cancel_our_meet_up_or_will_i_look_like_a/

8,mzx2jq,1619553332,"The worst way to be broken up with is when the person is into you and good to you, but can't see the long term potential with you.","One of the most intense and confusing heartbreaks I've ever experienced was when I was happily dating the most wonderful, good natured, kind and affectionate partner I could have asked for. He took care of me to the same intensity that I took care of him. We were goofy together and made each other laugh. We shared common values and were delighted with each other on a number of levels that we frequently vocalized.

My past is riddled with religious dogma and guilt due to growing up in a fundamentalist sect and subsequently leaving it behind me when i was in my early twenties. I was excommunicated by my own family and they even admitted that they'd rather I died than left the church.

I had warned him from day 1 that it would be unlikely i'd ever introduce him to my parents... and as time developed, I introduced him to others who were important to me, but never my parents. Initially he accepted this wholeheartedly. We can't pick our parents, and it was just the shitty hand I was dealt in life.

Apparently this caught up with him.

He never mistreated me, he never spoke harshly, or behaved in a controlling manipulative fashion, he never lied or did anything to compromise my self worth. But that ONE thing made him realize that he liked me, perhaps even loved me in some small ways... but not enough for it to last. He wanted everything I was, but with the good family relationships attached to it. He wanted someone who had family who would accept him... and I think most people want that, so I didn't blame him.

It's somewhat easier to get over a relationship where there is betrayal, or bad behaviour. Because at least in those situations you can point out the villain in the situation... or you can say ""they were emotionally unavailable and I deserved better"" or ""they lied, and therefore I feel better about how I conducted myself"". But in a situation where the person was a good and caring partner, perhaps even loved you... but cut it short simply didn't see a future with you.... it sucks. All you can do is sit in the grief of knowing that the type of partner they were is hard to come by... and that you'll have to repeat the laborious process of finding someone who carries all those good traits, but who has a fortitude and attraction toward you that is more long lasting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzx2jq/the_worst_way_to_be_broken_up_with_is_when_the/

I told him I wasn’t looking for anything serious, just casual sex and I already have few dudes. Been upfront from the very beginning. It seemed like he was a bit uncomfortable with the fact that I was sleeping with other men, but in the end, he was fine with the arrangement.

I liked him most out of all dudes I had, and seemingly he liked me too as all meetings were initiated by him, he’d ask me about other dudes I have in my life and act jealous. We’d meet once a week.

I have been seeing this guy since January, and in March I found out he had a long-distance girlfriend. I immediately cut him off, but after 2 weeks, he reached out to me saying he missed me and wants to see me again. The feeling was mutual because I was really into this dude.

I met up with him again. He told
me he was in LDR with this girl for a year and he said he will move to another country in April for 6 months for work and his girlfriend will travel to that country too. After that meeting, he again asked to meet because he misses me and I ended up seeing him again. While I was giving him blowjob, he said he loved me. And he said it like 7 times that day during sex. Said he will miss me.

Anyways, he moved to another country few days after we had sex, and deleted my number on Whatsapp. Haven’t heard from him ever since. He is now with his girlfriend posting happy couple IG stories that I stalk. 

I cannot help but feel used. I know this was the arrangement I signed up for, but I feel sad that I was so easily disposable. He was never mine in the first place, but I have this ‘what if’ thoughts. What if he didn’t get the job and had to stay in our country. Would be break up with his girl and be with me?

We started online it was quite accidental but we matched pretty well and fell in love pretty easily. And to be frank she broke up with me despite her still having feelings for me.   
It was my first meaningful relationship for my entire life. Not only meaningful but first. I'm hard to fall in love and so far and usually I fall for someone who is not into me. So that was pretty significant.   
Now even after 5 months, it feels soo tiring to start anew. I'm not a person who goes out and there is literally no place where I can meet new people except online. But approaching women feels so hard and I don't know even if it's worth it trying.

I met this guy recently and when we were talking we had some good laughs and got along. He was confident and a good conversationalist so I’m sure it largely had to do with that. I’m thinking I saw him blush but idk if I imagined it. Even if it did happen it doesn’t necessarily mean anything.

30,mzzswm,1619560819,Part of me still believes I've already met my soulmate but he never felt the same way,"For some context, I (F20) met someone (M21) on tinder in January of 2020. I knew from the moment I saw his profile that he was someone special. We began to talk but he soon told me he wasn't ready and that he was sorry to cancel our date. Fast forward to the following summer, I reached out to him on instagram and this time he was interested in seeing each other. We met up about three times in three months (I was home for the summer so I went to visit him, about a 4 hour drive) and I knew I was infatuated from the first meeting. I could talk to him every day and never get bored, wanted to know everything about him and asked many questions, felt content doing anything with him, and just had this feeling as though he was the one. Of course I did my best not to come on too strong.

On the third month, he messaged me one day saying that this wasn't what he was looking for anymore and a week later, he was with another girl on his instagram who he has been in a relationship with since.

I never believed in soulmates and I still don't. If there is such a thing, I feel as though people can have multiple soulmates in a lifetime who are not necessarily meant to be romantically involved. While this guy still seems like the perfect partner to me, I stopped hurting over it ending a long time ago. The only thing I know is that with every person I've dated since, even those I've felt really strongly for and was interested in being with, I never seemed to have that ""they're the one"" feeling with. At the same time, I've only ever dated in the last two years and haven't been in a relationship. It was also hard for me to come to terms with feeling as though this strong connection I felt with another person was never mutual.

This brings me to ask, has anyone ever felt this way about someone? If I feel as though this feeling is missing with someone else, does it mean I shouldn't pursue anything further? I'd love to hear of your experiences if you have any.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzzswm/part_of_me_still_believes_ive_already_met_my/

We met up at a lake that was an hour away for the both of us.  (my dumb idea).  It was exhausting and the 2nd date was kind of a chore.

Upon leaving I told her I would like to see her again.

The last time we texted was last friday when I asked if she made it home okay and she said yeah.

I know she works 12 hour shifts pretty much 6 days a week (nights).  Her schedule is super screwed up authentically.

I'm thinking of giving her a call at 4:30ish pm tomorrow to ask her how she's been doing and maybe apologize for our last date telling her I was a bundle of nerves.

Is this a good idea?  If she doesn't answer because she misses the call, should I leave a voicemail?  Should I send a text too?

I dated a guy for about a month. We realised he was too busy at the moment to give me whatever I needed emotionally and we decided to break up, with the thought that after he finished college we might get back together and try again.

A few months passed, I see him at a friend gathering. We hit it off. Decide to go back to his place. All fun and games until we go to his bed and he... Physically forced me to give him oral. Several times. I refused a lot and said a very firm no but he didn't stop and kept pushing my head with his hands. I eventually caved in just for it to stop and then told him I'm tired and went to sleep. He dropped me off silently back at home very early the next morning and that's it.

That's how one encounter just traumatised me so much that I decided to take a break. From men, from relationships, from dating. I can't see myself getting into another relationship and ending up being harassed again. Looking back at the relationship we had at first, there were signs I didn't notice because I was head over heels for him. Just the thought of being so in love with someone I don't see the abusive signs frightens me.

I tell myself it's for self development but it's been two years since it happened and I still can't bring myself to dating. Being demisexual really doesn't help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n017vb/cant_even_imagine_dating_after_the_last_guy_i_was/

I’ve never been worried about girls I’ve always focused on myself and I’m currently satisfied with how my life is now.

I rented a flat, made some new pictures. Uninstalled all games, started a drawing instagram, reading books and watching Ted in all subjects.
And started tindering again. And boy. Beautiful matches. But. Under 1 month i started talking with 21 girls. I dated 2. And no score. At a certain point convo always dries out. No second dates.
I feel like im really boring. I run out of topics to bring up and even smart questions start to get repetitive.

I felt like she was worth it. I put up with being blown off twice and Saturday we finally met. Well turns out I liked her even more in person. Her personality was everything I had hoped for. I keep replaying it in my head and nothing adds up. It's so difficult to process.

Walking to the car she said ""Sooo how do you think this went? Not going to ghost me are you?"" To which I replied "" I think it went good. I don't ghost people. Even if I thought it wouldn't work out, I'd tell you"". 

We get to the car and she says ""Hopefully I can see you again!"" And I say ""you will"". We hug and leave. When I get home I thank her for spending time and tell her I forgive her for blowing me off previously and hope we can see each other again. She texts back saying she had a great time with me and good night. 

In the morning I text her something about a stupid dream I had (not anything weird with her, just a dumb dream I thought was funny). And she texts me ""Good .morning!"". This was the last text I got. I sent her a few after that and got nothing back. It isn't uncommon for me to send a handful before I get a response. 

Well it's Tuesday. I am pretty sure she blocked me or something. I have no idea why or what. Usually I don't care. I'll just tell myself I deserve better and move on. This time is different. It's rough. Nothing's points to her disinterest. She is the first girl in a while I didn't try to hide anything about who I am from.

I’ve hardly told anyone there I was moving. He even said he would reveal who he is if I told him my deepest secrets.

I’m really creeped out by this. What’s more, the messages are all in lower case but iPhones and androids automatically capitalise messages. 

I was ghosted by a guy last year but I moved on. He’s the only guy I can think of who would miss me as I don’t give my number out.

52,n02fzh,1619568923,Dubious situation,"Hey sweeties

So I've recently started dating this genuinely interesting guy. We met on an app, but I recognized him from high school. We casually met at a park, both jammed the guitar, had a lot of fun and there was def a connection. We met a couple more times the weeks after, things got intimate and everything seemed equally reciprocated, but every moment was almost dream-like, away from reality. And I'm not sure if that's a good sign. 

I have never met a guy quite like him, his lifestyle is so unique from most people I know and he seems to have a lot of friends. So I'm finding it really hard to judge his character and how he thinks about things related to dating.
I wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship and I must admit I've never really communicated my intentions, simply because I wasn't sure about mine and his. But it didn't feel necessary either. I just went with what I felt like.

Now 3 weeks ago he asked me to go camping with him and a friend of his. Two days before we went, we'd still spent a great day together, quite romantic even.

On the trip I noticed his attitude towards me slightly changed over the trip. They hadn't seen each other for a long time and were very well befriended. But it was almost too noticeable, like the bromance was so extreme that it was hard for me to get involved in the conversation and numerous inside jokes. 
We only kissed one time the first night in our tent, that was it. Very weird. What we had done before suddenly seemed like just some friendship and afterwards I felt like he shouldn't have invited me on the trip. Now a week after we haven't really spoken much, but I definitely want to talk to him about it. But I'm hesitant about everything rn.

I just have no idea what happened or what shifted in that short period of time. Did he hold some facade on our dates and did he show himself on the trip when his friend was with us? Is this a sign of immaturity, am I not giving clear signs? I cannot figure out my importance to him, which itself can be a red flag. I want to keep my self-respect at all times and don't want to be toyed with, but he's like the most interesting person I've ever met.

Of course, there's the 'just ask him', because communication is everything, but the situation is just so complicated right now and I know it's going to change a lot. So what are your thoughts on this?

I'm 18F, he's 19 and we're both studying in the same city.

My friends would be approached by women or had their crushes reciprocated, but to my knowledge there was no one who ever had any romantic interest in me. I had no trouble making friends, male or female---it was just romantic interest that was the issue. This can almost entirely be attributed to me recovering from a medical condition that caused me to become quite underweight, often fatigued or in pain, and with a speech impediment that would vary in intensity. I went for coffee once with a girl who actually made fun of my speech during the course of the conversation.

I dated fine in high school before my medical condition came up. Over those five years, unable to do much else, I devoted myself completely to my career/entrepreneurial activities, and now I'm making much more money than most people my age. I've been on an experimental pill that has largely cured me of my condition over the past two years. To help with my esteem, I spent some of this money on an expensive personal trainer to help me bulk, and given that I was already starting from a ridiculously low body fat I'm now in excellent physical condition.

I didn't really talk to new people over the past year due to COVID, but over the past couple months I've been easing up and tried dating again. And it's like there's such a big difference---now I'm in shape, have money, and have no speech impediment, almost everyone seems interested.

The issue is, I have a really hard time taking any of these women seriously. I'm a 24 year non-asexual guy: I'm interested in sex. But I really can't see them as anything more. I don't care at all about their feelings, and I have no interest doing anything for them. I'm trying to play the game and act kind and genuine, but if something ever came up where they needed my help, I would intentionally not be there.

I vaguely remember how being in a relationship felt like in high school---how do I care for someone again? It's like my illusions have been shattered; it's clear that people aren't attracted to what's inside me, just my body and voice and money. How do people recognize this and still care about each other?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n02uk5/how_to_feel_sincere_attraction_for_someone/

But it’s been a week, and he hasn’t texted me. And I told some one in the comment is going to tell me to text him.

But I just wanna see for once if someone cares enough about me to text me. 

Even when we were getting to know each other, I texted him first all the time. 

I found out he got a friend vibe off me, and I was okay with that. Because I was gonna suggest we be friends and I found out he got a friend vibe off me when I told him it’s better if we stay friends.

So we both decided to stay friends, I couldn’t make him like me, or see me as someone he likes, so what’s the point.

And I actually see my self being his friend and I understand why he got a friend vibe, I kinda of understand why now, I get that from him too.

But I feel like he wants me to text even if we’re texts.

And I think he doesn’t want to meet up, or talk on the phone.

I think he just wants to have me on Snapchat to make himself feel like a good guy.

59,n03bd0,1619571828,Why did he [34M] send me [26F] flowers immediately after assaulting me?,"Two months ago, I got non-sexually assaulted by a guy I was casually dating. (Yes, all the legal action I could take has been taken.) I am basically over the trauma, but something happened today that’s made me feel upset and nervous.

He grabbed my nose and twisted it for several minutes as I sobbed and begged for him to stop. The violence was likely prompted by me telling him I didn’t want to be in a serious relationship with him. As a bit of background, he is super rich and used to getting his way with everyone. He would try to give me gifts and take me places, but I always refused. (I posted about him earlier this year and you can read my post history if you want.)

I spent time with him because I thought he was interesting and fun, and because he was dark and sexy, and I never imagined he’d physically assault me. Blame early exposure to Twilight. I don’t know, I’m going to be more careful from now on.

Anyway, as soon as he let go of my nose, I ran away and told him never to contact me again. (By the way, I had to go the ER to make sure my nose wasn’t broken.)

I left his house at maybe 2 am. The next morning, I woke up to a VERY expensive flower delivery (like $178 flowers) from someone anonymous. I called the flower shop, told them about the above, and they confirmed it was him.

When I confronted him via text about the flowers, because I was disturbed and upset, he said that he had ordered them days ago, and that he had tried to cancel them, was told they were canceled, and that they went through anyway.

To me, this didn’t feel so bad. At the very least, it wasn’t creepy.

I have been trying to get a protective order against him, and I found out today from the detective on my case (cool, right?) that the flowers were ordered after the assault. That means that he ordered them sometime from 2 am to 6:30 am after I ran away from him crying.

My question is: Why would he do this? I was sobbing SO hard when I ran away from him. He kept trying to engage with me, and I kept telling him to leave me alone and let me go. My last words to him were “do not ever contact me again.”

When I got in my car after the incident, I went online to block him, but found that he had blocked me on all social medias (probably right after I left his house.)

This is really bothering me. I’m pretty spooked he went on his computer and sent me such expensive flowers to my own apartment (thankfully with a lot of security where he is banned from entering) literally RIGHT after I ran away sobbing from being in so much physical pain.

Was it an intimidation tactic? Did he hope it would make me forgive him? Why would he do this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n03bd0/why_did_he_34m_send_me_26f_flowers_immediately/
60,n03evu,1619572157,Moving too fast?,"Sorry if formatting is weird, I’m on mobile. 

I (24F) have recently met someone (38M) on a dating app. It’s been about a week or so since me and this guy have been texting. We’ve exchanged pictures (nothing nsfw), we’ve sent audio recordings so I know I’m at least speaking to a male and i’ve done my googling on what information he’s given me so far. I’m a single mom of 1 kid and he’s a single dad of 2 kids. So we both have the same kind of life situation, in that aspect at least. 

He’s very sweet, thoughtful, and is always making good conversations. He’s asking questions about me, making it known that he’s actually interested in me and he’ll text me throughout his day at work to let me know he’s thinking of me! Super sweet right? ..right? 

He’s overall, as far as I can tell, a genuinely good guy. But something seems off. I feel like he might be moving too fast already or I don’t know? He’s constantly saying “I want to know everything about you” or “I feel like you’re my person” things like that. I’m sure his intentions are well but something feels off about it? Like he’s trying to push so hard for comfortability, like the second day we were texting he asked me my middle and last name? Doesn’t that seem odd? Or am I overthinking? 

I haven’t been in a real relationship in awhile, I haven’t dated since before becoming a mom. This guy seems really sweet and genuine, but something just seems off with how he wants to know everything about me. I haven’t noticed anything else odd, granted like I said earlier in the post that it’s only been about a week or so.

So my question is- is this normal? Is it normal for a guy to be wanting to know everything about you this early? Is my anxiety and problem with overthinking going to ruin my chance with someone who actually wants to be with me? Do people always move this fast? 

I know there’s some relationships where the people meet and then get married right away and are still together 20 years later. I just don’t know how to navigate this accordingly.. thanks for any helpful advice!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n03evu/moving_too_fast/

My question is what, if any, is the maximum height gap you will entertain?

I'm 6""3' and my rule of thumb is that I won't date women more than a foot shorter than me (so 5""3'). Any shorter than that and it starts to feel a bit weird for me (ie. They feel a bit child-like in comparison), and there are practical issues such as it makes kissing harder and it can sometimes be hard to hold a conversation in loud places because they're so far away.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n03s8n/whats_your_largest_height_gap_preference/

One interesting thing I initially overlooked is that she has over +100 unread texts on her personal phone! I commented on it as she was showing me something on her phone. She brushed it off as if it was nothing and so I didn't probe further out of respect. In hindsight, after getting ghosted out of the blue, I am starting to think this lady probably has issues dealing with confrontations/emotions/hard conversations and would rather leave them untouched instead of confronting them, which is a pretty big red flag in my book.

I then loaded the profiles up with pictures of the realistically rendered female and Holy SH*T! I had to mute the notifications for my phone for these dating apps… Tinder now has 99+ likes. Bumble has 92 likes and Hinge is pushing 76 likes. And the numbers keep climbing. It’s been 7 hours…

71,n04qr6,1619576603,Was she just being “nice”,"Was she interested or just being “nice”


There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn’t leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don’t take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn’t hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn’t speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and texted her the next day. We texted for about 2 days then i asked her on a date. She said she couldnt because of covid and a household family member had health issues. I took this as a rejection and told her i wouldnt talk to her anymore. She then said she really liked our relationship and i didnt have to do that. Why would she say relationship not friendship if she rejected me? I told her i would think about it and she insisted. 

When i saw her at work she looked all dolled up with make up and hair done more than usual. She approached me like usial We talked the next day at work like normal. 

That night i texted her saying i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. The next time i saw her she looked really sad and almost like she was about to cry. I felt really bad by cutting her off, i realized i should make amends and the next time i saw her i approached and she told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. Now when i see her she still looks sad and takes her breaks byherslef. I dont know what to do as i really enjoy taking to her. Any ideas on what went wrong? Also is there any way i can fix this as i really liked her and enjoyed talking to her. 

Now when i see her it appears that she doesn’t put any thought into her appearance. Probably not related. 
I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?

A little background on us: Prior to dating we have only gone on a few dates and mostly built our relationship off of hanging out on mostly weekends after a party. The attraction is definitely there but just this past week or two we have started getting intimate, taking her virginity. She’s gotten better in putting an effort to hang out compared to before. But it’s nowhere near where I think personally it should be. She’ll ask to grab Starbucks here and there for an hour during the week. But the relationship is still build off of hanging out Thurs-Sat night, with her never sleeping over, me driving her back at like 4 am. To be fair this is her first ever relationship she has been in and it’s obvious she doesn’t know how to fully be a relationship. 

I’ve been in past relationships and have seen buddies of mine get into recent relationships where them and their significant other hang out 5/7 days of the week, sleeping over and going on constant date. For me that is inexistsnt it feels like. I’m always asking her to hang out almost everyday and trying to plan cute stuff with her not really showing the effort back.

Am I just being to needy for a relationship so new with a girl who has little experience? I was thinking about backing way off, still talking to her obviously, but seeming less needy and appear I have more going on in my life then I acually do lol. And kinda let her take the initiative.

80,n05pq8,1619579909,Feel like girls only see me as someone they can have “fun” with?,"I just got broken up with a couple weeks ago by a girl i really liked and she had some issues going on in her life and she was never really available but we just clicked so well. She ended up breaking things off bc she said she wasnt ready for a relationship and even though we had been seeing each other for 3-4 months, she said she saw things as casual the whole time. I still think about her tbh and i did want a relationship with her and i was very attracted tp her and sad that things didnt work out. I dont understand what happened there (maybe i became too clingy or needy once i caught real feelings) but we skydived together, we would skate together, she cooked for me one time, i bought her a birthday present, somehow we would wear the same colors when we would go out, yet she just ended it in an instant. 

And cut to last week where i meet a girl at a club and we were sort of eyeing each other throughout the night, she was a friend of a friend, and somehow she ends up grinding on my dick and dancing with me. I thought it was fun and all but after my friend mentioned to me how she just wanted to dance and have fun and wasnt really interested in me like that. I don't necessarily want anything with that girl but  i felt like i was just used like a dancing pole lol, we held hands and she grinded on my dick, it's cool to touch a hot girls ass, but i felt bad that she didn't really  mean anything serious by that.

And yesterday i went out with this girl, this was basically the first time meeting her and i wasn't even trying to make a move or anything but she invited me back to her apartment and we had sex. The sex was meh but im not even sure if she wants to hangout again and she was going out of town to see her family which she had told me about before, and she said she would ""let me know"" when we could hangout again which to me means like a soft no. In this situation im sort of indifferent about the girl but i felt sort of used lol, and like she didn't even want to cuddle after and i felt like a sort of boy toy.

With the girl from yesterday we had pretty good conversations as well and talked for like 3-4 hours and she opened up to me about her mom having cancer, her disorders, not having friends, and we talked about what we want to do in the future and stuff like that. I made her laugh and we had some banter but like i think maybe the sex was off but it was my first time meeting her so i wanst even entirely comfortable tbh and i really only had sex with her bc she offered me drinks and i got drunk.

Personally from my perspective i think im decent looking enough and i give off a very carefree vibe, so i imagine these girls feel safe or comfortable just expressing there desires onto me. I'm not complaining bc the me from 5-6 months ago would not believe that he's experiencing these things with girls but it makes me feel empty when i have these moments of intimacy with these girls and it's not entirely genuine or they're more fleeting moments and not anything serious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n05pq8/feel_like_girls_only_see_me_as_someone_they_can/

85,n060m0,1619580957,A letter to my bumble date,"I’m really starting to like you. 

I feel like we hit it off on the first date. But unfortunately at any minute you can choose another girl. I’m in love with the idea of what you could be, not what you actually are. 

But the problem is I keep holding on to that hope so much so I don’t feel like seeing anyone else but you. 

But we all know that never ends well. Every time I rely on one guy from Bumble it never works out. I fall too damn hard that when it doesn’t work out I have to always pick myself up again. 

It’s so hard for me not to text you. To call you and just admit that I want to be your girlfriend. Because I know I’m just living in a fantasy and nothing ever goes the way I want it to in my head. 

So I guess I’ll be sitting by the phone anxiously waiting if you’ll ever text me tomorrow, or unmatch me, or you’ll just never talk to me again. 

I always do this vicious circle. I claim this time I won’t fall hard, and I always do. 

But what always picks me back up is I know somewhere, out there, my one true person is there and I find comfort in that for some reason. As I’m living in this weird phase between being single and looking for a partner, I know I can look back and look at all the fun times I had. Sure not all dates were a success but it will be certainly an interesting phase of my life and there will definitely be stories I will tell my kids. 

So maybe you aren’t the one for me. Who knows? But I know whatever happens life will go on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n060m0/a_letter_to_my_bumble_date/
86,n06cxr,1619582190,Why do girls preach body positivity until it applies to men?,"I honestly can’t take anyone who believes in body positivity seriously anymore, especially if it’s a woman. I see women doing the most to “support” body positivity when it comes to fat and obese women (weight is something you can most often control), but body shame when for their height, which is something they can’t control.

It’s just made me so discouraged and pessimistic. Social media and TikTok have made it so a guy needs to be 5’10+ or else he’s not considered attractive. And now it seems that fit/muscular guys aren’t “in style” anymore either, since tall, skinny lanky guys seem to be the aesthetic now.

As someone who is 5’7 AND a minority, it’s been so hard to date in the US. It almost feels hopeless. I’m decent looking and I go to the gym, but it always seems like women pass me off saying “oh..you’re really funny and attractive, but too short”, often coming from women who are SHORTER than me or the same height as me.

It’s just bizarre to me how people encourage fat, obese women to stay fat when it’s obviously unhealthy, but turn a blind eye to the pressure and discouragement men face for their height.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n06cxr/why_do_girls_preach_body_positivity_until_it/
87,n06ffy,1619582441,Guy I’ve been talking to for a month suddenly disappears... HELP!,"Should I text him? What are your thoughts on this...

Back in January I matched with a guy on Hinge but due to Covid I had to return to my home country for a couple months. We never even got the chance to text that time because I wasn’t up for anything long distance. 

In mid March this guy started texting me insistently through Hinge and then gave me his phone number so we could FaceTime. I was a little cautious at the beginning because I had just gotten over a “break-up”.

The guy was super cute and made me feel a little confident about what was going on. We FaceTimed almost daily and he would always say he wanted to see me ASAP and just hang out. 

Just last week I got plane tickets to go to Miami, not to visit him but for other VISA matters, and I just thought it would be the perfect opportunity to meet him. He was super excited and was even sad that I was staying for too little. 

1 day before the flight he called me and said he couldn’t wait to see me and he suggested we got together on Saturday (My flight was on Friday) because his sister needed some help over the house and her kids. I said it was ok, since I was going back to Miami in May to work. On Friday (the day of the flight) we spoke over the phone and he seemed super excited.

Then everything changed :( 

I never got a text or call from him on Friday and his phone went on voicemail so I thought he was out of battery. Saturday same thing, I couldn’t reach him. So I texted him asking if out meeting was still up for later that night. 1 hour after my text he just responded me with I cant, had to stay with my sister. I was kind of mad but just got over it since I knew he was going to be helping his sister over the weekend. So I asked him when we would meet them and his answer was “May” (When I am supposed to be back) 

Its Tuesday and I haven’t heard from him. No text, no call, nothing. I am confused af because not sure what could’ve changed in less that 24 hours. Should I wait for him to text me or reach out? 

What are your thoughts on this?

94,n06xvq,1619584360,New to dating,"Ok I’m already overwhelmed lol

So I downloaded bumble for the first time about a month ago after ending a 6 year relationship last year. My reason for getting on it is because I am ready to meet new people and learn what kind of people I gel with... considering the last person I was with made me challenge my own sanity. 

Well, I met someone pretty quickly who wanted to meet up. He was the first to actually make me excited to be meeting someone new. He was playful and interesting. Well we met up and got along super well. So well that we kissed on the first date. It wasn’t long after that we started regularly texting and I slept over a lot over the past month. We’ve both lost track of how much we’ve seen each other. 

We make each other laugh and I genuinely look forward to seeing him. Problem is, we really jumped into it and think we may have moved too fast with sleeping over and regularly talking every day. He recently confessed that he’d like me to be committed to him, even though that’s not what he originally intended when we first talked. He said there’s something between us that clicks compared to his previous relationships. Thing is, I told him i’m not looking for any commitments, and he understood where i’m coming from since i’m trying to learn more about myself and stuff. 

However he still wants to talk and date anyway, and honestly it’s hard at this point to deny that I really like him and want to keep seeing him. So... i made it clear that I don’t want to be held down to just him so soon... and he said we will slow down a lot and try to reset as much as possible. 

So I had someone else ask me out yesterday who clicked with me at a job i took one day maybe 2 weeks ago, and well I said yes to a date because in my mind, I thought we bonded well and i’m trying to get myself out there. However, the past couple days I feel immense guilt and confusion for how I should be feeling with the first guy I met. I realize I have a big crush on him and would probably be a bit jealous if he were talking to other girls. But damn I shouldn’t be like this. 

Part of me feels bad for trying to meet someone new even though I really like this current guy. But the other part of me feels like i owe it to myself to see what’s out there. When I think about it, it makes me sad if i had to cut things off with the current guy if this other relationship works out really well. How do people juggle this stuff?

I’m already overwhelmed. I have considered retracting and telling the second guy i’m not ready to date just yet, since i’m still having fun getting to know this guy, but idk. I kinda feel like i don’t want to see anyone new if it means i have to say goodbye to him. I’d be real sad. 

Maybe I should just go on the date with the new guy anyway? It’s just a single date? I’m not technically in a relationship with anyone so I’m not tied down, but part of me feel guilty and feels obligated to tell this first guy I accepted a date.

95,n076mr,1619585295,Need a break,"How to lose emotional attachment to someone?

I started seeing someone and it escalated quite quickly. He consistently takes me out, pays for everything, was the first to ask me to be his girlfriend and was the first to say “I love you” very early on. We’ve been apart for only a day or 2 and he’s tells me he misses me. He also bought gifts randomly and would surprise me. When he got a new apartment he even said I could move in, but I decided it was too soon and said we should wait. It’s now been about 3 months. He told me from the get-go he has family matters and an ex wife, his kid will always be priority which I get. He has worked hard to juggle them and also made plenty of time for me. 

Now it’s getting to that stage things are starting to unravel. His affection towards me has become less and less. He’s been going through some family stuff I am completely unaware of as we both know it’s not something I can and should be involved in. His way of coping however is to detach, he won’t tell me what happened (not always) and will shut off, needing space or to do an activity to take his mind off. I don’t try to pry but I wish I knew what was going on. I find it hard to not internalise this expecially when I don’t know the direct cause of why his behaviour has changed suddenly. I find it hard to just switch off and do something independently when I’m left with questions about wether I’m annoying him or if he’s losing feelings now the honey moon phase may be over. 

When I ask for a hug he often hasn’t been in the mood and continuing to ask for things like affection has been getting on his nerves as he says it feels “forced”. The drama going on in his life along with some of my own insecurities / anxiety have lead me to want more closeness with him, I’ve tried to lighten the mood, give him massages or tidy his apartment as a thanks to show my gratitude. Last night he really snapped at me at a dissageeement and said he needs some time apart to take a break. He didn’t specify how long and said it could be a couple days or a couple weeks. He just needs to figure some things out in his head. Although he’s shown his love for me, my anxiety is killing me thinking I’m going to get dumped. That maybe he’s considering rekindling with his wife or losing his feelings for me. I’ve put a lot of emotional energy into him after he did the persuing I really fell hard. I know he does love me and I need to get my own life. I don’t have any family in this town and my life has just been working on weekends and spending time with him.

Basically I’m wanting to be more independent and need to trust his word that he’s committed to me. I am already planning things like doing volunteer work, hobbies, go out with friends. But him consuming my thoughts is scaring me. There is an age gap of 10 years and I worry maybe I’m not yet mature enough for him. I can’t relate to having a child or a 15 year marriage / bond with her. I want to make things work but him being a lot more financially stable and independent could create a power dynamic. Do you think this break could be him trying to wean me off? Was I being love bombed and now he’s sick of me? Or am I just being really annoying by spending too much time with him? Im going to give it 2 weeks and avoid texting or calling. But I’m also trying to prepare myself to move on if this doesn’t work out which I am not ready for heartbreak again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n076mr/need_a_break/
