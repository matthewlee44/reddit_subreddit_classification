Before our dates we flirted virtually and things flowed. On date 2 two weeks ago we had lots of fun, slept together. He told me he was looking forward to seeing me soon again and I told him me too but that sadly  it would be about 3 weeks before that because I'll be studying and testing for finals (I'm in a rigorousb1 semester pre-med program, have to study tons of material and test every 4 weeks) . He said that was totally ok and if anything he is in a busy involving career too. 

Anyway, we were talking through Instagram just touching base in a conversation. He asked when I would be free again and I clarified. I then asked him cheekily ""Do you miss me?"". He responded 3 hours later despite being online "" who are you again?"" 

I actually am hurt because before this we had been flirting and he seemed romantic. I grew to like him after years of flirting and him being adamant to still meet up when we finally could.

I'm a bit confused about where exactly he lost interest but I know it doesn't matter. I'm wondering if I have a right to feel this way or if I'm reading into it. Truth be told I do have a Fearful Avoidant style and tend to be ""one foot in one foot out "" and this is making me step completely out and just walk away from the connection. I just hope I'm not misjudging him because he does have a ""roasting like"" sense of humor even with me (which I've told him I don't like) 

I also don't want to disregard my instincts and be into someone who is clearly not anymore. Is it advisable for me to just cool things off with this guy preemptively? I'm totally ok being friends with him if things don't work out.

It sounds really pathetic, but i really don't want to feel this way, i want to be able to just take things at face value and that be it. 

She lives in her own house and tonight something was making a noise and she got scared, i went to there to see if she was okay and we talked for a bit, i was stood outside, her by her bedroom window, we talked for a bit, then she messages me saying ""you could've stayed, but you're busy"" (I'm not, and even if i was I'd cancel everything for her).

I met my current girlfriend on a young age [F16] and me [M17], almost 18, i’m now 29 years old. We are still together till this day and i love her deeply. Our problems started around 3 years ago with small fights about that i’m to busy, i’m always away and don’t text much, i’m not doing this on purpose,it’s because of my work. The problem is that she is always at home, she does’t work, has no hobby’s, not a lot of friends to hang out with and if she’s interested to learn a new study she always says “i think i start with this new study” but in the end she never does. He is always waithing till she finally sees me. I mean if you are busy you have no time to wait for my response or to see me, right. Now don’t get me wrong, she is very beautiful, sweet, she is caring and is a very good person who loves me more than anything. The fights got worse with time and years and this got even worse when she got pregnant and lost our child after 3/4 months. She got depressed and cried almost everyday and made our fights even worse and intense. It created a distance between us, but in a very strange way because you would think, Oo distance then our love is over? No, she still loves me deeply and i still loves her deeply but i just could not see her anymore or hear her voice, whenever i heard her voice like when she said my name my mind was ready for a fight and i was thinking “What is going on now again?”. Now we get to the point where my fault begins. I was on Facebook and i just randomly sended a friend request to a goodlooking girl and she accepted it, after a few days i thought why not and i sended her a message how she’s doing and she replied and after some texts i got her number and we continued on Whatsapp, we talked for hours that day and the connection and vibe was strangely good, i mean i texted and had conversations with different girls (not in flirty way) but it never felt so good with them as with her. In the back of my mind i knew this was wrong but i continued. She had a 10 year relationship and was now a year and half single, she had a bad relationship where this guy beated her, she got pregnant but lost her baby at birth, that was the reason why she kept going so long with her previous relationship, even while he beated her. Now, it felt for her  extremely good to and while she never would meet a strange guy she met on Facebook she wanted to see me and we met, we had a great day and we had sex on the first date, and i’m now seeing her for 3 months now. Met het friends and her mother and i slept for the first time in her bed. She doesn’t know that i’m still in a relationship but i didn’t see my girlfriend now for almost month and a half because of our fights. I know, this is not good and i’m saying this to myself aswell but i just don’t know what to do with this situation. Some of my friends say “It’s your girlfriends own fault, she keeps fighting you” But still this is no reason to cheat on her, i had to end the relationship before i texted this girl, but it happened now, can’t turn time back. I have now 2 voices in my head, 1 says that i need to end my current relationship and then continue with this new girl (without) getting immediately a relationship with her, i would wait and see what would happen between her and me so no rushing. And 2, leave this new girl, you only know her for 3 months, you want to trow a 11/12 years relationship away for this girl? You know, i’m scared loosing my current relationship of almost 12 years, because i still love her deeply and i’m scared to live without her because i’m so used to be around her, we have been trough a lot together, but on the other side it feels like i’m trowing away not only my life away but also her life if we continue living like this with all the fights. I know cheating is VERY wrong and i never cheated on her ever before in these 12 years, i’m normally not the guy who cheats, i really don’t understand it myself.

During this time of arranging to meet the second guy, I decided to text the first guy and ask what was going on, and he simply said he's a busy guy with a busy life and doesn't really know how to be single. I had confronted him and simply explained that maybe it's not because he's too busy, but he doesn't want too. By this point I hadn't been showing much interest with him, as I had started to give up a little and was texting a lot less than I did, which obviously flipped a switch in his head as he then started making more of an effort and finally asked me if I wanted to meet him this weekend. And... knowing I was also meeting someone else, I agreed to meet him as well.

I met the second guy this week and we also hit it off rather well. The conversation flowed a lot easier than the first guy and I felt a lot more comfortable. I ended up staying round his, and then went round his again the night after! We get on really well, but he is the complete opposite to the first guy. Really keen to see me again and keeps bringing up our next dates... which puts me off a little. 

Why does this always seem to happen? For weeks I had been wanting to see the first guy, and once I am seeing someone new, he is texting me more, making more effort and actually wants to see me again?

I don't want either of them to know that I am seeing both simultaneously, as I am still trying to decide who would be better suited to me. I actually like the first guy, but the second guy seems to be making more effort.

As I leave this last physics lab, I’m kicking myself for not asking the girl that was my lab partner, that I thought was really cute, for her phone number. I stop in the hallway to fill up my water bottle, and she walks up to me and asks for MY number and told me to send her some of the art I told her I used to do in high school. She mentioned to me during that class that she was into art, and I told her that I used to a lot in high school and was actually pretty decent but hadn’t done any in a while.

I am completely flabbergasted and caught off guard, but of course I give it to her and tell her I’ll text her.

That night I shot her message of some pictures of paintings, drawings, etc… and mention that this week and next week I’ll be studying in the library a lot studying for some finals. Told her that it would be cool if she stopped by and we could get coffee or lunch and study some together. The next day she says that she’d be happy to, so invited her to come that day. We go study and talk for like an hour before she had to go to work. Seemed pretty normal, nothing off atleast to me.

She actually is the first to text me that night, telling me that she finally figured out the chemistry problem she had been working on. I take this a sign that she at least liked spending some time together enough to text back, so I told her this morning that if she would like, I’d love to go get dinner or see a movie to get to know her a bit better.

She texts back later that day.

Says that she’s sorry if she gave of any mixed signals, asked for my number because she wanted to be friends, just got out of a long term relationship, and would still like to be friends but nothing more.

I too just got out a 4 year relationship a few months ago. Keep in mind, I’m in college, so aside from my one girlfriend throughout high school and a bit into college, I have little to know dating experience. I wasn’t looking to rush into anything either but thought that I would at-least try to hangout and learn more about her.

She seems like a genuinely cool girl, so I told her it was no biggie, that I could relate and wasn’t wanting to rush into anything even if it was more than friends, and would still be cool being friends if it wouldn’t be weird for her, and respected her for being honest.

I say all this to ask a few questions. Being in a relationship for so long at such a young age has me wondering if I literally know nothing about dating. Obviously asking for somebody’s number can be to become friends, but doesn’t it typically mean that your into that person? I specifically asked her to meet for coffee or lunch so that it would be obvious it was a date, but apparently she didn’t pick up on that? Is it likely that she was initially into me, but after hanging out she no longer was?

It's common knowledge that a lot of men's ""bar"" for casually hooking up is a lot lower than their ""bar"" for who they'll commit to, when it comes to physical appearance.

As a woman, I feel like I wouldn't be able to enjoy having sex with someone if that genuine lust/desire wasn't there. I have a vibrator that does the trick just fine when I'm going through dry-spells. 

That being said, I know male and female sexuality works differently in some areas, so I'm curious how it is for men who have done this and what drives the desire to sleep with someone you're not that physically into. 

Is it an ego thing (aka knowing a woman would sleep with you in the first place)? Does having sex with any woman, regardless of attraction or lack thereof to her, simply feel better than masturbating (def not the case for me)? Is sex in this scenario the equivalent of eating or taking a piss, just a need to fulfill without much regard to who it's with?

I was at an all time low and she filled the void in my heart. I put her on a pedestal, but a week later I met and spoke with her sister who revealed to me a lot about this girl I’d loved. I found out she was love-bombing, had a history if compulsive lying. I confronted her about this, and she admitted to me. We talked more about this over time and I thought we’d worked things out. This was a consistent and recurring thing in our relationship. Enough with the prologue- she had called me one day telling me she had been kicked out of the house by her father. At this time we were doing long distance. (I was at college, with her for summer) At this point we were apart and together 2 separate times, both my doing trying to give her time to work on herself. Not wanting her to end up literally on the streets, I panicked and pulled every string and connection I had in our hometown. I ended up getting her a bus to my apartment where I was studying (5hrs away from hometown) Things were going great, so I brought her into my home to live with me temporarily. She had spoken to me about always wanting to live in (City X = my university’s city) City X, so I made the condition that she’d only live with me while she found a place to live. I did this for many reasons, it was well thought out. Though, months passed and she showed no effort into finding a place to stay. I didn’t mind too much, until I found out one of the risks in letting her into my world I didn’t foresee. She started getting overprotective and jealous of the life and many connections I’d built here in City X. She began adding all my friends on socials, I found this off but didn’t mind much. I found out later she was feeding them lies about me, these friends slowly stopped talking to me. I found out she was doing this and gave her 2 weeks to find a place to stay or I was driving her back to Hometown. About 2 weeks came, she found a place to stay, she showed me the lease. I didnt see the move in date or apt number, and she made up an excuse for why she didnt have it. In hindsight, that was sketchy asf. Few days later, mid-terms came and I decided to throw a party in my apartment and invited all my friends. Things hit the fan here. Me being me, I socialized with EVERYONE and she got jealous. I was drunk so I didn’t notice, but everyone else felt something was off. I went outside to sit on my car and enjoy the night sky while just a lil drunk. In hindsight, I think I did this hoping my ex would follow me outside. I give up and go back inside. Everyone’s staring at me, an odd stare, not the “oh the host walked in” stare but the “omg look at him” stare. Apparently my ex had started crying. Eventually, I heard mixed stories here, one is she was worried for me (this person and I were not close by any means and I doubt this source) and she was creating a pitty story including one where I would beat her for not cleaning (this one came from someoneone who was closer to me, Ive heard this more times than opposing). In actuality, she took pride in doing this. I made it a point to let her know that while I do appreciate her hard work, I by no means expect her to do this. I was drunk and didnt hear this, so I had no chance to defend myself. I keep getting bad vibes, so I go to my room and start to hyperventilate. The music outside stops and my OCD needing to fix it, drunk- I cannot. I hide in my room and start having a panic attack. My ex walks in and tries to talk to me. She’s making the attack worse so I ‘whisper-yell’ to her to exit the room and let me be alone. This turns into a full on mental breakdown and I start throwing things and making noise. Eventually I calm myself down, and compose myself before going outside to the living room and join the party. (At this point guests found a way to get music back on) but everyone is gone. Only Girl X, Boy Y and my ex are standing by the kitchen. They were waiting for me. My ex was crying again. She was telling a pitty story again. I finally realized whats going on here.

I was talking to this guy for 4 months until he ghosted me.  I didn’t hear from him for 2 weeks til the other day. He told me he started seeing someone and didn’t know how to tell me, and he was sorry for being away. I said it’s alright and hope he has a good holiday. I decided to leave it there and he didn’t reply. A day later, I still felt hurt and unsatisfied. Thinking I should have said how I feel so I texted him (yes double text) saying I thought it was rude how he ghosted, especially since we shared intimate things. I told him it wouldn’t have hurt to say something. That was all. It was more like a few sentences but I wish I didn’t text him at all. What would you think if someone did this?

\- Told her hex was abusive and narcissistc towards her

\- Uses tinder and dating apps 

\- Has had a high amount of sexual partners

I also only have girlfriends, i dont believe in having guy friends. So a few days ago i was at a lounge with a friend and we had a great time. I was making pictures of her, because it was a beautiful place. I also took some selfies. So the owner asked us: why are you taking pictures (which was very weird) this was while i was taking pics of my friend. He asked my friend are you insecure and she said just because im taking pics it doesnt mean im insecure. So that was weird.

Then she went to pay and i got back from the toilet and i see them talking about him giving his number because he wants to hire her for a job there. Apparantely she seemed a strong person lol. So i asked what are you guys talking about and then he explained and offered me a job right away. But i immediately said no because i have a very nice work-at-home job, and i dont like boys watching me or restaurant/lounge jobs. 

So the next day i thought about trolling my fiance about it: ask if i should work there. I told him on whatsapp and suddenly he got all crazy and started forbidding me to go to lounges. I thought what the hell is going on. He was being unreasonable. So i told him i will leave him alone so he could think. But when i talked to him 12 hours later he was so convinced i really wanted to work there. I seriously had to explain myself while he knows me almost 1,5 year??? Like almost saying im lying. So the way he was talking was  so degrading, i told him you have crossed a line (this was on whatsapp) and that i was done with him . But we both know it doesnt mean we break up.
