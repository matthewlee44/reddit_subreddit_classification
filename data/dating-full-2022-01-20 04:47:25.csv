I’m a baby gay and she was pretty awesome.
We definitely formed a genuine connection that neither of us expected 
We spent a lot of time together and before long we were hooking up and falling in love. 
I find out they have a partner pretty early but we continued anyway. In my head I was being ignorant of the fact that I was helping them cheat and I wanted to be with her so I ignored it.
They said they loved me and they wanted to be with me, my problem is that I didn’t want a relationship at the time cause our age gap is 8 years and I’m still in my early 20s and I didn’t want to settle down, I wasn’t ready. 

I told Jane this and I said I couldn’t give her what she wanted cause I don’t know what my future holds and I’m still figuring out who I am. We stopped seeing eachother for a week before she came back and said “Idc I want to still see you’ so I did. 
Her gf is suspicious of us And  I believe if I said I wanted a relationship, Jane would have left there partner for me. Which again I didn’t feel right about. I also think that starting a relationship off as a cheater isn’t a good start to the relo. 
There partner found out about us. Mind you they had a house together and a dog, Jane told me that she hadn’t been happy for a long time but she was also extremely comfortable and didnt think about leaving until she met me. When I found out that Janes gf found out about us I thought, even tho I loved and cared about her that i needed to remove myself from the situation so she could think clearly on what she wanted to do. I knew that if she wanted to stay in her relo casue I couldn’t commit then I couldn’t keep seeing her

But then she comes at me and tells me that I don’t really love her and that if I did I wouldn’t leave. She’s begging me to stay, we can’t really stay away from each other but we can’t really be together 

My thing is that Jane was perfectly happy before we starting seeing each other, or “comfortable” as she put it, so I can’t help but feel guilty for turning her life upside down and that if we never starting seeing eschtoher she would still be in a happy home and her partner wouldn’t be hurt like she is. I feel like I’ve completely ruined there lives and it sucks cause I know Jane deep down is a good person she just acts based on instincts and doesn’t think about what she’s doing 

I’m helping a cheater cheat and even worse it’s emotional cheating cause we love eachother.

Thing is, he asked if I wanted to go to his place for the first date…what?? I told him I’m not at all comfortable with that and he responded by saying, “I’m not going to kidnap you, lol.” Uhhh…there’s no way I’m going to a stranger’s place when I first meet them. So, I stood my ground and told him I prefer to meet in a public place. Since then, he’s been less responsive.

Here’s the thing. I’m not naïve, I know he wants sex. Not gonna lie, I do too but not when I first meet a guy. But since I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, this is what I’m wondering: Is he nervous about meeting outside of his own place because covid is still on the rise? Maybe he doesn’t have a car (he lives in the city, I’m in the suburbs) but isn’t comfortable with sharing that detail…or does he just not know where to go? I don’t know. There’s no chance I’m meeting him at his place unless he has a reason otherwise. I also said I’m cool about meeting somewhere in the middle; I don’t want to be in a super crowded place. I’ve communicated my feelings on the issue and it seemed like he understood. Who knows. Honestly, I don’t particularly mind if I hear back from him or not. He said he “doesn’t ghost people,” but that’s what it feels like and I’m *not* going to let it get to me. In the event that I do hear back, should I just straight up ask why he hasn’t made much of an effort to iron out the details? I’m just curious and I’m willing to compromise.

This text is very confusing to me since the last date seemed to go well and I thought overall things were going great and that she was into me.

To start at the beginning we matched on Hinge and kinda already knew each other thru a mutual friend that we both hung out with at a concert years ago. Our first date we met at a Thai restaurant at 7pm and the convo was so good our dinner lasted 2 hours, just talking and laughing. Then we went to a bar for maybe another hour, then I walked her home and she invited me up. Once inside, we started making out and she said she wanted to have sex but I told her I didn't want to do that on a first date so we just kept making out til I left at 1am since it was a week night and we both had work the next day. During the date we had talked about liking the same comedian and I told her I had tickets to see the comedian and a band the next week so we already had our next date planned while on the first date.

The second date we met up and had tacos before the concert. The convo seemed to flow smoothly and go as well as the first date had gone, if not better. After the concert we walked for maybe 30 minutes. It started to rain so we went under an awning and made out for awhile, which felt very romantic and like a movie or something. She even said she thought I was a great kisser and that she liked kissing me etc. We did seem to have good chemistry and the kissing was very heated and felt passionate. She also brought up that I didn't want to have sex after that first date and asked why and I told her I had just gotten out of a longterm relationship plus I was never the type to sleep with someone on night 1. Even after I answered she kinda seemed hung up on it and let me know that she really likes having sex and I responded that I do also but I guess I just take things slower than she does or whatever. Besides this the rest of the night's convos seemed normal and nothing stuck out to me as a bump in the night. Once we got to the subway I asked if she wanted to hang out again and she said she wanted to and we could make plans later on and we parted ways there as we both had work the next day.

That next week was when omicron started to get really bad in NYC so we both said thru text how we were trying to lay low before we went back home to see our families for the holidays. I then left NYC to go back home for 3 weeks. I'm not a very good texter in general plus I was preoccupied a lot during those 3 weeks as my grandma died and had a funeral so we only really texted for one day during those 3 weeks but I wasn't too worried about it based on how the 2 dates had gone. When I got back to the city on a Saturday I texted her at 4pm Sunday but she waited til 10am Monday morning to let me know she was still at her parents upstate. She also seemed less responsive and less talkative for this convo. I then waited another week and texted her yesterday asking how Westchester was at her parents to which she responded 8 hours later with the rejection text at 11pm. I kinda felt like she was doing a fade out type thing to me from our past 2 times texting once I got back to NYC but I was still surprised based on how our 2nd date had gone even though it was 4 weeks ago at this point. I wanted to ask her specifically how I fucked it up but that also seemed like a crazy thing to do plus I know I'm not going to change her mind or anything but I kinda wanted to know why for my own sake. 

So now I'm just sitting here wondering how I fucked it up since it seemed to be going so well. Looking back maybe it was the fact I didn't sleep with her yet, which seems like what some women get mad at men for doing so it would be weird if she was doing that to me? Or perhaps she didn't like that I didn't text her much during the holidays for 3 weeks and it killed the romance for her? The rejection text mentions there being no romance yet she wanted to sleep with me right away and told me she liked kissing me etc on our last date. Perhaps for her wanting to sleep with someone and make out doesn't mean she's actually into them romantically though? I've been friend zoned before but never after seemingly having chemistry like I had with her. Usually being friendzoned isn't surprising cause the person doesn't try to sleep with me and we didn't have much sexual chemistry. Maybe there could be another reason I'm missing though or I am fixating too much on thinking its cause I didn't sleep with her yet even though she wanted to.

Some of these infatuations have lasted for weeks, some for months, one for 4 years. The latter was a close friend of mine with whom I was so deeply infatuated that no matter how I looked at my future, I could never, ever see myself with someone else. I don't see any of them in that light anymore. Mostly because none of our relationships panned out, but that's the point. I was biased and maybe a little desperate, so I placed them on a pedestal no one deserves to be placed on.

I'm a very niche kind of dude. My interests don't match up with a lot of men my age, let alone women. This is why whenever I meet a girl who actually likes the things I like, I feel like I lose myself in thinking that she is ""the one"" meant for me. I start panicking and worrying about whether or not she likes me, when what I should be worrying about is whether or not *I like her*. *Her*, not her interests and hobbies. And in most of my cases, when I look back at the women I was infatuated with, I never really liked any of their personalities. Maybe a couple, but not enough to want to spend the rest of my life with them.

There isn't a single ""someone"" meant for every one of us. The truth is, you can never really know whether you're compatible with a person or not until you actually get into a relationship and live with them for a good few years at the least. So, the next time you meet someone special, take it easy. Don't stress about the future, don't stress about ""messing it up"", don't worry about whether they like you back or not. Instead, try to gauge whether *you* like them or not. Not their hobbies, or the way they smile, or that unique emoji they send you with every text.

So I (30 F) hung out with a guy (25 M) I met at the gym. I’m generally very reserved but we ended up hitting it off so figured after about two weeks of talking at the gym, why not have a spontaneous dinner. Well, I ended up asking to have sex with him (cuz hashtag consent). To that, he commented that he never would have assumed I’d ask that question based on my demeanor with but just genuinely wanted to hang out with me. (But, naturally, he didn’t decline the sex. Lol.) Anyways we’ve had sex once more after that (and I’d like to think it’s good sex as we have a great connection) but I just feel like since the sex, we’ve been communicating less. As in before the sex he at the very least made an effort to send a text or even work out together. Not much of that is happening. 
That said, do guys become less interested after a girl has sex so quickly? Because one minute he thought I was cool, funny, beautiful blah blah and now he’s pretty MIA. Or maybe he thinks I’m not interested in anything serious as I mentioned I am open to something casual if he doesn’t have the time or desire to sincerely hang out? Why is this so complicated?! My game plan is to wait until he reaches out, if he does at all, before I inquire about the situation.

Most of my partners were pretty clear they found me attractive, and the long term partners tried to drill it into my head that I’m not ugly. I never was able to feel that way myself though.

I’ve hardly tried to date since I broke off my last relationship back in May. I’ve been exploring hookups with men recently (playing on easy mode as some might say), so I haven’t really been looking for anything with women. 

I’ve finally found myself emotionally ready and in the right life situation to start looking for relationships again, but my self confidence has reached an all time low in recent months. 

It’s gotten to the point where I think that if people I know see me on a dating app, I worry they will find it hilarious that I think I’m good enough to date. I recognize it’s  irrational, but it doesn’t stop me from thinking that whenever I think about reactivating my profiles.

I’ve gotten in even better shape, started wearing more well fitting clothes, and I’ve taken better care of myself in general over the last 8 months. I look in the mirror from time to time and think “you handsome bastard”, but it seems to be just as often I think “you piece of trash.”

I’m starting to realize that I’ve probably just started to enter the window where I’m at the height of my datability and attractiveness, so if I was ever to shoot some shots, now is the time to do it.

I (30F) have been single for 5 years now and during that time I stayed away from men and dating.

I was mostly okay with this, yes I thought that it would be nice to meet someone and share my life with them but I just kinda assumed it would happen for me. 

Anyway late last year I joined a couple of dating apps out of curiosity, I had a couple of one night stands which was very out of character for me but I had given up on finding anything meaningful and thought this was it for me. 

I ended up meeting a guy on Hinge and for the first time in 5 years I was excited about someone. I really, really liked him and he seemed to like me too. It felt like we were building toward a relationship and then I was blindsided and it’s like overnight he just decided he didn’t want me anymore and couldn’t handle it. 

I don’t want to go into the details of what happened there because it’s a long story but the whole thing has left me absolutely gutted. I can’t shake it, I can’t get over it and now I feel lonelier than I ever have in my life. I have no intentions of putting myself out there again and can already feel that my walls are back up ten feet higher than before. 

It’s like I had accepted being alone and knew it would happen for me eventually but now I have finally lost hope and it’s hit me like a tonne of bricks. Like having a brief taste of intimacy and having someone be into me and having it taken away is so much worse than not having it at all.

She was really cool, and to be honest, I caught feelings for her. However, I already had a girlfriend at the time.

On the trip, we met some other people our age. There was this one guy that was hitting on the girl I liked, and I got really jealous. I was drunk and not thinking straight. I told this guy that I liked the girl.

The girl eventually found out, and she actually asked me herself if what I said was true. I didn't realize she liked me back, but I had to tell her that I had a girlfriend. She looked so disappointed, and I felt really bad.

A few days after the trip, she requested to follow me on Instagram. I left it pending for two weeks, and I rejected it. I felt really bad, because I already led her on, but I was just trying to do the right thing for my girlfriend. It wasn't so much that I felt threatened by her, but I thought that if I didn't see pictures and things this girl was doing, it would be easier to forget about her. Also, I thought by waiting for a little while, it would make the rejection easier as opposed to rejecting it right away. I wanted to make it look like I at least considered it before saying now. However, the same night I rejected her request, she blocked me.

I found out later that she tried requesting me to show that we were still friends. Her intention was not to get in the way of my girlfriend and I, but since I denied claims that I liked her, she figured that it was just a misunderstanding and we could at least be social media friends. After all, she and I live in different countries, over two thousand miles away.

I tried forgetting about her. It's been two months since I met her, and I just broke up with my girlfriend. I don't feel the same way about her anymore. This other girl, however, I like a lot more. However, I feel like I don't have a chance. I wouldn't take her back if she led me on and chose someone over me, why would she take me back?

We're thankfully getting to the point where it's acceptable to not want to have kids. It is your life, your body, your choice. How about realizing this a step further: you don't need to be married to live happily. Even further, you don't need to be in a relationship to be happy!

I'm 25F and I've dated, I've had my share of serious relationships, I've struggled with and gotten past codependency and trying to fit myself under other people's standards and societal norms...

...but I am the happiest I ever been now that I am living my life under my own standards. And I am so very happy on my own. I don't want a relationship with anyone. I'm not trying to find someone to fit some mold in my life that an arbitrary society says I need to fill.

I constantly see all these posts with people complaining that they're always looking for someone to fill some void in their lives. But I feel like this void is something society tells you you have. ""Others seem so happy in a relationship, and I don't have that so I'm not happy"". And then once you do find this relationship, it's ""I have a relationship just like others have, so now I am happy because I succeeded and am just as good as anyone else"".

Don't get me wrong, when you happen to meet someone and it so happens that you just want to spend all your time with them, that's great, go for it, but in my (probably unpopular) opinion, very many people are looking for a partner or are in a relationship for the wrong reason, and that's to appease some societal norm.

He lives in an apartment with his flatmate, but has yet to invite me over, however he has said ""if the carpark is closed and you can't get your car out, you can stay at mine"". 

I've just gone home after each date which I don't mind. I think it's a respect issue with his flatmate too. He doesn't want to bring back guys and make her uncomfortable, which I understand and respect. I am definitely not pressuring him to have me over, because that's his space and his right.

This weekend, I have the house to myself, and I mentioned this to him a week ago, to which he was excited and expressed interest towards. Today I asked him to come round tomorrow after his shift to spend the night and he said ""I'll see how the shift goes tbh""...

He doesn't seem that excited to spend the night at mine while my folks are out of town? His excuse is he has work again the next day at 10am. I told him that he could come Saturday night or Sunday night (if Friday night didn't work) to which he said ""I'll keep that in mind"" which again, doesn't sound very exciting of him?

He's mentioned to me before that's he's scared of sex, and hasn't done it with a guy before. So maybe that's why he's not keen on coming over or hasn't invited me back to his. To be honest, even if we don't have sex just yet, I'm okay to cuddle and enjoy his company really. It will be just nice to have our own place for once.

On our dates we chat, spend 6 to 12 hours together and kiss and get on heaps. So I'm slightly confused as to why he's being ""weird"" about staying at mine.

I (28M) live in a big Spanish city and, last Tuesday, while I went with a colleague out for lunch in a small restaurant. Since it's a small, quite famous vegetarian restaurant, there was a little bit of a queue, so we waited in line. Behind me there was this very pretty girl (in her twenties from her face), who at one point just smiled for some reason (probably looking at something on her phone) and I was just mesmerised (the smile is my favorite thing in a girl).

So, once we got in, I simply walked out (my colleague had sat down) and told her something along the lines of ""Hey, I really like your smile and I'd like to know you better, so if you feel so, can I ask for your number?"", she was surprised commenting how she usually makes the first move and the woman with her laughed (in a positive way) but then she gave me her number and we introduced each other (by the way, she is Spanish and I'm Italian, but I can speak fairly fluently Spanish). After that, I simply went in and had lunch and, while going out after eating, I simply waved hello as she had sat down to eat with her friend/relative with her replying with a smile. A couple of hours later, I texted her suggesting I'd like to take her out for a beer or a coffee: the idea is nothing serious or intimidating, just easy to see where everything is going. She replied after a few hours saying that a coffee was a good idea and wishing good night.

Okay, after this babbling, long story short my question: what are your advice for this first ""date""? All my relationships and flirting came out of social circles (serious ones at least), so I am like a fish out of water in terms of dates. And especially in this case, since I only know her name (and I presume she is single) and I don't even know if this qualifies as a proper date (I'd like to invite her out on this Saturday at like 10 am).  
So, my ""plan"" is to ask my Spanish colleagues for a nice coffee spot (besides googling for suggestions), meet her like 10' from there and walk together to go over the inevitable initial awkwardness and see where it leads. Is this a good plan?

I want to go without any expectation, meaning that, while I would like possibly to get a relationship, I'm just open to see where it all goes. For all I know, she could be my future wife, a good friend, or more likely just a random acquaintance. I don't know and I don't want to overthink it, but I do want to enjoy this opportunity (especially considering I come from a long dry spot and a pretty lonely love life). I had never approached a random girl and I just realise the opportunity was good (had she said no, we would have been both at our tables, no awkwardness or big deal), so I'd really like to do my best.

So, any advice on how to behave, what to do and not to do, anything really 'cause I am kind lost (happy but lost).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153777,public,self,Need advice: first date after a random approach,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8elnx/need_advice_first_date_after_a_random_approach/,no_ads,0.0,,,

The matter is I know this woman, we have been living together for a while and we built a nice relationship.

She could be easily 30 years older than me but still I feel attracted by her.

While I was living with her we engaged in nice conversations and I always noticed there was something else, a little attraction but I couldnt go further at that time.

I understand that affection can be from someone that gives you conversation.

She is separated from long time ago and I ignore if she is seen someone, I believe she is not.

We meet up every now and then, always the conversations and the meetups coming from me.

I tried to approach her and I realised she doesn't feel uncomfortable with my touch (or maybe yea but she doesn't show in any way shape or form).

However if I try to get closer, I feel she is hesitant. This could be because she hasn't been with anyone in long time.

Last time I spoke with her I said I would like to do a hike with her and she said she is always up for the adventure. I feel she likes engaging with me and she always have fun.

I'm in my late 20s and she is in her late 50s

I don't know how to approach and I suppose I'm too fearful to be direct and offend her.

In the first few months of dating she was always turned on and it was so easy to turn her on like a light switch and it made me feel really confident and loved and wanted. She is my everything and I was so happy. But then she stopped getting turned on easily and for the majority of our relationship since (it has settled a bit with time) my girlfriend has had bad mental health where she freaks out and constantly overthinks about whether or not she is lesbian. I love her so much and I tried to be there for her for so long despite the pain but overtime it killed me everyday and it completely and permanently has destroyed my confidence and how I feel about myself. 

I snooped her phone and I saw things she posted on her mental health apps (I know it’s bad but I couldn’t help it I went crazy because she wasn’t fully telling me what was going on for a very long time)and long story short most of her posts in a summary were she can’t get turned on by just looking at me (and naked boys in general)and she finds the naked female body more arousing than the males. She could only get aroused by lesbian porn. I saw things in her history before we dated like “I want to fuck a girl” etc even tho she told me and still tells me she never wanted/wants to have sex with a girl and it’s gross. I always (99% of the time ) initiate sex and when we get into sex she enjoys it but other than that I feel no sexual want/chemistry from her at all. She does however say she finds me pretty a lot and thinks I’m hot. 

I feel like pure shit. I feel so dejected all the time. I cry about it behind her back so regularly  and it’s been a year and a half now. I can’t cry to her about it because she freaks out about it and tells me I’m a bad person for not understanding her. It really has destroyed my confidence and I feel so ugly and worthless. Especially when I’m always getting so turned on by seeing her naked but I never feel the same energy back.

I’ve met this guy on Tinder and it was pretty clear he wanted me to come over as quick as possible to his place. I wanted to get to know him at first so he took me out but asked to come over the 2nd date again. He’s a good looking sporty man (M26), I’m also an attractive lady (F23) and get a lot of attention from good looking guys.

I agreed but told him I’m not promising anything sexual yet. He agreed, told me “sex isn’t the only thing on his mind”. (I kinda know it is, idk why he tries to make it seem like it isn’t) I just thought, alright.

One thing that I didn’t like before going to his place is that I asked him if he could pick me up from the city, as I live quite far from the city and would have to travel to another suburb from there. The response I got was “yea if that’s needed, but the bus also comes here”. 

Usually the guys I’m with happily pick me up especially if they want me to go to their place.

It just… didn’t feel like he would put in effort? which I always want to see in a guy in the beginning. 

So I went over to his place by myself (he did offer to pick me up but I was already omw). 

He was talkative and didn’t make any too sexual moves, as I had told him earlier I’m not sure about sex yet, but I felt comfortable with him after the movie and made the move for sex. It went fine.

I spent the night afterwards as it was late (he had told me earlier I can stay for the night). We talked a lot during the night and he said “do you need me to drop you off somewhere tomorrow?”. I said yea if you want, he asked where I live, I showed him the suburb. It’s  like 5 miles from his place to mine, but buses go through the city centre which makes the travel time over an hour. So ofc it would’ve been nice if he would’ve dropped me off in the morning.

Morning comes, he tries to make a move for sex again, but I have some stomach pain from last night’s session and we don’t fuck. 

He doesn’t even mention dropping me off home nor does he ask about how I plan on going home or anything. He knows I don’t know the suburb at all. 

I tell him I had a great time, he says he hopes I’ll come over again soon some time, and then he kisses me and we makeout for a while. _I leave alone_

Before this we had talked _every day_ on and off, not constantly though, but still. He doesn’t message me the whole day (doesn’t ask did I get home safe or how did I get there, nothing).

He only sent me a snapch*t 3 days later, which wasn’t even anything directly to me, but rather sent it probably to many people. I responded, but he didn’t really put effort to make a conversation. 

A week goes by of quietness and he asks if I wanna meet again. We agree that I’ll text him when my exams are done and I’ll have time to come over again. I texted him next week and told him when I’m free, he agreed we should meet, but never made an effort to make the plans and basically left me hanging.

2 weeks of silence go by and he comes back without any explanation.

**I’m down to hookup and have fun, but I don’t even feel like I would want to pleasure him sexually and do my best performance in oral etc if I know subconsciously that he’s lazy and doesn’t even care about me as a person or my safety or anything at a bare minimum level**.

But, that isn't all to be in a relationship. Just because you aren't someone they would sleep with in an ONS situation doesn't mean they can't grow to find you attractive.  

There are women who are unattractive, too. You must find someone who you don't \*find attractive, who probably won't be attracted to you either, and develop a relationship between you both. This is what they mean by ""attraction can grow"".  

Yes, the woman you're with would probably much rather prefer to be with a tall guy, but then, you'd feel the same about her.   

Yes, it's unfair. Life isn't meant to be. But, you can't really sit around complaining, can you? You have to do something. Get fit, get well dressed, groom well, get a good haircut, be giving in bed, don't be sexist in any way, get a stable financial situation, be hygienic, have a clean and well-furnished apartment, get rid of any insecurities that you have, and develop a good personality.

They don't guarantee that the human of your dreams will swoon at your feet, but they improve your chances.

2) ""Work on yourself"" sounds like cheap and trite advice, and honestly sometimes it is. But there is a good reason to do so anyway: We don't all look like instagram models, we don't all have as much dough as personal finance youtubers, and we're not all athletes. But taking a part of ourselves that we dislike or that others find unattractive and working every day (or most days) to improve it both maximizes our chances of finding a partner and minimizes the downside if we don't. You win either way.

3) If you are single, (like I am) well-meaning people, usually in relationships themselves, will sometimes tell you something that sounds like ""Well you shouldn't want a relationship"". They are wrong, but there is a kernel of truth in what they say. We are all human (well maybe a cat or two is reading this) and it is 100% natural to want to be loved and to love others back. That said, desperation is unattractive. Feeling desperate does not make you a bad person and can happen to the best of us, but it will turn others away.

4) ""Men"" and ""Women"" are not monolithic blocks of human with one single mind each. Reddit dating subs are full of questions along the lines of  ""Do women/men like \_\_\_\_\_?"" ""Do women/men feel \_\_\_\_\_?"" It is true that generalities exist (Everybody likes to feel safe, more women are hurt by men than vice versa, society sets some kinda dumb standards for what an 'attractive' male or female body is, etcetera). If you are wondering what a specific person is thinking or feeling, asking that specific person in an appropriate way at an appropriate place and time is often the best way to find out.

5) Dating is hard. Some people will find you unattractive, some people will ghost you, and some people will treat you like trash. It happens to everyone, so try not to let it get you down. You will like people who don't like you back. You will make mistakes. If you're anything like me, it might be an emotional rollercoaster. People may judge you for these emotions; try not to let any of this get you down either. At least not for long

We met up a fair bit, he wasn't the best texter but in person we hit it off really well, so I assumed he was the kind of person who preferred to talk in person (which is fine). He had told me he really liked me, and that we 'get one another'... whatever that means. 

We had made ourselves exclusive the other week, and I had started to catch a little more feelings than I had before. I thought to myself, 'Maybe this is different, and I need to embrace it', as I was starting to second guess a little beforehand. 

We last saw one another last weekend, I stayed round his and spent the day with him. At this point, I had started to open up more to him about the way I felt, telling him I liked him etc. Then when I left, I felt something in my gut that something wasn't quite right. I think I started to deep things a little more as I started to grow feelings for him. Then after that day, he stopped texting me. A couple of days after I asked what he was up too, and even called him. He never answered, and it really upset me. I was shocked! I didn't know whether something was up, but he was definitely online and knew I had tried to call, but never phoned back (he would always call me). The next day I asked why he was ignoring me, and he replied bluntly that he had a heavy night drinking the other night. I said it was a shitty excuse, and told him it would have been nice to know this. He was very passive and blunt, and said he doesn't like going on his phone all the time, (this is funny as whenever we were together, he was pretty much always on his phone).

The first date went super well. The second date also went well, though things got pretty spicy pretty quickly and she told me she wants to slow down. I totally agree with her, but now I feel embarrassed that I let myself get to that point, and I'm praying that the relationship isn't soured in any way.

I (22M) matched with a girl (F19) on OkCupid about a month ago. We talked on Discord for about two weeks to get to know each other, and we quickly discovered how much we shared in common (kinks, hobbies, personal experiences). Let me tell you, there was a *lot* of anticipation building up to the first date. She told me a lot that she was very touch-starved from the past few years of not dating, on top of some trauma (she says she is hypersexual) from other experiences. She told me that she has never felt such an emotional bond with someone and that I seem like a keeper. I conveyed that I felt the same for her.

The first date was perhaps one of the best that I've ever had. We met at a mall and she took me to various stores (including an adult toy store). While we were in the elevator, she grabbed my head and kissed me, which was so exhilarating. We went to a hibachi place right after (with her mother, believe it or not) and had an amazing time. Her mother even paid for the meal, and I insisted that I help pay her at least. Yes, I realize that this does not sound like a typical date, but let me tell you, I thought it was just amazing.

The next day, I invited her over to my apartment. We started with making out, then she started giving me a handjob while her feet were over my face. I was too nervous to finish, so then we stopped and played Resident Evil and watched funny videos for the rest of the evening. I walked her out to her mom's car, and she later told me her mom really appreciated that.

The day after that, we were talking about possible date ideas, and I suggested a romantic bath. She said that she really would like to do that, but in the future, as she wants us to slow down now. I completely agree with her, because while I feel pretty confident that she's the one I want to be with long-term, I don't think there's any need to rush at all. She also said that while she had a great time on the second date, she was touch-starved and let herself go a little, and for now, she wants to be in the cuddling phase. She said that ""sometimes it happens"". Later that day, we had a great time playing some PC games online.

Again, I completely agree with her. I really, really like her and I honestly can't fathom being without her companionship. But I'm just ashamed and embarrassed that I let myself go instead of slowing things down before we had the second date. She's been quite transparent with me since we started talking, and I just hope that this isn't a sign that she has doubts about dating me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153827,public,nsfw,I feel very embarrassed about getting intimate too fast with my date.,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8kz9m/i_feel_very_embarrassed_about_getting_intimate/,no_ads,0.0,,,

After that, his demeanor changed. He started cussing more, and acting like a db.  
I talked to him again two weeks after the first time I talked to him. I asked him out, and he was like: 😶. He just said ""we'll talk next time.""  
I didn't know if it was rejection or not. He missed classes for 1 week bc he was in contact w someone who had covid.

This can be utterly confusing. I’ve been there.

Having fun and making her laugh is not enough. Making her laugh is only one component of attraction. Some guys make the mistake of believing being funny is the primary component. 

She not only wants have fun, but feel an emotional spark. This can’t be done alone by making her laugh, or going to interesting places. There are several components to laying the foundation of engaging her emotions.

- Subtle, playful, incremental touch. A light hug when meeting her, playfully touching her arm while laughing. This component is crucial. However, it has to make sense in the context of your interaction, or it will come off as being creepy. Touching her hands within the first several minutes of sitting down is an example. If you’re walking, leading by putting your hand on her back lightly if you’re crossing a road or walking to different area shows leadership and has a protective quality at the same time

- Teasing and flirting. There is a  difference between teasing and negging. A neg usually involves a backhanded compliment about her appearance that is meant to make her self conscious. It’s subtle mental manipulation and is unethical. When you tease, you’re both in on the joke. Think of the way you tease someone when you’re in a relationship. When you like someone, it’s a natural behavior to lightly make fun of each other and have fun. Use that same type of energy. If she makes a joke that doesn’t stick, or says something dorky, look away jokingly as if you’re frightened, or for split second act like you’re getting out of your seat to leave. Teasing and flirting go hand in hand. You want to convey subtle sexual energy, though the way you look at her while you’re laughing and teasing. Use restraint; you don’t want to constantly be teasing one another. Ask her open ended questions as well.

- Eye contact. In studies, participants (who were strangers) that were placed in a room and stared into each other’s eyes reported feeling increased feelings of affection after prolonged eye contact. The importance of eye contact can’t be overstated. You don’t want to glare, but you should be maintaining steady eye contact throughout 90% of your conversation, looking away periodically so things don’t appear unnatural. While she’s talking look at her eyes, and then briefly look at her lips, and then back to her eyes.

So I'm currently in the last class of school and a few months ago I noticed a pretty girl at the bus stop, who I think is two classes below me. I would really like to get to know her but the problem is, I'm introverted and very shy (just like the average teenage Redditor) so I haven't talked to her yet even though I had a chance to talk to her multiple times.

Yesterday at school it has been announced that we can buy flowers with a custom message for someone in school which will be handed to the persons at valentine's day. Because of this I thought that maybe I could figure out her name by asking two of her friends, who take the same bus as me every morning, and send her a flower with a message like ""Hey I would like to get to know you"" and maybe my phone number or something. 

So my question is whether you think that this is a good idea and if so what message I could send her with that flower.

We tend to have decent conversations, where we are usually texting each other back.

There are times where I will call and text her, and she won't get back to me and I know she has received it, because she's posting stuff on Snap. It just makes me feel like our conversation is a lower priority than social media and it does bug me. When we're together in person, things tend to be good.

Last night for example, but I also think I'm also to blame as well.

She texted me in the morning and I replied a few minutes later. Then she texted me a little later asking if I got her message and that she didn't want to call and play phone 'tag,' in the off-chance I wasn't available to take the call, and I got caught up with work so I didn't get a chance to reply. I called her around 9PM, and we briefly talk while letting her know that I apologized for being occupied at the time. During the conversation, she mentions her best friend is calling her. I tell her okay, just call me back and she says okay that she will text me first beforehand to make sure I was still awake.

A few hours roll by, and I assumed she wasn't going to get back to me so I went to go workout and fell asleep. Then, when I wake up, I see on her Snap that she had posted a story saying she fell asleep at 11, which means she could've called or texted me around that time. 

I'm beginning to think that now that the honeymoon phase is sort of over, she's either getting comfortable around me with the thought that I wouldn't leave her, or doesn't think much of it. I'm not a huge fan of manipulation, but I'm going to start giving her back the same energy from now on.

I've always been told that you should judge someone based on what they do, not what they say.

Firstly I really just don't feel comfortable w/ my gf having done porn of any kind. Before this relationship, there was no way I would've dated someone who had done porn/exhibitionism. It's just a natural turnoff I guess. But this is such a special case I feel - I feel extremely bad for her because she doesn't feel comfortable with it either - it still haunts her and is completely not her fault as she was the victim of some heavy abuse in her past relationship. \`So its not like she even had control over it or we don't share the same values. 

It's been almost a month since she's told me, and its still bothering me on and off and kind of tearing me up, and affecting my  emotion towards her. I've been trying really hard to get past it and she really wants us to work out and I feel so so bad because she has had an extremely abusive past w/ both her family and her previous BF and I want to be the person who can show her what non-abuse looks like. I don't know how much longer I should wait to see if it subsides because right now our relationship dynamic consists partly of sometimes me being uncomfortable with it and her being anxious about me leaving, and its not that healthy for either of us. 

tl;dr GF was r\*ped by ex then coerced into making porn. I have a strong natural aversion to porn thats affecting our relationship, but also feel really bad for my GF because she does as well.

I'm not at the point of being exclusive with any of them. There's M, C, and J.

Ironically, M is the only one who explicitly knows about all the other dates I was going on at the time, which already made him so much more comfortable to be around and now he's by far my favorite. Possibly my favorite person I've ever met. Since work has ramped up, I really only have time/energy to continue seeing M. (And introvert-energy wise, he doesn't drain me which is **invaluable**.)

It's also of note, that I've only been intimate with M at this point.

My question is: how do I break it off with the runner-ups? I like C and J, but no amount of 'like' will outweigh someone who doesn't drain me and who I'm immensely comfortable around. I also know by the things C and J have said to me, that I'm going to end up hurting them - which I don't want to do!

J was an online friend of mine for several years prior to this and we decided to start dating when I was single. And yes, it was stupid that I decided to start seeing a friend. I should have known better.

I've been seeing C the longest and I'm under the impression that he thinks we're exclusive despite us never having that conversation.

I want to be honest, but I can't imagine, no matter how kindly I said it, it would sound anything different from, ""I cast a wide net and you made it to second place!

I gotta warn you that this is targetted torwards males from about 15-25. If you're above that age range some things here may not apply. That being said, let's begin.

First, what is a ""virgin""? The definition i'm using is ""has never engaged in any sexual acts"". It means that giving handjobs, oral, being fingered, among other things, counst as losing your virginity. Of course, different people may have different definitions but this is the one i'm using.

Now, trying to find a virgin girl might prove to be a challenge nowadays. Teens are encouraged to start their sex lives early so it's not uncommon for girls to have their first time at 14. In recent years, however, there's been a rise in virginity among young people so there may be hope. Still, we can't just rely on pure chance so we must find a way to raise our chances of finding virgins. In order to do that we must first identify what kind of girl has higher chances of being virgins.

The most obvious answer is religious girls. There is a catch, however. Religious girls have a far higher incentive to lie about being virgins due to purity culture and some may even be ""born-again virgins"" so i wouldn't trust religious circles to find virgins.

More liberal-minded girls are less likely to lie about their sexual history. They are, however, more likely to not be virgins. Still, the honesty factor makes pursuing them worth it but we gotta find characteristics that make them more likely to be virgins.

The number 1 trait that's shared among virgins is shyness. Extroverted, talkative people have more social interactions, thus have more opportunities of having sex. Shy people, on the other hand, have a hard time bonding with others and rarely if ever go out to party, thus removing them from the casual sex scene. The shy girls are, however, harder to find due to not going out much. The best environments to meet such girls are school and college. It's important to note that i'm not referring to girls who fake being shy to look cute, i'm talking about ACTUAL shy girls who have a hard time even looking someone in the eyes.

Pretty girls always attract attention even if they are shy so it's wiser to target average-ugly girls (if you are attracted to them, of course). Chubby girls, flat-chested girls, they tend to attract little to no attention so they are your best bets.

Now, on how to approach. To gain such a girl's trust you have to not pressure them. If you study together, ask her about the class. Talk to her a little everyday without pressuring her. If you make her feel comfortable she'll warm up to you and you can SLOWLY escalate things.
