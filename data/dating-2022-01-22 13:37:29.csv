He did not make a fuss about it, he just asked me home to clean them and assured me it was 100% percent okay. He cooks for me and pays most of time time when we go out. Last night my toxic family called me at 1 AM demanding I bring them some water &amp; (even though he didn‚Äôt want too) he was willing to drive with me to get the water &amp; bring it to my family‚Äôs house. After that he also talked to me about how I should set healthy boundaries with them. When we went on a mini road trip for four days, when I got back I asked him what he did while I was gone and he said ‚Äúworked, smoked weed, played demon souls and waited for you to get back.‚Äù But I seen on his phone that he had hinge messages from two women on the 15th of this month when he went to the bathroom. When we came back we cuddled for a big in silence &amp; then I told him ‚Äúokay, I have a serious question to ask you.‚Äù And he goes, sleepily ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Then I ask ‚Äúso what are we?‚Äù He goes ‚Äúbad timing‚Ä¶‚Äù then he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I like you and I like spending time with you.‚Äù Then I say ‚ÄúI like you too, and I like spending time with you as well.

What do you want?‚Äù He says ‚ÄúI want to be happy‚Äù. Then I realized that he was falling asleep so I just turned over and let him cuddle me.

I went to this bonfire meetup event on the beach and it was my first time with this group. There were maybe 100 people there and everyone was pretty friendly. Within about 20 minutes I was already taking with a woman who approached me. We casually spoke throughout the night and even spoke with a couple other women as well. Met some cool guys too and we just ate food, drank and talked for a few hours. The night ended with a spontaneous make out session with the first girl I had met earlier and we exchanged numbers. 

Damn, I couldn‚Äôt believe how much easier it is to talk to people face to face instead of online and dealing with superficial bullshit and ghosting 24/7. In person people can immediately appreciate your smile and sense of humor. Kinda crazy the people you can meet once you get off the apps üòÇ

19,saclb8,1642886866,My boyfriend is shutting me out,"My 20 y/o boyfriend‚Äôs dad died a few years before we started dating 7 months ago and I (22F) am doing my best to help him, but he says he feels lost and alone and I think he never dealt with it properly. Normally I think someone my age would be able to handle this and go about it in a mature and healthy manner. 
What you don‚Äôt know is that I was emotionally and psychologically abused by my mom and stepdad and now have CPTSD and abandonment trauma, with an anxious-avoidant attachment style which only affects approximately 7% of the population. I have BPD traits but have been finding new and healthy ways to cope with my trauma. I am still a long way off though, and ever since I got into this relationship there is always a fear that he will leave me. 
I am giving him space, I try to text him only once a day (usually just to say Goodnight) and we check in once a week. He knows I love him and that I‚Äôm there to support him, but I still feel helpless. He is pushing me away and shutting me out and my fear of abandonment is coming back like this huge ice cold wave that I am fighting so hard to control. I feel like I cry more about our situation than he does and it hurts me so much that he thought he should break up with me just because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. He already has hurt me by isolating himself and it‚Äôs really hard to watch him suffer like this. 
I was apprehensive about dating him in the beginning because I know I have destructive habits and skeletons in my closet that I am doing my best to heal from and get rid of and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him or myself, but being on the other side of it now has made me realize that all that really does is insult the other person. It means you don‚Äôt trust them to stand by you through thick and thin and is actually really selfish. I have acquired so many tools over the years and want so desperately to give them to him to see if any of them help, but he just won‚Äôt let me!! I see him at work and we are chill but I personally need a lot of physical intimacy and affection and those needs haven‚Äôt been met and so that‚Äôs been really hard too. I don‚Äôt sleep well now, I cry every day, even at work, my anxiety is through the roof now and I don‚Äôt have much of an appetite either.
Side note: I am a former psychology major so I have been ramping up my healing process by doing Dialectical Behavioural Therapy on myself and using various therapeutic tools and methods I have in my arsenal as well as scheduling more therapy sessions because I really want this relationship to work out. 
In short, I trust him but I do not trust him to get through this on his own. I am doing all I can at the moment including reaching out to our friends and getting their help and support, giving him space and trying to be patient, but I feel like I am still not doing enough and get so sad and anxious and just want to slap some sense into him.

27F Back in Dec, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Later in wk we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. Eventually I asked he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. I was not as bubbly at movies compared to when we first met up, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he‚Äôs the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you‚Äôre welcome and he said drive safe. When we first met, we ended with a hug. When we spoke on phone, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but at movies it was odd, he sent a message after saying that he wasn‚Äôt really feeling it from me and it‚Äôs not going to work for him. Flash fwd to yesterday, he sends a message on IG with a reference to Xbox exclusives, we used to be back &amp; forth about console wars. He continued to follow me on IG but I removed him when he called it quits, why is he reaching out again?

So  there's this girl I like in french class that I go to every weekend.  She's very nice, funny, pretty, relatable and feels good to talk with.  We share a lot of interests. I don't know if these are hints but she  always tries to get a seat beside me or asks me to sit beside her in  class . One time, she saw me drawing in my art book so the next day she  brought her art book to show me. Then another time, she noticed my snake  ring on my finger and next week she got a snake ring herself and showed  it off to me. We often go out of class for coffee during break and we  go for a walk. When I asked her which people she likes in class, my name  came up first. We talk online after classes but she takes a while to  get back to my messages (sometimes 1 to 2 days). She replies with like  20+ messages to just 2 to 3 of my messages ( her messages are not very  big but they seem very enthusiastic) She does reach out but its more for  help or homework. She tells me I am very enthusiastic, nice, romantic  and tells me I am very good with words. She apologizes in class if she  misses my messages before class and asks me what I was doing when I  don't reply to her messages when we are in class. She tells me she's a  very busy person also (this will be relevant later). So today , I told  her that I will be absent next class because I have some work. Her reply  was ""I will miss you a lot"" to which I said ""Well, if you are gonna  miss me so much, maybe we could hangout sometime"" to which she said ""I  wish I could but I just don't have the time"" and now here is my current  situation and I am totally lost on what to do next because I feel a bit  down by what she said.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sae3fi/i_like_someone_and_they_seem_to_like_me_back_but/

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know if these things that I find odd are something that I should overlook to connect with this person who is different from me, or if it‚Äôs an instinctive reaction that I should listen to and get away from these people because we probably won‚Äôt really connect to a level of being really close.

I didn't get to contact her at all yesterday because I was busy for majority of the day, but I was hoping she would have left me a message or something. I ended up getting 0 notifications from her. Fast forward to today, its about 5 PM now and still nothing from her on her end.

I feel like when I actually talk to her she seems interested, but the fact that she hasn't made an effort to initiate conversation with me for over a day makes me think the opposite. I'd send her a message, but I also don't want to force conversation when I have nothing to talk about.

I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking things too early, but my gut and experience tells me that she's not going to bother putting in effort.

I went from no matches to getting my first kiss today after two dates, which I would not have predicted a month ago. I am still a virgin however. 

She lives about an hour away, but we try to meet slightly halfway, although the midpoint is much closer to her than me. It's a lot of gas, but I don't mind driving on the weekends like that. 

The first date was for coffee, and it was obvious by the end she wanted to see me again. So we texted for a week back and forth, bantering. Then the date today, we got pizza and hung out around town at various locations. Sat in my car and talked. That's when the kiss happened, and I kissed her again when we left. 

Now I'm likely looking at a third date. To this point, I've only had 6 in my life, including the last two. The problem is, I cannot escalate beyond kissing at the moment because I have no real place that can give privacy. And this includes heavy make outs. Right now I live with my parents, and she lives with hers. The tentative plan is to move out by the springtime however. 

The third date, I have no idea what I'm going to do. Dinner sounds too intense, and afterwards I'm obviously going home. More coffee and lunch sounds boring.

53,safrpa,1642895660,Is it always appropriate to get a gift for a former GF if you're just friends now?,"TL;DR: I was seeing someone briefly and things went way too fast. Before we broke it off, she asked if I could buy her some FFTCG card packs as a way to repay for the dinner on the first date. I agreed, and I still want to do something nice for her, but I'm wondering if it's still appropriate or not.

I (22M) very briefly dated a woman (19F) recently. For some context, we met on OkCupid and texted on Discord for a couple weeks before we decided to finally meet up. On her end, there was a *lot* of anticipation for this date, and she even felt that the ""stars aligned so we could meet"" and that she didn't think there was anyone more compatible with her than me. I felt like I reciprocated those feelings.

So we have our first date and it went swimmingly. We went to the mall and were holding hands, kissing, hugging, and having a great time. Her mom ate with us at dinner and it seemed like I made a good impression. She ended up paying for the meal, even though I insisted that I at least pay for my portion.

We meet up at my apartment the next day, and we get very spicy with each other before playing Resident Evil. She told me she had a really good time. On the third day, she says that we should slow down and I agreed with her, though I felt a bit heartbroken. I was falling in love with her. While I'm still a little emotionally raw, I'm quickly learning to embrace friendship and I'm putting aside any sexual feelings I had for her.

Before we broke it off, she said ""I found out a way you could pay me back for dinner. I don't like to ask people for things because I feel like a burden. But I was wondering if you could buy me some FFTCG packs when we play at the game store? That would mean a lot to me"". I offered to buy her 5 packs.

For context, I do not play FFTCG. She wanted to introduce me to the game, which I am looking forward to. Even after breaking up, she still wants me to meet with her friends to play the game with her. I don't know if she's still expecting me to buy these cards for her. I want to do something nice for her, but at the same time, I feel like it would be seen as a romantic gift and not a friendly gift.

So yeah I just quit dating apps.
And now about cold approaches, I tried going to the mall today to do cold approaches and guess what.
I approached absolutely NOBODY, and the reason for that is because I just do not have the courage to.
I‚Äôm not worried about rejection, I‚Äôm more so worried about creating an awkward moment.
And so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to do that again just because I feel like I wasted alot of time and that put me in a bad mood.
And I get it, the more I go and do things the more confident I get.
But here is the thing though, I like to already have a good idea of who the person is before I approach them.
Heck, when I was still in high school I had better confidence approaching female class mates because I already sort of know them due to the fact that I saw them everyday.
But yeah I just don‚Äôt want to be someone who is 19 that approaches someone in the mall to talk to them for a bit, just to find out that they are like 30 and have two kids when I thought that they were like my age.
It‚Äôs moments like that that I‚Äôm worried about.
So yeah, dating apps and cold approaches are officially off my book now.
My last options now would be to sign up for something that I‚Äôm interested in (Like maybe a boot camp, a sport, a club, etc.) because apparently finding random women online and in public just don‚Äôt help me at all.
I think I know my niche but not necessarily full 100% though.
My dream job is to be a game dev and game entrepreneur and so I actually already signed up for some courses a few days ago that are online, I‚Äôm also going to take an online drivers training course soon too.
But still, those are all online and so I really need to figure out something to sign up for that I‚Äôm interested in that will also help me meet a lot of women who share the same interests.
Can I please hear some advice??
I would highly appreciate it.

69,sah1ag,1642899301,Is she interested?,"Hello,

I'm using a throw-away account since some of my friends know about my reddit account.

For the past three weeks I've been talking to a girl from my uni class that I'm interested in and whom I initially met roughly 1 year ago. Our convo began by catching up on how we spent our holidays, with her sending me pics of her trip. However, due to covid restrictions, I have been able to talk to her in person just a handful of times. Our conversations are mostly subject oriented, but occasionally we may talk about other things (pets, movies, etc.). Even though she replies really quickly and enthusiastically, laughs at almost all my jokes, sends me voice messages and sometimes teases me, she almost never initiates text conversations and if she does, it's still about asking for my opinion about homework. Could those be signs that she likes me?

On a second note, I'm not on her extended friend group, meaning that we haven't went out yet even as friends. Any advice on ways to get into her friend group would also be appreciated.

Lastly, do not hesitate pointing out things I may have said wrong. I'm a really introverted person and this is all very new to me. I'm willing to provide more info in the comments below.

Take care!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sah1ag/is_she_interested/

74,sahfec,1642900473,"Looking for advice on my situation, thank you in advance!","**About Us:**

* John, 24M ‚Äì graduated, works in Finance, 1st Gen Indian-Atheist.
* Jane, 21F ‚Äì graduating next semester, works in Real Estate, 1st Gen Russian-Jewish.
* Met through a group project at college.

**1st meet:**

After the semester ended, Jane asked for some help with personal finance tips (via Zoom). I shared that I also help people with writing resumes and polishing LinkedIn, and she was interested. I asked if she would like to meet in person to work on the resume over lunch ‚Äì she said yes!. We talked for 3 hours and we didn‚Äôt get to work on her resume (which gave us a reason to meet again). She wanted to split the bill, but I insisted to pay since I asked her for lunch. This lunch is where I fell in love with her, we shared a good 50% of our life story and background, what we like/dislike, how our birthdays are 2 days apart.. and she initiated to go watch a movie next weekend.  
 

**2nd meet:**

Still not an official date, but we went to the movies. I don‚Äôt own a car but have my license, mostly uber. Jane offered to drive us to the theatre. I got her flowers and I got us the tickets. She offered to pay for popcorn but I fought her to pay for it, the next minute she sent me the money over Zelle. Overall it was a rushed night for us since it was an evening show, and I was a little tired from work.  
 

**3rd meet:**

Still not an official date, but after midterms, I asked Jane to let‚Äôs go to a Thai restaurant, and later movies. We had a good time talking, watching the movie, walking around. Once again, my bad habit of always picking the bill. She fought me but I assured her don‚Äôt worry, I got this. We stopped by to get donuts, and she paid for it. On our way home, we planned for Sushi next weekend but ended up going to a concert.  
 

**4th meet:**

Still not an official date, but one of my favorite DJs was playing in the city, so I took Jane to the concert. The concert was good but it rained so we had to leave early. I paid for the tickets, but she asked me several times how much it was so she can send her portion. I said don‚Äôt worry, I got this.  
 

**5th meet:**

Still not an official date, but we go for the sushi night as we earlier planned. I got flowers for Jane. This was a big night where she shared about her ex, her breakup, etc. When we sat down at the sushi place, she called the waitress and whispered something in her ears. I didn‚Äôt ask, thought it was something female personal stuff. We both enjoyed the dinner. When it came to the bill, the waitress charged me only half and later realized this is what the whispering was about. I was shocked and impressed that she did that, but I guess I let it go since she has always been willing to help pay the bill. Later that night I felt like I should not put her in these situations again where she would go out of her way for the billing situation. I know I know, I‚Äôm being too serious with this billing thing. There‚Äôs more to come.. sorry. About the ex ‚Äì I finally asked her if she‚Äôs going out with someone or talking to someone, she said nobody. She wants to focus on her career and doesn‚Äôt really have time. I think this is normal and people always change their minds later if they are really attracted so I continued with the journey. Then she finally opened up about her ex and how he broke her heart by getting married to someone else. Really messed up. However, this gave me a good opportunity since the ex is completely out of the picture.  
 

**6th meet:**

Still, not an official date, but I asked Jane to let‚Äôs go to a standup comedy show. Once again, she wanted to chip in, but I paid for the food and cover. This was an alright night, but the only highlight was that I shared a story about a friend who was having relationship problems and wanted to get a female perspective. And I think, I think, I think while giving her opinion, she hinted something along the lines that ‚Äúif people are going out for several activities and not making it a relationship, then what are they really doing. I say hinting because that‚Äôs what we have been doing ‚Äì going out on these couple date-like activities but not making it official. I especially backed off and wanted to take this slower because she mentioned last time that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. Anyways, she mentioned that she will be going on a week-long trip with her friends. Her birthday was also coming up, so I asked her what her favorite color was for the gift.   
 

**7th meet:**

Still not an official date, but I asked Jane to let‚Äôs go to a Steakhouse, where I would give her early birthday gifts. One thing I didn't like was she texted me in advance not to bring flowers, and if I do then she won't accept it. I thought something is wrong, but the dinner went really well. I arrived earlier and asked the waiters to come to sing her birthday song with the dessert. Overall, I opened up about my ex and why I am an Atheist, learned that she is not strictly Jewish but slowly wants to follow it more. This was a problem because it would be hard for her to officially date/go out with someone who is not Jewish (just my thinking, maybe not true since we have already gone out so many times). One other key thing I found out is that she likes things to happen quickly, while I take my time. In other words, I was taking my time to learn about her and show her who I am before I could ask her to be my girlfriend. I forget the details but we opened up about a lot of other deeper things about our lives. Anyways, we split the bill this time, and we had the talk that going forward I won't fight over the bill, and go on budget-friendly places (since I was always taking her to $$$ places). I was coming close to where I needed to make this official, but in the back of my mind, I still didn‚Äôt help her with the resume. So we planned for next weekend, work on the resume then go watch a movie.   
 

**8th meet:**

Still not an official date, but I finally helped Jane with the resume this time. I was relieved knowing that in case she does not like me the way I like her, then at least I would have done my part to fulfill the goal of why we had originally planned to meet at first. So after the resume, we went to the movies. At the movies, she asked me what I like so she can get me something for my birthday. I said nah don‚Äôt get me anything‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mind, but I want to see what she can figure out naturally. After the movie, she said one of her friends (female) wants to go to the museum and if I would be interested to join. I said sure. This friend of hers was having her own relationship problems with a guy who was not putting his share of effort and making time for her, so my girl asked for my perspective, and I said if a guy/girl really likes you they will do everything to make time for you, they both were impressed with this. We later had dinner, and I once again snatched the bill, but this time it was 1 vs. 2 so we all split the bill. Yes yes, I know I have this obsession with paying for the bill. Before we left for home, she asked me if I would be interested to go to this circus which is running in the city right now. I said sure, and she insisted that she would buy the tickets. This was the last time we met before she went on vacation with her friends. By friends, I mean only female friends. Yes, she does have tons of guy friends but according to her she now avoids hanging out with guys unless her close female friends are also with her.

**9th Meet ‚Äì**

Still not an official date. Once exams ended, we planned to do something fun. I got Jane a box of chocolates. I kinda knew we were going to this Virtual Realty place because we talked about it earlier on + she asked me to meet around that place. She bought us the tickets and said this was my birthday gift. We talked about her vacation and found out that it was bad, she caught covid and didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. Once we returned, we headed straight to exams. All the above events we met every weekend, and this time was the first time we didn‚Äôt see each other for long. Our birthdays are 2 days apart. I sent her a birthday text when she was on her vacation, but she didn‚Äôt wish me on my birthday ‚Äì no big deal since I later found out she was sick + I wanted her to enjoy the vacation so I didn‚Äôt text her at all during this time. After the VR game, I then took her to a really romantic rooftop restaurant. During this dinner, one of her close friends texted that she had just broken up with her bf. And this led to talking about our ex‚Äôs. She mentioned how 2 weeks ago, there was a guy who DM‚Äôd her on ig and she was talking to him but she rejected him. This hurt a little, because I realize we were not officially dating, and so people should have the option to meet other people.. anyways winter was coming, so I wanted to buy her jacket. Not to sound creepy, but her home address was on her old resume when we were working on updating it. So I asked for her permission if it was cool to have it delivered to her home. She said yes but later forgot that I knew where she lives (more about this below). Another thing I learned at this dinner was that our mom‚Äôs birthdays are 2 days apart too!

**10th Meet -** 

Still not an official date. That last dinner and how guys DMing her really made me realize that I need to confess soon otherwise I lose her. We always spoke about broadway shows but Jane has never been to one, so I got us tickets. She insisted on sending over money for the tickets, but as usual, I said don‚Äôt worry. We later went for dinner, which she paid for. At this dinner, I told her that I have a few places/events I want to go to with her. Out of which half of them she already has done, so the list became smaller. One of the things is Monster Jam happening on Feb 5. So I set a deadline that ok I will ask her on a date after the show and if she says yes, then Feb. 14 is valentines day ‚Äì perfect timing. This time, she did mention that she would like to invite one of her best friends with who we went to the museum with. She also mentioned one of her other close friends' birthdays is coming up. I know this friend since earlier on Jane had asked me to help her friend with her resume too. I bought a gift card for her friend which I planned to give next time we meet. Walking back home, I asked her about what qualities she looks for in a guy. She said 4 important things (I mention it below what they are).

**11th Meet ‚Äì** 

Still not an official date. I got us VIP seats to the Medieval time's show (right by the glass where sometimes the warriors give fake flowers to you, bad decision if you are on a date). On the day of the event, Jane asked for our reservation details so that she could add her friend (who we went to the museum with) to this table. I was like it's alright whatever. Earlier that week, I got her some merch from my work and since it was last minute I didn‚Äôt get the chance to get her friend anything, which her friend was cool about. I also told them both that I got the gift card for her other friend (who I helped with her resume once), so just give it to her. Jane said let's call her so I could wish her birthday. Anyways, during the show, she and her friend were going berserk about the good-looking the warriors/actors at the show were and that really pissed me off. One of the actors, gives both of the girls fake roses, probably part of the act. There was also a photo opp for the three of us before the show. When we took the picture, I stood in the middle of both the girls and Jane stood a good 2inches away from me. Like bruh, you can see in the picture that there's a good gap between us. Anyways she insisted on paying for her tickets and asked how much was it. Even had her friend ask me, but I said don‚Äôt worry. My thinking was she drove us to the show so I can take care of the tickets. While driving back home, I reminded her we have a shooting range the next day. She said oh no can we cancel because she has something she needs to take care of. Later that night, I told her I will go with someone else for now since the reservation was for the next day. I also reminded her that we have the Monster Jam coming up next month and that I will meet her outside her place. To which she was shocked and ask me how do I know where she lives. Since her friend was also there I felt embarrassed. I reminded her that it was on the resume and I asked for her permission to have it delivered to the address. She was like oh. 

**Now, this week ‚Äì**

When I told her don‚Äôt worry about the shooting range, I did let her know that I had 2 other places from my list that I want to go so let me know if she was down. Jane said she will let me know during this week but was not 100% sure. I said ok I will check with her Wednesday ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt text her on Wednesday. Only because she said she will let me know if she is free and it's been a week she never texted so I am doing the same of keeping myself busy with other things in my life. I wanted to see if I'm a priority at all. I gave a lot of thought to what is happening, how she has already invited her friend and wants to invite her friends more and more to things that I plan for the 2 of us. So far, I know that I am in the friendzone, and it's going to be hard. I had also deleted all the dating apps I was previously on when I first met her, but now that I'm realizing how I'm not on her priority, I'm getting back to trying to keep my options open.

**Problems in my opinion:**

1. This girl is drop-dead beautiful, and I feel like I am out of her league. I am like 5'6 and she is 5'5 and I ask myself sometimes why is a girl so good looking like her hanging out with me. Especially after the last show of how she and her friend were going crazy about the actors, and how she stood away from me for the picture.
2. We never text during the workweek unless it‚Äôs about talking about the next hangout. Like never, ever. A huge part of this problem was created from my end. First, I am not good at texting, I rather do it the old way and meet you in person. Second, I wanted to give her privacy and not bug her texting every day or two. Third, I kind of pretended that I have a very busy schedule so I don't really get the time to text instead I send her voice messages most of the time. And this has now become a HUGE problem for me personally, where I check her WhatsApp status to see what was her last seen every hour. And also checked her IG      following list, to see if any new guys are on the radar. As if that‚Äôs gonna help me at all. Yes, I am worried and the obsession of not knowing what she's doing or where she's at. Really stupid of me. I told her that I'm sorry I don't text/call during the week and she said she knows how busy I      am and said it herself that she understands my job is hectic.
3. She has 2 Instagram accounts. One private, one public.      I followed both, she blocked me on the private but followed me back from the public profile. She told me the private one is only for her girlfriends. (Don‚Äôt      ask how) Later also found that she restricted me from viewing her IG      stories. Weird.
4. I am always the one initiating the events, and sending the first text. At the time of writing this, we have not texted each other for a week, and I'm debating whether I should text first, again.

**What are your thoughts? In your opinion, things that have been bad / I need to improve on? Things that have been good? Your thoughts on the problems I listed? Do you think her answer would be Yes when I ask her to go on a date with me?**

***This is what I'm going to say next time after the show when we are parked in her car:***

Jane, I met a girl couple of months ago. And I have had a crush on this girl for some time. But this time around I did not want to rush like I always would, and I did things differently. This time around it was inviting her to be a part of my world, not asking for a place in hers, especially when I realized how important she has become to me. Today I live a much simpler life, matured a lot, I now have a reputation that I need to maintain. Today my signature holds power. 

Jane, my parents taught me that you settle down where you find peace. Not beauty, not money, not status, but peace. And this girl I‚Äôm talking about is you. I found my peace. 

Jane, I know that there are some differences between us. From your point of view, I‚Äôm not Jewish, and I can't speak Russian. From my point of view, I‚Äôm not very demanding nor are my parents. But I am willing to do whatever it takes, whether it is to convert or learn Russian or come with you to the synagogue, whatever it takes. 

And here‚Äôs the why? Why you? What I find so attractive about you, is you have this amazing, exciting, full life and I get this feeling your life is good with or without me in it. When I met you, you were nothing that I expected, but everything I wanted rather than everything I needed. Because even though there are those differences, we are like two sides of the same coin. 

We both put family first, we do what we promise, we are financially strong, we are both passionate about what we do, we have a plan and we know how to get there, we are not the loudest in the room, nor do we need to be the center of attention, we both don't smoke and we both only know how to play blackjack. Our past experiences, we think so much alike, the way we look at the world, our likes, dislikes, our tragedies our successes. Our birthdays are 2 days apart, our moms‚Äô birthdays are 2 days apart. 

When I really think about it it‚Äôs really scary in a good way of how much we are compatible. And I‚Äôve taken my time to really think about this. The 4 things that matter to you the most, are loyalty &amp; trust, I know it's hard to do that but I say try me, give me a chance, no lies, I‚Äôm a bad liar and you know that already, I can bluff around other people but with you, I just can't, respecting your mom, I don‚Äôt see a reason why not to, and having faith in god. I started not believing in God when all that shit happened to me and my family 5 years ago, quite selfishly, but ever since I met you I have realized that I was wrong and there is no shame in being wrong. God forgives. I guess I just needed someone like you to come into my life and help me realize that. 

Jane, I say all this today, because it‚Äôs been 5 months since we first met and I think we have made some really good memories, given ourselves personal space and privacy, respected each other time, and I honestly don‚Äôt want you to be the who got away.

But in recent years, there has been a big push to completely stop cat calling. I‚Äôm talking no compliments to the opposite gender type shid. Remember that horrid gillette ad that shamed guys for approaching?

Where I‚Äôm confused is, a lot of girls don‚Äôt mind being cat called, and some do - almost all don‚Äôt like aggressive cat calls though which I can understand. 

The classic, if the guy is cute I‚Äôll appreciate it more trope is still a thing. But I‚Äôm also told looks don‚Äôt matter for girls who appreciate a good catcall anyway. 

Is this movement more just a general push to stop the subsect of vulgar men that make women feel threatened in public? 

Idk, where do you personally draw the line? How do you feel about cat calling?

They said something I didn't like, I said something in return, but apologized a week later after we stopped talking, but the damage was already done. 
I tried to find someone else like them on here, but my search hasn't been fruitful and I feel discouraged. 

I know it's better to meet people in person, organically, but I don't even have any friends in person. I'm not that sociable and the only club I'm interested in at my college meets too late for me. There is a chapter for my major that I could join and possibly meet people and get intern opportunities there, but I'm not sure if I should join. I want to meet new people still, but at the same time, I don't feel like having to go through the ""getting to know you"" stage again with anyone else, anytime soon; especially if I'm not sure how long it will even last. I don't really feel like trying anymore, especially if it might not even last long or things end over something insignificant. Not too long ago, I didn't feel this way, but after the ordeal with the last person, I just feel tired. I know I'm young and will probably be reminded that, but I just wanted if this feeling is normal and a sign that I need to take a break.

90,saj0jd,1642905351,Flattering photos or less flattering photos?,"Hey y'all,

I feel like this is something I go back and forth on a lot. I tend not to put my ""most flattering"" photos up on dating sites. I put up photos that are nice, certainly flattering, but still more like how I'd think I look so that the person doesn't get disappointed when they meet me. Something I've mostly heard is I look the same or better in real life and I like that. They can instantly recognize me in person. Also, at least one of my photos is low/barely any makeup. I don't wear heavy makeup in most (if not all) of my photos. I think in my close-up shots, I'm not even wearing eyeliner.

I've *been* on those dates where the guy looked older than his photos, or just not the same... and I'm not saying I've never thought, ""well he's still attractive, let's just see"", but it's obviously a bit strange when the person looks very different in person. I didn't even recognize one guy in real life, I walked right by him (awkward).

Now I just have to point something out: I know women who are attractive, pretty women, but on instagram, they post photos that *are not* accurate reflections of how they look in real life, at least most of the time. I feel like most of my dating profile photos are more ""cute"" and ""active"" or ""outdoorsy"" or ""girl next door"" because I like to undersell (lol). But some of these women, they look straight up sexy in photos, when I know they can look that way but they generally look a little less done up. I have photos of myself looking all model-y or very done up, but I try not to lead with those. I feel like it's better to post somewhat normal photos that show off my lifestyle more, but then I wonder.. am I shooting myself in the foot if a lot of other women are actually posting their absolute best shots, thus making me look worse than I do in real life? Because in real life, I do attract the attractive men. 

It's a bit shallow but I feel like online dating *is* shallow... so I just wanna know, especially from the men on here - what would you rather see? Are you more likely to swipe right if a woman looks *sexy* in her photos, or do you actually prefer more normal shots and prefer to be pleasantly surprised in real life?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/saj0jd/flattering_photos_or_less_flattering_photos/

93,sajeps,1642906628,Telling a girl how I feel knowing there is a chance it might not go how I hope,"I (28M) have been talking to a girl (23F) for a couple months now. 

We've been texting every day since late November. We work together and go to the same school so we see each other pretty often. I asked her if she wanted to hang out with me on Tuesday after her class and she said yes so we are planning to spend the rest of the day together. 

At the end of the night, I plan on telling her that I really like her and hope to take her out some time. 

Seems pretty basic but I'm getting nervous about the possibility that she shoots down any of my advances. When we first started talking she told me she doesn't seek out relationships and is content being single because of being fucked over in the past. But on the flip side she also told me that she hasn't met anyone who understands her like I do, and that she has built up trust with me faster than anyone she's met before. 

A mutual friend of ours told me today that she said she really likes me and has enjoyed every minute of talking to me and getting to know me. But she also told this mutual friend that she isn't sure about a relationship with me yet. Note that she said ""not sure yet"" and not ""no""  

So knowing this, is it still a good idea to just come out and say that I have feelings for her even if she might not be ready for a relationship? I would rather just get it out in the open so I'm not stuck giving her endless signals and affirmations because at some point that's either going to get stale or look like love bombing.

94,sajg79,1642906762,"Is this woman joking, or does she actually want to sleep w/ me/date me?"," 

This obese, Mexican lady, in her 50s some times tries to hit on me at work. She often times complements me and tells me that I look nice . She touched me twice. One time she told me ""you're invited to the party"" and touched my arm while giggling. Another time, she she said ""glad you made it"" and touched my leg. One time she made a joke about my pants fitting me nicely. Another time she made a joke about me getting married. She touches her hair often when interacting with me and has that ""flirty"" way of talking with me. (kind of like how girls in their teens and 20s talk to guys they like)  


Her husband recently died. I am 26, not overweight or obese, and she in her 50s and obese.  


It kind of makes me wonder tho. does she actually think that I will sleeo and date her or is she just joking(like a grandma calling her grandson handsome, or a teacher complementing a young student? )  


Maybe she's on too many online dating apps where she gets 100+ matches a day and watches too much fantasy porn , and does not understand the difference between that and real life. She could also be messing with omegle and other sex apps where females get a trillion billion times advantage over men.

98,sajmgb,1642907302,"I want to progress stages, but don't want to scare her off, nor take too long. When's the right time to tell her how I really feel?","I (M22) was dumped out of a 6 year relationship last year, therefore obviously my only, longest and most serious relationship since the age of 16.

I started casually dating a few girls starting winter 2021. But come November I started seeing someone I've become quite fond of. We've had numerous dates and slept together. All the signs &amp; signals have been positive, and she seems keen and interested. I've been cautious not to rush back into anything, but I guess sometimes you just can't help what the universe throws at you. 

But I've come to a roadblock in this 'purgatory' stage of talking/seeing each other. She's the first person where ideally I'd like to become exclusive with her, but maybe not become totally official or put any labels on anything quite yet. Just a mutually respected agreement of exclusivity. I wouldn't be put off if it turned out she wanted to get serious long term. 

So when's the right time to somehow ask? I don't want to rush and potentially scare her away too soon, but also don't want to take too long and make her think I'm taking her for a ride. Is there even a right time?

99,sajq2s,1642907626,"First relationship, scared of screwing it up","So i (21) finally did it, i have a girlfriend (18y). But im also a bit scared that i might be liying to myself about my feelings. We met the 4th of january, we got into a relationship the 10th. So we skipped the whole dating period, and we've been together the entire time since.

Reason is bcs we met in a psychiatric hospital, she was in for suicidal thoughts and i was in for panic attacks. I was already in there for a couple of days before she came in. She pretty much never left my side, fell asleep in the chair next to me (not allowed to sit close) wearing my sweater and jackets, which i found incredibly cute. A friend new she had feelings for me (she didnt know that i knew) and told me, the next two days i kinda teased her a bit. Bcs 1: i needed time to grasp the fact that a girl wanted me (never had that happen before) so it was kind of a strange feeling to me 2: i like teasing people in general and 3: a hospital isnt the most romantic place in the world. So ever since the 4th we were pretty much the entire time together, we are home now and we are basicly living together.

But now the struggle issue in my head. Bcs we were/are together all the time ever since we met, i havent had time to process what i feel exactly, and i fear that i went into a relationship with her because it was the easiest way to have someone by my side at all times and not be so lonley anymore. I havent had that tension with her (getting a good morning text or waiting till she finally responds,...). Dont get me wrong she is super cute and sweet and will do anything for me and i for her, i love spending time with her. She's super understanding, she is more experienced than me, i was a complete virgin (never even hugged a girl my age), and she agreed to follow my tempo. Turns out my tempo wasnt that slow. The first hug lead very quickly to the first kiss that lead to the first time frenching and so on. It all moved so fast bcs i feel really comfortabel with her, i never felt weird arround her, like ive been with her for years. But since this is my first relationship im still trying to figure out if this is a good feeling, like in love feeling or if its a fwb feeling, schouldnt the first time everything feel embarrasing? Or a tad bit unnatural? The first kiss felt like i was doing it for years. 

I cant really think about not having her here with me without getting a bit blue. But is it like wanting a friend arround or being in love? Im probably overthinking this way to hard but i dont want to lead her on if i dont feel the way she does. I have ADD and possible Autisme, so i never truly am in touch with my feelings, which can be anoying in analysing what i actually feel. 

One last thing, she thought she was pregnant, so we went to a GP to do a bloodtest. When she first mentioned it i got scared and stressed a ton, but two days past (waiting on the result), and i loosend up to the idea and wasnt opposed to raising a child with her. But the news came and the result was negatif, i felt relieved but sad at the same time. Which made me realize that if i ever have kids i would love to have them with her. But the question again: is it bcs i love her or bcs she is available.

One thing she loves to do is try and (french)kiss me in public spaces, lay her leg on mine (busses and stuff), touch my private area (to annoy me). I am a pretty shy person and also this is all very new to me, with holding hands and kisses i feel fine, but kissing for long periods of time or being to close as if we are at home make me feel a bit unneasy. So again is it bcs i might be lying to myself about my feelings that i dont want to be too touchy, isnt that what people that are in love do? I see other couples do it all the time, but i just dont want to, and i dont have a reffrence point to compare my feelings with, would this be me in all relationships or just not with her? Or will this change once im more used to it? 

I know im overthinking this, and that i should let it happen naturally, and just let my feelings do their thing. But im stressing about it all, i dont want to hurt her or lose her. So if anyone has a simular story or any advice or tips or questions please share them.

Have a great day everyone!
