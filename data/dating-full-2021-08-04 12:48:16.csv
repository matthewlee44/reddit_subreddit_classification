TL:DR: The 100th has me smiling wide and was worth all the bullshit.

**Dating sucks**. Dating these days *really* sucks. It's tiring, demeaning, distracting, and almost holistically unsuccessful for people like me (who care). However...

It's a numbers game, and one you *shouldn't* pay attention to, as best you can. When I got thrown out of my 5-year relationship almost a year ago, I had to completely rebuild myself from the ground up. I really didn't know where to start, so naturally I downloaded Hinge. Prob sent 100 likes before anyone I thought was attractive came through my inbox. The next 7 months proceeded to be a whirlwind of emotions, unsuccessful dates, unreciprocated feelings from matches and organic connections alike, and the emotional death of a hopeless romantic. 

I quit dating cold turkey for a couple of months in late spring. No apps, no effort, and thus, no time spent dwelling girls that didn't text me back. Guess what happened: My days brightened, my self-confidence soared to levels unseen, and I actually started to ***enjoy*** myself and my life. Then BOOM. Slowly I started finding myself circling the wagon on matches and crushes yet again.

At this point (late may), I felt I'd already been rejected into the ground, and that I had nothing to lose. I started being unabashedly myself, even in the earliest conversations with someone new. I learned to guard myself, keep sensitive information close to my chest (even though I feel the constant urge to tell everyone everything), and give NOBODY the benefit of the doubt. I learned to just exist.

From May until now, I've gone on more unsuccessful dates! I finally told a close girlfriend I was drawn to her the day before she went to the lake and got a BF LOL. But I wasn't that upset, I didn't dwell, and we remain best friends to date. Possibly even closer than we were before. I just kept going. 

Then came \[redacted female name\] and WOW. What a woman. And wait... You mean to tell me... She likes me? A lot? I can be myself around her and make her smile? She calls ME to hang out? We tear each other apart in bed and she wants to hear ALL OF MY MUSIC? Hahahaha what the fuck.

She was worth the wait and persistence. The point is not to go on 99 dates so you can get to the successful 100th. The point is to love yourself first, take eggs out of the dating basket, guard your feelings, and just. keep. pushing. **It's a numbers game anyway.** It's easy to feel hopeless, unattractive, unwanted, and bound for a life alone. **In my humble opinion, the single greatest strategy is to learn to love yourself first, present yourself as exactly who you are, find a way to not stare at your phone all day, and play a little hard to get (even if it feels unnatural).**

It started when I met this girl at the office I work at, and I started to feel an attraction.  Well I’m almost 23 now and I’ve never dated so naturally I was nervous, but I made a good impression and she was interested.  We went on a date which was really awesome for me and boosted my confidence, and afterwards we talked about continuing.  Unfortunately life happened to both of us so it’s been hard to see each other.  She’s been really busy with life and I started to feel nervous she wasn’t interested in seeing me rather than it just being a time problem.  Eventually my anxieties build up and I have to ask her if she still wants to see me, so she tells me it’s really not a good time and that her life needs to calm down.  Of course I respect this and have done my best to not ask for her time right now, but it’s gotten hard for me.  I still see her at work so now I feel so anxious around her, despite not feeling it so much when we went on a date a month ago. I’m not sure what’s gotten into me, but it’s completely ruining my confidence with her and the thought of her has taken over a lot of my time.  I feel like I can’t control my anxious thinking about her, probably because I’ve never experienced this with a girl before and I’ve already become attached.

It was extremely uncomfortable and I honestly just wanted to escape. I'm super inexperienced with dating and because of Coronavirus, it's been an eternity since I've even talked to a girl outside of occasional in-school discussions.

She looks a lot cooler than me and is a year older (I'm young so it makes more difference than if I were older), which I know doesn't really matter except for her experiences, but I think that might play a part in my anxiety. 

I feel a little dumb for asking this, because we haven't even got to know each other, but should I just give it up? I feel like I already messed up by taking almost an hour each time to reply (b/c of overthinking, nervousness) and that she probably wouldn't be into me once she got to know me.

Hell, even when I'm _thinking_ about sexual situations with her, I feel more stressed (""will it happen again? What's the problem with me? Why doesn't it work like it always did?"") than turned on.

Is it normal after such a long abstinence? I'm healthy, don't take any meds, I excercise a lot, don't masturbate since I met her. Before that I did not masturbate excessively either - and I certainly _never_ had a problem with getting it up on command before meeting her.

I'm trying to rationalize this by observing that for 29 years I haven't even touched a woman and now after a couple dates there's suddenly nudity, intimacy and sex involved all at once so the slope got really steep really quick so it makes sense that performance anxiety may kick in but dunno if I'm thinking correctly? Consciously I feel completely safe around her but at the same time I _do_ feel stressed that I want to have it happen and I certainly _am_ in my head way more than I should be when things are getting steamy. I've tried focusing outwards (to how hot the situation is, how much she turns me on etc.), I've tried relaxing with a couple drinks beforehand with her but to no avail. I barely managed to get it up for oral sex twice but even that was by some miraculous accident after a couple of tries.

Any tips? Personal accounts? Thoughts? Thanks a lot in advance.

(also: I'd rather stay from the pill for now. I know that many people praise it, I know it's safe but if it's still possible that it's anxiety-induced then I don't really see a benefit of having sex with a pill only to take an even harder hit to my ego and then obsess all over again when I try it _without_ the pill. If nothing helps, I'll try it but for now I'll pass.)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,936859,public,self,"Is it normal to have problems getting it up for sex after being a virgin for a long, long time?

This is kind of a different vent, I did not breakup recently, but I wanted to see if I am the only one here that seems to have permanent trust issues? I can never seem to trust girls, due to my past. And I am really not sure if I ever want to start trusting anyone ever again, if we are being honest.

I will turn only 25 in a few days, I know I am still a kid compared to most people here, and what could I possibly understand about life and love yet? But I’ve dated a lot of girls in my life, I mean like really a lot. And I've been cheated on by at least 3 girls in my life (the one’s that I found out by myself, due to my investigation skills). There was also more than one situation that after a breakup, an ex would soon hook up with the guy “she told me not to worry about” or go back to their ex. Which also looks very shady, so I don’t rule those out (even though the girls seemed very trustworthy). Or just in general, after a breakup I would find out that the girls lied to me, like a lot. And I never truly knew the person.

I have also witnessed/seen a lot of cheating stories in my multiple friend's circles, heck, even in my family circle. I got so good at spotting red flags, that nowadays if I even see one red flag in the beginning of our conversations, I immediately bail, because I know something will go wrong with this person in the future.

I am currently happy being single, but not sure what I will do in the future or how will I ever overpass this. And tbh I am not even sure if I want to get past this. My ""spidey senses"" and trust issues always saved me from wasting time with cheaters. :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,936864,public,self,Anyone else has permanent trust issues due to cheating ex'es?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxvaev/anyone_else_has_permanent_trust_issues_due_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I don't care if they are hot and 'successful', most of them are cruel-spirited, racist, and conservative af (despite how progressive they say they are on their profile).

I dated two women this year who roped me in with this nice person act, only later to reveal how nasty they were on the inside once we were exclusive. They started saying racist shit about my friends, and also instructing/demanding that I 'improve myself' for them. It was disgusting, and they were shocked went I walked away from them. 

I don't know what it is but I basically never ever get any dates with anyone who shares my progressive values or my interest in a modest and healthy lifestyle. Everyone who goes out me always ends up being this greedy, negative, egotistical jerks who thinks other people should worship them because they have an MBA or a degree in accounting. They tip poorly and they complain constantly, even on first dates. It's nuts. 

IRL anytime I meet someone who share my values, she's someone's gf/wife. We still become friends but it's just like sometimes feels like I'm being punished or something.

I can't say it was very passionate what we had but I felt good spending time together, we seemed to vibe and when we talked about values she said that basically all she wants is for someone to be considerate and I liked that.

We had a bit of quiet week and something felt awkward, call it intuition. I opened my tinder and noticed we were no longer a match and was like well ok I guess, we never talked exclusive and she is more than free to use tinder without having to report to me. I swipe left literally twice and boom she pops up with a new profile full of pics that I made of her on our dates and trip (im not the worst photographer). To make things worse one of them had my actual name in it which just felt too weird not to say anything so I did, I explained to her as well that I don't see how this fits with considerate behavior and how it surprised me she did that. She did immediately apologize and said she'd remove them so I said thanks. 

She then texted if we couldn't maybe talk about it irl life maybe (I didn't immediately respond as I was working so she also sent me apologize flowers which I found a bit much seeing as she was never very high on effort , it was mostly me initiating convo and suggesting dates). Anyways I told her that I'd definitely hear her out if it would make her feel better but admitted that I personally didn't really know what there was to be said about this whole picture incident. She asked me if I then never wanted to see her again? I said that wasn't the case, that I would be ok seeing her and told her that even though we were missing this passion that you might expect between romantically involved people I never assumed there'd be a reason why we couldn't be friends or why I'd have to ban her from my life. So she came over and said that she was stupid and didn't think when she posted those pics. She didn't go further on with a proper talk though so it just turned into chit chat untill I said it was getting late and I'd have to go to sleep. She then asked for a hug which I gave her and we said bye.

I purposely tried to let her lead the convo even though it was awkward and led to us saying almost nothing when we said bye, she said ""text you"" and I said ""see you"". I woke up the next day feeling bad, was I harsh? Should I check on her? I know we didn't talk about where to go from here/ how to maybe stay friends/ when to meet again. When is it best to just leave it like it is vs. put in any further effort to keep someone in your life? Bottom line is I don't want her to feel super bad about what she did because it wasn't a huge thing in the end but it was enough to make me feel a bit questionable about her.

I (F23) dated this guy (M25) throughout July, knowing fully well that he would move far away soon and that it was a temporary thing. I thought I was fine with that, but as we got to know each other more and more (we went on 7 dates total, and spent 6-7 hours per date) I became very attached to him. It was the first time I had ever felt so excited, yet comfortable being with someone. I think I fell for him.

The problem is he is on the other side of the country right now, and we agreed to avoid long-distance relationships. He wants to keep being friends, but as I mentioned, my feelings have gotten pretty strong. I don't know what to do. I think he's just not that into me, what do yall think? Should I just try to forget abt him and cut off communication? Or should I quietly suffer by pretending to be friends?

I’m not saying anyone should settle, but maybe it’s just more realistic to date within your means ? For example: if you’re “not rich” in the looks department but “rich” in the personality department; it’s going to be very difficult to find someone rich in both departments that will want to date you when they can date within their own means . And vice versa, if you’re “not rich” in the looks department but “rich” in personality then you’re not going to want to date someone not rich in either categories . 

I remember a theory from Psychology class called the Matching Hypothesis . Basically it argues that couples who are equally socially desirable are more likely to form a successful committed relationship .

One thing I’ve found very interesting is from the show Married at First Sight . The premise of the show is that couples get matched up and meet each other at their wedding for the first time, so there’s a lot of drama with people not being attracted to their new spouses . When a woman at first isn’t attracted to her husband, she can grow attraction over time if the guy is patient, confident, and just an overall good person . The attraction doesn’t come if the guy is aggressive and not very nice (obviously) . But what really throws me off is the fact that the men who aren’t attracted to their wife NEVER recover . In fact, pretty much all of the cases show the guys shut down really early on and basically fake trying to form a connection (they only stay because of the show I’m sure) .

So maybe try dating on your level, you never know, maybe someone will surprise you .

I think this girl and I are done And I'm feeling a bit lost. We didn't exclusively date but talked since the end of March/early April and went on 3 dates. It should've been 6 but she got covid, my mom had a heart attack, and I cut my leg open. So there were a couple cancelled ones. 

She's 20 and I'm 23 so she's a bit younger. We never talked about what we were wanting. She was giving me A LOT of attention. FaceTiming, texting me, texting me in the morning when she knew I was stressed/worried about my mom (mom had a heart attack), commented heart faces on my Instagram pictures, etc. 

It was a lot of attention I was getting from her and I started to like her once I got accustomed to this. After a date we had about a month ago I finally mentioned where we stood since we hadn't talked about it. 

We agreed we didn't want anything serious and she told me she wanted to keep seeing me. I ended it with ""what I think we're doing is great &amp; id like to continue if you do"" and she said ""yes I would love that too"".

Why would she give me so much attention if she didn't want anything serious?

She was still responsive and we even had a date planned last week but she fainted a few days before and had to go to a cardiologist. This actually happened for I saw posts about it. 

Last night I just got to a point where I was done being in limbo. Her change in communication patterns had been sticking out and I mentioned it to her last night. Just casually asked why communication had been 1 sided and she told me she doesn't like the feeling of always having to reply to someone. She said she wants to talk every now and then. I'm sure that's not true at all. 

She also said she ""just wants some space from this relationship for a little"". Red flag and probs she's gone. She is traveling and had some recent health problems so she does have a lot going on but people will make time if they're interested. 

I thanked her for being honest. I did tell her that if she didn't want to talk anymore it was totally cool no harm no foul, and that if she needed space I'll leave her alone. I just wanted to know which of the 2 it was so no energy was wasted on either end. (Genuinely needs space, or not wanting to talk at all).

She got pissed. She told me ""I've literally said it so many times now. I just want space rn. Thank you."" 

I didn't respond. Gonna back off for a while.
My behavior towards her didn't change, she just started backing away starting about a month ago. She would carry some conversations and was responsive and even initially accepted my date plans for last week. 

Is modern dating this hard? I feel like there is no magic formula. People just love instant gratification and will move on to the next in line the second they question something. 

I know she is younger than me so that could be part of the reason. I'm just a little lost. This ""abundance mentality"" is so foreign to me. My therapist told me I have insecure attachment. I've fallen to this pattern with other girls too.

I don't know how to get out of my head. Obviously it's upsetting news. I've had low self esteem for a while now and got cheated on in my last relationship of 2 years.

Coming here to just ask one simple question.

""How do we stop hurting?""

TL:DR about myself. 2 relationships, 1 from 5 years, another 2 months. Got beat up pretty hard by these 2, guilty feelings. Divorced parents (issues with not hurting people arose from me trying to not be like my dad and hurting women) 

I'm in therapy but...

Last month and a half I met this nice girl, we started talking, all was going fine but I had to end it due to my anxiety, to my fears. She was starting to gather some complex feelings and me, I was not having butterflies or rockets in my stomach and out of pure fear of hurting her or letting her down by continuing to date her further, I decided to let her go and put a stop in it.

Maybe I felt more than I thought I did, when I was with her I had peace and tranquility but when she was away I had panic and anxiety, thoughts like ""Omg, she has everything I wish for, why am I not falling for her?"" etc etc. 

Basically guilt and panic took over and I had to end it. We stayed friends, we have not deleted ourselves from insta or whats, we wished each other the best and yes, I truly wish her the best. Now i'm ""feeling heartbroken"" even tough I thought I was not attached. 

I know the world's not going to end, for either of us, altough some nights feels like it will. 

Question is, How do I overcome this fear of hurting people, How do I stop this ""fear"" from masking my true feelings? I can't understand the concept of using people, Maybe I am too serious about dating, maybe I'm not ready for relationship again. Idk.

Even if you don't answer, felt good to vent.

It’s so stupid.  Met on OLD.  I’m divorced and wanted to see what was out there… no intention of finding someone… and if I did it was just FWBs.  

We found each other.  He was in the same place except he wanted more than FWBs.  I was apprehensive.  He would txt every single day all day.  We just clicked.  He was everything I would have want presently and more.  

After two months we met and the chemistry was insane.  And I fell hook, line, and sinker.  We met up a few more times. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship but didn’t want to lose me.  He continued to txt all the time like a relationship.  

I finally had enough.  I wanted to date but definitely not a relationship… just some quality time 1-2times a month.  I have my own obligations and responsibilities.  I brought it up several times about dating.  And he would say “he feels like he is drowning and wishes he met me a few months down the road, that he met me too soon, because I would be someone he would want to be in a relationship with”.  

I think the straw that broke the camels back for me… I was telling him how someone kept hitting on me at my softball game and this guy wasn’t taking the hint.  He offered to come to my next game.  …..🤯 , um what?  I kind of brushed it off thinking he wasn’t serious and also thinking…You can’t make time but you will come to my game (like a boyfriend?).  

Is that not a mixed signal?

After 5 months of this stupid situationship and the constant txting via him initiating… I got fed up.  I told him that I wasn’t asking for much. I was practically in the same place. That he needed to get a child custody arrangement in place or his X would always control him.   And then blocked him thinking I was done.  

It was snarky and childish but I feel like my emotions got played.  

Unblocked him yesterday because I felt bad and I miss him.  

He responded apologizing, “that was the last thing i wanted to do was hurt you.  You are a ball of emotions, not a bad thing, and react too quickly on them.  I like you but maybe a break is a good right now. I don’t want to hold you back.”

He mentioned how I’ve been snappy and making backhanded comments about the situation recently.

I understood and didn’t fight it.  I miss him.  Which is ridiculous because it was 5 months,… mainly txting.  

I’m irritated because I wasn’t quite ready for the relationship and he wasn’t ready for anything, but he allowed me to catch feelings and then wants a break when I defended my feelings.  

I know what a break means.  I know he won’t be back.  But he was the first person I really liked and opened up feelings for.  I’m kind of soul crushed.  

I feel that I wasn’t completely out of line for saying what I said to him.  But I do feel bad.  I felt foolish and stupid for waiting with no signs on his part of moving forward.  My feelings got the best of me… but I’m human, and I wasn’t nasty.  

But was out of line, or not? Am I wrong for misreading signs?  The softball game thing…. How was I suppose to interpret that?

Because of this I said he was being disrespectful and broke things off immediately. In retrospect I feel like I reacted too quickly and allowed some insecurities to build up because I was expecting things from him that I didn’t communicate. 

After talking to my therapist about the situation, she simply suggested that I send him an apology. I sent him an apology saying my expectations were unfair and I didn’t communicate enough and that I really did enjoy getting to know him and hoped that he had an enjoyable trip (he’s going on vacation this weekend which he told me about when we were going out because he wanted to communicate his availability in the future to me). He responded within a few hours saying that it happens to all of us and that he also could’ve handled things better. He said he thought that I was very genuine and fun to be around and that he enjoyed getting to know me. He said that he hoped my weekend after I ended things went well. 10 minutes after that he said he also hoped that a summer class that I finished this past weekend ended well. 

Where do I go from here? I’d like to start seeing him again with less pressure (maybe just get to know him as a friend). I was thinking of just saying thank you and telling him to let me know how his trips goes, as that lets him go on this week long trip and is pretty noncommittal if he doesn’t want to see me again (he can just say yeah and ghost).

I was going to pick a restaurant with outdoor seating and then something light to do as a post restaurant hangout but I have another idea...

With covid and everything, maybe it would be nicer to have a 'homey' date? Something intimate and nice. There's a hotel in the next town over that is really nice and offers rooms that are essentially little apartments. (We've actually used it before for group weekend gatherings).

We would talk everyday &amp; see each other every other weekend. Well then covid hit &amp; my uni kicked me out so I returned to my hometown, which is far from my uni &amp; where he lived. We still kept in touch despite not being able to see each other &amp; grew really close. When I was able to return to my uni in January 2021, we would see each other maybe once a month. He never brought up becoming official so I just assumed this was a friends with benefits sort of thing. 

When I graduated I moved back to my hometown I began hanging out with my friends &amp; coworkers a lot more, most of whom happen to be guys. When he found this out he became jealous &amp; when I asked him about it he said that the next weekend, when we planned to meet up, we should talk. When we met up &amp; I asked him about it, he said that while he liked me &amp; cared for me, he still had a lot he needed to figure out &amp; a lot that he wanted to do while he was still single &amp; able to. We decided to remain friends but drop the benefits part &amp; that possibly in the years down the road we could end up together. I asked him if he would get jealous if I started seeing other guys &amp; he said a little but that he couldn’t really do anything about it because this was the choice he made.

So as time goes on, I’ve had 2 guys show interest in me &amp; I’ve gone on dates with them, although I really don’t see it going anywhere. When he found out about this he started making the jealous comments again. I reminded him that this was the choice he made &amp; he told me that he had a change of heart. I asked him what he meant &amp; he said I would find out soon enough, since we have plans to hang out again to go golfing soon.

I’ve been going back &amp; forth about this. Part of me loves the friendship that we have &amp; that fact that I’ve never felt this way about any other guy before. Part of me also understands how confusing your 20s can be when you’re trying to figure out what you want in life because I feel the same way sometimes. But part of me gets upset though that he only seems to want me out of jealousy. Like he didn’t show much interest in a relationship until other guys came into the picture. What do you all think about this? Have any of you been in a similar boat? Thanks!

I’m on Tinder with no intensios of a relationship atm. Been talking to a guy who had the same intensions and our convos have been rather… you know. Sexual. 


I was wondering if he was real, because he doesn’t have any info on his profile regarding his work or IG (totally fine!) but also no verification and only three pics from the same setting (same clothes, clearly taken on the same day). Wasn’t thinking about it that hard becuse he did seem like he was acting his age, but I just didn’t know anything about him. He kept messaging me from early mornings till late at night. Did he even work?! Who knows. 


So, I decided to JOKINGLY say that I’ve been wondering if he’s a bot (plus other small talk). Our convo before this was jokes thrown out here and there so no biggie. He answered, and the answer was clearly a joke as well, because he commented that a bot couldn’t keep up with the convos that we’ve had. Then I, again, JOKINGLY, stated that maybe you are ”John, aged 65”. And lord behold, he deleted me lol. 


So! Would you delete someone because of this if:
1. You were actually John, aged 65 (or other scammer)
2. Got frustrated and really didn’t find it funny

Disclaimer 2: Yes I've tried dating apps, I suck ass on that one. Any tips on how to build a good profile would help. Conversation starters advice would definitely help.

I'm a 26 yo, international student turned professional in the greater seattle area, used to live in the bay area before. I'm relatively new to the US. Not in bad shape, kinda short, funny and easy to talk to. I'm respectful of people's moods and needs, sometimes way too much to the point that I don't deliberately speak to them in case I think it's bothering them.

I have a vestibular condition that bothers me time to time when I'm outdoors (like hitting clubs, etc.) so lately I tend to avoid it. Also the delta variant rearing it's ugly ass head doesn't help with the socializing. I'm into casual gaming, metal music, mythology, historical fiction, photography and drums.

First of all, this is anecdotal and it is meant for average (or below) looking men who are looking to get more matches on tinder(or similar services) - a ""small"" story with the tip lol. Remember: It does not matter how good your personality is, if the girl will never match you.

About a year ago, I was bored and tried out tinder. I was not very successful, as I am a pretty average (maybe even slightly below) man. I live in Copenhagen which is quite small compared to cities in US, and I only matched with women ages 20-30. After trying and talking to friends of mine about it, I decided to test out how I could increase my matches. I tried lots of different things, and I think I remade my account about 30 times in a span of a month - once per day to test the likes I received. I tried taking pics of myself, I got pictures taken by friends and I had pics taken by friends with friends in the photo.

I received on average 5-20 likes a day - the most was if the picture was with friends in it (maybe they just wanted my friends number lol). But I felt that this was low, so I asked my female friends about tinder. One of them showed me how she used the app, and she would spend less than a second before swiping left. If she was a bit attracted in the guy,  I noticed that she would stop for a brief moment, scrolling through his pics and swipe right (pretty much regardless of other pictures). So, this told me that I needed to make girls spend more than 3 seconds looking at me. Apparently this was easier said than done, because she showed me some of her matches and my god were they good looking. A fun trivia though: She actually only chatted with like 1 dude regularly out of maybe 200 matches.

So, I thought how the hell can I, average/below average looking, ever compete with these dudes!? I have always been quite an odd person, but always been a bit scared of standing out. Because ""what if people think I am gay, weird, trans, nasty etc.?"" Anyway, I defied these thoughts and chose to do something very controversial. I bought a pair of high heeled boots (And they look fucking majestic!). This to me was eye catching and out of the ordinary, men in high heels especially straight men in high heels.

I took a picture of it in front of the mirror - And I will admit they look bomb on me and gave me a bit of confidence somehow. I then made a new tinder account and nervously put the picture as my profile pic - with a normal face picture of me as my second . And what do you know? In less than a second, I had a like. Within 10 minutes I had 5 likes. This kept going on for 3 days till I had around 80 likes. I then began liking back and after a week I had around 150 matches. I had my singe phrase I sent to all matches to see their reaction which was: ""Do you like my shoes? \*Dying from laughter smiley\*"".

A good chunk of the women did not respond (usually some crazy hot ones, some I think were scams but most were legit).Then a small group of them just replied with a no-convo answer like: ""Yes :) (worst smiley ever, btw)""But out of the 150 women, I would estimate like 80 of them engaged in a two way dialogue. Most of them was like ""HELL YEAH, where did you get them?"" and ""You look fucking hot, I hope you like women (lol, why else would I match you)""

Anyway, I saw a site of women that took me ages to get to, in mere seconds. Just because of my fucking heels. I went on a couple of dates, met some of them at clubs with mine and their friends. And then I met a special one, one who I fell very very hard for and who eventually became my girlfriend - sadly we are no longer together. We had an amazing time together, but she had to move back to the US where is from and it sadly ended. But I asked her: Why did you like me on tinder? And she replied: The boots, of course. I asked her if she would have liked me if I did not have them on to which she said no, but the boots made me look like a fun time.

And there you go fellas. With just one, odd, purchase I managed to have an amazing and fun time, and also meeting a girl who ended up meaning a lot to me. Had I not posted that pic, I would never have had that many matches and the girls would never realize who I was. It does not matter how much youtube, self-help books, reddit etc. you read/watch regarding online dating if you cannot even get a match. Do you have to be as ""extreme"" as I did, no. But you have to stand out, and if your looks does not do that in a positive way, you got to think outside of the box.

Just to give you an example(because I know I’m not explaining it well):

I’m at work and take a few hours to message someone back. When I finally do, they reply with a big monologue about how they were worried something happened to me, and they were sick with worry all day. Wtf. Is that normal?

I wanted to try to put myself out there more, see what cool people are out there, have fun and try to find a relationship. It feels like I’m on a job interview with a bunch of people. They take it super seriously and act like we’re in a ltr before we’ve even met or exchanged numbers. 

I’ve had someone I’ve never met get mad that I was still on the app and not exclusive with them.

I’ve had people send “poor me” messages about how they must be doing something wrong. This is after I explain I can’t be on my phone at work, or am traveling and will take awhile to respond.

I’ve had people aggressively demand things from me. 

I’ve had people blab on their life stories and traumas.

And what’s with all the love bombing?

Guys never texted me back when I wanted a relationship. Now that I only want sex, they….still don’t text me. 

He also said I was “harping”. I told him ONCE, early on, that I’m not looking for anything serious. Is that harping? We met on tinder… 

Funny thing is, this other guy I dated a while ago told me about this girl he’d hooked up with, before me, how she *enchanted* him and was *so fascinating* to him because she told him straight up that she wasn’t looking for a relationship. He found that SO sexy and intriguing. (And he definitely reached out to her a bunch of times during their fling.)

But when I do it, guys never reach out to me, as you can see here. 

Why does this behavior somehow “enchant” and “fascinate” men when other girls do it (get them hooked basically) but when I do it, they just *let me reach out first* all the time???

Whenever my friends talk about dates that didn't work out or relationships that didn't work out, they would throw around the word ""toxic.""  While some relationships/situationships definitely are, some aren't and they leave it because they don't know how to deal with conflict. 

We are so concerned about self and whether or not things ""serve us"" and if they feel good every single moment, that we will lose good relationships because we don't know how to address conflict.

I know I definitely used to be that person who would AVOID conflict because I thought that if I addressed it, the relationship would end and there was no coming back. This was because I never had to deal with conflict growing up in my family and my family would avoid hard topics, so that's what I learned to do.
