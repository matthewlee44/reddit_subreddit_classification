COVID has been tough because im not in a relationship and havent been in one for a long time. im a 21 year old man and im getting frustrated with being lonely, i want to date a girl or at least take my chances with girls im interested in, life is too short to not take risks and COVID has taught me that. i had a crush on this girl a couple of years ago when we both worked at sleep away camp but never put myself out there to talk to her and express my feelings. what should i do to get her attention and ask her out on a date? i have her facebook and i think snapchat but thats it. would it be weird to start messaging her out of nowhere on facebook? how should i reach out to her? i just want to know how to do this without seeming weird, desperate or anything like that. i like to believe that i actually have a chance but its hard to say. whats your advice on asking someone out in this situation? keep in mind that we dont live in the same city but we arent far apart from each other.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/now2qk/asking_a_girl_out/

5,nox9vl,1622444779,How to Deal with Being Rejected？,"Learning to handle rejection is all part and parcel of becoming a more confident individual. Having this attribute will go a long way in increasing your success rates with women and moving on from rough breakups. These 7 tips will guarantee that you’ll bounce back from rejection.no matter how much your self-esteem is damaged or the extent of your heartbreaks.

\#1 Allocate a period for grieving  
This is better known as an immediate remedy. Set a maximum timeframe for you to wallow in your state of despond, but have the discipline to ensure that you won’t think about it once the deadline comes.

\#2 Keep yourself surrounded with friends  
Humans are social creatures, and being immersed into social settings will allow youto keep your mind off things. The less you think about it, the higher your chances are of picking yourself up.

\#3 Accept the fact that you got rejected  
Once all’s been said and done, the fact of the matter is that you were rejected. There’s no better way to phrase it, and there’s no point telling it any other way. Don’t spend your days wondering what could have been or what you did wrong, and just accept it for what it is.

\#4 Don’t take it personally  
This is probably the hardest tip to follow, but it’ll come in time. Don’t blame yourself for what happened, because what’s not meant to be won’t be. Instead, take it as an opportunity for you to grow stronger.

\#5 Find a new hobby  
You’re going to spend a lot of time lying in bed with your mind clawing relentless at you about the rejection. You need to occupy yourself at home when you’re all by yourself. Getting a new video game works, or even learning an instrument.

\#6 Let nature take its course  
Once enough time has passed, you’ll come to realize that certain things just aren’t within your control. Admit that in certain situations, you have to let nature take its course and you can’t force someone to accept you.

\#7 Keep your chin up and move forward  
This is the part where you can finally let go of your internal suffering. Keep your head high and stride forward with nothing but pride, because you finally got over your rejection and it’s time for you to move on. You’ve learned valuable lessons that have made you become a better person, and you can now move on and focus your energy on tackling something or someone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nox9vl/how_to_deal_with_being_rejected/

One thing led to another and we hooked up. Shortly after she went home and we exchanged a couple texts and after asking if she’d be down for a date (not a hookup) the texting ended. It’s been a couple days unreplied, did I just get haunted by my first ghost? Communication earlier on led me to believe we both acknowledged neither of us are a one night stand type.

The next morning i wake up at 11:50 am and i see no message from him, i call him and he doesnt pick up as usually. So i texted: shouldnt you be at work? He said: no i start at 01:00 pm. So i felt some kind of disgust. He knew this since when he was with me that evening and he still said 11:00 am.

He lied to me so he had a excuse to leave. He could have been honest. Why lie about the most simple things like holy shit?

I confronted him and his response is: “you see this as lying” then continues to disrespect me. He says: i dont feel like speaking to you anymore, bye, goodnight. So i didnt say anything until today, the next morning because i was so pissed. He did text me to send him money (this is normal, we do this all the time) but for the rest nothing.

Basically, I was in a long term relationship. 8 months a go I became single and since then have been going on lots of dates. I've met and slept with a few girls, but I'm struggling to cope with modern dating as it just makes me feel so low.

Here is my most recent situation and example. The girl I am currently seeing I really like and we get on so well, but the other day when she came round she said ""I want to tell you something, I really like spending time with you but I am also sleeping with other guys and wanted to let you know"". Now although I appreciate the honesty, this kind of stuff just seems so off for me and leaves me feeling terrible. I had to call the situation off as I really hated the fact she was sleeping with other people.

And it seems so common for people my age (early 20s) to get into these situations. That is just one example and I am struggling to find someone who wants something more meaningful, maybe I'm just not used to it? Maybe I see sex as a romantic thing and struggling to adjust to this casual free mindset. Maybe I'm just insecure?

21,nozvxm,1622455533,Don't even know where to start,"To give my problem a little more context, as hard as it is for me to do, is to share something from my life. I was bullied for much of my school years, all the way through my high school years. Combined with the fact that I have always been relatively introverted, this has ultimately led to me being very closed off to real life people, in fear that no matter what I share about myself with others will ultimately be used against me. Other problems would be that to this day I have difficulty distinguishing simple jokes from serious insults, which is why I have become more and more of a sarcastic asshole as a ""defense mechanism"". At least this was the state of 2-3 years ago. I have found a larger group of friends who have helped me to become less detached and more social. 

However, I am still too incompetent to know how to meet someone for a more intimate relationship. I don't know where to meet someone, nor how to approach someone when I do. These are probably all things I should have learned in school, but I was too busy building a wall around myself to avoid getting hurt.

In the pandemic, I also ultimately realized how lonely and frankly pathetic my life has been so far.

The only exception to this are the meetings with my friends, which now also only come at longer intervals, as they are studying in different cities.

In truth, I haven't had many people attracted to me, so I by default assume they aren't (not incorrectly imo, it would be weird if more people were interested than not). Additionally, some advice I read was that you should forge authentic connections with people, and let those relationships develop naturally - whether they lead to romance or not is a coin toss.

Just under a year and a half ago, I started talking to the girl I'm now head over heels for. We hit it off instantly and have been talking pretty much every day since we met. However, we only just met up in person this last week. We don't live too far apart, but with Covid and everything going on we decided to not take any chances and wait until things got back to normal. We spoke at length about what we'd both like out of a relationship and when we got onto the topic of ""us"", we agreed it would be best to not give it a label until we met in person.

So we met up a few days ago and it was perfect. She's a beautiful, kind, caring soul and we both said that it was worth the wait to finally meet each other. I'll spare you all the mushy stuff, but we got pretty close while on the date so it's pretty clear that the attraction goes both ways!

Now we've met, all of the worries I had about ""will she still like me when she sees me in person"" have vanished which is awesome! But now I find myself constantly wondering ""when should I ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend?""

Part of me thinks I should let her be the one to bring it up, as I don't want to come across as too clingy or needy. But on the opposite side of the coin, if she wasn't serious about this she surely wouldn't have been talking to me for the last 16 months?

He's in his 30s and has been single his whole life (nothing wrong with that), he's been trying to date, but according to him he's too unlucky in love, and sometimes he blames it on his race (not in the bitter entitled way, I should add).

We got to talking, and few months after, I realized what the problem is. He has no hobby whatsoever (not even gaming), has no passion or topic of interest, and doesn't like reading or even watching the news. He spends his days watching netflix. As a result, he can't hold conversations for shit. You talk about climate change, and dude could only contribute ""oh that's bad..."", talk about nature and animals, and dude doesn't even know what platypus is, talk about shopping, dude hates shopping (said he left it to his mom to do it), talk about tech, dude's not in touch with what mobile phones are out there, talk about travelling, dude never left town and doesn't seem to have any intention to (also completely blanked out when i shared my stories so I stopped), talk about current affairs and news, and you'd be lucky to get any sort of signs that he was interested, even when I asked about what he does at work, it was super vague (I guess he's not used to talking/explaining).

He NEVER made jokes, never said anything remotely witty, and can't understand jokes either... I introduced him to my friend who tried to break the ice by teasing him lightly (nothing mean at all - his phone was acting up when they tried to exchange numbers, so my friend said something along the line haha your phone doesn't consent to this exchange huh), and he apologized (very sincerely too). Uh... 

He tried to pick up guitar because he thought that would get him girls, but gave up when he realized it doesn't. 

He is the most boring person I've ever met.... And everytime we talk, it's up to me to drive the conversation. I have to conduct a bloody interview everytime... I always feel so exhausted and drained afterwards.

In an attempt to help him, I asked him if there's anything he wants to try doing, or even mildly interested in, and got... None... Threw some suggestions (like hiking and stuff), and got rejected because he thinks it's not fun to do those unless with a girlfriend (went nowhere when I tried to persuade him otherwise). Even when hanging out with his group of friends (that he said he couldn't connect with), he's just there, not talking, not participating, just tagging along silently (he said this). He also has very low self esteem and as a result has victim paranoia problems. 

He said I'm his only real friend, which made me feel guilty, because it's not mutual... I asked if he's struggling with mental health, and he said he's ok apart from really wanting a girlfriend, but he always gets ghosted after few conversations (not too surprised...). I tried to help him find something, anything, to be interested in, to live for, a goal, and got nowhere.

Not sure how he can get a girlfriend if he doesn't change... Not sure why I'm posting here either, just a little frustrated with him I guess.

To clarify, it's ok to be this kind of person of you're happy, but he's not, he's super unhappy with with social life (friends &amp; girlfriend department).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/np11sn/you_dont_have_to_be_the_most_interesting_person/

I don’t think the job you have says too much about you ... now .. how about we start asking people DO YOU LOVE what you do? 
Because think about it, if they do they will tell you about their job... (if that’s what u want to know) if they don’t love it you will find out why and you can even learn more about their character. 

Do I make sense?

44,np2a8k,1622464127,Wondering if i should reach out,"Hello everybody this is my first time posting here (also don't mind the username this is not my main account)

So a little backstory, back in april 2020 my fiancé of 4 years dumped me, it was harsh but i went on with my life.
A few months later i met a girl through reddit and everything went pretty well, i explained her my situation and asked her if we could take things slow if we were to start dating, to which she agreed.

So we kinda started dating, it went pretty well up until a second lockdown was instated in my country, my mental health took a nose dive and i realized i hadn't fully healed.
I wasn't in the right place for dating and i broke up with her trying to be as honnest as i could and wishing her well.

After that i went no contact and focused on myself, that was 6 months ago.

Cue to now i'm in a better place mentaly and i've been wondering how she's been doing and thinking about her a lot.
So my question would be if i should reach out ?
Maybe she's better off left alone.

What would be your take on that ?

Tl;dr : Broke up with a girl because i wasn't ready to date and mental health problems, went on to focus on myself.

57,np35fv,1622466894,"Something that I've noticed, dating women.","Firstly: **NOT ALL**. But it's a clear trend. I know that I only have my anecdotal experiences to go by, but what I've experienced and observed seem to prove me right. I'm not saying that guys have it worse or that guys don't do a lot of toxic or bad shit either. We're not some little angels. It's just not something I ever seen talked about, in any serious serious manner.

A lot of them really are bad at respecting a guys boundaries or emotions. 

There's no give and take with a lot of them. It's quite common that they believe that she has the right  to dictate what boundaries the both of us should have. 

Examples:  
What I should be comfortable with sharing with her.  
What kinds of standards I should set for me wanting to be vulnerable to others(it's often centered around where she is).  
What I'm allowed to be uncomfortable with.

If I'm good at communicating is solely based on how her experience on it. If she's too unclear, then I'm bad at listening, if she doesn't understand what I'm saying, then I'm unclear. 

The middle ground is the guy adapting to her and not both of us making an effort, both getting out of our comfort zones. 

I don't know why this is, but I have a theory. We've been taught that women are naturally good at this, so we form our expectations accordingly to this bias. 

I dunno if I'm right about this, but every time I hear these complaints about guys being vague, distant or noncommittal; I do wonder. Is it that, subconsciously, they just don't feel that they can feel comfortable around their partner, that there's some resentment(somewhat justified) lingering there - due to their emotional needs not being respected or denied. When I hear women complain about this, there's a small voice in the back of my head asking ""well, why would he want to trust you? What have you done to prove your trustworthiness?""

Once again, not all women are like this and I don't think that women are doing this out of malice. It's more like they've not been taught this kind of stuff. 

I dunno if I'm the only one that feels like I do about this, but I don't think that I'm crazy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/np35fv/something_that_ive_noticed_dating_women/

I have talked to my German ex, we're still friends, about this, but he lived outside Germany for a long time, and I noticed how different people like him are. I try not to generalize, but it's starting to become difficult. He said that I didn't do anything wrong for sure.

I started dating again a few months ago. This is the third one that just vanished, and we hadn't even been on a date yet XD It's starting to piss me off, and I know I didn't do anything because the last interaction we had was totally fine. I should say I'm pretty confident about my appearance, I'm definitely above average, my intelligence, and I'm definitely the funny one in the relationship.

**The first one** (the most infuriating one), we dated for a few weeks, then he was busy, I guess, and I called him out on not being responsive or attentive in general in my texts. He said that he doesn't want to be annoying with texting me to ask about my health (I was sick for a week at the time), he is starting to catch feelings too quickly (as if it's my fault he gets extra horny when we're in the same room 😒), and he is a little autistic, and he needs time to himself ( should have run when I heard that, I know). So, I told him that I lose interest when I feel ignored, and the dumb reversed psychology doesn't work on me. Anyway, we resolved that one. Every time we hung out, he would tell me how amazing I am and blah blah the stuff that I already know ( I always acted like I was flattered AF though, so no, I never act condescending and full of myself.). So it seemed all great, and I was starting to get a Lil bit of butterfly or more like a  cocoon. I haven't had butterflies since I was 16. The last time we met was when he was heading to his hometown for a week, and he wasn't texting much, and I didn't mind. Again he said he's tired from socializing with other people. Then he says he's rethinking his career and misses living in his hometown. I felt like he might say he doesn't want to see me, but he doesn't say anything. He gets back to the city, and I find this out by checking his location on Tinder (he went from 200km away to less than 1 km). So, I texted him just to close the deal because I don't like dating around or cheating in any way. He has the audacity to say he doesn't have the energy to see me at the moment. I was gonna tell him that he's a terrible person who was planning on just leaving me without any decency to text me, at least that. It's just so selfish. Instead, I wrote back **""K"".** I'm just happy I know my worth not to get emotionally involved with anyone before they prove themselves.

**Number 2** was pretty boring, so I didn't really care, but this is how it went near the end. We were texting some crap, and he brought up Schwarzenegger, and I said omg what a racist name XD, he goes on mansplaining that it's ""Schwarzen egger"" and ""n"" belongs to the first word in that name. I said the damage is done, but he took it seriously and had the audacity to tell me, ""please don't tell me you follow the trend to see r\*cism everywhere"" 🤦‍♀️**Hey A\*\*\*, if you're reading this, drink some water you crusty bech.** I said it's easy not to see it when you don't experience it. He goes on saying a bunch of crap about the same goes for n\*zis. **Dear people, it's not a trend. It's just more out there thanks to the access, so many people have to social media.** I just responded with ""ok"" this time because I had told him about the ""K"" incident. Of course, I didn't hear from him, which was ok. I could never be associated with someone that ignorant. I personally did not experience discrimination until I moved to Germany, and no one should ever invalidate my or other's experience in these issues.

**Number 3** is too short. I only connect based on interests, energy, affection, future goals, and scent because we are all animals, after all. He seemed to want exactly the same things as me. Everything seemed fine, and I only needed to see him in person because that's where I make the final decision to decide if I want to see them any further. The last time we texted, everything seemed just fine. We were gonna meet on the weekend, and I texted him about it if he still wants to meet, but guess what?! I didn't hear from him anymore. He was online on the evening of that day but hasn't been since then.

I'll tell you why,
She had this urge to share everything with her girl best friends and one day in the middle of our conversation, her friends pointed out about my nature and the way I don't socialize with people and rubbed it in my face to make me realize  how I should be thankful to have her and that no-one would ever consider me and there you could see my girlfriend just standing there and kinda seconding that whole opinion.


It was at that moment I realized that she was always just curious about my insecurities and used them to get into my head and the face of concern she put on at that time is really holding me back from talking to anyone else.

74,np6mkc,1622476575,"Guys, how would you feel if a girl you barely know tried contacting you that way ?","Hi, I (19F) met a guy during a course last week and really liked him. We were partnered together for an exercise and I just had the best feeling with him. I'm usually very shy and anxious around new people but it seemed so easy with him, we couldn't stop bantering and laughing. During the break we hung out with other people but still were talking a lot just the two of us. He seemed to enjoy talking to me as well, so it's maybe not only a one-way feeling. Or he's just very friendly. I'd love to get to know him better, just as friends or more if we both feel like it.

But despite all that talking, we never exchanged significant informations. I had to leave early at the end of the course to catch my train, but I regret it because I really wanted to ask him for his number...

I have no way to find him again. I don't know his last name, I don't know where he's studying, I don't know anything. The course was an unique event and not affiliated with anything else, I have no chance of running into him again.


The only option I have would be to ask the course organizer to ask them to give him my email or number (so he has the choice to contact me himself). But that honestly feels creepy and kinda desperate, and I'm not even sure they would do it or have the time for it. Maybe if I make up a lie that justifies needing to contact him it would work better, but that seems really out of line.

But at the same time, I don't want to miss my chance. What I felt with him was really unique.

People have told me that I should go for it, that it's cute and romantic. But I know that if our genders were switched up, their opinions would be very different.

So, guys, if a girl you met for 3 hours tried to contact you that way, how would you feel ? Especially if she used a lie to get your contact ?


I guess it depends on wether you like her or not, but I can't claim anything about his feelings

TL;DR : I met a guy during a course, liked him (maybe mutual), didn't get the time to exchange contacts. Now I'm considering getting his contact through the course organizer, but it seems creepy.

75,np7504,1622477932,My ex is back !," After a 4 years of relationship he ghosted me ..

Our relationship wasn't perfect, we were just hurting each other as he said, even if we were so in love. we used to have breaks and it was me who talk first but in our last breakup I didn't, I know he won't show up so I've decided to move on. It wasn't easy it took me more that a year to get convinced that what he had is finally over. I'm dating now a lovely man who helped a lot with this, he knew that I was dealing with a heartbreak, he has my back and I'm not ready to loose him no matter what.

Last month my ex texted me, I was super mad at him I refused to talk, I wasn't ready to return back to the past, I was so rude I blocked him. I told my bf about it.

From that time, I've been thinking a lot about it, what if he just wanted to check of me, what if he feel sorry about what he did, maybe I need to hear that apologie that i've been always waiting for to stop hating him, cuz I want to feel nothing towards him. I wanted to focus on my new relationship.

I texted him back yesterday, "" sorry for being rude, Im doing good thank u for asking, I moved on don't worry about me I feel much better""

He answered, he told me that he's ready to explain himself, the reasons why he ghosted me.. we spend the whole night talking about it,It was his was to solve things, running away and cutting off communication, he apologized and I feel so relieved.

My question is :

Should I tell my bf ? last time he told that I did the right thing ignoring him, I'm afraid that he can't understant why I did that, that I needed a closure ..

80,np7fiv,1622478753,Should I ghost my fwb/ex?,"I need help! Early twenties f here. Ive been in an on and off unbalanced fwb situation with a guy 10 years older than me for the past 2 and half years. It started out with dating ( I was in college) than transitioned when he kind of shittily said he couldn’t commit/I lived too far away.

It’s been unbalanced and difficult because I was younger and naive and had stronger feelings, which he acknowledged but tried to shrug off, I think in the hope that he could get more sex and friendship from me (because we do have a good time when we hang out.)

However, I now live two states away and I’ve grown a lot and just don’t really see the appeal anymore of a directionless relationship. I’ve been living in an emotionally abusive family situation and he’s offered me to go visit. It could be nice to get away but the idea of playing house and having sex with someone who’s not my boyfriend and who leads a lifestyle I don’t agree with just doesn’t sound like the right move.

The thing is I have already rescheduled the flight once. He’s bought stuff in preparation for my visit. I don’t want to be an asshole. I care about him. But I don’t see the value in continuing this. My childish, romantic feelings have dissipated and now I see they are the only things that kept me in this situation.

So here are my choices:

Go, enjoy some time away after 1 year uninterrupted in a toxic household

Cancel my flight and ghost

Make up an excuse for a second time, cancel flights, slowly stop talking

OR: and this is pretty lame, but I’ve been thinking of saying I’m having a terrible herpes outbreak and can’t go. I actually do have herpes (he knows) so it wouldn’t be that far fetched.

I know this sounds like a no brainer but I have a dysfunctional family and therefore low self esteem and it is very very hard to advocate for myself, especially against people who have shown me kindness- which he has, despite his many flaws and our incompatibilities.

How do I do this without oversharing, being an asshole, etc? I have already made myself vulnerable in front of him many times only to humiliate myself because of his emotional limitations.

TLDR; I have a flight booked to see a fwb I’ve been in a dysfunctional situationship with for over 2 years and I want to cancel without too much collateral damage.

I'm new to tinder. I matched with some girl last night and she was surprised at how friendly I came across. She told me she doesn't use tinder much so she asked for my number pretty much off the bat.

She texted me ""Hey. So what city are you from? and if you don't see my profile it's bc I activated the hidden mode as I'm talking with you"". Idk i thought that was a bit odd to completely shut her tinder off immediately after but okay haha.

She just asked about relationships and I told her I just got out of something and so did she. She said shes still sad about it and i said i had as well. She said she isnt really looking for anything serious right now.

She first talked about meeting at a cafe but then she said why dont you come over this evening (not really evening, it was nearly 4am lmao). She said she has a gin bottle she could use help finishing and offered to pick me up. I was honestly not feeling like getting picked up that late but said Id love to later in the week after work.

She then went on to say lets catch up and that she uses something called noon-light safe which I had to look up myself as I didn't know what it was. I fell asleep but just woke up to a link to something regarding noon-light and she explained how it works saying itll give me some private number for her to send her my address or something.

83,np7mfw,1622479285,I can't forgive myself for being too available," I dated someone last year, shortly. He was everything I wanted on paper in someone. Truly--I have never felt that way before. He opened me up more than anyone I've ever known. The difficult element of this, is that there are two possible narratives that accompany it. It's undeniable that he demonstrated every emotionally unavailable red flag; and also all--let's say 9/10 of what would be covert narcissism (though I absolutely abhor diagnoses, and I hate getting stuck there). It was brief, but incredibly intense. I was the biggest thing I've ever felt. In attachment theory language. I am fearful-avoidant leaning anxious, and I think he is fearful-avoidant leaning dismissive. His signals were super mixed; and I asked for clarity a lot--which drove him away. He said it was my high expectations (in honest observation, they were: clear communication throughout the getting to know you process, and coming through on plans because he canceled often) drove him away. I think he thought because I needed these things, I was ready to ""lock it down,"" he wasn't really meeting me halfway, but in the same breath, I have to take ownership of the fact that I wanted it SO BAD. And I want to be clear. I don't date often--I pour all my energy into my creativity and work and relationships. I try to do my work, and meet my own needs. I don't always succeed. But I wanted HIM really bad--not just someone. Not just a random partner. In the end, he said ""I'd overwatered it with my want; that my want was like drinking out of a firehose, and he felt suffocated."" Then he asked for space and never spoke to me again. I tried to reach out several months later with something light, but he ignored me. It's hard because I can't forgive myself for being too available. I feel like, if I'd pulled back, or been more measured, we would have been perfect for each other. It's so hard because I was trying to honor his needs. I didn't text a lot, I never texted first, I only went on dates when he asked--I really stayed in my corner. But I think he sense my internal want, even if I wasn't saying it. He shamed me for it, and now I feel ashamed, wishing I could have been better. I think if I had been healthier--I wouldn't have missed out on the best thing that's ever happened to me.

Typically the situation goes like this, they make plans for a long weekend together, they each find care or sitters for their kids, they talk the weekend up via cell and text and get excited for it to be here. Usually on that THursday one of her kids or her or her niece gets ""Sick"" (so she says)  and she wants to ""try to keep plans"" but yet again Lucy has pulled that football out from underneath Charlie Brown and he's left home heartbroken and making excuses for her.  (She never follows through and keeps him on some kind of hopeless leash) 

We can't tell what kind of games she's playing but I told him she's done this repeatedly over the last two years so she clearly has no class, manners, self respect or respect for you so for God's Sake, dump her. 

This guy can't let go for some reason, can someone shed some light on what she's doing and why? 

We can't figure out why she does this so repeatedly...he's even driven by her home/places she hangs out to see if she's with other men or anyone else but him on a night they had plans.  I need to help this guy but he doesn't get it.

* Person A (20sF): We are FWB. High sexual chemistry, not so high intellectual connection. She has hurt me before, because I wanted to be more than friends. Now, I just wanted to be fwb and she wants a relationship.
* Person B (20sF): Met her recently. She's cute, I like her vibe, I can already tell she wants me to kiss her and she is pushing for a sushi date that I actually was the first one to propose. She is pretty, but, to me, not as much as person A. Personality wise, we are a better match

The deal with person A was that we would be fwb while still meeting other people, and that is why I started pursuing person B. Now, person A says she has feelings and is ready to commit to me, and I am confused because I like her and, eventhough she has hurt me before, I could consider a relationship with her if I felt she really meant it. But if I choose person A, I may be missing a good connection with person B, and I already led her on a bit. If I stop pursuing person B now, I may never get the chance to date her

I went on one date with a guy that I met over a dating app, and before we met up, I had a feeling he wasn't over his ex. They were in a long term relationship and just broke up a few months ago. But even with this in mind, we talked and he said he felt like he was ready to get back into the dating world.

We went out, and overall, we had a good time. He did seem a lot more shy than I had anticipated, and I had moments where I thought this meant he wasn't attracted to me because he wasn't very touchy, but overall, he asked a lot of questions and maintained good eye contact and we talked for a couple hours. Later in the night, he asked if he could kiss me, and I was really surprised because it didn't seem like he was into me. The shyness plus the asking really made me want to see him more, because he was so respectful. We kissed goodbye and parted ways.

Two days later, I hadn't heard from him so I sent a follow up text saying I had a great time and would be happy to meet up later in the week. He agreed and said he'd let me know. A few days later though, he sent me a text and was very open about how after we met, he experienced a lot of emotions from his breakup and was thinking he wasn't ready to date just yet. My heart sank. He was planning to go home and think about things, and said we could maybe hang out when he got back. But I told him I understood and said we didn't have to meet up even when he got back. I felt for him, I can't imagine what hurt he's going through, so I wanted to give him time.

On the day he was going to travel back, I sent a text to which he said ""Thanks!"". Maybe I'm a little bit more on the sensitive side, but this curtness compared to our previous texts made me really sad. I feel the distance, and I think more than anything, I feel a little rejected. Part of me also wonders whether this was an excuse to not see me again?

We get along great and share a number of things in common.  She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner I’ve ever had.  I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.  As a result, I started dating much later than the average person.  After becoming more self-aware, I decided to start making changes in my life to better myself and my circumstances.  I started eating healthier, exercising 6 days a week and started CBT therapy.  I consider myself a much improved person mentally, socially, physically and spiritually.  

However, I recently learned something about my girlfriend’s past that has me seriously reconsidering our relationship.  I recently discovered how many guys she’s been with previously.  I know it’s foolish to let something of the past mess up the present but it’s really bothering me for some reason.   I find myself becoming less invested in the relationship as a result.  


I’m doing my best not to judge because I know I don’t have a right to but this particular scenario is really putting a strain on my mind.  After sitting and thinking about it for a week, I still don’t have an idea of why I feel retroactively jealous and upset by this.
