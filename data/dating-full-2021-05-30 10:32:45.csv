And I know that I’ll probably get called an ncel or a nice guy for making this post but whatever, call me what you want.

So I hung out with a friend and her friends all of them were women and I was the only guy. While in the car one of them started talking about her boyfriend or whoever she was sleeping with and how he was kind of an asshole. Well not kinda, he’s a scumbag. Then other girls started hiking in about how their boyfriends or fuckbuddies are also scumbags. I didn’t have much to contribute so I minded my business but then one of them said this. 

“No offense OP, but the bar is so low for men, I’m just happy when he doesn’t *insert shitty thing*” and all of them agreed.

So firstly I think that I am, and that probably at least half of all guys are good guys. Like I try my best to be a good person. I volunteer, I’m empathetic, I try hard to be someone that other people can come to with a problem and I help them, which I know doesn’t mean I deserve a relationship, but it’s just very frustrating to hear them say that guys can be complete shitheads and women will not care because it’s expected and I still can’t get a date.

It also annoyed me just as their friend because they’re inviting this behavior. When the guy that fucks them and stops talking to them for weeks until he wants to seem them again sees that they’ll put up with that, it just says that he can walk over you and you reward him for it. They’re allowing these guys to treat them like trash and then still give the guys what they want from them. Why the fuck would you do that? He’s making your life worse. Why would you want that?

And lastly it of course offends me because it paints men with a broad stroke like we’re all assholes put the bare minimum effort into relationships.

Now it sounds like a harmless phrase for most, but for me it is a trigger warning. See my last ex took advantage of me monetarily and damn near put me in debt. I have gotten out of that hole thankfully, but it is still a red flag for a gold digger.

To the girls I've talked to it sounds like either a joke that they think is ""cute"" and when I say no either becomes something that pisses them off or they think I'm hung up on my ex, when I say I cannot. However to me, it just takes me back to a dark relationship that I rather not talk about and move on from.

I find myself investing more emotions than I should early on when dating. I went on 3 long dates with someone over the course of 2 weeks (totaling 17 hours) - obviously we had a really good time and enjoyed each other’s company. We both thought we were on the same page about not wanting anything seriously, but after the 4th date, he clarifies that he’s not looking for any commitment *at all*. Up until then, we had been talking constantly for weeks and meeting up every week (this is what I usually think of when casual dating is going well). Now he’s taken a step back and just wants to be able to just focus on himself, take it easy, and if things line up then we meet. 

I respect that he knows he needs to work on himself and heal from a toxic relationship. I’m at a point where I don’t feel I need a serious relationship nor am I dating with the intention of getting serious (but I’m not against it if it happens later on). Obviously I’m pretty disappointed - I really felt like we clicked extremely well on top of physical attraction and it went both ways. In fact, normally dislike physical touch and affection but really enjoyed giving/receiving with him. After finding out, I’ve been lessening my hopes and expectations towards him but realized the reason I’m more disappointed is because I had emotionally invested more when I should’ve had less. 

I know I have anxious attachment style and have gotten better with it over the past few years through therapy, but I’d really love some reminders/tips/encouragement on how I can avoid investing too much too early and save myself extra disappointment moving forward. I want to better myself not just so I can get a “boyfriend” but just so I can be closer to a secure, healthy attachment style for all of my relationships (not just romantic ones).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,805208,public,self,I (early 20s) want to work on myself too after what happened.

To be frank, there is no ugliness that can't be fixed. I know several dudes who were ranked as ""ugly"" sometimes back but rn they are okay and they are getting what they want. 

So here is my little breakdown on how to stop wallowing in self pity about your looks especially for males.

1. Eat well and drink a lot of water and dehydrate more often. You can't be chugging fast food and maybe alcohol and expect to be looking like Brad Pitt. No it won't happen. Just eat well, have some fruits and get plenty of sunshine where possible. Brush your teeth, trim unwanted facial hair clean your ears well. Have a fresh breath. Work on yourself throughly. 

2. Get skin moisturizers and skin toners, baby oil and exfoliation creams. Wash your face and apply oil daily and moisturizers and wait for the results. Quit the toxic masculinity bs that men can't do this, it would only make you more uglier and unattractive. Apply baby oil to your face, moisturize and exfoliate often and you will have a smooth skin. You can't be having a scaly dry skin and then you start complaining. Point is, use cosmetics to improve your looks. 

3. Relax your hair for those who have hard coarse hair and the others with long hair, curl it and maybe straighten it well and nicely. Shaggy and unkempt hair is a turn off. Just have clean, well combed, well kept hair.

4. Glasses, Wear glasses if you think your face is not that good. Glasses accentuate your face and gives you some few points (the trendy curved/oval one, depending on your face) and you will come out as as a
 gentleman 

5. Lastly quit complaining about your looks and work on them. Complaining about them won't yield anything. Use anything at your disposal to work on them. Also cleanliness is the first step to improve your looks, use colognes or deodorants to mask your smell if you have one. Use cosmetics, use exfoliation creams, go for facial scrubs, go for facial cleansing, go for facial treatments if possible. Just do anything within your reach to make things work and stop complaining.

He was really nice to me though and sometimes I felt like maybe he would eventually start seeing me in a different way. That encouraged me not to stop it, but a few weeks ago I was finally done with it, as it keeps me from seeing other people and it’s leading nowhere. 

Now I matched with his best friend (27, m) on a dating app, and he asked me to go out for drinks. I jokingly said that it was okay and that he could be my wingman, because I thought he was maybe fooling with me. 
I do like to go because we get along well, but I don’t want to be mean towards my now ex fuckbuddy or be the topic of a joke between them. 

(I get that it’s a little bit weird that out of all people I had a nice conversation with him, but I think it’s due to the fact that I’m a little scared to meet someone who I don’t know in real life. With him I already know he is a nice guy and not creepy.)

He said he wanted to be with me, likes me and wants to be a part of his future. He talked about our plans about moving together because we live 6 hours away from each other. In which we had a bit of disagreement about because I have a good career and it requires me to be physically present. He even talked about how we're going to move things around, our living situation, our finances, our careers— the entire what we want in the future. We have each other contact details and sometimes send each other dinner via a food delivery app. He even made plans to visit me and try to be in a serious relationship if we vibe. We couldn't make it because he tested positive for covid and I temporarily have my grandmother with me.

He even said ""I love you"" while intoxicated a few weeks after. I gave him a free pass but thanked him. He said he meant it after he sobered up but he still wants us friends. He and I never deleted the app which is fine. He said he's only looking people to chat with while I can't handle talking to multiple people.

We talked almost daily until he didn't. I tried reaching out to him but he doesn't want to talk. I know he also has a busy career like I do (and communicated about) and he has a joint custody of his child so I let him spend time with his child when he needs to. He started giving me one liners. I texted him that I hope that he's fine. I gave him the ""we need to talk"" stuff and asked him how he was, what he wanted. He said his feelings has not changed. I asked if he still talks with the people from the app, he said he does and even admitted that he might be interested in them. I told him that his plans don't match with his word. He stopped talking.

We stopped talking since. He promised he would not ghost me because he's not like that. But then he did. I tried reaching out because I felt it's so immature to not talk but I was left on seen zone.

I'm not expecting his reply anymore. I know he has his phone all the time and he has the app where we talk on his laptop. It's funny how fast these ""actors"" run as soon as they get caught.

I’m a 33[M] who matched with and met a really awesome girl 27[F]. We had what we both said was the best first date ever, we met for coffee and walked around a nice lake during the morning with great weather. We had an awesome connection and conversation flowed naturally, we talked about a lot of things that were high level (values, family stuff) and found we’re extremely on the same page about just about everything. 

She was free the next evening, so we got dinner at a restaurant near where she lives. It was loud and hard to hear each other, and I was feeling nervous about things not going as well as before. We both agreed that it was probably just the atmosphere and set up for a third date. 

Today, we got breakfast and did an escape room. Things felt fine, but nothing like date 1. Almost as if we both felt nervous/self conscious/disappointed that the vibe wasn’t the same as it had been. After it was over, we talked about it and she admitted that she doesn’t know yet about wanting to date, but was very clear that she likes me and enjoys spending time with me, and would like to go on a fourth date at least before being sure either way, which I understand. 

I don’t feel like this is one-sided, I feel almost exactly the same way she does, and I see a huge amount of potential for us to be in a great relationship - but I don’t know what to do next.

We chatted about anything and every thing, had a hot &amp; heavy make out session after he walked me to my car, and even texted me 10 minutes after I left that he liked me and wanted to see me again. Sweet. 

Well, this guy is the worst texter in the world even though before we went out he was pretty quick to respond on Snapchat (he would occasionally open things &amp; ignore it but would respond with something totally different later instead of continuing the convo). After our first date he kept saying sorry &amp; that he was busy if he took a long time to respond, but now he just 100% sucks at responding but will text goodmorning or hiiiii and not continue the convo lol then a few days later he asked to add my on IG (even went for the Facebook) &amp; mentioned he showed his best friend my photo &amp; that I got the seal of approval. Adorable, love that. Then he went back to being a crappy texter 

We had plans to go out this past Friday but he wasn’t feeling well after getting the second dose of the vaxx, so I said I was down to go over as long as he didn’t pull any sneaky moves. As soon as I got there he wanted to cuddle, hold hands, kept kissing my shoulder &amp; I found it odd after he was so distant through the week but finally gave in to it. We spent the whole evening getting worked up &amp; me eventually saying  to going any further cause I said no sneaky moves. I told him if he wanted to be a fuck buddy then that’s one thing &amp; he said he didn’t want to just be a fuckbuddy. Sweeeeet.

Next day, again. Terrible texter. Hasn’t mentioned wanting to go out again, or really tried to initiate any conversation. In person he’s super sweet so it’s totally throwing me off. Am I looking to deep into this??

Side note, I’m used to guys being really great at texting but having zero interest or personality in person.

Nothing inappropriate.

He knows about my adhd and sensory issues along with my Rejection sensitivity dysphoria and relationship anxiety , he reassures me a lot, and has told me to never apologise for having adhd (it's a habit of mine) or apologise for being myself, he's also very patient.

My family is Latin American so i was cooking Ají de gallina for him, and he let me teach him how to dance salsa. 
He said WHEN i meet your family I'm going to take private lessons so I'm ready for your family parties. 
And also mentioned' next time i see you' or 'next time I will....' 
We spoke after our date
He says he feels relaxed around me and feels like he can be himself

I'm bad at dating or whatever, i dont know social norms. 


I dont know if he likes me

And i dont know what it means when he says he feels relaxed around me and like he can be himself

It’s pandemic times, I’m traveling in a foreign country. There is not much to do other than go to restaurants or hang out at someone’s house.

So today, a Sunday, we both felt chipper and I invited her to do something. Although, I feel weird forcing it, like “Come over so we can hook up.” Although that is exactly what I intended, which she seemed open to. She already agreed to come over. And I don’t really want to take her out to eat... again.
So this afternoon I said hey let’s get together and she said ok, what do you want to do?
I said basically “Come on over, I don’t have an exact plan is that ok? I’m at the store, I’ll get a dessert. Whatever you’re comfortable with...” etc. Seemed pretty damn obvious to me.
Her reply: “I don’t get it.”
I’m thinking... What don’t you get?
So I said never mind, (if you don’t “get it.”) let’s try again later this week. I assumed she would play along and she understood and this would work out. After all, she has been very interested the whole time.

Of course, this intrigued me quite a bit, so last Monday she entered the bar and at first she didn't impress me that much. However, my hesitation didn't last long since I realized her apparently lowkey looks, combined with her softness, made me like her more and more. She's downright beautiful, she's basically my type. Up to now we haven't shared any dialogue, since her appearances are obviously very fleeting, but last time she smiled at me as if we were longstanding people. I don't think it was a fitting expression, it felt totally genuine, which brings me to believe it wasn't really a dumb detail. She appears to be single, too, which motivated me even further.  
Unfortunately, she's also very reserved more or less like me, but not my way, since I'm reserved because I don't care, whereas she's pretty bashful. While I do realize why she wouldn't be that open with my parents, I hope she'll be more relaxed when I'm also there.  
I've never been so determined, as I've even been thinking of opening an Instagram account (despite hating to take pics), just for the sake of DMing her without any ""undesired guests"". I also have to treat her as delicately as she acts, and for now my goal is to obtain her trust. She needs to be calmer and less shy, I want her to have some conversations with me.
