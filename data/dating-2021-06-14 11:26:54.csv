0,nzqoze,1623688057,Me (33m) Ghosted by (31F) after sex,"I don't really know what to do about this situation but i guess i just wanted to vent as i know people here have had this happen to the aswel, it absolutely sucks. You are the worst kind of person if you ghost someone after sex:

I met this girl on a dating app last week and we really hit it off, we spent 12+ hours on the first date chatting and laughing and having a great time, so much so that we ended up having sex on the first date and she stayed the night at mine. After that she seemed to show even more interest in me and began to text me 50+ times a day with running jokes and general chat which I enjoyed. We met up again two days ago and had an excellent time and the night also ended with sex and with her staying over. The next day she was sending me cryptic fun messages in Spanish as to where to meet next. I deciphered the messages and sent fun messages back also. The next night though she asked me what I was up to ( after a day of texting ) and I said I was having a drink with a friend at my house tonight. She responded with an abrupt ""have fun"" and I checked my WhatsApp this morning and she had blocked me.

Wtf?

Update:
I ended up texting her as I had her number and found out the reason she blocked me on whatsapp. It was something that I didn't expect and didn't mention above. I got my covid vax last week and felt like shit after for a few days. She asked me to meet her on Saturday night ( night of the ghost ) but I had already told her I wasn't feeling well and wanted to chill with a friend and do something low key. She told me that she ghosted me because I wouldn't go out with her and that my behavior basically reminded me off her ex and the way he wouldn't do anything with her.

1,nzqqja,1623688175,Am I being strung along? Should I walk?,"Been seeing this woman for a month, and things have been going great. We were last together the weekend just gone. She was telling me about how we have so much in common, how well we get along, how excited she gets to see me and how she forgot what an amazing guy I am (we dated briefly prior which stopped with covid running rampant). It was very reassuring to hear, because I've really took a liking to her. 

I decided that I'd bring up 'us' and where this is going, and she seemed so unsure, and thinks 'I might be taking it a little too seriously right now' and that she wants to take it easy. Asked if she'd been seeing anybody else and she admits she'd seen someone twice in the last fortnight. 

And then plans got turned down for this week and I was told 'next week, very busy/worn out rn'

I'm just not sure what to think. The vibe quickly turned from 'I'm really into you' to 'I'm unsure and might walk' in a matter of a day for no apparent reason. 

Does anybody have any advice? Do I walk? Do I tell her that I thing I'm being strung along?

And as far as interracial and same sex dating people still look at that as a problem but they are still widely accepted in this world. But when it comes to interabled dating there still seems to be a major problem from outside of the disability community. There seems to be not be as much positive acceptance like there for other types of couples. Where are the parades Like there is for same sex couples?

That night she told me it's not going to work out because even after she told me her concerns about Covid I still didn't wear a mask when I went to get ice cream. She said it's hard to have a peace of mind with me if I'm this careless, and we are done.

6,nzrfj8,1623690018,"How the fuck does casual dating work? (50% rant, 100% honest question, 69% anxiety)","***tl;dr:***

*What are the expectations in establishing that I'm looking to be casual and non-exclusive?*

*Additionally, I'm awkward and anxious so idk how to make moves and to end things with tact, so any help there would be appreciated, but that's technically something else.*

\-------

&lt;rant&gt; I (27M) am very much new to dating in general, having only really tried giving it a go last year. First person I spoke to and tried being serious with was actually kinda crazy, so that ended. Second person and I were talking but not yet in a relationship, but we just didn't work out. Now I'm kinda trying to figure out stuff like my sex drive/comfort, how long I may reasonably be interested in someone as I feel like it quickly wanes -- mostly like ""fuck it, things are confusing and I don't really know if I want to seriously date atm, so I'll be casual.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Main stuff**

*On stating that a given relationship is casual:*

Firstly, on the handful of apps I'm using, I outright say on my profiles/bio that I'm not looking for anything serious. Be forthright with it because why not? That way, if someone's interested in me then they should know my intentions from the get-go. How do I best deliver that if it's someone I meet in person? I get anxious at the idea of keeping it ""hidden"" for so long, so I feel compelled to just say it ASAP, but then that becomes potentially 2much2soon and isn't that appealing, and it's kinda presumptuous of her intentions. However, I just feel like getting to know someone for X dates to then find out that we're looking for different things is just time wasted and unnecessary potential sadness (which is presumptuous of her feelings, but is the safer route, imo).

&amp;#x200B;

*On letting it known that there may be many relationships with others:*

I had matched with a woman and we had met up. I said again in person that I'm not looking for anything serious because reasons, and we ended hooking up a few times. We had both said toward the beginning that we're not seeing anyone else because \_there's a pandemic, y'all\_. Eventually I asked her whether she would prefer that I continue not see anyone else during this time as to not put her at risk, as this was before we were vaccinated. She said she's not hooking up with anyone else at the moment because of pandemic, but if she were going to she'd let me know. *Do I then extend this same* ***exact*** *courtesy?* I'd assume so (reinforced by the fact that it's a pandemic), but I'm also wondering why not just start assuming that we're seeing other people?

What about in general? How do I establish that we're actively non-exclusive? I'm being told by many of my friends that ""nobody is exclusive until you talk about it"", but one of my friends and I both think that we should be open about it and let them decide what they're comfortable with. If I'm going with the latter, then when do I bring that up? Again, can't be 2much2soon.

Additionally, what if she says something like the above, where she would *tell me* if she's hooking up with someone else? Assuming she doesn't specify what she would like to *hear*, do I still extend the same **exact** courtesy? *I would assume so*, but a friend told me that she might be comfortable with saying that, but not with hearing it. I feel like assuming reciprocity here is the fairest and safest route though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional stuff**

&amp;#x200B;

*On making moves:*

I would assume that I should be smooth with it, although I was very much awkward af with the above woman, but do I initiate? If so, when? I've had some female friends tell me that I should just wait for the woman to make the move because otherwise she could feel pressured into something she's not comfortable with, but I've other female friends tell me that that just takes the allure out of it and that I should just make the move.

&amp;#x200B;

*On the next day:*

Let's say I spend the night and I wake up before she and want to leave because reasons. Do I wait until she's up and chat with her before leaving? Do I just leave and let her know that ""I had fun"" via a text or note or whatever? Do I stay to make breakfast? lol. If she spends the night, do I still make breakfast?

&amp;#x200B;

*On everything else (initiating, maintaining, ending, etc.):*

I assume it's all ""just go with the flow"", and that may very well be the answers to the above.

However, the first time I was with someone in an attempt at being casual, I had stressed that I didn't even think we should be hooking up because I was moving to another continent in a month and she just said to go with the flow. She ended up getting attached and getting hurt when I wasn't reciprocating. Confusingly enough for her, we were still chatting even when I was gone because we were long-lost childhood friends. Eventually, I *anxiously* asked whether she still had feelings for me, and when she sad she did still have some, I reiterated that I don't, and may have additionally *anxiously* added that I'm looking to go to lunch with someone I had just met (didn't want to keep anything secret/hidden). Yes, we're not in touch anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to cut it short as I have to actually get some work done today. Thank you in advance for any advice given.

7,nzrmmj,1623690522,Is it weird I don't text very much before or after a date?,I (26M) tend to not be interested in texting someone after a date. For example I went out this weekend with (24f) the date went great! She sent me a text saying good morning the next day and asked how I slept and all that stuff. We had a small talk conversation but nothing interesting. Hours later she sent me snap chats of an outfit she got and pictures that had to do with an inside joke. I answered the snaps and everything but it didn't go very far. I haven't talked to her in a day which is okay with me but I'm wondering if that's a mistake I'm making? This is a really similar situation I get into after dates every time. I just like engaging with someone in person or on the phone.

8,nzrmx5,1623690542,Advise ! I [M 23] can't seem to put a label to the kind of relationship I have with this girl [F 22],"I met this girl in tinder. I'll admit, right off the bat she didn't look so attractive physically. Started talking and I liked how receptive and responsive she is (which most women weren't in my experience on Tinder). 

It's been 3 months now we ended up texting for hours and calls every weekend. We aren't able to meet because they enforced lockdowns here in India. Anyways, this one day she just tells me she wanted to kiss me and then she admitted she wants to go all the way with me and she's never felt this way with anyone. Though we talk so much we never bore each other out. I can see good compatibility between us. We like/dislike and value similar things in life. 

We've both never had sex with anyone before but I kind of freaked out when I heard. But eventually I grew to like her and she, even more. We both want to lose our virginity to each other. 

I asked if she's okay with meeting me in a room for our first date and she didn't refuse. We trust each other and openly communate about literally everything and are vulnerable to each other emotionally. We ask each other if we've had our meals, ask how our day went and it's a little bit platonic too. 

She does know that I'm not ready for a committed relationship yet cause I told her I need to get my affairs in order and focus on my career amongst other things so though she doesn't admit it, she's afraid to push me and lose me like that (which obviously won't happen). Right now we're exclusive. She doesn't talk to any guy from dating apps or otherwise (mostly because she's too shy and doesn't open up to a lot of people). So we've agreed to keep things casual and let the relationship take whatever pace it wants to and see where it lands us. 

I don't even know if I should be putting a label on our relationship but how would you describe it ? We're obviously not FWBs or are we ? If not then is there potential for our relationship to transform into something  serious ? Cause we're both definitely not in this for just fun.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzrmx5/advise_i_m_23_cant_seem_to_put_a_label_to_the/
9,nzrp1f,1623690695,Should I call it a loss?,"Full disclosure, I also posted this in r/dating_advice. Hoping to get some more insight!

Hi all, I \[24F\] recently started seeing a guy \[26M\] I met on tinder and I'm fairly certain he has lost interest/is ghosting me, but I'd like some perspective that isn't coming from my friends. I'll try to keep the context brief!

So I was using tinder with no clear end goal, just looking to meet someone and have fun and see what happens. I matched with this guy and he asked me out pretty much immediately. We went on our first date to a bar about 6 weeks ago. It went super well, way better than I expected and I ended up going back to his place. We slept together and I spent the night. The next day he texted me and asked if I wanted to hang out after he got back from a trip and I said of course! We planned to go out to dinner exactly 2 weeks after the first date, but the night before we were going to go, he replied to my instagram story around 11pm while I was hanging out with friends. We got to talking and he ended up picking me up and we went back to his, hung out, and then had sex again. Like I said, I had no end goal here so I didn't really mind if this turned into more of a hookup than a long term relationship. I spent the night there again, of course. The next day (the original day of our planned 2nd date), he asked if I wanted to reschedule to the next day. I was exhausted anyway so I said no problem. We went out to casual dinner at a bar and then (as usual) I slept over at his. He had done basically all of the initiating at that point, so I figured the next one was on me. So a few days later, I asked if he wanted to get dinner with me and he said yes. This time we went to a real restaurant and, again, it was really great. This time I paid and he seemed grateful. He came back to my apartment after but I had plans early the next morning so he didn't stay over (although we did have sex). After that, I was out of town for a few days so I figured I should let him know when I got back and see if he wanted to go out again. This is where I started to notice some changes. When I texted him to hang out, he didn't reply until the next day but said yes and offered a day for the date. I suggested we watch a movie (I wanted it to be clear that I don't expect us to drop $$$ every time we hang out) , but to my surprise he suggested another nice restaurant that we had talked about before. I thought this was a good sign that he wanted to continue taking me out etc. But after he said that, he didn't reply until the day we were supposed to go out (2 days later). He said something like ""whoops my bad..."" but then established the time for dinner. It was kind of off putting but by no means a deal breaker, and we still ended up having a good time. I went to his apartment after, we did watch a movie, had sex, and then I went home. As I was leaving, he kissed me goodbye as he always does, and said ""see you soon?"" I replied, ""yes definitely! Let me know,"" he affirmed and I went home.

That brings us to the present. That last date was 10 days ago and I have not heard from him since. We never really texted between dates so it wasn't weird at first, but I feel like since so much time has gone by and he hasn't reached out, he's probably over it. I totally get it that feelings can change but I don't get what happened or why. We had a lot in common, made each other laugh, had some deeper conversations, and seemed to enjoy each other's company. I feel like I'm being ghosted and should just forget it, but my friends think I can send one last text as sort of a hail mary to see what happens. I kind of disagree since I initiated the last 2 times, he specifically said he'd let me know, and if he wanted to see me he would. What do you think is going on and what should I do about it? Thanks in advance for reading this essay haha.

22,nzt6wo,1623694680,Dating is Rough,"I (20f) met this guy (26m) on hinge and we started going out and quickly go into a relationship. We were dating for about a month and a half and things were going well. He asked me to be his girlfriend a few weeks in and I said yes because we had both been up front about the fact that we had wanted a relationship. At that point we both deleted all of our dating apps and mutually decided to official and exclusive. We had a really great connection, I met his friends and got along with them great (he said they loved me), he had invited me to plans a few months away. He would tell me about how he started to tell his friends and coworkers about me and would introduce me as his girlfriend. We were laughing together about the fact that when he told his coworkers about me they said ""don't f\*\*\* it up"". He would talk to me about plans years down the line involving me and what he wanted out of marriage and kids and referred to me when talking about those things.

This scared me a little since I have a history of 'fleeing' relationships when they get serious, but I made a promise to myself that I would not be the one to flee this relationship. Overall, I'm not one to date a lot and have plenty of personal problems that hold me back in term of intimacy (as did he) and we were able to discuss that candidly. I was feeling increasingly secure in the relationship. Last week we went out to dinner and we were talking about past relationships and he admitted that he has never been broken up with because if he feels it coming he always does it first. This scared me a little, but reminded me of how I am/was in relationships (I took a lot of time to work through those things, thanks therapy). When he told me that, I thought to myself ""ok, when/if we break up I am ok with being the one broken up with because I will be able to emotionally handle it"". Not that I was necessarily thinking about ending it, I just was acknowledging what clearly were some deep rejection issues on his end and measuring how I could handle those against my own rejection issues. He would also often talk about how he had ""been through a lot"" and struggled with relationships in the past so I figured whatever was clearly emotionally hurting him would be expressed to me down the line when he felt comfortable.

He talked about how he was very mature for his age and how he thought his exes were intimidated by him. This was a weird part of the conversation, but I didn't say anything in response, as I was just taking what he said in without feeling the need to respond or argue. My thoughts were that 1) If someone is mature for their age, the don't really need to repeatedly say it, its just a fact that those around them will figure out if that is truly the case and 2) I doubted that his exes were intimidated by him, as I was not at all intimidated by him (I respected him as I thought he respected me, but there was no sense of intimidation).

I was supposed to go over his place this past Friday but he texted me and said ""I'm so sorry, I have a family issue and I'm still at their house and I don't know when I'm going to get back so would it be okay if we postponed to sunday?"" I was understanding and gave him his space. I tried to set up a call that Saturday, but he said he was out at a friends party and would be out all night. At this point I was thinking this was all a little weird and just figured I would discuss my concerns with him when we met up on Sunday. Sunday comes, we text in the morning and I send him a message saying what time I can come over and he responded ""Im sorry. I cant do this relationship anymore. It's due to some things I have to work through on my end. I truly wish you the best"". I was obviously caught off guard, but I didn't even dignify that with a response and I wont ever respond, because he didn't respect me enough to tell me in person.

Immediately after I saw the text I went to instagram to unfollow him/unfollow his account from mine, but he had already beat me to it. It was at that point that I thought to myself ""we are so similar"" and just chuckled to myself a little. Several hours later I re-downloaded the dating app we met on and the next day I saw his profile come up. I was obviously disappointed to see it, but we are broken up and he doesn't owe me anything at this point. Overall, Im disappointed but not devastated (it was a month and a half long relationship, after all), I know that I deserve so much better and at the very least I was able to fulfill my commitment to myself and not flee. I'm not going to waste time trying to understand why, because all that matters is we're done. I learned a lot about myself and how I am in relationships and hope that he is able to overcome his pain.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzt6wo/dating_is_rough/

I felt a deep connection with her,even asking if she wanted to go get something to eat together. I felt like I was pushing for a relationship to most I would call her probably every hour and she wouldn’t reply to me.. sometimes she would pick up other times we won’t speak until days after that. I think I messed up here :) I posted a a screenshot of this photo that stated “You’re not the only one I have options” she saw it and then immediately blew up my phone saying I was childish and stupid then she went on to block me on everything.. We didn’t talk for a week I knew I was in the wrong but I felt like I had to make it known that I wasn’t a fool and only wanted her even though I actually did.. Today this morning she texted me “Hey” and “I’m guessing you blocked my number” what should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nztqav/talking_to_a_female_but_a_single_post_on_social/

41,nzuocc,1623698587,How not to fall into boredom in second/third dates?,"Hello. I've been noticing that the dates i go normally fall into a kind of boredom after the first or second date. It's like, the first date is easy to go because there are so many things to talk about and you are genuinely curious about the other person. But on the second or third dates, its like you trying to find things to say, or just a monotonous time passing with a person. In these times where COVID is still a danger, going to parties is not a thing we can do, so it is kind of harder not to fall in these boring dates.

Maybe i should just do more exciting things like going into the wild, or any activity together that is not just walk and talk, or drink and talk, or eat and talk. Ok, i get that. But im starting to think if this is not due to Tinder/Apps kind of relationship.

It's different when you date a girl you know at college, or who is friend of a friend. You have other stuff to do that dont involve only the two of you, or you have a lot of subjects in common to talk about. But when you meet someone in-app you need dates to know the person, and you need to talk for that. Also, you dont know their friends, and it is kind of a step to introduce someone to friends, not ideal to be on a second or third date for sure!

Is this why the relationship through apps seem to fail more than thrive? How to overcome that?

I dont feel like i am a boring person, i actually have a lot going on in my personal life, but as 30yrs old person i dont have this really really exciting social life, and events, its normal, its a routine, i have to work a lot, and i have to pay bills, i see friends ocasionally and is nothing close to crazy as it was in my 20s.

Is this a normal drama, or is it just me?  


Edit: I would like to point that life is kind of boring, at least thats how i see it. So its normal to do boring things, we cant go into a trip every weekend, or go to cool parties every weekend... but maybe dates should be a way to do more exciting things with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzuocc/how_not_to_fall_into_boredom_in_secondthird_dates/

I have a question about something. One of my friends and her husband who live in Texas asked if I was open to meeting a guy whom her husband goes to PT school with. I said yes. Btw, I live in California. We have been chatting for over a month by texting and FaceTime. We have a lot of similar values, are both Christians, and have had great conversation. There are some things about him though that are kinda bothering me. For instance he asked if I was opening to meeting in a few months. I said yes and he said his friend told him that there were some men at my church who may let him stay with them while he visits. I kinda felt weird about it cause I have never actually met him in person. It would be one thing if we were actually in a committed relationship for him to ask this but we have not even met each other! After a week, I posted on the FB page of my church asking if someone could host him. In the span of two weeks, he has asked him if I have found him a place to stay four times. I understand he wants to find a place so he doesn’t have to pay for a hotel but I feel like he is being really pushy. Also, he is planning to come on a Thursday evening and leave on a Sunday morning. He asked me if I like dancing and I said yes and we could do that one evening. I also told him we could get California burritos and that we could also go to Balboa Park and Coronado while he is here. After I told him this he asked if we were gonna do anything else. To me it kinda came off rude to do this cause I am the one showing him my city and if he didn’t think we had enough to do he could have offered more suggestions. I don’t know- maybe I am just getting really in my head and overly picky.

I was an alcoholic, coke head, drug dealer, and even got arrested twice. Some how during this time I never struggled to meet and date women… in fact women were literally fighting over me and chasing me like crazy. 

But after my most recent arrest when I was 23 (I got a DUI and found with possession of narcotics, I got really lucky since my lawyer got it reduced to just a dui and some jail time), I cleaned up my act. Got my shit together and finished my degree in chemistry, got a great job, make good money, own my own place and I don’t touch any drugs anymore aside from alcohol and weed.

Now? Now it’s like women want nothing to do with me. I’m too boring or too safe. Now women lose interest in me after a couple of dates.. like seriously? So the only reason women liked me before was cause i was a criminal who had drugs and stole shit? 

And it’s not like these women were awful. No they were smart and well to do. Doctors, lawyers, med students, and even once a 40 year old ceo of her own company. 

I’m very fortunate that the only thing I have on my record is a dui but I’m just shocked at how much my dating and sex life tanked ever since I cleaned up my act. So I guess it’s true, women really do prefer the bad boys ha.

Had a promising fling last summer that ultimately fell through and have just been dreading trying again but alas, I'm a glutton for punishment I guess.

I (M27) matched with a woman (29F) on Bumble and we hit it off fairly quickly. She's in the same career as me, cute, smart, etc. Promising, you know. She did mention to me that she can seem ""cold and distant at first but then warms up slowly"" which, hey I get it, plus I'm not very aggressive dating wise at all, so it's fine.  She also has a MAJOR travel bug which she can afford since she lives in an efficiency her parents built her behind their house (meanwhile she half jokingly suggests I should upgrade after showing her pics of my apartment that I actually pay for) After I believe 3 or 4 days of talking she suggests meeting up for breakfast and I accept. We're about 20 miles apart and I agree to meet somewhere that's closer to her. Breakfast is nice and we had a couple drinks and afterwards, I take out my card to pay the $65 bill (it was a trendy little spot, I guess). I did find it a little odd that she didn't even acknowledge me paying or at least spot me a ""lol thanks :)"" but, I guess some women just have that expectation. 

Next day, she wants to meet again for drinks and a movie, again, in her neck of the woods. We agree to meet at 6pm but she texts me 20 minutes after that saying she still hasn't left yet because ""my best friend called me and she just had to vent to me about how hard her graduate school program is lol"" ... Really? lol. She shows up at 6:50, after I've been twirling my thumbs for nearly an hour at the bar.  We have a drink at a bar then hit the movie. Throughout both dates she's laughing a lot, having a seemingly good time. I notice she doesn't respond to even mild compliments or flirtation, but I chalk it up to what she told me earlier about being cold and distant at first (but man, she wasn't lying lol). Of course, I pay for everything again and again, no sort of acknowledgement at all. 

I text her when I got home that I had a good time and that I hope she did too. No response till the morning when she says that she thinks I'm hilarious and sweet, but that she's getting a friendship vibe. I respond saying I kind of felt that way too but wasn't sure if that was just you not warming up to me yet. She never responded. Obviously, it's done with and it's just like...I feel empty lol Like I get it, at least she was honest and nobody owes each other anything at this stage of dating, but man I feel like a chump lol.

during the meet, we had a great time and figured we’re both stable in our respective fields and have great sexual chemistry. our first kiss felt like just in the movies and held hands after that before walking back to his car.

i’ve laid my intent off the bat that i’m not having sex with him until im comfortable. there’s an instance that i had to bring up the ex bec i have to give context why i am the way i an currently. ie ex was alcoholic, i was emotionally abused and im sexually repressed. i’ve also mentioned that i’m talking to other people but nothing serious and i’m not in a rush. i was in a 7.5yr relationship. he just re-sign with tinder and i was the first person he talked to and met. i told him he should talk and meet more people or else how would he know. he also he doesn’t like texting and girls asking for constant validation and he ghosts. 

i asked him if he felt a spark, and he said he did and that it was easy and felt connected. i truly felt that meeting was organic. even the way he kissed me.

i texted him 24 hrs after that i had a great time and would like to do it again soon. i didn’t hear from him after 4 days 🤷‍♀️.  i thought i was being ghosted.. 

it’s been more than week, we’ve texted a few times during the week but mostly with sexual overtones and he told me that we definitely need to see each other again soon but hasn’t made plans.

just needed to get it off my chest. i know i should probably go with the flow and let him take the lead as he has most likely a dom personality and maybe a little bit old fashioned....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzwt9f/i_might_be_overthinking_and_have_the_scarcity/

- Some people view sex as quite important or indicative of a deeper connection and if things don't pan out, I don't want to lead them on

- Even though exclusivity is not on the table, part of me feels it would be dishonest to sleep with people without all my dates being aware. Not even necessarily from an STD standpoint, just good manners. 

On the other hand, I don't know where life will lead. Maybe some of the dates I'm pursuing won't work out and then I've missed out on a lot of stuff. Maybe some of them do regard sex as a bit of fun and it would be nice to have it were that the case.

What's important to me is not hurting anyone's feelings.

68,nzxnjl,1623706433,Want to live in different places,"Hi, 
I have been seeing a guy for about 6 months (F24) (M29) and he has a house, dog and career in the city I’m in , which is both of ours hometowns. I will be here for the next 4 years for med school, however afterwards I know I will be leaving for residency.
We have had brief conversations about that he wants to stay here. And I know I will be leaving eventually and likely not moving back. I have lived in a different city previously and loved it. I can’t see myself spending my whole life in this city. He understands I will be leaving and am unsure what my future looks like.

Should I be getting into a relationship with him? Should we deal with this years down the road? Or should we spare the heartbreak or compromise/resent now? 

Any advice is appreciated",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzxnjl/want_to_live_in_different_places/
69,nzxqvi,1623706690,I'm shitting bricks right now.," Guys... Fuuuuuck.

So a girl texted me a couple of days ago to ask me about something in uni, so I helped her but we continued texting, although mostly about studies.

Today we had an exam in the morning and now she told me that she saw me but didn't have the time to talk to me in person and that she can't wait to meet me tomorrow.

Guys I'll let you know that I'm extremely shy around girls as I never had any contact with them (no sisters, no prior relationships). And I kinda like her so don't want to screw this up.

So please guys any help in how to keep a conversation going and not seem scared of talking would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks a lot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzxqvi/im_shitting_bricks_right_now/
70,nzxri7,1623706740,did I get my hopes up for nothing?," 

Long post but I added details to make things clear.

I am not used to people being very friendly so it can be confusing, also I haven’t socialized properly in a long time before moving.

There’s this guy but I cannot tell 100%. if he is attracted to me or not. He is Japanese and speaks some English but he tends to be nice. He actually more outspoken with other people and he is shyer with me, not sure if it is because I speak more and he has said he is not confident about his english.

When we met he asked me for my name and offered some food at the school party while he was serving tables (language school, he had a party with food), when we met after a while I got near him and another girl, they let me choose a song etc

We had a long convo about a cultural thing and Japan and he seemed attentive, smiled and he was mirroring my body language too, eye contact etc

After that he walked me outside and asked me for my Ig and number, then he said bye. The conversation lasted a lot and we talked 2 hours or so, we were some of the few people who didn't go to bed lol it was 1 am

All students from language school went to a bar last Tuesday and he ran after me and stopped me to say, asked me if I was going scuba diving etc

I said maybe but today I realized I couldn’t go (period came randomly lol) so I told him but he loves swimming so he decided to go anyway before he told me.

The same night he invited me to go to the beach and there was also another guy he met there. He asked me about what tv shows I liked and I said South Park so he googled it and checked it out.

We had a barbecue at the school and initially, he only said hi etc, he talked with other people then he sat close to me and we talked and seemed cool. He made me choose a song and asked me about my music taste. He also patted me on the shoulder randomly but idk what it means, it can't be anything

I noticed sometimes he is hesitant and I asked him if he wanted to sit outside and he said no because it was cold (lol wut) then he saw me getting a cup of ice cream and he picked the spoon for me because I forgot, told me about he saw when he visited Italy (I am Italian but I am living abroad atm).

I stood very close and felt the urge to put my arm around him but I didn’t because I didn’t want to seem weird, then he went to talk with other people.

I see sometimes he stands around me and generally he is friendly but I have seen that he is less shy when he speaks Japanese and more confident but quieter when speaking in English.

I remember the first time we met he asked me if I did sport because I am fit and when the topic of relationships came up he said he is single etc and asked me If I have ever been in love. The topic came up because we overheard it while two people were talking about Japanese culture, I was quite surprised when he said people have to be in an official relationship to kiss, etc

He mentioned he had a girlfriend in the past but I misunderstood and he cleared it up by saying he did but now he doesn't have one, I said I never had a boyfriend too. He asked me if I have been in love and we talked a bit about the topic.

Some things make me think he likes me in general but some are confusing lol

Also recently I was supposed to go for dinner with one girl and her other 3 guys joined and I sat at the same table as him. He talked a lot and I pushed him on the arm and he did it back, he liked my earrings and touched my backpack before asking if the brand was popular in Italy.

Yesterday I noticed he saw around me without speaking or saying much but he smiled at me often. Sometimes if I looked at him he looked away quickly, I couldn't tell if he was looking at me or another girl. He is nice to everyone but idk, I even suspected he liked her instead because everytime I looked at him he looked away or behind me where the girl was. This happened a few times.

He is helpful and sends me random messages to tell me random stuff like do you know that supermarket, he also told me he goes to the gym at the residence where I am now

Yesterday we were at a party but I was not feeling it because I was tired and I was busy all week. I gave him some glances, sometimes he smiled or sometimes he looked away or we talked a little.

I said bye and left early but when I got outside he followed me and asked me why. I jokingly asked if he missed me and he said yeah and smiled so I told him to come to visit me here where I am.

In general, I noticed he has trouble looking at me and he is always looking around the room, glances at me quickly then looks away. Also I noticed sometimes he just leave without saying anything but he asks if I am coming to events (schools activities etc)

I flirted on a text by asking if he missed me with the tongue and wink emoji and respond by asking back if I missed him, more emoji or also when I said he come to see me more clothes on (we were discussing shopping).

He has texted me first mostly every 2-3 days but the last few times I did first to ask if someone else was coming to an activity etc

I decided to bite the bullet and I asked him if we wanted to hang out because I wanted to get to know him. Initially, he responded in 30 minutes - 1 hr but after that, it became 12-24 hrs, sometimes a few hrs.

He said yes and when but he wasn't particularly enthusiastic (slow short responses), he let me decide if I wanted to dinner or walking around etc but his response was so slow it turned me off.

I just said I couldn't make it, I canceled and said see you soon but neither tried to reschedule.

Is it possible I misunderstood and he was just friendly? I know dating is seen as serious in Japan and they don't kiss until it is official, you have to confess bla bla but

TLDR: Guy acts weird around me and sometimes acts like he likes me but sometimes he avoids eye contact, acts weird, asked him out and didn't seem too excited, I felt turned off",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzxri7/did_i_get_my_hopes_up_for_nothing/

73,nzy08r,1623707415,am i in the wrong for seeing a few girls before forming a relationship with one of them?," In the past, I would fixate on a girl I hadn't even met IRL, and when I got rejected or stood up for whatever reason I would make myself even more depressed than I already am. So, I changed tactics lately, and decided I wouldn't limit myself to one girl, and talk to a few and see who I got the furthest with. I met this girl online, and she was gorgeous. Probably the most attractive girl who'se ever given me the time of day. She was very flirty, our messages were pretty sexual, but she was more than a sex object in case thats what you're thinking. Anyway, she lives a while away and has been busy, so I said we should meet later on in the summer. In the meantime, I also happen to notice this other girl who is mnuch closer to me comments on my picture, we arrange a date. Aftre rit, despite texting to say she'd let me know when she was free, she ignored my texts, and I felt a bit down. For whatever reason, when I told the previous girl I was feeling down and she asked why, I decided to be honest. She acted cool about it, the day after howver, she spontaneously asked me to delete the nudes she sent (fair enough) and said she wanted to be friends and felt like she didn't just want to be an ""option"" for me. Am I in the wrong here, or is shse just being picky? As far as I'm concerned, its not as if I actually ever committed to a relationship with either, it's pretty casual, and I did tell the previous girl (the one who now just wants to be friends) that I liked her more, its just I wanted to experiment before hand and I couldn't turn down the opportunnity to get out an dsee this other girl. (i've been depressd for a long time, and i don't really have anyone to do anything with). So it kind fo feels I'm back to square one now, I lost two girls in the space of a short time, there'\[s a third girl who I actually met today, but she lives further away, and is quite unpredictable, like she's cancelled on me 3-4 times before this, albeit she had somewhat good reason. However, I don't see much of a future for us. So am I being a dick, or is she just not comfortable with it personally? I don't think she's bad or anything, maybe its jsut her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzy08r/am_i_in_the_wrong_for_seeing_a_few_girls_before/
74,nzy1pa,1623707525,New guy I’m seeing is nervous to have sex with me and I don’t know what to do,"Hey guys, I (28f) don’t have a lot of experience dating because I was in a long term relationship and I’ve been single for about 4 years because I just haven’t found someone who is worth the time and effort. Sorry if this is a little long, and I made this new account so this isn’t linked to my main. 

I recently got back into the dating scene since rona is dying down a bit and I’m vaccinated. I met a guy (34m) and it is such a relief to finally find someone I’m interested in getting to know and date. We’ve been going on dates and spending time with each other for about 2 months. 

I’m naturally a very sexual person, especially when I like someone, so after the third date is was ready to get it in. I suggested Netflix and chill and he was down for it. I get there and we’re just cuddling watching the movie and he’s not making a move. I got tired of waiting and tried to initiate like a make out session twice and both times he stops and goes back to watching the movie. I leave his house that night super confused and feeling so rejected like he’s not attracted to me. 

Over text I’ll suggest sexual things and what I want to do to him and for him to do to me and he’s all for it over text. We’ll even go out to dinner and talk about like past hooks ups or embarrassing stories and talk about what we like sexually so it’s not like we haven’t talked about it or he’s like secretly a virgin or something. 

This past weekend we planned to go out and for me to spend the night at his house. Like I knew it was going down and he did too. We go out, have some drinks, kissing all night and just having a good time. We get back to his house, I’m still a little tipsy and he puts on a movie. I was READY to fuck this guy, so I wait like 10 minutes into the movie and make my move. 

We’re making out and I go down on him, we even started to have sex on the couch and I’m loving it. It only lasted for about 5 minutes, but we didn’t have a condom since it was a little spontaneous so I suggested we go up stairs. 

**a little nsfw** 

I’m literally riding him telling him all this and talking about I want to taste him, I want his cum on my face, I want him to fuck me in his bed and he’s saying yes to everything. So I hop off and practically run up the stairs to get in position on his bed. He comes up and says he’s gonna find the condoms in his bathroom and will be right back. 

He comes back and says I have something I want to tell you. At this point I’m confused and literally just want this man to rearrange my organs. He says I’m sorry I don’t know if I can continue because I’m so nervous. I don’t want to disappoint you and then you tell all your friends I can’t perform(which I would not do, literally why I’m posting here so my friends don’t know). I’m confused, horny, but I also know I need to be understanding because this is still so new I still have things I need to learn about this man. I say ok and am left feeling undesired. 

I’ll be honest that I think I know what it is, I’m a little out of his league. It’s something he’s mentioned and I know it because I’m not dumb, I have eyes. But I don’t care about that, I like this guy, I’m attracted to him, and I’m horny as fuck. 

I’m not used to this kind of experience, I get a lot of male attention so if I wanted sex I could go out and get it. It’s like the one guy I want to fuck doesn’t want to fuck me and it’s ruining my self esteem. 

I need help in navigating this situation to be conscious of his needs while also not feeling like I’m disgusting. I don’t want to pressure him, but I also have needs after this pandemic.

Whenever I meet a guy that I click with....I am usually enamored and believing that I met the love of my life within 2 weeks. But then I end up with a broken heart whenever it doesn’t work out (I.e., being ghosted, friend zoned, or the relationship just fizzles out). I have only been in one serious relationship so far in my life and that only lasted for about five months.

Let me give you a sense of my dating habits: 

I met a guy during March of last year. Let’s call him Mike. Mike and I we were declaring ourselves a couple in April even though the only interaction we had were text messages and Factime dates. When we finally had our first in-person date, we said “I love you” and by Memorial Day weekend, we were having sex. By July, I even offered to move in with him because I was trying to overcompensate from not being able to see him on a regular basis while he was stationed in the national guard. Things then fizzled out by August for various reasons and then a week after that breakup, I met a recovering alcoholic named Luke. I became fast friends with Luke and thought I was in love with him and still think I am in love with him. Luke tells me that he is not ready for a serious relationship right now and I willing to respect his boundaries. But as soon as he told me that, I contacted Mike to get back together but that only lasted a week because I was reminded of the reasons we broke up and I realized that I was still not over Luke so I thought that would be unfair to date Mike when  I wasn’t.

Things were going great, there was nothing we didn't share with each other. We even confessed super strong feelings for each other, FaceTime sex a bunch, the whole nine yards. We both ""could not wait to be together"". In my eyes it's definitely happening. 

Then, about a couple weeks before we were to meet, I noticed her acting differently. No more words of affirmation, took longer for her to text back. Phone calls were super quiet. I called her out on it but she just assured me ""she was going through an introvert spell"" and ""nervous about meeting but still wants to be with me and I make her so happy"". Well, the day finally comes. The entire time she looked uncomfortable. She was on her phone a lot. Demeanor was a little cold. And I was clearly upset. That was a few days ago. 

Now she tells me ""I want to get to know you better and I think I want to start off as friends and go from there. I was drunk when I said I love you. You can't tell me you really thought it wouldn't be different from FaceTime to meeting IRL. Basically we should be starting over"". 

And no, she did not indicate having that opinion before we met so I had no warning. Even though I guess there is always that chance that you won't click regardless of what you say. I'm pretty bummed.

TLDR: I met up with a guy who made me feel like we would be a thing. We had sex and he ghosted. I feel worthless now. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. A pretty popular athlete DM'd me a few months ago asking me to help him with a side business he was working on (my instagram is a mixture of my work in branding and my personal pics)
2. As the months went on we were texting everyday and he told me he wanted to date me, and that we would be a great couple, and how beautiful I am, and how he can't wait to see me. We never ended up talking business it was definitely like a talking/texting stage. 
3. We tried to meet up a few times but he either ghosted the day of or plans fell through. ie I was supposed to fly see him (he got me a ticket) and then the day of he just ghosted. 
4. After he would ghost I would get mad, kinda blow up his phone on how rude it is, he would apologize and say he would make it up to me. We went through this cycle 3-4 times. 
5. Finally I was fed up of the ghosting and told him it was draining to me. He promised me he'd make it up to me and to come see him and he'd personally pick me up from the airport. 
6. Last Friday, I flew to his city, he picked me up from the airport, checked me into a swanky hotel. On the way from the airport he kept saying how I would be ""his girl"", how I should learn how to cook his favorite dishes if we are going to be together, he kissed me in the car etc etc. He is a pretty big name and he just walked into the hotel with me, people were staring at us etc. I felt wanted and excited.
7. We had a night filled with sex and I think we both had a great time. He kept saying how great of a time he had. Note: He didn't ask me any questions about myself, pretty much spoke about himself only. 
8. He slept over and the next morning he said he had a workout and he'd be back. 
9. He never came back, he just left me at the hotel. I texted him a bunch of times and he said he was coming, but then after noon he just stopped responding. Total GHOST. But he was posting to social media. 
10. My flight was that evening and I just ubered to the airport and left, he totally didn't say bye or a word to me. I got pretty upset and told him how hurtful it was that he wouldnt say bye. 
11. The next day he responded ""sorry I had a great time, sorry my workout ran late and I got busy"" 
12. Later that day he unfollowed me on social media
13. I texted him what was wrong and he hasn't responded. 

Was this all just for that one night? Did he see me and wasn't interested. I feel like so hurt, I feel insecure, I feel like I wasn't pretty enough to his liking. I just feel super ashamed that I got swept up in the fantasy. 

For context: this guy has many children with many different women. he is single.

85,nzz4y5,1623710568,Shy family oriented girl or not interested?,"So I've been crushing hard on a coworker for a few months but have been mixed about her since day one. I kinda developed a fantasy version of her, but over the months have been able to dispell the fantasy and focus on the real her. I made some mistakes in the past such as asking for the 2nd date that she pay for us since I paid the 1st which got her to be flakey. Over the months our communication with one another (we work remotely for the same company) was on and off. During this last weekend we spoke on the phone and she opened up more apologizing being flakey, admitting she is super family oriented and is obligated to do stuff with extended family and family, and they do things often and to give her a heads up for a date/hang out at least a couple of weeks in advance so she could ""try"" to free up her schedule and not blow off her family members. So I told her I'd hit her up soon which I did and she told me she'd let me know sometime this week.

She has also opened up about her dating past and has mentioned that when she starts to fall for a guy who treats her with respect, surprise surprise, he's gay, has a gf etc. So she's been burned before. I notice she's NEVER complimented me this entire time but is super receptive of my attention and compliments. Is she worried about being flirty and not working out? I'm just curious. 

Lastly the biggest reason why I like her is she is totally different. On past posts I've pointed out that she hardly post stuff about herself on social media, she doesn't seek male validation. She may not be the hottest girl and lack curves but her smile, her kind nature, being raised in a 2 parent home growing up, being close to her dad, has me gaga over her, I'd rather go for this goofy, kind, short version of Olive Oyl (think Popeye the Sailor's girl) over a smoke show with a Jessica Rabbit build who constantly seeks out attention and cat calling I see so prevalent in today's dating market.

We were both mutual and I may have pushed a little, brought her coffee and stuff. Talked a lot. At the end of the relationship she just said she 'Didn't want a relationship.' But then goes to get a relationship with someone else. Why not say 'I DIDNT WANT A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.' And i probably would have been a lot better. 🙁",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzzn3s/i_dont_want_a_relationship/

92,o008lf,1623713857,I feel like I depend too much on other people to satisfy me.,"I went to a bar with my friends after my toxic and mentally abusive boyfriend and I broke up for the final time about three months ago. It was a relationship I worked hard to move on from that was not good for me at all. Even though I was sad at the time I was really happy for it to be over and I could enjoy myself.
It was so much fun and one of my friend’s guy friends actually ended up coming along later on throughout the night. I guess because I was there, he was so excited to meet me because he had seen me on my friend’s Instagram account before and thought I was cute. After we left the bar, he asked me if we could hangout later and get to know each other better because he thought I was really pretty and fun. This was so flattering to me and made me feel amazing when just a few weeks before that, I felt sad over someone who treated me so poorly. We started texting a lot and talking on the phone and making plans to hangout and I felt like I really liked this person. I do travel a lot for work so I couldn’t immediately hangout with him and he would get mad at me. When I would make plans he would go to bars instead with his friends and said it was because I don’t commit to any of his plans (which he plans while I am on business travel). I don’t want to bother him anymore but it hurts feeling alone like this, why do I cling on to all these people and allow them to make me feel this way? Being alone is scary for me and makes me feel so depressed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o008lf/i_feel_like_i_depend_too_much_on_other_people_to/
93,o009xd,1623713966,Relationships that happen naturally in person vs relationships that start over social media.,"I want some opinions on this, I'm curious as to what the majority of people think is the best relationship. I've thought a lot that the best way a relationship to start would be to have a face to face interaction in an environment thats naturally occurring like at the gym or school or something. The thought of seeking love online seems... idk lazy? Not natural, not genuine? It seems like it doesn't have the spark that seeing ""that one person"" in person. I feel like starting something over your phone has less likelihood of working idk im not an experienced relationship person as in I haven't been in many of them. But I can say the ones I was in, started from personal interaction, not the internet.

95,o00ihc,1623714689,I am very heartbroken and lost. Please read and help me if you can,"I am 22 F and he is 22 M. We met online  without any intention of dating or sexuality. Just two random internet strangers. We live in different countries. With time we both shared a lot with each other. Our lives, families, mental issues etc. We even told the things that we are afraid to confess to ourselves. We facetimed and talked everyday, for hours. Called each other and cried together. The way he looks at me - I can't even explain. So caring, gentle, smiling eyes even when he is super sad. His eyes are full of love. When he thinks he said something wrong (he never does) he gets teary and even cries because he thinks he hurt me. He doesnt do it to get my attention, he is geniuenly afraid of losing and hurting me. He constantly tells me how much he likes me and how much I mean to him. He says that it is not just liking and his feelings for me are way more than feelings for a regular friend. He says he wants me and he gets scared of how much he wants me. He gets extremely happy when I text him. He gives me so much from his time. So do I. As time passed, we started sexting (we cant meet yet irl but we are planning to very soon, I told him that I cant promise any sex when we meet, he was totally okay with it). We didnt label our relationship (mutual desicion). The thing is, he is in love with another girl. Recently I told him he is special to me after him telling me I am so important for him. As a response he said ""You mean so much more than you think you do. It is not just liking you as a friend anymore, it is more than that. But I love X, you know that"".  He loves her (X) so much that it hurts him very deeply. I am very lost. I am afraid of falling for him (I already am and I am very scared). Because it is a dead end, but we both need each other right now. I stopped sexting too. Right now while I am writing these, he fell asleep talking to me on facetime. I start crying when I see his face there, looking at me with all that care and warmness. I hate that I am the one who comforts him when he cries over the girl he loves. I hate myself for feeling this way because that girl seems so great. I can't leave him. He needs me right now. Please someone tell me what to do and how to feel about this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o00ihc/i_am_very_heartbroken_and_lost_please_read_and/
96,o00pgw,1623715294,Can I get your thoughts on this ?,"So I went through some hard times earlier this year lost a close family member. Anyways I was in a deep depression for a couple months and now I kind of been feeling a lot better lately and in a better mood, so I started trying to get myself out there , got a first date and everything but idk why the day of the date I just wake up in this depressed state of being and just kinda bummed out , even though I was excited for the date , this wave of depression just kinda came out of nowhere . So what’s the correct thing to do , I still went on the date and tried to stay as positive as I could I think it went Ok but idk I feel like maybe some of the depression vibes might of slipped through the cracks . The girl was actually very chill but I don’t know if there will be a second ima try but who knows . Would it have been better to just cancel and meet a different day , I’m trying real hard to overcome this depression and I think just staying home and avoiding everything wouldn’t help, what you guys think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o00pgw/can_i_get_your_thoughts_on_this/
97,o00pxw,1623715333,Need some input .,So me 24(m) and my fiancé 25(f) met when I was 17 in my early stages of boiling testosterone and just you know running around doing what young males do and she came over to my house we did the dirty but after being with her that night realized she wasn’t my type so of course I did what all young males do . Just don’t respond after . Well maybe 2 months go by and she sends me a picture of a sonogram (I think that’s what they are called) and it had her name on it in the corner so I knew it was legit and she wasn’t pulling the come back routine females run to after something like that happens it showed a child  and date conceived well I did the math it matched up but I was still in total denial and denied the possibility of the child being mine . Anyways she didn’t say too much after but obv I kept In touch anywho few months go by I met this girl one year younger than me we clicked immediately personality seemed to be a perfect match for mine . We dated about 6 months then Nicole (my current fiancé mentioned first ) had the child and obv I went there my girlfriend at the time was mad but kind of had understanding . Anyways 6 months after that I get a paper in the mail demanding a dna swab she’s going for child support . So I comply for up there take it and few weeks later 99.99999% my child . So I made the decision to drop everything and go be with her and my child a year goes by . We just argue all the time nonstop and she hates everything I enjoy even doesn’t like my brother coming over . So we fall out on that she moves away to Alabama with her dad without saying anything . I just come home to nothing but a mattress on the floor . And I was so depressed for awhile . It shook me way harder then I could have ever imagined. For reference at this time I had not been the best either as in having random old friends that do drugs over I was always out cheating as well . She had her suspicions. But anyways after a couple weeks of her gone I’m begging for her to come back which is something that is odd for me because never in a million years could I see myself doing that but there I was pride out the window just begging . She came back . Everything was fine for maybe a month then boom right back to it except her leaving was like a wake up call to me I stopped hanging around bad so called friends and stopped cheating haven’t even looked at any other girl since but it was like we were roomates we’d have sex maybe twice a month because we wasn’t always feeling it . She stil hates when inhang with my brother and won’t do anything I enjoy like the river fishing hunting camping but expects me to go do things that she likes which is like going to her family’s in Alabama and stuff anyways at present time we have 3 kids and nothing has changed it just feels toxic and I can’t just leave she has no way to support these kids and wouldn’t ever let me see them if we split . And also I’m scared of feeling the way I did when she left the first time . I’ve tried everything to change the mood for us even proposing but nothing last longer than a week and it’s back to being but hey about everything is there any advice on this or anything I could try .

98,o011uc,1623716416,My(19f) boyfriend (23m) says he cares about me but he doesn't really show it. I feel like I might need to break up with him but I want to stay on good terms because of our cat.," 

We've been dating for about 9 months now and he says he cares about me and so I know that he does but with my past(abuse) it is really hard to acknowledge that he does care about me when he is not showing it. He plays lots of video games and I have had multiple conversations with him saying that I don't feel like I'm getting enough attention and he'll say that he is trying and I'll see that he is trying maybe that day and the next few days but it never lasts. 

I need more support from him but I'm just not sure if he can provide that for me because he is busy playing games or just doing something else, it seems like he just wants to keep me around but without putting in the effort. I care about him a lot and I love him and we had plans to move into an apartment together in the fall (with roommates) since we go to the same college and we are sharing a cat. I got the kitten for my birthday but it was at his apartment so it's like ours and I know he is attached to the cat and I don't want to just take him away but I'm not sure if the relationship will work and I don't know what to do.

He does have depression so I understand that he does need some time to himself but he just doesn't seem to talk to me much and will disappear for hours playing video games sometimes, which is really hurtful because I am his girlfriend and he should want to talk to me and feel comfortable opening up to me. I have tried to let him know that I am there for him and want him to tell me how he is feeling but I also know he has trouble even knowing how he feels sometimes.

I asked him why it's so hard to have a conversation most of the time and he said ""I just don't like doing conversations over text or snap they don't feel like they hold any significance""

I replied with ""That's fair I just do wanna talk to you more and if we can't call then that's what I wanna do, but if that is the case can we try to make it a routine to actually call?""

He replied ""I mean calling every day is just a lot though, even every other day can be a bit much sometimes""

To which I said ""That kinda sounds like you don't really enjoy talking to me then""

And he said ""No?""

This to me really seems like he would prefer not to talk to me and he says no so I don't understand

Tl,Dr: my boyfriend isn't putting in visible effort to show me that he cares and it's hurting me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o011uc/my19f_boyfriend_23m_says_he_cares_about_me_but_he/
99,o019f0,1623717085,If a guy doesn't text you is he just not serious?,"I (25F)matched with a guy (26M) off hinge about 6 months back. We weren't talking that consistently for the first month but after that we were. First month was just teasing each other in the dms till I finally gave him my number after feeling more comfortable. He wanted to go on a date with me while I wanted to call first before meeting up in person but ultimately he didn't wanna call cus he wasn't comfortable/ didn't want to put expectations before meeting. I wasn't comfortable meeting cus of covid and all the cases so I told him let's meet when things calm down. We had an online friendship for the past 3 ish months where we just talked over snap and texted a few times (but convo would last for a few weeks and a few replies a day). We would just text about random stuff and tease nothing too serious. 

Anyways, things have calmed down and he hasn't asked me out yet/doesn't text me. We recently became each other's best friends on snap for about 3 weeks now. He usually teases me over snapchat and I've dropped hints numerous times that I don't like talking over snapchat and he knows I like text better. Anyways, I ended up telling him that I was a little annoyed with him cause he doesn't listen to what I like(referring to him not following through with the communication method I like which is texting). He just replied with smh and that was that. Kind of a red flag to me but think maybe I should just move on and explore other options instead of hope for him to take note of what I like which is the bare minimum.

Let me know what you guys think please!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o019f0/if_a_guy_doesnt_text_you_is_he_just_not_serious/
