I guess maybe both. I fully understand it’s better to go for it than have regret that I didn’t but I can’t seem to put into practice and it’s really getting me down.

So I’ve (F24) been told by a number of people that I need to get myself out there and start dating. People are saying to me that I need to learn what’s out there and know what I like. 

I would really love a partner myself and I do long to be in a loving relationship but starting to think I’m actually not ready for it ). 

Honestly my life isn’t in the best of places and I’m worried about communication and being there for someone like they deserve  and honestly just feels like a lot of energy for me( I have chronic fatigue ) right now . I also feel like I do know what I want, I’m not saying I’m completely aware of what’s out there but I have learnt a lot of things through seeing other people. I’m incredibly observant and the friend a lot of people come to for advice with dating and relationships even though I have no experience. 

The thought of dating right now makes me sick as I feel like I have so much to sort out in other areas of my life, but if I’m being honest I think it might always feel like this and I will never date if I think like this . I don’t know if this is just fear and me trying to protect myself or if I should just go for it?

4,qqlu0w,1636517571,Texting girls frustrates me a lot," I’m in college and like most guys, I want to meet girls and have fun, but the whole dating game is very frustrating. Let me explain, I don’t really have a lot of trouble getting girls interested in me, or at least I think so, I meet girls in different settings clubs/bar, school, friend groups etc… My only problem is that once the relationship goes online, and I have to “convince” them to see me again, I often just end up never hearing back from them again. And this is from girls that were initially interested in me. This whole process is incredibly frustrating and makes me want to delete snapchat and stop trying to get girls for good. The thing is that I don’t chase girls like the typical college guy, but still when I meet girls that I like, I would like to see them again, but it never leads anywhere. I feel like I am confronted with two options: either change the way I approach girls online or just stop trying at all and if they come they come. I also have to add that I also hate conversing with girls through text because it totally drags me out of whatever I am doing at the moment and it puts me in a state where I’m wondering what/when/if she will answer me instant of just being present.

6,qqlznx,1636518111,Is a date five days after breakup too soon?,"So me and my ex had been on and off. Mostly off for three years. After finally thinking “yes this is it, this time he’s ready to be with me” well We dated for 5 months and then he checked out of the relationship… again. I fought for it so much but I was no longer validated, and he had no emotions towards me at all. He broke up with me but took it back right away. For two weeks after that, he was cold, distant and just didn’t seem to care about me. So I left him. 

I feel like I already grieved this relationship a long time ago. I broke up with him Saturday Feeling nothing else but extremely unhappy and empty, every love and hope was gone. I went out with some friends Sunday night to eat ramen and at the bar we sat next to this guy. We joked around when we accidentally touched elbows and when I got ramen on him because I’m a messy eater apparently. He made me feel some butterflies with our jokes and we have the same humor. To be quite honest, it felt like I was on a date with this guy. Well I gave him my number, and he invited me on a date Friday. It feels weird because it’s so soon, I literally broke up with someone who I thought I was going to marry because he checked out and didn’t want to be with me. I broke up with my best friend and my soul mate and now I feel some butterflies for someone else and suddenly I’m thinking about saying yes to a date just a few days later? It almost feels like I’m cheating. I loved this man and I wasn’t planning on going on a date with someone for months just like before but I have this awesome connection and it makes me feel guilty.

9,qqmcjy,1636519441,My online dating conundrum,"I've been single for about a year and a half and have been on Tinder, Bumble, and one other dating app since then. I get a decent amount of matches. When I first became single, I was hitting up a lot of girls with witty, clever, and calculated conversations. It would work (sometimes; I'm not a Greek God or anything) and I would get their numbers/Instagrams/Snapchat. 'Cool, it's working I thought to myself. I listened to advice from Reddit and attempted to get a date in the air as fast as possible. 'Cool' again I thought.

Fast forward to the date. I do NOT like them. We have nothing in common and it feels like a chore talking to them. I've learned nothing about these people beforehand and if we are even somewhat of a match. Out of the 4 girls I've been on IRL dates with I haven't had so much as a movie in common to talk about.

Well, this makes sense because I didn't get to know them through conversations beforehand, I think to myself. Maybe I should take my time and get to know the person before meeting in person, my current approach of being a stand-up comedian online is exhausting anyway.

Now I just straight-up message girls and start small talk. Sometimes it will go well, we'll have a normal conversation and I'll flirt a bit and get their number. But then as I try to get to know them their replies dwindle and then eventually stop replying. It's so weird because we'll call each other cute, have pretty decent back and forths, but they will eventually lose interest. I'm not ugly or anything, I posted myself on r/amiugly and got ratings of 7-8's and people telling me I have nothing to worry about and that I was cute. Which only made me more confused about what I'm doing wrong.

I don't remember why we fought last time but I decided to delete everything I ever sent him and he got mad and started calling me names and drawing conclusions that aren't true. I didn't address his false conclusions and blocked him instead when I saw the names he called me. He did it in the past but this was unforgivable especially since it's something that hits hard. I can't think about him now without hearing him call me a specific name. I can't look at myself in the mirror without hearing that name. It hit home badly...... but Then I unblocked him because I missed him - but I didn't text him. He just sits there in my phone. We are extremely toxic and this isn't good and we are never Going anywhere, we are incompatible on so many levels, but I'm also a lonely person sometimes and some attention from someone I somewhat developed an emotional connection to felt good....

Relationship started to fall apart because she was relying on me to fix her mental issues. I'm a strong believer that your issues are your own and it's not your partner's job to work them out with you. Eventually, I became tired as I have my own set of issues I'm working out in therapy. This resulted in the romantic feelings towards my ex to fade, she became a dependent, not a romantic partner. Just bought a house and she wanted an amicable divorce, tried couples counseling but it was too far gone. I agreed and decided to accept it and mutually part ways. She was still living in our house, until I could close and solely take possession of the house. She was becoming close with a guy I was friends with at work. My friend tipped me off that they might be hooking up, but I asked her and she said no. This past weekend my curiosity got the better for me and I needed to know. I drove over to his house to hear my ex moaning and being screwed. So I walked in the front door and caught them in the act. My ex didn't seem to understand the problem, yes, marriage was over but nothing has been filed in court yet and she still lived the house. And of all people she chose a person I work with and have to interact with on a daily basis. That night, I told her to take her stuff and move out the next day, which she did. I find myself angry at the situation because I still consider it cheating, but had it been anyone else, like someone I don't know, I wouldn't be mad. Now, I'm relieved for a few reasons. 1. She's out of the house and I can start to heal. 2. Her mental issues are not for me to solve anymore. 3. The guy has a small wee wee, like real small.

15,qqna8y,1636522864,"Biggest Surprise of My Life When it Came to Women, and Will Help Guys Starting Out &amp; Looking For a Relationship","I am now 26, and I need to go back to when I was 17 to begin. And to begin with, I should mention while my dad works for a major corporation there were and are several medical professionals in my family and sprinkled throughout my relatives. My mother is an RN, and two of her sisters are as well, and I now have two sisters who have become RN's. This fact about nursing is paramount to my experiences. When I was 17  I did well in my high school studies and there were two things I wanted to do in my life back then: Travel around the world and have a career somewhere within STEM. Through high school, while I would never grace a cover of GQ, I never worried about my looks, as I did date and did have a couple of girlfriends. I am a bit athletic and did play both hockey and baseball, now it's mainly CrossFit along with Fall basketball and Summer softball. As I was in the summer leading into, and looking forward to my senior year I expressed to one of my RN aunts my desire to travel, but how since traveling cost big bucks? And from her, and for the first time ever, I heard the term, travel nurse. Go anywhere in the country as a nurse, get paid serious money, have your housing (hotel) paid for while you worked wherever it was you had gone. And the best part she told me was this, you can get your nurse's license in two years through a junior college. Since my mother and her sisters all had at least bachelor's degrees, this also was news to me. However, I looked into this throughout that summer and discovered I could in fact just after two years not only gain a nursing license, but at the age of 20 I could walk into a nursing job here in Boston that paid just a tick under 40k to start. A year later I was waiting to begin nursing school at a local junior college, and through the help of my mother that summer, I was hired as a part-time orderly at her teaching hospital. And that is when my eyes began to open to the possibilities of what it meant to be a straight guy in the world of 90% women. Because once I began working as an orderly and it was known I would be going to school for nursing, a number of female nursing students, nurses, and yes both female medical students and doctors (medical students &amp; doctors once I was a nurse) and others in other departments at the hospital once it was understood I was straight became friendly and I soon found myself becoming popular. And even before I reached 21 and could join others for drinks no guy gracing a GQ cover could have had more picks or done better in dating.  And once having graduated and passed my boards, I was hired by my hospital for the ER/ED night shift. And I was straight up told, I was hired  because they wanted more of a male presence in the ER at night. Seventy-year-old security guards and maybe one other male staff nurse or orderly were never enough, especially on weekends. Anyway, I remained in the ER for nearly two years for the experience before finally making the move to becoming a travel nurse. And at the age of 23, I pulled down 120k in salary. The downside is, no real benefits beyond the pay. And in the end, this is what I have learned. 

1. Being a straight and single guy as a nurse is very appealing to many women, but you do have to shrug off the idea that some will believe your gay or bi-sexual. There is no good in getting mad over it, as you will become mad fifty times a year if  you don't just let it wash off your back.
2. You will be mistaken for a doctor or medical student every single day.
3. Even as a 19 or 20-year-old nursing student, if you just remain a guy, not nasty or a pansy, just be a regular guy, then other nursing students as well as nurses and other women in the various medical fields will be attracted to you. You will have a field full of choices on who to date. 
4. Maybe by the time you graduate nursing school you will find yourself being proposed marriage to at least once. But beware of such proposals, as that girl just might see you as being one of the items off her bucket list. You can, if my experience is anything to take as normal also expect to be proposed to once you are a nurse as well. And, again, be very careful and wise when this happens. You can simply as I said, be no more than a bucket list item. 
5. You will discover when your 19-23 not only will other nursing students and nurses want to have a relationship with you, but so will girls and women who already have boyfriends, and beyond these, so will those who are engaged to be married, and the married as well. Don't be scum, and let these losers pass.
6. If you ever choose to become a traveler, #5 above becomes even more prevalent in female behavior, as even engaged or married female doctors understand you will be long gone and away for good after a month or two, so they will make the offer of having a tryst while you happen to be at their hospital. And don't think some these women won't give you a going away, remember me by present in the form of some sort STD, and some of permanent kind. I know a couple of male travel nurses who carry such life-long reminders from their travel dalliances.  
7. There will always be a number of 'free spirits' who do not have a boyfriend or husband or who are not engaged and will become interested in you. So, you will never need to bother with the married, almost married or those in a relationship. 
8. And perhaps in the end, something similar that happened to me when I was 25 and working my first week in a New Mexico Hospital ED will happen to you. Because now 19 months ago, a shapely, 26-year-old brown-eyed, brunet beauty who worked at this same hospital as a physician's assistant, and who at age 11 had immigrated from Italy to of all places, Boston, came to the ED for her back to work Covid-19 test after taking vacation back in Boston for a week. A test she was required to have 24 hours before being allowed back to work. I was the one given the task of taking the swab. And once she heard my accent as I greeted her, and told her I would  be taking the swab, this gorgeous vision smiled and asked if I were from Boston. Things for us took off from there. And just so you will know, I now sit a bit south of Boston within the 'TV room' end this writing 12:21am on November 10 while my beautiful Italian wife of now 25 days lays asleep upstairs. So in the end, this is what I say. I never intended nursing as a life-long career, and maybe I will one day end up with a career in STEM, but for the moment, all I know is this; if it were not for my Aunt Pamala telling me about travel nurses and how I would be making nearly 40k right out of junior college, I now offer this same advice to other guys. It is fair pay that only gets better, and offers mobility as well. And if not for heeding my aunt's advice, I would not now be sitting here typing all this out with the biggest smile on my face while knowing the greatest advice I ever received not only saw that at 20, I entered a field that paid well, and not satisfied a good portion of my wanderlust, but led to the greatest gift of my life, and that gift happens to be laying in a bed I hope and expect to be sharing with her for the next fifty to sixty-years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqna8y/biggest_surprise_of_my_life_when_it_came_to_women/

Short guys take me more seriously and I feel like its more of an equal match. Everything is just better.

They also don't make me feel uneasy and make weird comments about my size.

24,qqo963,1636526700,"Avoiding being ""just a friend""?","I am looking for some advice for a new relationship I'm really hopeful for.

About 3 weeks ago my roommate hosted a birthday party for himself and invited some of his friends, who ended up inviting some of their own friends. Early into the party, a girl arrives at the party, and she stuns me. Several hours later and a few drinks later and we both are hanging out in my room, and long story short we end up having sex. The next morning she leaves, and I get her Snapchat.

She messages me 2 days later and strikes up a small conversation. We talk for a few hours, and she eventually says she wants to come over to hang out more and watch a movie. I happily say yes, and she responds ""it's a date then. ❤️"". When the time comes, she says she was feeling under the weather and she cancels the day of. I tell her no worries, but that was 2 weeks ago. I keep trying to plan new dates but she is extremely busy with college and 2 jobs. 

She says there will be a window soon where we will be able to go to my town's local Christmas light show. We chat on Snapchat everyday but I've noticed that her messages have begun getting less and less flirty. I figure I need to go on this date to solidify our sexual relationship, but it's still 2 weeks out. 

So, what should I do? I don't want to stop messaging her for the 2 weeks before our date, but I'm afraid that I'm digging myself a hole into being ""just a friend."". I'm terrified that our time spent in a few weeks is just going to be platonic. Maybe I'm overthinking?

26,qqoj3t,1636527759,Told my FWB that I have a big ass crush on him,"So, I’ve been casually seeing this guy for about 4 months or so. He is seriously the most attractive and sweetest/nicest/introspective/smart dude. I should have probably figured I was gonna get a mad crush on him. 

I met him on Tinder. I was very upfront about not looking for a relationship, he told me he wasn’t either as he travels for work frequently and probably wouldn’t be in my state in the foreseeable future. So that worked out great.

We’ve seen each other almost every week since then. We don’t overly talk when we are not with each other, I have been so careful about not getting into a relationship or a whirlwind lovebombing/trauma bonding type of situation. I feel like pretty much every dude I casually have dated gets weirdly attached very quickly, and I’ve been caught up in that before. This guy has actually been not doing that. 

But of course, I have a huge crush on him now. I know it wouldn’t work relationship wise- mostly because im not quite in the position to be in a serious relationship right now (actively healing myself and growing as a human from a traumatic past 4 years) he obviously travels a lot and won’t be in my state forever, and im considering moving out of state in a year as well. 

But it was just getting so overwhelming. Like, we are friends with benefits. And friends now, I would say. Our sex and chemistry is fucking ridiculous. We are both incredibly attracted to each other. So yeah, I finally got the balls to tell him this weekend. I was pretty scared. I was pretty sure that I was gonna get ghosted lol. 

BUT

It actually didn’t go THAT bad. 

I wouldn’t say bad at all actually, it went the best route it could have. 

Basically, he told me that he likes me also but he was hesitant in getting into a relationship with me (his reasons were mine as well lol). I told him I wasn’t trying get into a relationship but more that I wanted to share my feelings with him because they were more than just friendship or sex and I just felt like he needed to know that- I really like him as a human. I guess the point of what I wanted to tell him was that I value him as a person and really like him beyond just our physical chemistry. I know I’m misread frequently and I wasn’t sure if he was just getting sex vibes from me. At the same time, not asking him to be my bf or make shit weird.

I seriously thought that this was bad move on my part. It took me weeks to get the courage to do it. I understand that FWB can get “hairy” and complicated with feelings involved. It was such a relief to tell him that tho finally, honestly I’ve just been holding it in and for some reason, every time I see him I just get vibbbeeesss

So anyways, I think he’s gonna ghost me BUT he ended up continuing talking to me. He’s been texting me MORE actually. 

Then he sent me a song- which he never did before. And maybe I’m looking too into it lol but it was a Spanish song- about being attracted to someone like magnets, and not fighting it, and falling in love…. Also just a great song in general.. but normally when I get sent music it’s because there is a message ..

And I saw him again today, and we hung out and talked for hours. Had amazing sex and napped in each other’s arms. We didn’t bring up anything I said. I guess I’ve been kinda detached in some sense, with my feelings around him. He seemed like he was more open with me than usual, and tryna get me to stay longer. Texted me first thing in the morning to ask if I wanted to spend the day with him. Like I really have tried to hide it But the chemistry between us when we are hooking up is seriously intense, like being in love sex. And the chemistry of us just being near each other, just talking about life and shit, we have a very unique cam, comforting, nice energy wrapped around the two of us and I’m not used that at all. Hence, me even writing this post. 

So yeah, thought I would share my telling my FWB my feelings results lol. Looks I’m still in the game hahahah",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqoj3t/told_my_fwb_that_i_have_a_big_ass_crush_on_him/

The soul has a cruel way of making love seem like the only thing that matters: Life and love in a constant tug of war… until love starts losing ground, making its way towards that balance that’s life. This loss is the real hurdle one in love faces, for he must remember the good times and not give in to the leanings toward despair, or jealousy, or doubt. The love for you is the same but, he must remember that you love him back, even if the signs are vague and fading, not because you are losing love for him, but just letting life push further towards that point.

I’m seeing someone (F49) and that’s extremely complicated. She’s actually my first love from when I was 17-20. My ex wife (40) never met her but knows all about her. I lost my virginity to her we shared a lot of firsts so of course over our 16 year marriage she’s heard of her. When I first told her she lost her shit but then got good with it. She saw herself as a placeholder until I had an opportunity to be with her again. 

She’s from an extremely religious family. She’s shaking up with some Jamaican guy and selling weed out of a flop house. 

Mind you- we had a great life together- we made a lot of money as a team and traveled all over the globe. Now we both are suffering. 

Point is- we both know stuff about each other that’s capable of destroying each other. But we’re still an open book for each other. Largely because we keep secrets that no one else could know and we both need someone to bounce things off of. 

Don’t get me wrong- we are not friends. If we had to be in the same room together for any amount of time - it would not end well. Yet we trust each other and keep each other’s secret.

30,qqoxhe,1636529396,Is it unethical to be FWB/hookup with an insecure person?,"I (23yr) recently went on a VERY casual date, if one can call it a date at all. I had been talking to this girl (21yr) on Tinder for a couple weeks and it was time we actually met up. It was kind of late when we started planning so I suggested something chill, i.e get food/snacks, smoke, and go to a view. She was really adamant about hanging out at my place, so she came over. A lot of the time she was monologuing about different things about her or about the things she liked, which was fine because I asked her questions that prompted these responses but she didn’t ask me the questions back so it was kind of weird vibes to be on a “date” with someone who doesn’t actually seem interested in getting to know you. I was ready to say sorry and say that I don’t think we’re compatible. However, she texted me right after leaving my house, apologizing for being weird/awkward/overcompensating/nervous. While at the same time having the confidence to call me gorgeous and ask me out on a “proper date”. She also told me that she basically has no friends because she moved here for college and can’t seem to keep friends either (which is something I totally understand and empathize with to an extent). 

I feel SO bad for this girl knowing all this (lack of friends + insecurity in self) but I also don’t want to be doing things out of pity. At the same time, Im trying really hard not to be overly critical of other people and accepting that people have flaws, myself included. I’ve been really critical of my past relationships, so I’m trying to actually give others a chance. I honestly don’t feel like I’m getting relationship vibes from her, but would be down for FWB.

He is very funny, smart, cutely nervous and I do like him. He asked me out on the date and chose the pub, which I was happy with. It was a good night overall. However, he seems insanely cheap despite having a very good job, especially compared to me (he makes like 4x what I do). He grew up in a. Very rich family who have two holiday homes and boats. I think he looks down on me a bit as my family are poor and most live in small council flats.

Rhe pub is about 15 mins walking distance from us both but he chose to drive. I paid for the first round of drinks, he paid for the second. All fine.

He offered me a lift home which I thought was nice, but when he went to the machine to pay, it was £2.40. he had £2.50 but didn't want to put it in in case the machine 'didnt give change' (10 fricken p) I only had my card on me or I'd have paid it.

So he said he was going to try and get through the barrier without paying. Apparently he saw other cars do it. 

Of course it didn't work, and we ended up stuck with a line of cars behind us. He had to go out and pay the machine, which DID give change. But he wasn't happy that he didn't get away with it.

The morning after the first night she told me that I could join them in their tent and I thanked and said no because idk felt weird sleeping in the tent with them either way. We later went for a swim in the nearby lake and the girl who asked me to join them in the tent took my shoulders and pulled herself up on me covering my eyes and making us both fall. The girls then later felt that they couldn't sleep on the hard ground another night so we moved the tents to that girls house 

Me and my guy friend put the tents outside and we all went in to watch the matrix. Everyone except me fell asleep and the girls fell asleep on each others heads and after a while the girl who asked me to sleep in their tents woke up because her parents came home and then we ate marshmallows on the porch and went to bed. The next morning I woke up to  the girl yelling my name from the porch and she had made breakfast for us and with us it was only me her and her friend whilst the other dude was left outside we later packed everything up and went home. 

Now a few months after that we still talk and she shows great interest in the stuff I do in my games and she tells me she sucks at them and I tell her that she isnt as bad as she thinks, she can text me without reason sometimes to just act a bit childish in a cute way and sometimes she vents her stress and anxiety out on me wich is ok.

 I'm kinda starting to like her as shes overall cute and fun to be around, she doesn't have a bf and has never had someone in a serious manner as she said she always felt wrong with most guys and that they never really wanted her because of her personality and mostly only for her body (wich I kinda understand why they did but it's wrong still).

Well either way all that has happened and now recently she responds to videos I post when I play games and such she even joined my army youth program that I'm in doing exercises with me and she talks bad about herself to me directly so I have to mood boost her then she says she sucks at games I play and I always tell her that shes probably better than me as she plays more games than me.

47,qqqyha,1636538226,This girl is an angel. What should I do?,"First of all, I (M19) could be making some grammar mistakes in this text because English isn't my native language, but I will do my best.

There is this girl (F19) in my class, she is from another city/smaller city and she came here to study. 

She really is an angel, if there is one. I have never met a girl like her. She is so nice and soft and girlish, has sweet voice. She is also really friendly to everyone and overall nice person.

I really like her. I am really close with her. We joke a lot and go in caffee together (a lot of times we are joined by others too). In this short period of time (three weeks or so) I have already learned so much about her. She told me many stuff. About her hometown, about what her dad does and stuff like that, about her friends, her ex and only boyfriend she ever had, her girl roomates and a lot about her overall. She almost always walks alongside me and when there is more people, she kind of also tries to be close.

I mean, she knows I like her, and she knows I am shy. I have never had a serious relationship or dated someone. I am afraid that she is looking for someone more attractive, because as I wrote in the beginning, she really is an angel. And I, I would say that I am only a bit higher than average looking, just because I am tall and look strong/manly or whatever.

The only problem is that I am not really sure she is into me being with her. I could be in a friendzone at the moment...

She never replies to my stories on social media or stuff like that and honestly very rarely texts me if it's not for school stuff. And, a well known fact is that if a girl is interested in you she'll do everything in her power to talk to you (online or not). Also there are many guys into her, it's on her to choose. But honestly, I in her eyes I showed as a really nice guy to her.

That is where I am confused... 
We joke, we learn together, we chat, we walk alongside each other, we know so much about each other in this little time period, but at the same time we are not a couple?

What should I do with this girl?
When should I ask her out other than school stuff?
What if she rejects to go out with me?
Where should we even go out?

Please help me because I honestly have no experience dating.

I just wrote this of my chest and I hope this whole makes a story understandable.

51,qqrgkf,1636540259,Woman I'm dating/basically going out with has major issues with sexual imagery...,"I (34M) am dating a woman (36F) who suffered some seriously fucked up problems as a child/teen. She was sexually abused by someone who also took photos/videos of her. She says any evidence was destroyed so there is no way for her to prove this happened. This is obviously the root cause of her trauma and issues I will now discuss. She is also autistic and prone to shutdown moments/bolting which is tied into what I'm about to discuss. She left home at 17 and moved to a different state, we met in the same state this summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been dating for about 3 months now, pretty much on the first date she told me she has undiagnosed autism and is waiting to have this checked out. All of the symptoms are there and it makes sense to me and more importantly to her. This alone wouldn't be an issue for me, I think she is a really sweet person but the more I have got to know her, the more open she has been about her issues. She has said that if she comes across any of the following things, she has a mental shutdown of sorts and has to run away from it. The triggers include: seeing women dressed in revealing outfits, pornography, lingerie billboards/shop facades, lingerie adverts, nudity or sex in films, nudity on album covers or artwork. Any of these makes her shutdown. In fact just this weekend I was browsing my Twitter feed and someone had retweeted a photo of which featured a meme involving a woman in a bra. I wasn't purposefully looking for or at this post but she was next to me on my couch and just got up and stormed out of my apartment. I tried to reason and explain why it happened but she wouldn't accept this. She says if I want to be with her, I too need to avoid the same things that she does. 

Her problems do confuse me at times though, I know she went travelling to Cambodia and India about 5 years ago. She also used to go to quite a few concerts and had a phase of enjoying nightlife. I have no idea how she managed to navigate these things with her issues but to me it seems things must have gotten harder/worse for her since then. 

I have tried to explain to her that I don't look at porn, I like music for the music not any racy album sleeve, I don't hang around in strip clubs and I am a faithful dude. None of this seems to matter, she says that any exploitation of women in the above examples is too much for her. I have asked her to get therapy as a professional might be able to help her find the world more manageable, I even know some good therapists from my working background but she says she has tried therapy in the past and it hasn't worked. Besides this she feels the world is fucked up and she shouldn't have to try and change for it. 

Is there any way I can help her to try and make her life more tolerable and to be able to allow us to continue?

Right now I feel like I am putting myself into a very small box of a life with her and I will have to give up so much whilst she seems done with trying to speak with professionals on this. She so far says she has tried therapy, it doesn't help, and that the world is fucked up and she just wants to be accepted and doesn't want to be limited... it feels like her life right now really is limited although I know this isn't her fault and some of her views (porn etc) I agree with. I understand why she is this way but I just wish there was some way to help her lead a more normal life. 

When things are good they are great, I would like to start a family in the next couple of years and I'm settled in my state. Neither of us have children but I also wonder even if I was able to live within her confines, would they then be applied to raising a child, would her aversions to every day life be passed on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqrgkf/woman_im_datingbasically_going_out_with_has_major/

We started dating again in April and everything was perfect! I really liked him but was secretly terrified to dive in or ask about a relationship. I wasn’t sure it was what I wanted just yet. We dated for 2 1/2 months. I noticed he kinda started to pull away but I feel like I wasn’t showing how I really felt about him, which is what hurts the most and haunts me. 

I went on a trip for 10 days and didn’t see him before I left. He seemed upset but wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. When I got back, I told him I missed him and he seemed super distant and short. Taking forever to text back etc. 

The next week I asked him how his week was and he said he was out of town. I expected to not hear from him again but he wished me a happy birthday a week later then stopped responding to me.

I was confused for months and sad I wasn’t vulnerable enough. He constantly told me he missed me and would try to make plans (I did too, and we saw each other about once a week). I just feel like I didn’t do enough. His vibe seemed to change within a week though. 

Finally I reached out this week (after 4 months) and he told me he’s seeing someone now.  I was gutted. I feel like I lost someone really amazing because I was too nervous to try a relationship.

So Last week (i told him that i noticed he isnt that interested and that its ok but i wont initiate another meeting. He replied and asked me why i would think he is not interested in meeting me again? I told him that i think that is the case because i asked him and he didnt meet me. He then replied with a couple of smiley faces to which i responded by texting „Thats not a real answer tho“ and he said „it wasnt a question“ 

I didnt respond afterwards but checked our chat conversation the next day and realised that he is right. I really didnt ask a question but thought i implied it in the texts?

Now he posted a picture of himself and I was gonna like it at first but then thought maybe I shouldnt as to not seem to eager. But then I thought it’s stupid to play games and not liking it just to not look eager. 

I confuse myself now.
I realize i sound like a 15 year old Teenager (i am not) which makes this even more embarrassing.

She's coming over this Thursday to spend time together. I asked to hang out with her on the weekends, but she says she cannot due to being busy, and prefers to meet up after work on M-Thursday. I have a feeling she does have other options and people she's talking to, so she's kind of figuring out who she wants to be with.

But her behavior when we hook up is very past intimate fuck buddy phases that I'm used to. Most women stay the night but tend to cuddle not as much, the others like to leave after they fuck, and some of them do not like to do hand holding at all.

She swallows, (my experience women do not enjoy doing this unless they actually really like the guy,) holds my hands back tightly when I lead her somewhere, she cuddles a lot, and enjoys snuggling with me.

While I know she has other options, I'm considering giving her the dating status.

So my question is, when do you guys mention what this is? Or at least casually communicate if this is just that; casual or potential for more?

76,qqutpk,1636552080,Am I wrong for wanting to leave my husband after caught him flirting with a “fan”,"I (20F) and my husband (22M) have been together for years, married Dec. 2020, no kids. Up until now, I’ve thought this man is near perfect. Now I think I’ve been blind and regret getting married. Here’s why: 

A couple years ago he came up with a “rule” where he did not want me to add/follow other males on socials, like their pictures or talk to them, no interaction. And he would do the same for me with females. Toxic but okay, I have no problem doing this for him as I am loyal.(I should’ve known the first red flag was when he violated this rule, liking a girls pic 2 days later 🤦🏻‍♀️). 

Anyways, up until now we followed this rule and we were doing great or so I thought. A few months ago I was using his phone when I noticed he had certain activity on his phone that made it quite clear he had been interacting with other females and trying to hide it. That was already weird but it bothered me because it violated the rule he expected me to follow, I felt stupid and played. I wanted to confront him but had no proof and he is a serial denier. So I asked an old friend to text him and test him. He fell for it, and was VERY sneaky about it. I let it go on for about two weeks to see how far he would take it. He was outright flirting, asking her to add him on Snapchat(probs would have gotten worse), lying to me about who he was texting, texting her when I was asleep and at work. At one point I asked him, “would you be upset if I started texting a guy and added him on my socials?” He said he would be livid, he said it’s like cheating. 

We had a big fight, it got ugly. I ended up staying with him because I love him still of course but also for selfish reasons such as I need time to get my own place, I have surgery coming up, etc. Our relationship is very rocky right now, it will never be the same for me, and my love for him has changed. I don’t trust him. I am afraid of what else he has done or will do seeing that he is so good at being sneaky. It kind of feels like I am mentally breaking up while still with him. He disgusts me. 

I know I’m going to get hate about setting him up, but that’s not the point of this post. It was immature but his disrespect for me is far worse. There are so many other horrible, similar things he’s done. I’ve always forgave him but now it feels like I finally see all the red flags I ignored.

80,qqv79f,1636553195,I asked someone out at an inopportune time... What should I do next?,"So, I've been talking to the girl for the past couple of days and we really hit it off over the weekend. So, my plan was to ask her out on Monday. Problem is that during the week she is really busy so we texted a bit on Monday but we were mid conversation and I didn't hear back from her after one of my texts. So, I didn't want to double text her asking her out. I thought maybe she'd respond Tuesday let me be patient.

Anyways, so Tuesday... Tuesday is now the day that I'm going to ask her out. I waited throughout the day for a response but I never got one. Granted she hasn't been on the app since before I sent the last message. The one thing about her is if she hasn't been on the app in a while, she'll literally get on moments after I message her every time. So, I message her last night and she responded really quickly. We had a few messages back and forth but then once again mid convo she doesn't respond... So, I was like screw it let me just get this out of the way and ask her out cause I don't want to wait too long especially if she's talking to other guys.

So, I asked her out. My thought process was: 1. maybe she's been expecting/waiting for me to ask her out and that's why she stops responding half way through our convo 2. she literally always hops on right when I message her so if I ask her out she'll probably jump on the app to respond to that message. Well... that didn't happen. I asked her out last night and still haven't heard from her. I will say she hasn't been back on the app since we were talking yesterday though.

I'm honestly kind of regretting asking her out when I did cause I know she's busy. She told me as much. But I thought that if I sent her that message she'd jump on the app just like she did with my other messages. In retrospect, I should've waited until I had her attention to ask her out cause now I'm sitting wondering when she's going to respond but in all honesty she probably won't until tonight if she does at all.

Anyways, my question is I really enjoyed talking to this girl and want to meet up in person so what should I do next? I was thinking I should give her until tomorrow to respond and then if she doesn't I could text her again about something else and take it from there? I just don't want to leave it where it is because like I said we really hit it off and I know that she's busy so there's a pretty good chance she either hasn't seen the message yet or she's been too busy to respond.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqv79f/i_asked_someone_out_at_an_inopportune_time_what/

90,qqwdsg,1636556651,Got back into dating 3months and is been brutal. 28m,"I started with my friends circle. Got rejected by a girl who I really felt like I had a connection with. Than I had a few friends recommend me online dating. I've probably been on 6 dates. I really worked on my profile and it seemed to be working alright. Most dates I new wasnt going anywhere after the first minute, but I had a 2nd date and was friendzoned.   


Than I meet someone last week and it was the best date I had been on. She seemed totally into me. Even through text. After the first date we figured out a 2nd date. Her texting has slowly fizzled out this week and I cant figure out what went wrong. Its been over 24hrs since she has responded to me and knowing her schedule this could mean she doesnt even text me back today. So something really seems up and I am super bummed out.   


I deleted all my dating apps earlier this week and decided to focus on IRL for awhile again.   


This rejection, ghosting thing is hard. Definitely setting a 2nd date. You share so much with someone and possible start to really like them. Then without much explanation they seem to lose interest.   


Then im I want to go through my recent texts overthinking what I said or didnt say.   


This current situation hurts more then anything in the last 3 months. I know this is typical dating, but I dont feel cut out for this.   


Im a healthy, relatively fit and decent looking guy. It has got to be something with me, but I cant tell whats just incapability and what I need to work out. I mean I know im not perfect and im always trying to have a growth mindset.  


Dating like this a tight rope between protecting your confidence and also being vulnerable to people.   


Who know she might text me later, but this is the same old same old. Feels like a game that I cant win.   
When the texting slows like this I definitely start to prepare to move on.

I'll try to keep it short. I'm going to be taking a girl who I'm friends with out for a date this weekend. We met in college together and have hung out a decent amount together in our mutual friend group, but have never really went on a ""date.""

In the last few months, she was sending out some pretty strong signals and I finally popped the question. The thing is, what should I talk about?

She knows a lot about me and I know a lot about her. We know each other's backgrounds, schoolwork, and a large majority of each other's likes and dislikes. We have quite a bit in common and enjoy a lot of the same activities. We've done a lot of recreational activities.

I'm just worried that the time will be boring and not seem like a ""date"" at all because the things I know to talk about, we've already covered time and again, because we’ve hung out as friends so much.

I’m sure this is a very popular issue with some people and they’d probably benefit from this too. 
So giving examples on what to say/ask would be very helpful :).

Just to note: I do compliment the girls I meet on their hair, their eyes, touch their hand, look at their lips, and keep eye contact and smile, joke around.

Here to just vent. Opinions would be great too.

So last year, I met this woman and she is absolutely stunning inside and out. We both do have a crush on one another but the thing is, neither of us are allowed to act upon it. It's kind of forbidden. I can't tell the full story for this one. (We're both single just so you know). 

Anyways, so the last time we talked was in April. I asked her out for coffee and she completely changes the subject. She could have easily said no and given a response. Instead, she changes the topic completely.

A few months after of not talking, I texted her and she kind of shot me down immediately.

The last few months, I've been dreaming of her quite a bit. Nothing erotic. Just a lot of like going on dates and holding hands with her.

Man, did he have me fooled. He was one of the sweetest, most attentive, caring guys I had met to date.

It started as something casual, just two people talking about movies (we’re huge film buffs and it’s his career). I never thought it would lead up to anything. However, he introduced himself as single and with a different name. Because I wasn’t invested romantically, I never thought to look him up or anything. So far, he was nice and just a random dude to talk to about one of our favorite things with. 

Eventually things progressed, texting/sexting all the time, long phone calls, etc. I’m not sure how he had time to have a whole job and a committed relationship. How he found the time, I will never know. 

I found his gf on Facebook, finally made itself useful, but Instagram told the detailed story of their recent engagement and two year relationship filled with constant travels, date nights, and hiking trips.  

She seems lovely, way too good for him, but I had no idea what her response would be if I told her about her fiancé’s misadventures. I even hoped they were in an open relationship so less people would get hurt. I can handle it, if he only lied to me. But she’s didn’t know. She wasn’t defensive or aggressive towards me. I told her how him and I met and when (June). She disclosed they got engaged in May and she already had a wedding dress picked out. 

She thanked me and acknowledged how difficult this conversation must be. I have no idea if she believes me (I hope so) or if he will try to twist the story to something untrue (I hope not) but I guess I can say I did my part.
