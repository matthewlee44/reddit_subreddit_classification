So I met a guy who happened to go to church with me (I had never met him in person, long story) on a dating app. He had just come back from living out of the country for a mission trip for our church for two years. Once we matched he immediately asked me out. I said sure, said I was free on a certain day and gave him my number. The original plan didn’t work because I had to keep putting off the date because of my busy schedule or something would come up. So we would plan, it wouldn’t work out and it happened around 3-5 times. 

The next Sunday I came into church, he was there and I immediately came up to him to talk, as we hadn’t talked in person or met each other til that point. He got so nervous and so red, bless his heart. I confirmed date plans with him since he’s a horrifically bad texter and once again, I had to put them off two days before because a family thing came up. Then since he just came off his mission trip, he didn’t have a car and he lives an hour away from me, so we couldn’t make a date as my parents would have not allowed me to travel to a city I don’t know and had me drive. They’re very old fashioned but it works out well. I informed him of my parents rule that my dates have to meet with them and that we should have a date here, he agreed, and said he would make it work out somehow. 

He was very persistent in getting a date with me. He then told me about a week ago that he was moving out of state in two weeks and he would love to take me out and get to know me before he left, so I gave him my schedule and we scheduled for a date and finally stuck with it. 

The date was yesterday, I was so nervous. He came to my door, came in and met with my parents and had a good conversation with them for about 45 minutes, I felt embarrassed because my parents get a little TMI and my dogs and siblings are kinda wild. We then finally left for our date and he was so gentlemanly. He opened the house door, car doors, etc for me and would not allow me to do it myself at all. He would INSIST. 
We drove to get ice cream, and he made everything so easy. I hardly had to lift a finger.
He would do most of the question asking and I would ask him the same questions just to get fair game. I am the worst at answering questions about myself, so I felt like I was a disappointment in that way. We got the ice cream, and he asked if there was a park around, I said there was, and we went to this cute park down the street. Our ice cream spilled all over us just because it’s really hot and we live in the south lol so it was dripping everywhere. We had a good laugh about all of that, walked around the park, talked for about an hour. We had SO many things in common. I just felt so bad because I felt like I was acting like a dumb blonde just because I really don’t do good at answering questions and carrying on conversations. One thing that just kind of blew it for me was we got on the topic of a sport that I used to be in, swim team, and he had asked me “oh aren’t you the one that likes butterfly?” I had never talked to him about swim team and I hate butterfly. I was like “oh no! I don’t like butterfly haha” and then he said “oh, I must be thinking of someone else.” That kind of killed me.

We finally hopped into the car after walking around and he took me home. He walked me halfway up my driveway but not to my doorstep, and then asked me if I was going to church on Sunday. I said “maybe” thanked him for the date and told him to have a safe drive home. 
Then I went inside my house and felt so weirdly empty. Not like I didn’t enjoy myself, just because I was overthinking things and felt like I was acting stupid and weird. He sat in his car for 5 minutes and finally left.
I texted him after and said “hey! Thanks for the date! It was fun! I really liked talking with you! Have a safe drive back!!” 

And he texted me back “Hey thanks so much! It was good to meet you and your family. It was lots of fun.” 
It didn’t sound very good to me, but maybe I’m just overthinking everything. He didn’t text me today until I texted him and I just feel like I didn’t have a good date or something.

Here’s a little back story.

She asked to hangout on a Saturday a few weeks ago. We hungout every weekend. I gave her space.

Texted her the next day after she dropped me off so Monday morning said “heyy”

Waited 30 hours texted “are you okay?”

Waited 24 hours and texted and called it rang through

Bout a few weeks later I called and I’m pretty sure I’m blocked or she lost her phone and it died?

Anyways when we met on the first date she said all I need is a job nothing else and she’ll love that about me. I do have a job.

Honestly she was impressed by how much money I had in my saving account alone.

Also on the first date she said she hates being “ghosted” she also hates how men in her past did drugs and used her for sex and money.

Anyways I wasn’t doing that at all! I honestly loved her after months of dating her.

When she dropped me off Sunday. She said “I had a great time, it was good seeing you, I hope you have a good day, bye” kissed me then left

So I have no idea why she ghosted maybe because the last text I sent before the block I said And I’m blunt.

“Don’t know why you’re ghosting me it’s been a week, look I like you a lot, I like spending time with you and I appreciate you. But I don’t want to have sex anymore because you lacked communication. If you’re really interested, I want to take things slower and get to know you”

Pretty big text but I felt like I needed and wanted to express my emotions. Anyways no idea why she ghosted.

She introduced me to her kid. Family. Said she liked me and was completely comfortable around me.

I plan on if she returns. To tell her “we can hangout as friends and take it slow”

Another part says ghost her back if she contacts me.

Doubt she’s coming back anyways. You can stay positive all you want the truth hurts the most right?

I would of appreciated a text like “I’m not interested”

But what would you guys do in my shoes?

P.S. I love myself for who I am, I’m not a dick I’m not going to tell her off or be mean to her. She has anxiety, depression,  Schizophrenia. At least she said

I’m very happy with my height, body and hobbies, if they don’t like it they can leave of course. But she was really sweet and nice. Who knows? Maybe I was the side piece of the meal 😂

\~2 weeks ago, I met a woman on a dating website. (35/F/Single).   We can't hang out in person until we're both Vaccinated, but we've talked on the phone a few times and we message each other most days, but not too too much.  Things are too early to make any reliable assessments, but so far things seem to be going well. i.e. no red flags. We had the ""any weird ex-bf/gf drama? conversation early on, so I know she broke up with her ex-bf a year ago. When we talk, our conversations are nice. We're both relaxed and funny, so things just flow  kind of effortlessly.  Today, however, she brought up her ex-bf. For a good 5 minutes, she talked about how big that relationship was for her in her life, and how it really helped her learn a lot about life and herself. She went on to talk about, even though it's over, she still has great memories... blah blah blah. It wasn't a full blown ex-bf lament... but, in my opinion, it crossed a line that I want to maintain with any women I am thinking about dating. 

Finally, she said, *""I'm sorry if I'm talking too much. I know I'm just rambling on and on.""* I told her that it's fine, but that I don't really know what to say after someone starts talking about their ex-bf and how amazing it all was. I wasn't snarky about it. I genuinely and honestly just explained... *""It's kind of hard to come up with a natural segue you just talked me through some deeply emotional stuff from your past. It would kind of feel silly now if I just said... Mmm... w'okay... So... like... what's your favorite cheese?* We both had a good laugh about it, and she did say she wasn't trying to talk about her ex-bf, but was more talking about herself and life in general.  It was no big deal, so we just moved on and... we actually just started talking about our favorite cheeses.

So, even though this particular experience was not a big deal... brought forward in me, a problem with dating I've had most of my life.  In the past, I've allowed women to feel comfortable telling me all about their deep squishy feelings and it has landed my ass in the Friend Zone every single time. I am very aware of where I have gone wrong in the past in this department. What I do not know is... how to avoid it conversationally. What I mean is... my personality is simply very... conversational. Even with my male friends, I never just sit back and am content discussing sports, internet memes, and lawn care. I am deeply fascinated by... the human condition, in general. I always wanna know what makes people tick... their likes, dislikes, fears, memories, stories... etc. It isn't just some ""Nice Guy"" stuff that I do to women in hopes they might like me. It is just... how I am. So... I have had to come to terms with the honest fact that I simply need to shelve that kind of behavior until well within the framework of a relationship. Then I can settle in to my curious self. But in the meantime...

What does a ""typical man"" talk about on a date that might last 2-3 hours? And if the conversation starts to drift toward platonic stuff... how does one refocus the conversation in a way that makes it clear that I'm not here for that... but also isn't artificially harsh.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,702652,public,self,What can a man talk about on a date if he feels the conversation drifting into platonic friend-stuff?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmcza8/what_can_a_man_talk_about_on_a_date_if_he_feels/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Because I’ve already went through life being told that I’m ugly by a ton of girls.

Now at 25, I’m not even functional for my age, I’m plagued with mental issues, even some physical issues. 

My experiences throughout life have given me NO REASON to NOT believe, that I won’t turn out like these other late adult virgins. I already have a less than even average record. Why wouldn’t I end up like these other guys? Especially when some of them even claim they’ve done **EVERYTHING** and still nothing worked for them. Even guys who ARE fully financially independent, even guys claiming they’re in great physical shape, great career, blah blah blah.

People being significantly older than me and still never succeeded in something so basic (or even if they HAVE, but not until significantly older than me) don’t make me feel any better, just makes me feel even more hopeless that my fate will be the same, if not worse.

I don’t believe that getting a girlfriend and having sex is the main point of life, I also don’t believe it’d “FIX” me. It’s just one of, if not **THE** most basic parts of life, that for **MOST** people, just happens naturally. I’m not saying that they don’t put in any effort at all, but it’s just like, a natural byproduct of their life? 

Most people don’t have to read a ton of self-help books, or watch a ton of dating advice videos, or pay a dating coach, or just put so much conscious effort into it. It’s just a normal part of life.

It doesn’t take most people until their 30s or 40s to have their first experiences either. For most it happens in their teens. Even for those who didn’t make it in those years, most make it in their lower, definitely not later than mid-20s.

Teens in highschool don’t have to be financially independent to get into relationships and have sex. Young adults? It’s more important, if not necessary. I get that, I understand why it’s more important once you’re an actual adult, I accept that, it’s reasonable.

But I also don’t see how I can establish a real career before 30 either. I have so many hurdles, and contrary to what a lot of people say, time/age DOES MATTER. It really does get harder as you get older, because more is expected of you, so it becomes harder to catch up if you’re still behind. In regards to dating and career, just life in general.

Our bodies age goddammit. I’d give anything to at least stop biologically aging now, so no matter how long it takes to become successful, I’d still be young to enjoy it. But I’m not counting on age reversal/pausing treatment ever being accessible to me.

Those two women (most likely sociopaths) were late in my dating life (last seven years). 

Most of my girlfriends were great but had too many flaws to be wives. I've lived a hard life. I'm in my early 50's now. Looking back, I can say that I know what I did wrong. I didn't intelligently look for my women. I just let life deal the cards, big mistake. I also thought too much with my little head and went with women I was attracted to.  

My current gf has huge blue eyes and blonde hair. She is about 5""4 and weighs 206. When I met her in 2017 she was 145 pounds and pretty for her age (early 40's). 

Back in my late 20's and 30's, I dated extremely attractive women by anyone's standards. Two were runway models. One was from China and the other was Jewish with the most exquisitely golden eyes (not brown GOLD). Another of my girlfriends was recruited by Hugo Boss to model as a teen. She turned down the offer. She dated me, wanted me to knock her up, laughed in my face when I suggested we marry if she got pregnant, and then she moved across the nation after a year and a half. Later, flew back to my home town to approach me to be a sperm donor. She even had a long legal contract and everything. I have a genius IQ and I've done some things in my life that are impressive on paper, and so that was probably part of her motivation, aside from the fact that I am fairly good looking and physically very strong.  

So why am I posting this? I'm sad and I feel like I need to hear from people who either have been through the ringer like me, or can offer some kind words. At this point, I'm feeling like I'm at the end of my rope. I have a dead end job and enough savings to last about five years without working. I'm thinking of quitting my job. But I can't travel the world now with Covid. I was going to travel the world and then maybe just you know what. Now, I can't travel without a ton of red tape and the passports are coming out. I can't get the vaccines. I just don't trust them. 

So I'm stuck at home working online with my obese live-in girlfriend who has a rough voice like a belt sander and isn't in the best of health. She has some very nice qualities though or I wouldn't be with her. But she doesn't have much in the way of empathy. She is ""empathy free"" as a person. And she reads new age books when not working or surfs conspiracy theory websites that drive me nuts to hear about. she refuses to exercise and eats mainly carbs, all frozen meals. Her idea of exercise is waddling around the block slowly while pausing frequently to smell the flowers or puff on her vape. I work out every day for about thirty minutes vigorously. I also swim about five days a week for an hour. I'm in fairly good shape still. But I feel just too worn down to date during Covid. It's just too exhausting dating online and it's very hard to meet women in person with Covid. 

One of the reasons that I settled down with my current gf was due to being poisoned twice and almost dying both times. My current lady is definitely not a sociopath and she is ""safe"" (not vindictive or a gold digger at all). 

Being almost killed twice has made me nervous to date. It's hard for me to do now. I met one of those ""deadly"" girlfriends on CL and the other on Match. I just can't computer date any more. It's too traumatic. I don't think I would have met either woman organically in real life.

There have been guys who were good at holding a conversation but of course I manage to choose the ones who speak cave man. I’m not saying that if someone is inherently bad at communicating they shouldn’t reach out and find themselves a partner. I’m just acknowledging the fact the partner will be dissatisfied as time goes on and nothing changes. 

It’s a noticeable distinction between men and women. Women talk more openly about their feelings and men are closed off and unwilling to have a conversation. Or for some reason they can carry on a soliloquy in the group chat on playstation yet barely say two words over the phone. Then they act affronted when someone confronts them about their lack of communication. Like it’s a shock that you expect more than an “ok” in response.

Let's talk about a few examples.

A few years ago, I got into a relationship after months of dating. It was pretty serious since we were friends for 6 years and we were talking about marriage. At the time, I was starting an art business. I also made it VERY clear that I would only ever live in a city. However, he kept on saying that he ""couldn't afford to buy a house in the city"" like he expected my business to fail and for him to pay for everything. He just wasn't expecting me to make a substantial amount of income from my art. If the gender roles were reversed, I highly doubt he would expect my business to fail. I broke up shortly and I moved countries although he's still trying to get in touch with me. 

I broke up with my last ex because he invited me over to cook dinner at my house. The plan was to cook together. I bought groceries but had some last-minute issues with my roommate so I brought everything over to his place. The minute I started cooking, he went to his bed to watch Youtube videos. I called him out and told him to come to help out. He could barely cut an eggplant so I ended up finishing cutting it while he cut a bell pepper. When we sat down for dinner, he said: ""wow we did such a great job hun.  I responded ""you mean *I* did a great job? You cut up half an eggplant and a bell pepper. You didn't do shit."" Again, I broke up with him shortly after. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've gotten better at weeding out the red flags early on, but this type of behavior always comes up when things get serious. It's a pattern for me to dump guys as soon as the commitment starts due to intolerable behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be single forever, but I can't stand the casual sexism and won't follow along with gender roles. Deep down, ""men"" engage in this behavior because they want to keep their privilege and therefore do not truly respect women on a fundamental level as they want to hold power over us. I can't stand the ""men"" who view themselves as ""providers"" because deep down they feel inadequate and therefore need to have financial control over women. Or the ""nice guys"" who have the bar set so low for them that they know they don't need to bother to be attractive or fun because some woman will settle for them.

So I met a guy online in the beginning of the year. We started our “dates” by watching movies through zoom and we made sure we talked every day at least once a day. We were like that all January and we met for the first time in person by the end of February, after I got vaccinated for covid and all. 
March came in and we literally stay doing couple things, we hold hands when we go out, he makes me dinner when I go to his house, rubs my feet when I’m too tired from working doubles. He’s always opening doors for me and we cuddle a lot (and well, have sex). I of course reciprocate with the massages and cooking.

We have plans to take a road trip in the summer but I know we are not in an actual relationship because whenever he’s going though something and I talk to him about it, he tells me he’s happy he met me and that we’re “talking.” 

Last week we had our first fight? Sort of. He basically was on vacation for a week and although we did see each other a lot, whenever we were not together he would take a little bit over 24 hours to reply, even though he knows how important it is for me to talk at least once a day.
He noticed he had been doing this and he himself bought it up and apologized and told me we will make a better effort to be more consistent. He said something (I forgot exactly what) but he said “our relationship” but to me that means nothing since we’ve never had THE TALK. I’m just very confused as to where we stand... maybe to him I’m just a friends with benefits. I don’t even know if he still has his Hinge account or any other accounts, talking to other girls or anything.
I don’t want to bring up the conversation of being exclusive because I’ve done that in the past and it feels as if men just get really awkward after that even after saying yes. To me if feels as if men should be the ones asking to be exclusive to not take away that masculinity from them.

I've had some insecurity due to the fact that I'm neurodivergent. That insecurity used to be a lot worse than it is now. Normally, it's not that noticeable, but when it comes to dating that's when wires get crossed.

I admit that having lurked a bit, I feel like my situation puts me ahead of the curve. I've had several partners and my last relationship lasted for several years. I don't intend this as a brag, as I still have doubts about my situation all the same.

I spent the last six months working towards a massive creative project that will hopefully open doors for me down the line, I've moved out completely on my own, and I'm trying to do constructive things like improving my self-care routine, work on weight loss, etc. It's slow, but things are at least in motion. I'm not sure how long it's going to take to pay off, but I'm trying.

I feel like most of the time I'm fine, but there are days when I get hit with a depression spike and feel like I'm not going to get anywhere dating-wise. My female friends have assured me that I've got plenty of positive qualities and it's not like I don't believe them. In fact one is pretty adamant that I'll find a partner soon. I guess my point is that even though I think I've come a pretty long way in a short period of time, I still have some lingering doubts.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,703055,public,self,"Returning to dating, and I'm a bit worried",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmiqih/returning_to_dating_and_im_a_bit_worried/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I’m 28M and my friend’s gf is trying to wingwoman me and set me up with her friend. Besides her name and number I don’t know anything about her but according to my friend and his GF we would be a good match. I feel like that last statement when my friends said it added more pressure than it should have. I was in a relationship 2 years ago which incidentally was also 2 years long. 

With the pandemic ongoing and another lockdown for us, I’m more nervous than I have been in the past. I feel like my time single coupled with the lock down has made my mind mush, in the sense I don’t even know what to say or how to start. I’ve never had issues talking to women and when I last used dating apps I had no trouble but for some reason this time and this set up is making me nervous. Is this normal? Has anyone else felt this way? 

Any advice on how to msg or keep the conversation going with the person? I’ve always done better in person and even when I used dating apps before I would basically shoot from the hip and say let’s just meet it would be faster to get to know each other.

 I’ve haven’t msgd the person yet, partly cause of how nervous I am and also I’ve been really busy with work.

It has been obvious I’ve had the hots for her but nothing serious has ever happened. I recently transferred to a different location for work and for the past month haven’t seen her and out of the blue I sent her a funny picture and that spiraled into us hanging out with our kids this last weekend and I almost declined because I am super protective of my kids and I know the divorce has been hell for them. So in the course of the weekend she met my kids and I met her son and for Easter I went over and met her family with my kids obviously this was odd for me but it was a blast for the kids and she literally melted my heart playing with my daughter. But we don’t flirt or even talk all that much so I decided to ask her out and she said yes and we went out that night and it was fun nothing too serious just me talking way too much being nervous. So during our date she kept saying things like the next time I go to her parents or hinting at other ideas for things we can do and I want to emphasize I am dense I don’t pick up on things especially signals from women. After dinner we talked for about an hour and she said something along the lines that she would text me more and I should text her more and I made a joke “so I passed the first date” and she said it wasn’t a date so automatically I was confused. We ended the date with 2 long hugs and some eye contact but I didn’t want to kiss or make her feel uncomfortable especially after what she said. So it’s been a couple days and I text and she text back but just very short and matter of fact. I haven’t said anything about seeing her again just the normal good morning or how’s your day text with some varying topics but like nothing regular. So of course I’m asking all my friends like why did she ask me to hang out and meet her parents and all and go to dinner the day I asked her? I have been out of the dating game too long and I definitely don’t understand women but I have had the biggest crush on this woman for so long and I don’t want to fuck this up.

He was nothing like any of the other guys I had ever dated before. We have similar interests, similar family structures and values, similar sense of humors, similar communication styles, and worked in similar industries. I could talk to him about genuinely anything and everything, and he was able to make me laugh like literally nobody else could. I felt like he was the guy version of me, except my weaknesses as a person were his strengths and his weaknesses were my strengths.

When we were together, I felt loved and cared for. It felt natural. I could genuinely picture a future with him. 

Except he only hung out with me twice in that almost year-long period. It wasn’t long distance because he lived about an hour and fifteen minutes away. It wasn’t the pandemic’s fault, because he was going to see his friends, and went to weddings, etc. When I told him I wanted to see him more, he pulled away. When I pulled away, he got mad that I was either not communicating or frustrated that I was calling him out on the fact that I felt like he wasn’t into me, and blamed it on the fact that work wasn’t busy when he did show a lot of effort.

The first time we hung out we went out downtown with his best friend from college, and I ended up staying with him at a hotel. I remember sending him a Snapchat of myself smiling and saying how happy I was and he sent one back with a giant smile saying that he was really happy, too. I remember him saying a comment about how we would absolutely dominate a couples golf league and I was thinking, ”this is the first relationship that I've had that I can actually see a future where he’d fit in with my family and friends”...

Until my best friend sent me a screenshot of his Tinder profile the morning that I left, and I FREAKED out. I mean, my Bumble profile was still active, but I wasn’t using it and the app hadn’t been on my phone since about two months in to talking to him. So I downplayed it originally. But it kept eating at me over the next two week period because he didn't want to talk about it, and he definitely didn't apologize or explain himself, other than the fact that he was blackout drunk and on Tinder the night before we met up, BUT, he didn't text me at all that night and I genuinely thought that he was going to blow me off for our plans the next day.

He got really mad that I was even mad at the fact that he was on Tinder, but by that point we had been communicating *everyday* for five and a half months and had made tentative plans to go on a golf trip!!!!! The next couple months were pretty toxic and included lots of frustrated conversations on my end where I was just trying to get an answer as to what his intentions were. It just got to the point where I stopped putting myself in situations where I knew he was going to tell me “no” because it genuinely hurt and was confusing to have someone say something completely different than what their actions showed. I cut him off during the Super Bowl and was honestly really blunt and harsh about it, and told him that I deserved someone that actually wanted to spend time with him. I removed him from all the apps and deleted his number. And I haven’t talked to him until last week...

My friends all hated him. I realize that I was probably a side chick. Or something to keep him entertained throughout the day. Or a way to feel important. And that he probably didn’t love me. Because when someone loves you they let you know. They show up for you. They make an effort. And he never did. My friends all still hate him. 

But I can’t let it go. I don’t find men that I can communicate with like that very often. I was sexually assaulted when I was 19 and trust issues have very much been a thing. It’s not that I fell in love with the potential of him either. He had issues, we all do. But I told him if this was going to be a real thing then we figure it out together, because that’s life.

Our first conversation since I cut off communication just felt...normal. It was honestly really, really nice, but at the same time I’m feeling pretty hurt. I REALLY miss talking to him. But like I still don’t wanna talk. I want him here. So I’ve been pretty guarded and short with him when we have communicated, although I’ve been honest with how I’m doing instead of putting on the “I AM SO GOOD SINCE WE STOPPED TALKING BLAH BLAH BLAH” schtick. I’ve been working a lot and my life has been kind of a dumpster fire since January. 

I haven’t told my friends that we’re communicating again, honestly because it’s just Snapchat. And mostly because I’ve realized that the right person, wrong time theme that we see in movies is complete fiction. If he loved me, I would know.

TLDR; I fell in love with a man who confused me for almost a year, but I can't hate him even though I'm hurt.

Anyway we've been talking for about two days about different topics and he was quick to reply to my messages. I complimented him saying he was handsome, and he replied saying I was also handsome. I thought things were going well so I asked him if he wanted to meet up for dessert and gave a time and location (Wednesday).

I feel like most of the people I've grown up with seemed to always be self-conscious about whether they've dated/kissed/fucked/etc., but I've never related to desiring those things for myself because my self-esteem is tied to what I achieve, mainly career-wise. But the fact of the matter is that achieving things no longer makes me as happy either. I want to explore the happiness that comes with being in a relationship, *however*, because I don't feel like I've achieved much and since my self-esteem is tied to that, I feel like my insecurities would just drag me down even if I was in a relationship.

It just feels strange for me because I feel like this, I guess, inferiority complex of mine is in some whole other dimension that I have yet to understand.

Paused in venting for a moment, but I just remembered that how I've phrased it to myself before is that I don't feel worthy of someone else's love until I'm happy with myself. But the thing is that it may be a long ass time until I'll be happy with myself?

I guess I'm actually just confused about what I want since I hold myself to higher standards than what I already would seek in a partner?

Sort of related, but I want to vent about how I feel when lonely people I've met use me to fill some void. Since my self-esteem is in the ground, it just frustrates me when people appear to like me in spite of my shortcomings? I guess I'm just angry if others have such low self-esteem that they don't have standards which makes me feel worthless, or mad at myself because maybe they do objectively see something I don't, but I can't just flip some switch in my head to change my worldview.

We experienced our teenaged years together in the same neighborhood, and we were really good friends before we started dating. We dated for almost 2.5 years from high school into my first semester of college. I wanted to marry her, got her a ring and everything, but she ended up breaking things off when she started college. She wanted to experience college life on her own. She wanted to have a little more control over her life as she was just out of high school and felt like she wasn't ready to get married. I was clingy and didn't want the breakup to happen, so I made the breakup a lot worse. Anyways, it happened and I got over it after a few months. 

She met me a year or so later to give me back the ring which was honestly really nice, and we left off on good terms. She ended up marrying a guy pretty soon after that, and I just never thought about her too much aside from the rare nostalgic memories that would pop into my head every once in a while. I've stayed single for the most part since then, and it has suited me just fine. I have actually had so much fun just doing my own thing. 

Well.

My ex was good friends with my brother before we started dating. She was really good friends with my whole family actually. After the breakup, she kept in touch with my brother and his wife. They went to her wedding, and they all hung out occasionally. I don't mind either. I'm honestly a very easy going guy, so I could care less that they were hanging out. I mean of course I wish I had someone and we were all hanging out together, but it's fine. Well, I get a text from my brother last Friday: ""she wants to talk to you."" I agreed.

So we met that night. I wasn't expecting anything from her honestly. I was just happy to be talking to her again. It's like nothing changed between us in 4 years. We talked about everything and anything, and it was so nice. I'm super shy and not really great at communicating, but talking with her was as smooth as butter. She ended up apologizing for the way that she treated me over the breakup, and this is when I learned why she broke up with me because I was too hurt to understand back then. I was able to apologize for things that I've always felt bad about and get a lot of things off of my chest. 

I loved being around her again and just shooting the shit and learning about what has been going on in her life. She had separated from her husband about a year and a half ago, and finalized her divorce in June 2020. She's doing pretty well on her own again now, going to therapy and just doing her own thing. She told me that she rebounded a couple times just to get over the whole situation and start living again. Well at the end of the night she ends up telling me that after talking to me and hanging out for a few hours that she thinks she might still like me. She knew that would get to my head, and I got pretty cocky haha. She assured me that it was just a harmless crush because we don't know each other anymore, but the damage was already done.

We continued talking throughout the weekend and hung out once more before she went back home. I am totally down to be her friend. Before I even knew that she liked me I still would've been as forgiving as I have been and wanted to be friends with her. But I can't get her off of my mind now that I know I could have an opportunity with her again.

She was being kinda flirty and told me that she ""wasn't gonna make this easy for me."" I asked my brother and his wife for advice, and they told me to dial back the flirtiness just a little. I told her that, and she told me not to take their advice sooooo. She also told me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with anyone until this june (a year after finalization) which is fine. It gives me an opportunity to get to know her and see if that's something that I even want. But I feel like because she brought that up, it might mean that she is interested in a relationship?? When she said this, I let her know that she didn't have to explain herself, and that I was totally fine just being friends and she said: ""I can't believe you just friend-zoned yourself."" She keeps saying little things like this that make me question wtf is happening.

We actually have plans to see each other again this weekend, but I just don't really know what to think or what I should do. I know that I am in that excited phase of something new happening, but I don't want to get hurt when I come down from that. I would get back with her at the drop of a hat if I knew her more. There's definitely still something there, but I don't know if I should pursue it. A lot of my friends have given me differing opinions and I guess I just need some more advice. We have calmed down a little bit and right now, I'm not trying to smother her or anything. I guess I just don't want to miss this opportunity that's been handed to me on a golden platter directly from my ex that I still love.

I want to be respectful of the june thing because it's not that far away, but I don't want to get my hopes up, but also she keeps saying little things that kind of egg me on...

He was just here for summer. After he left i blocked him because i needed to move on and knew i wouldnt see him again. I moved on but the feelings never really went away and i never forgot him. But then i added him again a few months ago on facebook. Then a few days ago, i added him on instagram again because he had asked me about it and i had it deactivated, but i started using it again so i started following him.

After i followed him he liked some of my pics so i returned the favor. Then he messaged me, drunk, saying that he missed me, that he would love to see me again, he really liked me and spending time with me when he was here, stuff like that. I had told him i was moving to europe (spain) and he said ""man i wish im gonna visit spain soon then."" The next morning when he was sober he insisted that he meant everything he said. This basically brought back all those strong feelings i had.

So the next night when i was trying to sleep i was really thinking about it and decided that the best thing i should do is talk to him about how im feeling. So i text him and tell him whenever hes free the next day we should talk, he says ""sure you can talk to me about anything.""

So the next day i just say ""so what was the point in saying that stuff you said, about you liking me and missing me, what did you want from that?"" and he said ""what do u mean? i said it after all this time because i felt like missing you"" and i said "" i wish that you didnt, because now i like you again, and you saying that gives me false hope that we're gonna be together and i know that we cant.""

So then i just tell him that i just had a moment of confusion and don't want to cut him off. and apologized for putting that on him and he says "" you didnt put anything on me dont worry, its ok to speak your mind and clear things out"" So after that i just thank him for being understanding and listening and do a convo closer. But it seemed that he wanted to talk more, so i complimented him on a story he had just posted and we started having a conversation about the most random stuff for a couple hours. The only convos we had had were just 2-3 text exchanges. We havent had convos like that since we were 'together' 3 years ago. It gets late where he lives and he says hes gonna go to bed. I said ""goodnight, good talk"" and he says ""haha yeah i agree, have a nice day, \*kiss emoji\*""

So im kind of confused on how to move forward from here. I'm confused on where we stand, this convo was 2 days ago so we havent talked since.

I’ve been dating this guy for the past month and I slept with him the second week. I don’t regret it. I felt great chemistry, like I’ve never felt. I felt entirely comfortable with him. It was a decision I made out of pure passion. However, I felt hesitant continuing to sleep with him after this if we weren’t going to be exclusive, at least sexually. I communicated this to him on our following date the next week. He told me he wasn’t ready for exclusivity, even just sexual, and that he had been on dates with others recently. But, he said that he saw this going somewhere and would like to continue to get to know me better as well and we could talk about this again as things progressed. He asked me what other things I would be willing to do sexually because he thinks sex is an important part of the relationship. However, knowing that he had multiple sexual partners at this time, I no longer felt comfortable engaging in that with him. We continued to see each other after this, but I felt his interest decline. I wanted to explain myself to him but I never did, because he texted me immediately the next day asking me out again even after we had had this conversation. So I thought everything was fine.. And last night, we had another date. But it was so different. For starters, it had been a week since I had seen him. He barely texted me at all the entire time we were apart. We went to dinner, and the chemistry was just completely gone. There was just a disconnect. I don’t know what happened, but he was certainly getting me mixed up with other girls he’s been talking to. He kept asking “Wait- did I already tell you that.?” Like he can’t even keep up with the girls he’s dating. I was disappointed but I thought maybe today I would text him and ask him where this was going and try to further explain my reasoning for wanting exclusivity, even though at this point, I was so put off from our date that I wasn’t even sure that was what I wanted anymore. However, he saved me the effort because he texted me first this evening that he likes, me but doesn’t feel like continuing this any further. I guess I’m just kind of contemplating what I did wrong. It makes me feel like sex might’ve been what is he was after in the first place. Which in that case I’m glad I held my ground. I’m just mad at myself. I feel like I screwed it up. We had such a great connection in the beginning. And I would’ve continued sleeping with him if I could’ve guarantee that he wasn’t going to be sleeping with all these other people. So don’t say I should’ve put out because I’m not a prude, I just value my health and well-being. I’m just really disappointed because I saw this going somewhere.

But before you read the rest of this post, I want you to go and look at my post history. Ignore the random stuff from subreddits, what I want you to read is the posts I made on relationshipadvice.

Go on. Have a laugh. Really, it's good for the soul.

Now, from those absurd posts, one would immediately assume that I'm trolling, or bored, or something along those lines. That would be true 99% of the time in this situation. Really, it's ridiculous. To have romantic relationships that weird, to find and be absolutely dedicated to another person within 5 days of breaking up with the last one, to do any of the things outlined within the post, would be insane to say the least. But I assure you, it gets worse. 

The root of this problem is that I fall in love with people instantly, the second I see them, hear from them, I don't care. I feel the need to please them, to satisfy them, all these things. I just want to hold someone, or be held, or do anything with another person in order to make them happy. I've been listening to plenty of ASMR but it hasn't been the same. I've been in 3 relationships in my life.

The first one was my most happiest. She was a very troubled person and confessed her love to me until one day she ghosted me because I would tell her every hour I loved her. She was terribly, terribly troubled in the head and she would cut herself in ""tribute"" for me, but I loved her so so much. The days I spent with her were the happiest that I had ever spent in my life. She ended it with me by ghosting me, and every other night I read through our text conversations wondering where I had gone wrong. My heart aches always with her loss.

My second relationship was my most long lasting. She was lesbian, which meant she would never engage with me sexually, the most we really did was kissing and we hardly ever did that, but it was good because I was able to satisfy someone and make them happy. She broke it off with me saying that it could never last. The nights after that were the closest to ending my life then I have ever been.

My third relationship was with this very abusive person who I didn't like much but wanted to see them happy. I broke up with them myself, and now I'm in the situation I'm in right now.

Now I live in a closet sized apartment eating frozen meals (still cold) every day wishing I could just have the satisfaction of holding someone, but I always mess it up because whenever I'm talking to a girl I just want to tell them I love them. So I spend my days wishing I could die, or not fuck up whenever I'm talking to people on dating sites, or something.

I'm currently not comfortable enough to ask him about it because I would like him to be the one to freely open up to me about it.

I've noticed over the years that he has been addicted to online dating, specifically international dating. I'm not going to name the website but here's how it works. There are all of these women from different countries (mainly Ukraine, Russia, China, and Mexico) that send him letters in his inbox. If he likes what he sees on their profile, he writes them a letter back. This has been going on for five years now and he hasn't gone on a tour or seen them in person. Meanwhile, he's been racking up a lot of money(we run a business and this is where his paychecks go to). Reading and writing a letter is $7.50. Viewing a picture is another $1.50. You can see how fast it adds up. About a year and a half ago, I totaled up how much money he spent at the time on this website and it was around $80,000. Now, it's even worse. I had him tell one of the women he was talking to that he's been talking to her for four years, so surely it should be time to see her in real life. She responded by saying she wants to keep talking on the website. Sending more letters and wasting more money.

1. Saying something sexual/ complimenting physical appearance 
- can come off as creepy, may be hard for the convo to organically progress from there on 
2. Asking how the other person is/ where they are from/ something about them
- gives interviewer vibes, kind of boring
3. Asking about their music/film/tv show taste
- if there’s no common ground found through these questions it can be hard for the convo to progress, like “I like X” “oh I don’t know them” “oh you should listen to them” 
4. (Could be a hit or miss, but if it hits it HITS) Opening the convo up with something comedic, a comedic remark, or a random funny question. If the comedic tone is interweaved with flirtation even better 
- Finding someone funny makes you more inclined to liking them and wanting to learn more about them
- also if you know that you’re humor is not compatible then there probably won’t be chemistry and that can save you time on not talking to the people you won’t be attracted to
