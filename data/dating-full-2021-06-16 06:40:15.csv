I texted him; “babe I love you but your dick smells not so great” and he responded with: “your weird” after clarifying it does and that I was serious  he said “ok”and nothing else.

Short story:

I met a guy at a Trainings park, where we have also like a Trainings group. So we probably see each other like 3 or more times a week. So we begann to flirt and spent some time together after trainings... and one day we had sex... After that day, he didn't wrote me like before, he was acting with distance. 
And my head was going crazy, because I felt used with someone who I had to see oft. 

So I wrote him, why is he acting like that, did he lost the interest on me, and I didn't want the atmosphere at the training to become weird. And we could be friends. He answered:
I think you are really attractive and it is always funny with you, but I don't want to hang out that much, because I want to avoid this turning into a relationship. But I will be happy to become friends. 
And I said yes of course, thanks for your honesty. 

The next day I went to train and he was there too. He came to me and told me:
Really brave what you did, and I was I needed to know where we were, because I don't want to get hurt. And he said: I can't normally talk like this stuff so easy and ask me if he hurt me? And I said yes you did. And he was oh... I feel bad and me saying don't worry it is going to be fine. I have shouldn't say that! But I just wanted that conversation to finish. After that we didn't talk anymore. 

The next I realized that I should have been more mad at him. And tell him it isn't fine at all. So now I want to tell him that I don't want him as a friend! Because I don't like people who uses other people just to feel much better with themselves! To push up specially his ego. 

Any advice? 

Long story:

I met a guy at a park, where we do train like almost everyday. And we are kind of in a group that also trains there.
And he came to me talk to me, flirted a lot with me and then we spend after training time together... Like 4 times, and the whole time was this game of flirtation. He knows he is handsome and has a really good body. At the beginning I had that feeling, that I should not trust him but at the end  I did...

The next week I had some drinks with some friends and I wrote him, to meet and he wanted to come to my place. And he said yes and of course we had sex because that was the intention. After sex I wanted him to stay and sleep with me but I didn't say anything, because he wanted to go home. So we spent like half an hour like talking and just laying down. So after that he went, and I had like a wierd feeling that somethinf changed.

Next day he didn't wrote until I did, he was colder than normally and yes... My head was really like thinking everything, that could went wrong...
Two days later I had a birthday, where before the sex I had invited this guy. And he told me he will be happy to come or he will let me know if he could come. He never wrote me at all. I saw him that he did train that night at the park and didn't write me at all.

The next day after the party, the training group, he and I went to a lake. He picked me up and talk normal to me but not like before, like with distance. And I was okay. I asked him if he played with me? He said no I don't do that. And I was okay... The whole day at the we didn't talk anymore. 
The next day I wrote him like thanking him for me picking me up, and he said how are you, and no problem at all with a kiss. So I told him I was fine but missing a hug from him and wishing him a nice day. He didn't answer at all. Until then my head was driving me crazy, and I decided to write him, why was he acting like that, and if he list interest on me, he could tell me, and I don't want the situation to become weird and we can be friends.
He wrote so quickly like I do finde you really attractiv and it is funny to be with you, but I don't US to spend too much time together, because it could turn on into a relationship and I don't want that. And would be really nice to become friends. 
So I answered OK fine, thanks for telling me the truth. We can be friends.

I felt really used... Because why would you that, with someone that you have to see every day in a group of friends... It is stupid. But yeah I think he wanted to push up his ego.

Next day I went to train, and he was there. He came to me and say oh really brave what you did, and I was I needed to know where we were, because I don't want to get hurt. And he told me I can't normally talk like this stuff so easy and ask me if he hurt me? And I said yes you did. And he was oh... I feel bad and me saying don't worry it is going to be fine. I have shouldn't say that! But I just wanted that conversation to finish.

I’d never really experienced anything like it before and it’s hard to explain,but in brief, it just felt right. I felt connected to her right away and we were mirroring each other’s actions across the room constantly staring at each other. Usually, I’m really reserved and socially awkward, but when I met her I can honestly say that it is one of the few times in recent years that I truely felt like I was living in the moment. At that time, nothing else mattered but her and it felt euphoric; all my problems disappear because I was 100% focused on her. Overall, it was an amazing experience where we connected with each other on a very deep level.

After we met we started texting. We didn’t talk often, but whenever we did talk it would always be a super deep convo that lasts hours -Neither of us enjoy small talk.

We spoke about the night we met and we both expressed that it was a magical experience thst we cannot put to words - she felt a similar connection to me as of the connection I felt to her. Ever since I can’t get it out of my head that she might be the one.

Fast forward a few weeks and COVID hits meaning that we never get to meet up during our peak interest. As a result, we started texting each other less due to repetition, but the interest never faded. She never left my thoughts during the whole of lockdown.

Fast forward to the present day: lockdown has ended and we both finish uni so we manage to finally have our long awaited first date. I was obviously nervous; I already know this woman better than anyone I’ve ever met and we’ve only met once. Fortunately, when we met all my nerves vanished and there was no awkwardness about. The date was good; it felt very casual with both of us more just getting comfortable being together. However, it also felt deeper than that on a non-verbal level once again; although we were both talking, it felt like a formality. It felt like we were communicating more with our eyes, both of us locked in a gaze. It felt like we were reading each other and everything made sense. Overall, the date was good.

My main question was about our next date. Do you think it is too early to express all this to her? For example, do I tell her that I’ve dreamt about her every day since and she’s dominated my thoughmy feelings are pretty intense and I don’t know wheter
 it’s best to express that or to hide it. I don’t want to scare her off, but i also want to be true to my feelings.

\-Disabled guy can't get a first date, gets told to ""look at the positives and keep living your life"". Our life purpose is to mate and if that doesn't happen, then it's hard to look at the positives and keep living because we're in pain

\-Late 30s guy, never been in a relationship, gets told ""Don't give up, you'll find someone one day"". If he still hasn't found someone at that age, then his chances of finding someone in the future is very slim, so why shouldn't he give up?

It really hurts because I’v liked her for so long and she doesn’t like me back and she likes another guy who “has nice muscles” according to her. I started working out so I might be able to change the way she sees me.

I tend to be extremely direct at times but can generally be pretty lax about word choice but today it was text. I feel definitely it was a ""lost in translation"" situation but as I process the whole thing I understand that I offended her greatly. 

Essentially she has been avoiding meeting my friends and as I have gotten closer to a dinner for everyone I have teased along the way. Today I asked her to bring me a burrito at work (we worked out together but I rode my bike the 10min to the gym) and when she found out people were going to be there she accused me of gaslighting the situation. It was definitely a 2 birds/1 stone incident but I wasn't pushing that. Once I got back to the shop I tried to diffuse/defend the situation through text but I only made it worse. 

She's pissed, and she isn't wrong. Obviously if I had called or spoken the same words the sentiment would be different but she has broken things off. I definitely feel like there is more to it that I don't fully understand (in her anxiety about meeting the group) but in re-reading the days messages and understanding her already pumped state I definitely get it.

And told me I could text him at any time even 9 or 10 pm. He seems to be single as I noticed after our short private conversation. 

He has a beach photo as a profile picture on whatsapp and his status was normal. No hint that he might have a girlfriend

The problem is that I can’t get the man out of my head, what if he’s interested, but he can’t talk to me out of his job? How can I take the next step and find out if there is any real interest from his side? Or do I interpret too much into it?

After that I had some time to myself and recently I have decided to get back on as many dating apps as I could to maximize my chances to find someone. 

I have spent a whole day on setting quite a few apps and trying to interact with multiple women from where I only got 1 reply back which then fastly fizzled out. I don't think I'm bad looking, I'm tall and very geeky/nerdy, introverted. I have manners and respect women etc.

And howly shit, most of them dating apps are robbery in a bright daylight as they seem to be a blantant crash grab for the features that should be free.  Also, what doesn't help is that there are multiple the same profiles on all of them apps so frequently you become accross familiar faces which I can't criticize them for as I do exactly the same to maximize my dating chances. 

It feels to me that Online Dating is rigged and manipulated by companies for their own advantage to bring as much profits as they can and to fill their CEO's pockets to the full capacity. I'm not the only guy who has issues with online dating as when I was checking for some dating tips on YouTube, I noticed that many guys have similar experiences. 

After reading all of them comments, I started to feel discouraged\\low and I'm currently wonder if I should at all continue with Online Dating as I'm at my end wits. I guess I could spend that time on something more productive but Online Dating is my only option, not because of Covid of course.

The above confirms somehow in real life as I know people who are very harismatic, fashionable and got everything that a woman would want but somehow it takes them years to find someone online. Also, no, I'm not salty that I haven't went on any dates after doing Online Dating for 1 day but rather expressing my frustration on how much Online Dating became worse and worse over the past years as technology have advanced more and more. 

I think I got all of it off my chest now so somehow I feel better. 

Oh well, I will need to stick around for a while until I find someone again.

Im 21 years old, have never had luck with girls which I know is common but I know for a fact it’s because of my face.

I know everyone says that looks aren’t everything, but they’re so much. I’ve been told I’m ugly by so many people my entire life including my own parents and siblings. I’ve been pointed at and laughed at, heard people talking behind my back, in high school, on multiple occasions girls came up to me and said, “You know, you’re so weird looking”

I don’t pursue attractive women. I go after women that I think are as desperate as I am, and they still don’t want me. Last week I was texting this one girl whom I had been speaking with for days before and who I thought I had a chance with and when I finally shot my shot, she posted it on her Instagram story captioned, “ugly dudes are getting bold” and blocked me. All I said was that I’d like to hang out with her some time.

I feel like this is the sign that no woman would ever desire me and that I probably will die alone. I’ve tried dating apps, clubs, meeting friends of friends, nothing has done me any good. I feel so hopeless and I don’t want to be alone for the rest of my life and never have a family or wife or someone who loves me and is attracted to me.

I’m smart, I’m in a good college, I’m in pretty good shape and healthy, I have a job, I have a good enough personality to have a good amount of friends who like me, but I just can’t get a single girl to want to be more than friends with me because I just had to be born one of the the ugliest losers in the world.

I met this girl from a school group assignment earlier this week. We decided to get started on it and I scheduled to meet up with her in person in the library 2 days later. The assignment took 2 hours to complete. Afterwards, I asked if she was free to hang out at Mcdonalds for dinner instead of going home and she said yes. While I didn’t intend to date her, I wanted to make friends.

Then at Mcdonalds, we talked about ourselves and our background. During one of our conversations, it lead up to her talking about her past relationships. We first started by talking about what we were doing on our free time. Then she talked about how she used to hang out with her boyfriend and was dumped her and now she doesn’t do much with her free time. They broke up a month ago and she’s mentions she’s had a lot of terrible BFs. She broke into tears and then we hugged in the end. I felt sorry for her on this. While I didn’t initially have feelings for her, I decided to ask her to an actual date to the movies and she accepted. I wanted to give my chance into dating and I want to make a good relationship with her.

My question now is, what are the red flags I have to watch out for? I can’t believe on our first meeting she mentioned this. I only wanted to be friends with her originally but I wanted to give her a chance because she’s so sweet and smart. I’ve never had a closer chance to date a girl before than this.

Hey everyone! I don’t go on here super frequently but I’m 24 today, and I realized that I kind of want to see a bunch of internet denizens roast the shit out of my ex’s apology email on my birthday. (We broke up around 3 weeks ago because he fucked another girl in our bed. Well, she’s 31, so maybe “woman” would be more appropriate than “girl” in this context). So I’m copy and pasting the text here: 

Hey. Happy birthday. I hope you have a blessed day. I’m writing this email to tell you I’m sorry I fucked Juliana. I’ve been working through a lot of childhood trauma and just bullshit that’s happened to me as an adult that I haven’t really processed. I remember you told me that I should go to therapy and even researched therapists I should see. I want to thank you for all of that. You were a real ride or die and I’ll never forget you. (He then proceeds to talk about his friend’s death and how that affected him because he learned “not to grow too close” to people. I’m not including this part out of respect for privacy). 

I’m sorry about how she treated you when that all went down. She was geekin because she doesn’t get that much attention ever and she had to tear you down because shes jealous of you. I should have stopped her but didn’t. I was angry with you. I was angry with you even though I knew it was my fault and that I fucked up. I felt hurt and betrayed that you left, even though you had every right to. I knew I fucked up and I was cruel to you because I loved you. 

I still love you, and I’ll probably love you forever. I understand if you don’t want anything to do with me. Shit, I’m gonna have to live with the fact I did you wrong forever. I still think about you all the time, and my condo is so lonely without you. I come downstairs in the morning and I keep hoping to see you down there, with your coffee and smoothie bowl. I miss talking o you, and how you fill my mind with ideas. I miss holding your hand. I miss laughing with you. I miss being inside you, and making love to you. My mom keeps reminding me I fucked up a good thing, and my mom doesn’t trust anyone, so that kinda says it all.

Now let me give some context, this brother I refer to is my half brother who I dont see too often and his birthday passed a few weeks ago. We made arrangements for me to come spend the weekend with him (he lives like a hour and a half away) so I came by. When I got there (it was Friday night) he informed me that on Saturday he would have some friends come over and we would chill for a bit. So on Saturday we clean up, grab some snacks and some drinks and one of his friends come, a cool guy who's company i enjoyed. About 2 hours later 2 more people come and I weren't expecting females, because he never said anything about it... Now nothing is wrong with that, I just wish he gave a heads up... Now both were attractive but one in particular just gave off a certain sort of energy with her playfulness that attracted me to her as im sort of a chill, laid back individual while she had high energy (she tried to get me to run with her to her car because she left something in it and asked me to get it with her). So we were just chilling, we drank a little bit (dont be judgemental im American) and we played some cards and a little bit of video games. Now let me get to the point, I noticed she kept looking at me at different points and also kept trying to come next to me all the while maintaining contact with me, when we were at the counter although there was plenty of space she leaned into me, constantly touched me, asked me many questions, offered to rebraid my hair, touched my hair. Then we moved to the couch, she sat directly next to me and made my brother sit on the other side and her friend and his other friend sit elsewhere (3 person couch) while she kept talking to me and touching and what not. Now I'm not a shy person, but like I said im laid back and chill. I made sure to maintain eye contact even though at certain points it was kind of weird, tried to answer directly and keep the conversation light hearted as I opened up and became more comfortable with everyone around. Anyways, I wasnt able to get her # or social media due to not wanting to come on too strong as this was my first meeting in a chill setting and out of respect for my brother and wanting to get his blessing afterwards speaking to him about it first. I will say this, she did hug me before she left and left a great impression with me as I find myself smiling at the encounter, but I just wanted other people's opinion on what happened here (I know its long, sorry) and any words of encouragement. 
ADDING THIS IN: I am a pretty attractive dude (other people told me this not being cocky) with long hair that was twisted up and a fresh fade.

I'm a (27y.o F) I've been going on a few dates now and then, maybe 1-2 a month, and it feels like all my dates go well, and the guys seem interested, then after the first date they take longer and longer to text and it basically fizzles out between us, even though they would have said multiple times they want to meet up again, and even plan something, only to flake.

I met one guy (32y.o M)a month ago and we had a really nice first date. We had gone for drinks, and it felt like there was a really nice connection and conversational flow, he would even copy things I would do or drinks I would order for example and we even made a joke about that. When it came to the time to pay I offered to split the bill, but the waitresses card machine wasn't working so the guy offered to pay the full bill (around 90 euros) and he hinted at meeting up again and was planning dates we would do in the future.

After our date we left the bar and it was only 8:30pm in the evening and the bars were closing due to covid. He asked what the plan was after (here in Sweden during covid it's usual to go to someones house after for a drink since the closing time is so early, or to take a walk) - maybe he assumed since I lived very close we would take another drink at mine since we were enjoying ourselves, but it was a Sunday evening and I wanted an early night. So we didn't go back to my place, but instead we went for a long walk (bearing in mind it was raining) and I walked him back to the metro station, where we kissed and he said he would like to meet again.

A few days after this date, the guy messaged and were having a lot of nice, flirty texts back and forth before we decided to meet up and play boule for our second date (I had originally suggested this for the first date actually). It was the most beautiful summers day, and the guy had literally organised everything for this date (booking the game, paying, paying for drinks again even though I offered). We had more flirty and fun banter, but yet again the place closed at 08:30pm due to covid. We had already been hanging out around 2/3 hours and were having a great time, so he suggested for us to take a walk through the park and he had brought some drinks we could have and sit on the cliffs and watch the sunset.

Honestly, the date felt super amazing, we were a little tipsy, but it was so fun. He is a Landscape Architect and was walking me around the whole island we were on, giving me a tour of the history behind different places etc, and while we were watching the sunset on the cliffs he kissed me.

Again, the island we were hanging on is quite close to my house, and as it was getting cold we decided to go back to my place to have some drinks. We had more fun conversations, and were speaking about music etc. By this point we were quite tipsy though as we hadn't eaten dinner, so we went to sleep. There was obviously a lot of sexual tension and attraction between us and so it was quite hard to go to sleep, but he was being super gentlemanly and saying that we didn't need to have sex and could have it another time as to not pressure me, but we did as there was too much tension.

The next day it was a bank holiday here and he had to leave early to catch a train to his friends summer house for a week to relax but he said we would definitely do this again (meeting I assume). Then the week after that he decided to go to his own summer house to see his family. While he was at his friends summer house I text him that I had a super nice time with him and that I would like to meet him again - to which he agreed and responded immediately.

Some more days went by and we made plans to meet on a Sunday - I asked him what he felt like doing and he had planned a really nice date where he would show me his local area, show me the basketball court he played at, and local attractions etc, so felt like he put some effort in. A few days went by and I didn't hear from him, then on the morning of the date he cancelled as he said he had to work on a deadline for work (fair enough) and hope he hadn't ruined my day. I was super dissappointed obviously as at this point we hadn't seen each other for two weeks and I didn't want things to fizzle out - but I didn't let him know this and just wished him luck for his deadline.

The next day I message him to see how his deadline is going and just generally tried to strike up a conversation, hinting at meeting again and sent him a cute picture of me. I felt rejected as now he said he was back home again and left it at that. So it felt like I had hinted at meeting twice and it wasn't really working out, and also his texts were short (although he would reply immediately). Not sure if this was because of the deadline.

It's now been two weeks and I haven't heard from him. Either he lost interest (most likely) and things fizzled out, or he's been busy with work. Tbh, my gut feeling says he lost interest, or someone else came in the picture. I am really gutted though as I don't understand why. We had a really nice vibe and connection and he even planned this super nice date (although it never happened). I also fucked him like a pornstar so not sure why he wouldn't even want to meet again for sex!!

The last time I saw him (a month ago since he always seems to be at his summer house) he left his ring at my place, so when that happened I messaged him that he left it and he said he would like to pick it up at some point. I guess since it's been a month he forgot about it.

Should I text him one last time? Maybe saying something about the ring? Or would you guys just chalk it up to he lost interest and that he was trying to make it obvious by cancelling / not following up.

It seems to be happening time and time again, I go on a great first date or two dates, then the guy loses interest. It happened with another guy also, he said he wanted to meet again and we kissed, but he takes 5/6 days to reply to a text!!!! So I forgot about him.

Why are guys interested and say they want to meet then never follow up? I am an attractive woman, in shape, good style, confident, funny, great personality, ambitious etc.

Do they just meet someone better? I am convinced as a mixed-race girl living in Sweden, the white guys that I meet must prefer to date white skinny blonde women, as that's who I see him mainly following if I have them on social media, as I don't see why else they are not interested... When I lived in the UK I had no problem attracting men and at least dating guys for like 5 dates.

Is there something I could be doing wrong? Or these guys just change their mind?

As an average guy/ even slightly below, I can empathize, I'm close to giving up. Maybe love and relationships aren't meant for everyone. But when I see some of my friends who are girls dating I just can't help but be envious. As my best friend put it, ""Life just happens to them"". Many of them don't even use the apps but still have no problems with dating, hookups, friends with benefits, or finding a boyfriend. My close friend got out of a relationship, went through the hookup phase, and got into another relationship again, all in the span of a few months. Another one is voluntarily single, she can restart anytime and she was always in relationships. Neither of them did online dating, men just approach them, several times a week. Similar stories for 2 other friends too. Meanwhile, I haven't gotten laid in a year, and never had a relationship in my life. With how dating is nowadays, I don't think i will any time soon either. It just feels hopeless. I did have some interest from girls in high school and early college years, but it seems unless you have an extensive social circle or incredible luck/ appearance with approaching women, it's not happening. Online dating took a hard situation and made it nearly impossible to participate in. After 2 years of OLD, still no luck.

But I barely hear from the other side of things though. I firmly believe men or at least average short guys like me have the hardest in dating. I can't even imagine what it's like to have 500 matches or getting to pick whoever you want out of the lot, basically unlimited options. So to the ladies on here, what's online dating actually like for you? How many dates do you go on a week on average and do you see a lot of people simultaneously? Do the unlimited options get exhausting? Can you also empathize with the other side who has the opposite situation to yours? let me hear your thoughts.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,842072,public,self,"To the women on here, how has your experience been using online dating?

A little about me. About two years ago I started going on a mental health journey which included medication, therapy and other things I neglected growing up since mental health was about the most taboo subject in my home. Currently on medication for depression, anxiety and ADHD but I feel like a complete 180 of my former self and love every second of it. 

I’m also somewhat fresh (~4mo) out of a two year relationship that my therapist has labeled as “toxic” and “abusive”. I never really thought that my partner was a bad person, until my therapist made me realize the things that were being done to me during the course of our relationship wasn’t healthy. Thankfully I’ve gotten away from that person entirely and I’m happily moving on. 

But dating apps just seem completely different now that I’m more in touch with my thoughts and feelings when I’m approaching others online. It’s almost like I sike myself out before the game’s even begun. As a guy, I figure it’s mostly on me to reach out first (from what I’ve read, this is how a majority of apps work aside from Bumble if I’m looking to have a conversation). I just seem to kind of struggle to find something interesting to say beyond the usual “hey”. 

I aim to find things in their profile I can relate to, or at least something I can work with in order to break the ice. If it’s an empty bio or a slim one, I don’t typically try to reach out. I just don’t really know what to say if I’m given limited information about the person I’m looking to connect with, and feel a generic greeting would be lost in a sea of messages. 

I’m also trying to improve on my photos that I put out there, currently I have about three great selfies (according to my friends of the opposite sex), a couple of pictures of me with my hound, a candid shot of me kneeling down to pet our family dog at a gathering, and a picture of the mountains on my road trip to Colorado. 

I’m just looking for ways to improve my profile, and maybe some tips on how to connect with others. Like most jokingly say on their bio, “I don’t really know what to put here”.

I like someone, but it's a little crush, nothing big. I'm not sure how he feels--doesn't necessarily matter at the moment but I get a tad bubbly and giggly when he messages me back. I haven't actually dealt with this before, it's new. It's gushy. And it kind of awakens the teenage girl in me, wtf? I buried the crush down because I was lost in my former partner. I feel guilty as if I shouldn't have the crush, like I don't even deserve it because of the past relationship. I buried authentic feelings for a new person. ANYWAY.

Well I was brave enough (and this is a big deal for me) to message him and have him come hang out with my brother person and I. My brother person gets off at 10pm right, so I... Asked him if he wanted to hang out with me before I go pick up my brother person. 
He said yes. And I fell off my bed when I saw it 😂 
So like I said, it doesn't matter if he feels anything, I just don't know how to do this, I trauma bond in all of my friendships and relationships, but we aren't having trash parties here. HOW THE FUCK DO I KEEP MYSELF FROM BEING AWKWARD AND NERVOUS?! WHAT DO I SAY OR DO?!
