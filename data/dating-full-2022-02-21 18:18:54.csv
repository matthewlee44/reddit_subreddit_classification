I met this guy and we’ve been talking on and off for a bit. He ended up asking me out but I had to go out of town and I’m unfortunately still away.. I get back in a few weeks.. 2 1/2 to be exact. He told me to reach out when I was back and I gave him what I originally thought I was getting back ( a date). I ended up not reaching out because I ended up having to stay longer so I reached out letting him know that. He asked if I’m ever going to be back (jokingly) and I said I was getting back in March. It’s only been a few days since I sent that and he doesn’t respond that quickly.. I know he made a comment that work was getting busy. 

Should I say something like when I get back I can reach out if you still want to etc..? 

Or something like would you still want to get together when I’m back.. 

Or wait to see if he responds to my previous message about when I’m getting back?

I'm a 27M living in a large metropolitan city. I met this guy about a year or two ago and we hit it off as good friends. I've since introduced him to my friend group and he's fit in with everyone splendidly.

There's a girl who I've known for several years who I've liked. Her and I have talked about this, and she doesn't feel the same way which I respect and acknowledge. We used to be really close but we've become a lot more distant. The only time I really ever see her is at inter-friend events or when she comes to these parties that I throw.

Recently, my friend has started dating this girl--they met at one of these such parties. I'm happy for them and they seem really happy. However, I've noticed I feel a little uncomfortable around them. It's especially difficult when I'm a third or fifth wheel. My friend and I have had a conversation months ago about this. I explained to him how I feel and that, ultimately, it's something ""I just need to get over."" I said that I'm happy for them both and wish them well. He's a good guy and there's no animosity here between us.

With that said, I'm still having a lot of difficulty accepting the reality. I would love to maintain a friendship with them both, but I obviously can't just push my emotions down into a pit and expect said emotions to go away. It's even more complicated by the fact that the two of them are so intertwined with my friend group now... any time I go and hang out at some event, chances are they'll both be there as well.

How do I process my emotions here to make being around the two of them less uncomfortable?

At the beginning of the year I met a boy as he too was a commuter, engaged to a girl for 4 years. I didn't have the slightest interest in him right from the start and if I hadn't found out we had a mutual friend I don't think I would have ever talked to him. This mutual friend I later discovered had been obsessed with me for about 5 years and for a series of vicissitudes (such as continuing to ask about my private sex life or sexualizing me) I pushed him away. Later I found out from the boy of the train (we'll call him Francesco) that Francesco had already closed relations with him and warned me he was kinda crazy. From here Francesco began to behave strangely: he always came looking for me, he replied to every story on instagram, he wrote me on whatsapp and made exits like ""in this thing you are the same as my girlfriend"". At first I didn't care much, I just thought he liked me, but then there was a turning point. One morning we were alone, going to school. He intercepts me and we start talking about very private things that I have never been able to talk to anyone about. He listens to me and indeed I discover that he has lived through the exact same situation. After this exchange, back home, I realize that I have developed very strong feelings. I got a crush on him. Now comes the weird part: after this event he practically stopped talking to me. I tried to look for him a few times but he became very cold out of the blue: he doesn't write to me anymore, he greets me at moments. I don't really know what I may have done and I think he was kidding me. But I didn't do anything to let him know I had a crush so I don't understand why he should have done it, plus he's engaged.

At that moment I felt very sad. Thought that my life just seemed worthless and no girl would ever want to go out with me. I’ve never had a girlfriend before, try my best to improve myself but feel like I’m just fighting against the impossible.

I have a question for the Muslim men that have left their non-Muslim gfs to either get married to a Muslim woman or to be single with the intention of finding their Muslim wife. 

I have had lots and lots of conversations around this with other women who have experienced this. They’re in serious and intimate relationships with Muslim men that end rather abruptly despite that they have already had conversations about the future including marriage and/ or kids. Of course not all relationships pan out (that’s okay) but it seems counterproductive, in this case. 

As a non-Muslim woman who has been in a long term relationship with a Muslim man in the past, I can relate. In my particular case, we absolutely talked about our future together. We also lived together for a few years. I mention that for context. Thankfully I have done a lot of healing from that, but an old friend of mine is experiencing something similar right now and I can’t help but ask the Muslim men of Reddit.  I want to ask as someone who’s genuinely interested in understanding the mindset of a Muslim man who doesn’t just date Muslim women if they’re the ideal choice for you?

Just wanted to share a story I still cannot get over. 

I 19f matched with a guy 28m on bumble in September. Because of our age difference I knew I wouldn’t want anything to serious with him, so we hooked up and I stayed the night at his apartment. He was very sweet and didn’t pressure me to do anything. 

After our first time meeting we have now been seeing each other every 12-15 days or so. For the first two months he kept saying how badly he wanted to take me on an official date, but never did. He would apologize, blaming it on his busy work schedule. I genuinely didn’t care but I
could tell it was bothering him (clearly not enough to get around to it). 

November comes and he finally takes me on a date. I had a good time but he seemed nervous and said he “hadn’t been in public in a while”. He’s more reserved and a typical workaholic. After our date he walked me to my car and we had fun before parting ways….

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I went out of town for work, and when I came back I was eager to see him. When I get to his house we skip a movie and go straight to his bed. We talk and catch up and he says he bought a townhouse. I made a joke saying “oh with your wife?” because all of my friends think he’s in a relationship because how often we see each other and the way he texts me (not so often, only to hook up). He says no, then we continue talking. I then make a joke saying “how is your girlfriend doing” and he says “I don’t have a girlfriend, you’re my girlfriend”. I remind him I am not his girl friend because he is emotionally unavailable. 

While we were having sex, he literally asks me 

“How long is the lease on your apartment?” I say “Month to month” then he asks if I want to move in with him to his new house. I don’t really say anything and just freak out inside and focus on finishing in bed. 

Since then he hasn’t mentioned it. I haven’t seen him because he was out of town. But him saying that got me thinking. He really expects me, a 19yo girl to move in with him? I am young but not an idiot. 

He hasn’t properly asked me to be his girlfriend or to be exclusive. I bet when I see him next he won’t even bring it up.

The graduate program I am a part of is just like high school, where I see the same people every day for the next 3 years. I met a guy in the same year as me, and we hit it off right away. 

He followed me on instagram the same day that we met and we became friends in the same friend group. I would come to class early every day and he would come early and study with me in the mornings. We would always hang out on the weekends in our friend group, and everyone (including myself) could sense that him and I both had a natural gravitation to each other. In face, someone asked one of my friends if we were dating, which we weren't. 

As the semester progresses, we find out that this guy has a GIRLFRIEND. Even though he has been flirting for weeks and always around me. 

However, as my group of friends gets to know him better, we learn that his relationship is on and off and toxic. He broke up with his girlfriend twice in the span of one semester. During on and off periods of his girlfriend, he would hang with me more, text, or snap me more. I knew what was going on behind the scenes, but I didn't want to read too much into it because I didn't want to cause any drama between me and him or the friend group, or make any assumptions, since we were friends. We would also play drinking games at parties together, even though he was never transparent about if he was with his girlfriend or not. Maybe that's me being naive, but I wasn't going to say no. The most recent time that he broke up with her was 2 weeks before the semester ended. He was a wreck, and being the friend that I was, I comforted him a lot, invited him to the library to get him out of the house because I knew he was depressed, etc. 

Until everything changed once the semester ended. 

My graduate friends and I had a Christmas party, and I handed out everyone handwritten Christmas cards. Every note had considerable thought put into it. He was taken aback by my note. That night, we were the only two left at the party, and he walked me back to my place, only to ask to be let inside. He didn't have his ID on him to be let into my building, so originally he hugged me and left. Then, I get a text that he's coming back. He brings his backpack, coat and ID, I let him in to my building, (he was NOT with his ex at this time). We talk for a bit, he kisses me and makes the first move, and spends the night at my place. I made sure that he was aware I had to get up early the next day for work, but he didn't care. We were both intoxicated, but we weren't the next morning when we kissed each other when we got up, not even speaking to each other, and just kissed. 

Then, winter break hits. We do not talk much, but eventually, I don't hear from him at all, only to find out at the beginning of this semester that he got back with his girlfriend over break. And they are still together. 

I know I got used, but the events leading up to him spending the night with me and the morning kiss is driving me insane to get to the bottom of what it all means. We have not spoken about that night, and **the worst part about it is I see him every. single. day.** 

I know myself pretty well and I know that after I get with/hook up with someone that distance is best. Especially because I get attached easily, and I gave up hook up culture a long time ago for that reason but I thought this would be different because of everything leading up to it. Things have changed considerably between us, and there are some days where it feels like it never happened and there are days where it hits me like a truck that it did. 

I have gotten over my feelings for him and because of his actions I would never date him; I make progress on the weekends when I don't have to see him in class but I take 3 steps backwards during the week when I have to see him/talk to him in class. I don't want to talk about the situation because he's the type of person that will cover up any feelings and just blame it on being drunk. But I am angry about the situation and I find myself in a very tough spot of just being angry. I don't know how to handle the situation (and this has happened to me before of having to see someone frequently that I have spent the night with), but not in a situation where the wound keeps re-opening because I see that person **every single day** and they are intertwined in my friend group.

We met in the afternoon on a Saturday. We grabbed coffee and sat on a bench talking for 3 hrs. He asked me if I was interested in getting dinner after which we did. We started getting a bit physical after dinner like hugging and holding hands when we were walking. We got into his car and started making out. He suggested that we could either do something in his car or go to my place (my place is closer to where we met and also he could grabbed some condoms along the way). I was hesitated for a bit cus I didn’t want to fuck it up (was worried if having sex too soon would ruin the connection). But I decided to go with it when everything felt so right at that moment. I had a crush on him for sure and he's the first person from dating apps that made me actually feel something.

We met at my place. He told me he would sleepover which I was a bit surprised. I felt like he should at least ask me before he assumed he could (he lives 45 mins away from me and that was close to midnight so it made sense).

I found out I'm allergic to condoms after a while (only hooked up twice in my life and they both ended quick so didn’t even had time to feel the allergy I guess). We stopped and started talking about STD tests. He told me he took a test 2yrs ago and haven’t had any sexual partners since then. I believed him but still wasn’t sure. He said we didn’t have to have sex if I didn’t want to. He fell asleep after. We were both horny in the next morning and I asked him to do it. The sex was average. He told me he felt so relaxed with me and had fun but didn't mention doing it again. He gave me a fairly long hug before he left.

No text after 2 days. I texted him first and tried to open up some convos but he replied slow. He seemed excited when I hinted to meet up again and he suggested a time right away. We still didn’t text much in between. The second date was at my place since we talked about I’d cook for him. He showed up late for 2hrs. I took that as a sign that he’s trying to piss me off cause he could have told me that. Also I asked him if he was busy during the week and he told me no. So that’s another sign that he just didn’t want to text me. The night was a bit weird at first but then we put on a movie and started talking. We talked about dating app experience and past relationships. He told me his last relationship started from hooking up. The girl which is his ex all of a sudden told him she loved him. And he felt bad not being able to reciprocate. We made out for a bit but didn’t have sex during the movie.

After the movie ended (almost 2am), he said he should head out soon. I assumed he would stay cus he did that last time and it was late so I asked why. He said he couldn’t provide me consistency like spending time together and staying over etc. Also never done casual relationships before, don’t know how to keep a relationship that he doesn’t think it’s going anywhere. TBH I don’t really know what I’m looking for (and also too early to talk about that to me) and I didn’t want to end it this soon (it’s so hard to find someone I like), so I played it cool. He decided to stay over after and seemed surprised that I didn’t go crazy. We had pillow talks and sex. Since we talked about our fantasies and kinda open up to each other, the sex was a lot better.

The next morning I assumed he would leave early like the last time but he didn’t. We talked and cuddle for hours. We had sex again around noon. He told me he had fun with me. I walked him to his car but he didn’t even try to give me a hug and just said see you next time. I know we probably won’t see each other again. But I’m still feeling a bit frustrated like I thought there was a mutual connection and he seemed like really trying to get to know me. He asked a lot of questions about what I wrote on my dating profile, our zodiac signs compatibility, remembers every single thing I said and told me he didn't go on a lot of dates. If he didn’t like me, why would he even open up and put in efforts to get to know each other? And he could have just left without cuddling in the next morning. I had a lot deep talkings with him and our values seemed aligned. He’s good looking I’m sure getting sex is pretty easy for him. Should I still try to text him?

TL;DR I thought I had a mutual connection with a guy and hooked up with him on the first date.

We had some events lately that made me question the relationship and put things into perspective for myself and I feel like I might be about to marry the wrong person because I would be putting everything on a gamble on whether she would even fall in love with me later + I want to enjoy my dating life with her, I am having no appetite, no sleep and struggling with depression because of the situation and feeling completely deprived of love and care while I feel like I gave more than I could into this relationship and into making her feel happy, cared for and loved.   
Our ""happiness"" always depended on my flexibility.   


We had a talk about this yesterday, and she says she wants to continue our relationship but would support any decision I make.  


Should I just   
\- Call it done and break it off completely to save myself from the pain I am in right now?

6 months ago He told me that his family lives not far from the town where I found my new job and where I moved to, so He said that we would meet whenever He was going to be around.

I've been suffering with depression and anxiety since I was 13 years old, I have a really toxic environment at home and a difficult relationship with my family. Because of this I've always had really low self-esteem and every time I've had a chance to date someone I ended up sabotaging myself (if that makes sense).

I have my ups and downs and my mood changes a lot in a short spawn of time. I've talked about this with my therapist and they have tried to help me but most of the time I don't think it's working.

So, last year a friend of mine decided that they would definitely set me up with someone. Some time later we went to a party with some college friends and I got a bit tipsy and ended up getting a bit closer to a peer I hadn't share too much time with until then; I kinda had a crush on  them from then on, and I told my friend.

They decided to help me get closer to my crush and I started liking them more, they are a really sweet person, kind of attractive and they don't have experience in this dating thing (like me XD) Finally this Valetine's Day they confessed to me and we agreed to go on a date last Saturday.

We had a nice date, it was a bit awkward at times as it is new for both of us, but we had fun. We kissed and it was really weird, I don't really know if I liked it because it was messy and I felt they were kind of anxious, but I couldn't bring myself to say it because they seemed sooo happy afterwards.

The thing is I've been on an emotional rollercoaster since then, I'm afraid I'll end up self-sabotaging again and hurting them in the process (and they surely don't deserve it); I've been having second thoughts about going out with them since then and I don't know if it's me being stupid again or what but I'm very lost.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160510,public,self,Mental Health and Dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sy7red/mental_health_and_dating/,no_ads,0,

I met this girl on Tinder about two weeks ago. Most girls kinda bore me, but we had similar interests and she was really pretty. We connected pretty quickly and finally went on a date last week.

We went out for a drink and it was neat. After the drink, I got her back to my place and we made out for more than a hour. And even though at the time, we told each other we didn’t want to get into a relationship, it truly was a special moment, intimate and nice. When she left she told me she wanted to see me again.

Over the last few days, she started to ghost me. I couldn’t understand why and so today, I try to have a conversation (over text) with her on her honest feelings. She finally admitted that she didn’t think it was a good idea seeing each other again, as we both kind of caught feeling for each other and that she was very scared by that. I tried to persuade her we had to see each other again to make sure of everything, but she didn’t want (the whole story is confusing, she seemed very confused).

I ended the conservation respecting her wish, but mentioning nonetheless that I had a splendid night with her and that I was sorry for any harm that I could’ve done to her. Now I just feel heavily depressed, because even though I’m not exactly new to the dating scene, this was the first time I actually clicked with someone since many years.

So I’ve been going this coffee shop twice a week and there’s a cute cashier der that I interact , I think she’s kinda likes me cause whenever I place my order she gives something extra every time even though the store’s busy or manager is there. Other than that she asked me where I’m from and by coincidence we both share the same home town. I know it’s a retail job and I know they always be friendly with their customers but i see a real connection here for real(eyes Chico they never lie) . So my question is when I’m going there tomorrow should I ask this girl out or go for her phone number? I’m a pretty confident guy so I can pull either one off but the thing is I don’t want her to be in a situation where she starts to think that I’m just a random weirdo ykwim .

I’m sure I’m not in a unique position but I’ve been very curious about this recently. So to give some context, at the start of the pandemic about two years ago, I moved into a house with three of my girlfriends. We were very nice and supportive with each other especially when it came to body image. We often encouraged each other to do, eat and wear whatever feels good and whatever makes us happy. As a result I ended up gaining a little over 35 kg in one year of living with the girls. We always made each other feel confident and beautiful in line with rhetoric of the body positivity movement. But in the last year when things finally opened up again and I started going out and trying to date, I found myself being almost entirely invisible to men. I cannot begin to describe it without breaking down but so many of the privileges I had before like free drinks free entry anywhere and overall chivalry that I was accustom to went out the door. At first I just thought that all men forgot their social skills during the lockdown, but then I was catching too many comments about, “being a big girl and so on every time I went out so I started putting the pieces together. I am certain at this point that my severe weight gain and change in appearance has affected the way that men treat me and it’s for the negative. I don’t understand because if anything I’m getting more praise and more encouragement from my girlfriends and support for my new beautiful body now. I’m just curious if men are aware of the body positivity movement and if they are open to dating different types of bodies not just athletic straight bodies like I used to have. I’m looking for genuine answers and don’t mean to offend any group, I just want to know where the miscommunication is happening with progressive views of bodies in women versus men.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160515,public,self,Body positivity/dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sy8g45/body_positivitydating/,no_ads,0,

I am Iraqi. I am brown with darker features, dark eyes. Considered very good looking (ha, not just by my mother). 

She revealed her type is more white-red color skin Turkish men with green/blue eyes. She also romanticizes Turkey so much. Been there a few times.

A few weeks later, she brought up the topic about races and looks again and talking badly about darker skin in general, she says I am almost her type. 

After telling her about my problems with her colorism/racism, I then said: ""oh I thought I wasn't your type but I was still on the level of being your ideal"" 

She said: ""you are good looking, but a good looking Mediterranean or Turkish man do look better if they have a lighter skin color and lighter eyes"" - she's very firm in this opinion. 

She also shot down the idea that darker skin people can look just as good as the best looking people in other races, she was dismissive. She is a minority herself.

For example, I DM'd this one girl a few months ago in response to her story about her dog. We had a good short convo about dogs and then I asked her about soccer cause her bio said she played soccer. She responded saying she plays and coaches it. I then said ""that's awesome what position do you play?"" and then I got blocked... 

So, I'm curious if girls just find it creepy in general when a guy DM's them? I should also say that the girls that I've DM'd follow me and I follow them back. Reason I'm asking this is because a few weeks ago this girl followed me and I followed back and I think she's really cute but don't know if I should DM her or not cause I don't want to be a creep.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160517,public,self,Do people think that sliding into someones DM's is creepy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sy9dzr/do_people_think_that_sliding_into_someones_dms_is/,no_ads,0,

I fell hard for a girl, I’m sure some of you reading may understand, others not. However, we never actually dated, never even kissed or had a moment. The reason I fell was because of the quality time we spent together among our mutual friends. Our chemistry and conversations were just the highlight of my week every week. Anyway, after a few months, I asked her out to coffee (but not a date) and she was very excited, at this point I believed she felt the same way for this reason and the way we would flirt in person. The coffee hang went really well, and at the end I told her ‘I like you’ and she cut me off saying thank you and that she wasn’t ready for a relationship (as she got out of a toxic one a few months prior). I wasn’t going to ask her to be my girlfriend but just express my feelings. So this crushed me. Long story short, things never were the same, I tried to act like it didn’t happen but she couldn’t for whatever reason. She stopped treating me the same way, and stop seeing our mutual friends and I whenever we would hang (the reason not related to the incident). But, she’s back, and gladly we talked likes before, it feels good to be friends again. However, I fell out of love around a year after. What I wanted to ask was, do you guys think it’s ever a good idea to bring up that I used to love her?

Long story short, this man ended up having a lot of unresolved personal issues and we decided, very amicably, to break up and go our own ways. However, I unwittingly continued to follow dating coaches and even purchased their guides and enrollment to ""attraction academies"" as I entered the dating game again.

As of late, I've started a few ""situationships"" with several men and all of them have something in common: I am absolutely terrified of pursuing them. Dating coaches lay out so many ""rules"" and ""tricks"" that basically push for relationships where the man is pursuing a woman. In the past I have been much more dominant and as a result had more satisfying relationships. Now, there is a definite air of discontent in all of my interactions with men. I tend to linger and doubt myself, and feel SUPER clingly/needy even if I send a text to a man saying ""hey"". 

Attraction is simple. If you like someone then you just want to spend time with them. You show interest. I have had men straight up tell me ""I'm having a hard time figuring out if you're interested in me"" and that I am ""life-threateningly aloof"" because I was so hung up over following some dating coach's rules. I've probably lost out on more guys by listening to them. 

I've removed myself from the realm of dating coaches and advice. I get that it's my fault for buying into these games. It's just hard to avoid now (compared to 10 years ago) when social media is absolutely saturated with this stuff, especially with algorithms etc. So I completely own up to the fact that I allowed myself to be manipulated and I hope that I can quickly re-learn how to be authentic again. I guess I would encourage more people not to fall down the same hole that I did and simply let things develop naturally and organically.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160521,public,self,Dating coaches have made me terrified of men,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sy9p1y/dating_coaches_have_made_me_terrified_of_men/,no_ads,0,

Today we planned a date for a few days from now. As a woman, I tend to ask for a mans instagram before meeting as a way to check that they are who they are on their profile - to be safe - and usually ask to follow and vice versa as extra proof. After checking out a man’s instagram, his age seems to be 3 years younger than what is listed on his profile based on when he graduated highschool. I also found more birthday posts in his tagged posts as proof of that age difference. I jokingly asked the guy if his age was true to his profile and let him know that I saw a post on his instagram that indicates that he could be younger than me, yet he is still saying he is older. 

This makes absolutely no sense as it does not match the timeline of his education and birthday posts including the age of said birthday. I would not have dug so far, but one of his posts made me question it big time.
