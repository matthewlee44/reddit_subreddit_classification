This is an awesome history that hapened 4 days ago, but I'm gonna need to give some context first for the history to make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I suffer from an illness and have delicate health. I always thought this girl was beautiful, but it was only 6 months ago that I fell in love with her.

&amp;#x200B;

6 months ago, I was suffering a lot. The insanity of living with this disease was taking over my life, and as the time went by, I was going crazy. I realized during this sad period that no matter how much you cry or scream, life is not gonna change. I became depressed and my depression was quickly raising to suicide danger levels

&amp;#x200B;

It was horrible. A time of too much suffering. At this time, I hated the world, and I vowed to never forget my hatred.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the midst of all this suffering, \*she\* was there. She took me to the park and layed on the grass beside me. And then, for the first time in over 3 years, I saw kindness in this cruel world. Hatred was no longer all I saw, and I couldn't stop thinking about her smile.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to four days ago, she was here, in my house. I invited her over to play some games, watch something, and whatever friends do. We had a great time, but It was getting late, so she said she had to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped her and said: ""Hey, I want to ask you something""

""I... have a crush on you... And I was wondering if we could go on a date""

&amp;#x200B;

She paused, surprised and a little shy. I was expecting a no, since she never seen to had any romantic interest about me. I then said, stuttering like I have never stuttered before:

&amp;#x200B;

""I mean...don't feel pressured. If we just keep being friends, it'll be great too. But these are my feelings, and I'm handing them over to you. Can you think about it?""

&amp;#x200B;

Shyly, she smiled.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, we can go on a date""

""Really??""

&amp;#x200B;

We paused for a bit

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey... how long have you been feeling this way for me?"" She asked me

""Well, I always though you were beautiful, but six months ago, when you came to my house and I was suffering a lot, is when I really fell in love. We went to the park, and I layed besides you on the grass. You showed me that the world had a kind side""

&amp;#x200B;

She smiled

&amp;#x200B;

""Really? I'm so glad""

&amp;#x200B;

We were both really shy at this point. I could barely talk.

&amp;#x200B;

""Also, when I saw your smile, on that day, I though that... well... that I wanted to see your smile again and again. I realized I wanted to make you smile. You are precious to me""

""You are also precious to me""

&amp;#x200B;

We then hugged, and, a little later, she went back to her house. We are both 21 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

We are going out on our first date :)

&amp;#x200B;

Though I couldn’t think straight at the time, we ended up doing other things considered safe and didn’t engage in sexual activity.

This was on our first date. I knew he wanted something casual and I decided to accept that, even risking it could have ended up being only a ONS as I was insanely attracted to him. 
I’d already accepted at the time that he might be that kind of guy, especially considering his looks and his bragging about multiple threesomes and having had multiple partners without my even asking (I believe no girl wants to know this especially on a first date). I knew it right then he shouldn’t be taken seriously and that I shouldn’t have expectations.

However, we ended up keeping in touch and just hanging out occasionally, and the more I talked to him the more I liked him.

The problem is, even though I’m trying to keep things friendly considering both him just wanting a casual relationship, having herpes and leaving the country by the end of the year, he keeps persisting. 
I was straightforward and told him I seek a deeper connection and expect it to turn into a relationship which I know is not something he wants and that he’d just leave me with a broken heart and potentially herpes.

He keeps persisting and talking about sex, asking me to stay over at his. I don’t want to lose him as we have a great connection and I enjoy talking to him heaps. We have just so much in common. 
Living in a country far away from my home country it’s difficult to find friends. I don’t want to lose him but the more we hang out the more he tries to convince me to have sex with him. I know he’s aware of how much I like him.

“Go up to her.”    “Make a move.”     “Shoot your shot.”    “Ask her out.”    “The worst she can say is no.”  

Men are told this from both other men and women. And yet, it’s terrible advice. Why? Because men seem to have gotten the idea into their head that even if there’s no indication that a woman is interested in them, and that she’ll probably reject him, he should still make his own interest clear, as a matter of practice. And that just leads to negative consequences for both sides.

Rejecting a man isn‘t a whole lot of fun for a woman. Because many women feel absolutely no attraction to the man asking them out, they certainly don’t want to agree to any date. Yet they feel like it’s rude/mean to do so, which puts them in a sticky spot. It’s also pretty annoying to have to coddle the ego of some man. When the man who is formally making overt moves on her isn‘t someone she knows well, she‘ll probably feel some lack of safety out of fear of how this man will react when she says no. And when the man *is* someone she knows well, she‘ll probably feel annoyed at how someone who she thought was just a normal person in her life was just another man who sees her as a love interest instead of how she saw them.

Of course, being rejected as a man isn’t a walk in the park, either. Being rejected is of course a disappointment on the person being rejected. Being rejected can be a pretty big blow to someone’s self-esteem- not when it happens just once, but when failure happens relentlessly after every attempt, it takes a toll on someone. And it makes him feel foolish as well. Not only did the other person find you unattractive- but you were actually foolish enough to believe they didn’t! Additionally, being rejected over and over again isn’t a good look. It makes someone appear to be desperate, unable to find someone who‘s interested, and not very self-aware. It does no good to be rejected, except in a “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger“ sense.

A lot of the time a man asks a woman out, they aren’t strangers- they’re good friends or acquaintances who were building a relationship with each other. And when the man tells the woman she’s interested, but she doesn’t feel the same way, it can put a huge damper on the company that they probably enjoyed between each other. Sometimes, it can be repaired. But other times, it totally ends what could’ve otherwise been a great, mutually beneficial relationship had the man kept his feelings to himself.

So no, men, don’t shoot your shot just because you’re interested and she’s single. I know this advice goes against everything you’ve probably been told, but trust me- for the sake of both you and her, unless she’s made some some clear signs she’s interested, keep your feelings to yourself.

TL;DR Men shouldn’t ask out women whenever they are interested because rejections helps absolutely no one and should be avoided. Men should only approach if their are clear signs that the women is interested.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158017,public,self,Don’t shoot your shot.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/so2cw6/dont_shoot_your_shot/,no_ads,0,,,,,

There've been plenty of sexual innuendos, the jealous undertones when another friend of the opposite sex or a new Hinge match is mentioned jokes about us just dating each other instead of the failed attempts we've both had, and plenty of other things that lead you to question ""could this be the beginning of something"" even though we've both told each other on more than one occasions that we are ""just friends"" - but are we both lying to ourselves? Could that change once we introduce a physical dynamic?

We live 4 hours apart. She spent a month and a half back home for the holidays, January was super busy for both of us, so we have yet to actually get to spend time together IRL - that's changing in a couple weeks when I go visit some friends and stay with her. Just yesterday I found myself talking to a friend, describing my ideal partner, and realized that I was just describing her. 

The ""friend zone"", of course, is always a tricky topic for a number of reasons but I guess my biggest question is... are we heading there, already there, or simply waiting to see if there's physical chemistry before committing to either path? Should I mention my newfound discovery now in order to be transparent or wait to see how things go?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158017,public,self,"Another one about the friendzone, but different - maybe?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/so36at/another_one_about_the_friendzone_but_different/,no_ads,0,,,,,

Personally, if someone responded to me late I’d assume that they weren’t interested, didn’t find any potential down the line so backtracked back to me, so I would rarely respond. 

On the flip side, sometimes I match too many people and have too many conversations going on at once which is overwhelming, and I end up honestly forgetting about conversations with people. 

When things quieten down, I look back to older matches and want to pick things back up now that I’m not overwhelmed, but from my own perspective of being on the receiving side, it just seems so rude that often I just don’t, because it seems insulting and I hate having to come up with an excuse because it sounds like lying.

Nothing official or exclusive. Before we dated he used to bring me this amazing cake and we’d have playful banter until I was just like dude.. I like you! So we started casually dating. 

He stay about an hour away in Miami but I see him regularly once a week and we often text throughout the week as well. He’s a pretty busy guy so I’m often understanding and just grateful that he had some time to spend with me.

At first everything was great, the conversation, the sex, the regular visits.. we would go out sometimes to have dinner/drinks but lately things have hit a plateau. I wouldn’t say a decline because I could just be overthinking like I am most of the time. But I just can’t seem to gauge him. And I really like him and don’t want to freak him out by being irrational about trivial things. 

Lately he just comes over late on Saturday nights, we have sex, he leaves a few hours that follow then we do it all again in a week!

He recently went on a month long trip to teach a class. We texted and stayed in contact and talked about how much we’ve missed each other. 

I missed him so much and Valentine’s Day was approaching so I got him a gift to give him when he returned! He likes 80s music so I got him a modern vinyl record player and a vinyl to go with it. He thanked me greatly and said he had a gift for me too that he forgot to grab. My birthday had just passed a few days prior. But I gave him the gift and our night went on as usual. 

Weird part was when asked to leave the gift at my house?! He said it was so we could listen to it together but something about it felt weird. He has his own place and car so I thought that was a bit confusing for him to leave it with me. Lately the texts have fallen off a bit. And it’s days later now and I’ve still heard no word about the birthday plans he promised or any plans to take me out and doing anything fun other than sex! 

Could the gift have scared him off? Was I doing too much? Could it be that this guy is just invested in having sex and I’m taking things too serious?

I’m a guy (20) and I had known this girl my age for about a year. But we developed a more solid friendship over the past couple months and were more like acquaintances before that. And then out of nowhere one night, she initiated romantic contact with me and we made out on my couch. She said that she wanted to explore things further. 

The next night, we had sex, that was about a week ago now. Since then, we’ve gotten together a couple times and just made out and chilled for long periods of time. I was down to do more last time, but my roommate didn’t want to give up the room since he had class the next day so we were just on the couch in the living room area, so options were limited.  

I was informed from the beginning that this was an non-commitment type relationship and that she was seeing other people too. So basically a friends with benefits situation. I was fine with that at the moment but did end up catching feelings…but for the time being I was ok with the arrangement. 

Now, in a sudden turn of events, she has told me that she now feels uncomfortable with the sexual part of our relationship and just wants to be friends. She said I didn’t do anything wrong but that for a while she had been trying to decide if she had romantic or platonic feelings for me and now says it’s definitely platonic. 

This is very difficult for me to understand, especially the last part since she initiated the romantic contact. And just Sunday night, as she was leaving, she gave me a kiss that was pretty extended as we said goodbye…and now all this is happening. I just don’t understand how her feelings shifted like this. And keep in mind, all these events happened within the course of about a week. I feel very emotionally hurt rn. 

This was my first sexual relationship. So this has just been such a crazy time for me emotionally and things keep changing so fast. Because of these circumstances, maybe this was more special for me than it was for her. 

I care about her and don’t want to lose our friendship. We spent hours talking effortlessly and I think it’s hard to find that in someone. I don’t hold this against her, I guess she feels what she feels and that’s not her fault. I told her I’d be willing to be friends, but that I need some time. Obviously I’m not going to try to “win her back” or some bullshit as that’s very unhealthy and dishonest and weird. I’ve accepted that she just wants to be friends and I just have to get to that point too. I just need time to recover emotionally and would hopefully be down to be friends when I’m over this. 

But I guess I’m just looking for help understanding this or any advice. I honestly don’t feel much closure. Especially since she made the first move and I really felt a connection and I just don’t understand how her feelings changed like this.

Bad questions keep swirling in my head. Like “am I not good enough?” Or “did I mess things up?” 

I’m gonna talk with a couple of my homies about this and hopefully that will make me feel better, but until then, I guess I’ll just ask strangers on Reddit.

Went on 3 dates and end up hooking up on the 3rd and then ghosted right after.

I know there's a lot of post on ghosting on on this subreddit but i just want to see what you guys think of my situation. 

Met this girl on a dating app. On her profile she said that she wanted something casual but willing to see how it goes. We moved from dating app to Snapchat and chatted a bit (nothing NSFW). I asked her on a date shortly after. 

First date, we met at a park, got coffee and drove around (cause of covid) and chatted for around 3 hrs. While we were talking about dating she jokingly mentioned that we could totally hookup but i just brushed it aside. I eventually dropped her off to her car as she had to leave early for some family gathering. During that car ride, we realized that we have a lot in common and I thought the date went well but nothing special happened. We kinda vibed that's it. 

After the date, i messaged her that I had a great time and would be nice to meet her again. She agreed and we scheduled something for the next weekend. Throughout the week, we texted but not often. She would sometimes take up to 8-10 hrs to a day to reply to me. She works retail so i figured she was busy and not able to text at work and after work she's probably dead and doesn't want to text. I have to admit that I kinda let my insecurities show as from my personal experience, if you really like someone you want to text them often (that's how I am). So i kind of already screwed this up in my mind. The night before the date i asked her whether she was really interested in me given she wasn't responsive to my text and she said that she will not try to convince me that she wanted to hangout. She then confirmed whether i wanted to meet and i said yes.

Come the second date, i picked her up and once again we went on a car drive cause everything is closed except the mall but we both love car rides so it was fine. We also went on a walk around her town which was really nice. We spent like 10hrs together vibing to music and getting to know each other. In that time, she shared about her dating experience (last two didn't end up well), family issues, depression/anxiety she had etc (very personal things). We eventually ordered food and the date ended in us making out in the car. Now, i am not sure if it's my insecurities but i sensed throughout the date that she was kinda distant like she had a wall. Maybe it's her personality but i felt i just couldn't get closer. Later on I did ask her about it and she just said it's takes time for her full personality to come out and i told her that she could be herself around me. Anyways, i dropped her home and i texted her after i got home that i had a great time and she agreed. 

We texted throughout the week. She took the same amount of time to respond but i didn't mind since she mentioned she's not a big texter and she gets sleepy after work. I actually thought that was great cause i could focus on my own work. We set a 3rd date and instead of driving around again, i booked a hotel room so we can chill, watch a movie and couple things (think that was the mistake). I waited for her to get off work and we grabbed food, drinks and went back to the hotel. We watched a series and cuddled a bit. We end up hooking up and talking all night long. I inquired more about her ex cause i wanted to know whether she was ready for something serious. That was when she shared that she had just stopped contact with her ex (ex was working in a different state, cheated on her while away, tried to get her back but she didn't want to get back) and she jokingly said all men are trash. Looking back i shouldn't reassured she that no all men are like that but i thought through my action i would be able to show her that there's good men out there. Morning come, we hook up one last time and she then had to hurry back home as she had work. 

I drove back home and texted her around 5 hrs later to inquire whether she had a good day at work cause i knew she wouldn't have time to respond to my text. She replied the next day saying she was so dead and crashed after work and to let her know how much the hotel was so she could pinch in. i texted her it's all good as i had a great time and it was my idea. She didn't respond to that last message (been around a week) and left on unread. I tried reaching out one more time but im thinking she blocked me.

Wanted to get some perspective as to what might have changed her mind? Thinking I'm a rebound or her ex contacted her again but I'm an overthinker so idk.

Has the dating scene been permanently damage, it has been bad for years but never like this. Not only did the pandemic ruin social life and make most people socially anxious, but it seems that not only dating apps are running rampant but people have seemed to not care for things that matter. I am currently a 25 year old college student who has witnessed friends love life deteriorate during and after Corvid.  


I do not think this applies to everyone, some are luckier than others, but I suppose the real question is… is the issues the ever lasting problems of the pandemic? Or are we the people in the dating scene the problem? 

We as human are are can be inherently selfish and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It seems like when it comes to dating people don’t seem to listen to advice or friendly suggestions and choose the heart ache, but I can’t blame them I too have fallen for my own heart ache.

He tells me when he's working, when he gets home, when he's with friends/family, etc. He's a great listener, always compliments me and is always asking about my day. And yes, I do the same. He's already told me that he's told a few of his friends about me and that they tell him they're happy for him. Overall, I just feel like we have a very genuine, fun time with each other. It's constant smiling, laughing, making jokes. I put in the effort as much as I can and I feel he does as well. We've both made it clear that we like each other, but I've made it much more clearer.

I've been observant about his upbringing and he mentioned he was extremely shy and bad at talking to girls growing up. But, I still get the feeling he's still super shy, though I could be wrong. We kiss, but he doesn't initiate it many times. I think it doesn't bother me too much, since he's been amazing overall and such a gentleman. I give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he's just shy. Thing is....I'm super shy too. We listen to each other's problems and we're slowly opening up. We haven't had the exclusive talk yet, but I know eventually I'm going to have to bring it up. We recently hung out and he was showing me something on his phone. Once i was done looking at his phone, I looked away and then looked back a few seconds later and saw he was cleaning his screen, which was a hinge background.

There's two occasions with two separate guys I've dated that particularly stands out in different ways:

The first one was while my date walked me home and this volunteer stopped us to join his cause, the moment he saw us, I could see the "" what are you doing with this guy"" expression which felt really uncomfortable, then when we left I heard him and his coworker talk about us. This has happened many times before but not just with him 😅

The second occasions wasn't actually a bad experience, it was with another guy in a sort of high end restaurant, as soon as we sat down I could see the waiters talking to themselves and looking at us. Then one of them came to our table with the biggest grin and said ""someone got lucky today"" I got confused and when the waiter took our orders and left I asked my date if he knew him and he said no. Then another waiter came, asking if we ordered (he knew that we did) my date smiled and said yes and the water responded with "" look at that smile isn't he cute"" and then sort of started going on about what a catch my date seems to be, so kind looking. My date sort of blushed and said ""don't only compliment me haha"" and the waiter looked at me and said "" yeah she's absolutely stunning, a very good couple"". At this point I was convinced they knew each other but he swore that they didn't and I jokingly said that they did a good job selling him to me and that's something best buddies normally do. 

Both of these dates were extremely kind, charming and okay maybe socially not the best looking but they were attractive to me. 

For me the first example of the way we were treated was unfair and uncomfortable for both us and the second one was actually really sweet. Apparently they really didn't know him but they tried their best to make our date fun and put my date in the best light.

I have terrible anxiety and severe depression. A lot of my anxiety is about my fear of death. Nothing anyone says really helps, it’s just this weird feeling in me that doesn’t ever go away. Just knowing one day that I won’t be here and there’s nothing to do about it drives me insane. I don’t really know if I believe in it, but I’m Jewish and my parents are pretty religious. They try to comfort me by saying that there’s heaven and all that stuff but it doesn’t stick. You just die. You can’t feel or see anything. You’re just nothing. You have no idea what happens after. It’s like I’m having an existential crisis at 17. It comes out of nowhere. I could be having a great time and then the thought just pops up in my brain and I start having a meltdown for HOURS on end. Basically, nothing that anyone says really helps me. I find that it’s only my boyfriend’s presence that calms me down. Problem is, I only see him once a week ~if I’m lucky~ because of distance and our lack of driver licenses. This also happens at night when everyone’s asleep, so I have nobody to talk to. He goes to sleep a lot earlier than me which doesn’t help. He seems to get really frustrated when nothing he says over text helps. To him, it’s comforting. To me, it’s invalidating. I feel like it’s only just his physical presence that can really bring me back to reality when I start freaking out. My family isn’t affectionate and they don’t see to understand it at all, so it’s not like I can really ask them for help. My mom just says “just try to calm down” as if that magically heals something. 
My questions are how do I help him understand?, what can I do to be less dependent on him to calm me down?, and do you have any tips on how to get over this anxiety? 
Also, FYI, this anxiety started out of nowhere in the beginning of middle school. I do see a therapist and that’s how I was diagnosed, but she doesn’t help me and I’m thinking about switching to a different one, which is a whole other story/problem.

I used Tinder and hinge a while. It was reasonably successful and I had plenty of dates but mostly the quality was not as high as I hoped. I mean if you don't like that person you swipe a few minutes and have a new date at hand. It's like fast food. 

My previous GF's I met in real life and the story behind how we met was always kind of interesting and funny to tell. I felt meeting someone in real life led mostly to more meaningful relationships of higher quality. In comparison to Tinder where you literally can meet your partner while popping in the morning and playing with your phone. I exaggerate to make a point.

She then said she's literally ordering food right now too so I should order food to make her feel better.

I found this extremely off putting, is this weird? Or is it rightfully a turn off? I saw it as selfish and not caring at all, I mean I literally told her to talk me out of it and she was like no do it because she needs to feel better.

I think the key for me is someone supportive and I think this shows the complete opposite of that.
