1,pwyons,1632803683,I don’t understand relationships.,"I’m a 21 year old male never been in a relationship. Kinda dumb but I think the problem really comes down to high school. Coming in as a freshmen I was socially awkward and dudes would all ways make fun of me whenever girls were around. By senior year I “glowed up” because girls finally started showing interest in me but my confidence was destroyed so I never pursued. College has really been kind to me because girls actually approach me now without me having to do anything. Now a junior and I’m looking for something more than just a hookup, Dating confuses the hell out of me. Not to sound like a douche but after a couple weeks I lose interest . I get rejected too but it doesn’t even bother me I just move onto the next. I just feel lost I have so many questions because I never had a girlfriend, am I not giving the other person enough time to feel emotionally attached to them? Are relationships even worth it?

Everything was amazing, he is super smart, kind and understanding. All of it is just perfect, except for the timing. I have never experienced this before, the right person wrong time. There is an ninety percent chance that he is moving to a different country in 3 months. I really do like him and I know he feels the same way. But knowing the situation we called it off for now because it would get complicated and we would end up getting hurt if he eventually had to move. But there is a small chance that he does get to stay, but we won't know that for atleast another month. I do hope that happens, but another really decent guy asked me out for next week and I'm so unsure if I should go or not because it feels like some sort of betrayal that I'm not waiting to know if he might stay.

She was super flirty, like asking me to hold her hand to the bathroom, blowing kisses to me, playing with her hair, and a couple other things. 

I was gonna kiss her but unfortunately I was stuck as the bartender the whole night and no opportunity came up and she went home with one of her friends who also came and took her home cause she got too drunk.  I also found out another guy asked her out on a date and one night when I got way to drunk I drunk texted her about it. She told me she only told the guy maybe and they didn’t plan anything.

10,pwzetp,1632806597,Advice,"I have been dating my girlfriend have been dating for about 7 months now and since I have met her I fell in love her and I felt extremely happy and blessed to have her in my life. Everything was was going well until I lied to her a couple weeks into the relationship. She brought up the topic of sex and asked me if I was a virgin and I said no and she said she was a virgin. A couple of seconds later I told her that I was a virgin too. I am not sure why I told her the truth after maybe I felt more comfortable knowing she was I guess?? We got into an argument that I lied to her and she can never trust me and I explained to her why I lied because from past experiences when I told the truth I got made fun of or it was an uncomfortable feeling when I was and the the girls I talked to wasn’t, it made me feel severely judged and I hated that feeling. She was okay and told me not to lie to her again and the next few days was a bit weird but it went back to normal and we made a lot of good memories together and I felt that she loved me as much as I did her.

Another big argument we had was over money, she is very financial literate and she invests her money while I am not so financially literate and don’t invest. I never asked her for money or anything like that. She saved a lot more money than I did and I tend to spend more but never more than I have. I tend to live more in the present and she tends to live more in the future which isn’t bad but it’s a difference between us. We talked about it and I started to save more and spend a lot less because we would like to get married one day. 

Over the course of the relationship we had some small arguments and I always felt it that it was my fault because I accidentally said something wrong and she took personally and we argued over it. She said some things that annoyed me but I never argued/talked about it because for me it was really that big of a deal to talk about it. I felt that during the relationship I was the cause of the arguments and sometimes I felt judged by her. One small disagreement we had was when we talked about our wedding and she wanted to invite her ex( they still are friends) I told her that I felt uncomfortable that she wanted to invite her ex at our wedding and said I had a weird fear that her ex may stop the wedding somehow and tell her that he still loves her. She assured me that she has no feelings for him and she thinks that he doesn’t for her as well. I was okay but I still felt uncomfortable. In the end I kind of gave up because it was going in circles and she kept on trying to convince me that he is not going to do anything and I didn’t want to deal with it anymore so I told her if he comes it’s cool and we ended the conversation. 

She is very in touch with her feelings and really into self love and self care and journals and can easily able to communicate her feelings and express her emotions while I am the complete opposite. Like I do love myself and sure I know I am not perfect and I am trying to improve myself like I am trying to be better at communication For me when we get into arguments I tend to shut down and stay quiet and my mind goes blank and have a difficult time forming sentences because sometimes I genuinely don’t know what to say sometimes. I am trying to change that but not 100% sure how to do so??? 

And recently we had a major argument because I got a hefty speeding ticket and I didn’t tell her right away, I told her a few weeks later because I didn’t want to be judged and start an argument.  She had told me in the past that she doesn’t like my driving because I tend to zig zag and speed a bit and after she told me I stopped doing it while I was with her but continued driving like that while I was alone. For me driving was an escape and it made me feel better but after receiving the ticket I stopped driving that completely and changed my driving habits. 

Now we are in a weird situation because she feels that she can’t trust/respect me anymore and I know I made mistakes and I told her that I am truly am sorry and will make changes to myself and I wrote a list of goals to myself and I am following it. We are okay but now it feels different, before we would talk a lot and now we talk but feels different. I feel this may be the end of our relationship and I really don’t want it to be because I really do love her and she know I do. I always made time for her, I was always there for her, I made her feel special, I always told her how I appreciated her for what she’s done for me and I know she did the same for me but now it feels like she makes it a chore to talk to me and our conversations are a bit brief than normal. I really want this to work out and I feel that I am the one that needs to do a lot of changing which I am definitely going to do.

The only excuse he  gave me was that he had done some thinking and felt like he should be  alone right now and that he thought I was looking for a real  relationship and he couldn't give that to me. This all may be true but  everything before it feels so misleading. The last time I saw him in  person was 24 hours ago and he was so affectionate, loving and we talked  about plans for next week. I just don't know what happened. I guess I'm  just here to vent....I'm thinking i'm going to wait 24 hours and then  send him a text kinda explaining why I'm upset and then let it go.

19,px04yx,1632809720,"As a 32M, will living alone with a 45F roommate hurt my chances?","So, I have kind of a crappy living situation currently, living at a friend's (male) gross house far from the city I work in because I was in a hurry to move after a breakup, and I'm searching for roommate situations online because I can't quite afford to live by myself (not comfortably anyway). A roommate opportunity I'm meeting tomorrow to see the place, is with a 45 year old woman, and the place has everything I'm looking for and a freaking jacuzzi. Moving in too soon with my ex is one of the biggest regrets of my life, so personally no force on earth could convince me to date a roommate, and I'm usually of the opinion that I should avoid dating women who get jealous of platonic relationships I have with women, but I'm wondering if I'm underestimating how it would look and how many women would be bothered by it. 

I was chatting with a woman from Tinder on another app with quick reply rate for about an hour, decided to run the question of what she would think if I ended up living with a 45 year old woman and mentioned the jacuzzi to soften it a bit (I had previously talked to her about other roomy options that fell through), and no more responses. I know this sounds funny, but it's not super important to me that she responds and we both exchanged a lot of red flaggy convo before that so it felt fairly safe, I'm just bringing this up because it sparked me thinking maybe this is a bigger deal than I thought. I'm only really concerned that it will hurt my chances with future dating in general. 

I have a close friends group I have known since high school that is mostly women, and have always considered it a deal breaker that someone is too jealous at the idea that I might hang out with my friends, but I wonder if there's something different about an older woman roommate I hardly know? 

If you would consider a dude living with a female roommate a deal breaker or especially highly concerning, I'd love to better understand why. Most of my adult life I had female roommates who were platonic friends and I didn't really think much of it, but I also didn't really date a lot of that time. If it's a really big deal, I'll probably just wait until I find a better roomy option.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/px04yx/as_a_32m_will_living_alone_with_a_45f_roommate/

I’m a man myself, I can’t think of any more challenges for man, asking someone out is quite low effort, even lower if know the woman likes you.

Con for Women: 
- Women have to wait to be approached, conventional attraction matters meaning more men approach less women.
- women have to use the correct body language to catch the attention of a man they like.
- Some women have to lower their standards as they age because they get approached less.
- Some women have to lower their standards because the men they want don’t approach them.
- Women have to practically artificially augment they appear to attract particular men.

IRL I stopped going to any kind of gathering (especially weddings) no longer because of anxiety. I’m way past that: I can no longer stand happy couples.

33,px2shr,1632822058,Am I missing something?,"So, bear with this is my first time posting on here, here's the story.

Met a boy - lovely 22 year old australian banker who had just moved to the country - at a houseparty. Hit it off and talked for hours. Proceeded to ask me out on a date which was 6 hours long and subsequently many dates over 3 months.

Important moments to highlight in these three months to set the scene for the drama.

1. On our third date he asked what I wanted for this and established that although new here he couldn't ignore the connection and wanted to see where things go. Mentioned I was quite closed off and encouraged me to trust him as he thought this had legs.
2. By 5th date we established exclusivity and said heading towards girlfriend/boyfriend
3. By 6 weeks we decided to take a trip together. Happened at about 9 weeks and we went for 3 days which was amazing/felt very in love. No signs of him not reciprocating - in fact a lot of affirmation from his end
4. At 2 months he told me he loved me (drunk) in the back of an uber after my housewarming where he made not the best impression with my friends by stealing drinks/food. Also ruined someones birthday with an incident involving cake (it's far to specific for me to describe here). I had a go at him for saying that but making no moves to show me any commitment (e.g. asking me to be his girlfriend) and said it was unfair.

4b) Anyway, he affirmed a couple days later that he still felt that way (though never repeated it after) and that ultimately he was scared of responsibility. His job by this point had become very intense and he was hating it a LOT. Ultimately, after I made him realise i was so chill and we had so much fun/such a good time together I would never been a responsibility (because please i've been paying my own way since 18). Ultimately, he said we were basically at the point of being 'official' and would ask on the trip away. Clearly didn't happen

Generally he pushed our relationship and was very vocal about how happy I made him and how he couldn't believe how this had happened. We would see each other twice a week for 3 months and I had begun introducing him to my friends etc. This was the first relationship I had experienced (lets forget those situationships) since 2018 and I was so happy/we never argued and I felt very safe. I also let my guard down that I had been building for three years.

Fast forward to a week ago we ended up on a night out as the mutual connection went out where I was with my uni friends. He was again super drunk (context he didnt usually drink but was so wayward when drunk) and was drinking my friends drinks/being excessive with people in the group. My friend asked me to ask him to calm down as people felt uncomfortable so I pulled him to the side. He started getting upset about work (he had been trying to quit his job, but had relocation costs that he couldn't currently payback) and how london wasn't what he thought it would be. Bearing in mind we had spent the night together on wednesday and he had stayed over to go to work. On that night we were probably our most coupley too and he kept asking if I trusted him, if I was happy and how much I made him smile. So no sign of the shitshow to come. Anyway, I calm him down and we have a lovely time. I'm not sober at this point and actually we were taking very coupely photos/being very touchy. I can't remember how or why but suddenly says:

I can't commit to this.

In the middle of the club. In front of our friends. I'm drunk.

So, I walk away and pretend nothing happens until he follows me and convinces me to talk outside. Now, I don't remember much from emotion/drunkness but essentially he said he wasn't ready and wasn't stable. He didn't know what he wanted from life but it all tied back to his job. I kept saying that I get it but how did it impact us because I'd stand by him whatever decision he'd make. My friends start to leave the club and clearly im upset but I make him drop me home. We then proceed to continue to the convo in my flat and I cry hysterically in the bathroom. (Not my finest moment) My flatmates come back and I proceed to tell him that I'm confused because before the trip or meeting my friends I always gave him an 'out' to leave. I then start to say that it didn't matter where he was I wanted to give it a go. He says nothing. He then proceeds to say that he wants to be in my life 'to check in' and he didn't want me to close off from others (the audacity).

My flatmate tells him to leave and then I go to sleep crying. (not my finest moment part 2)

Next day he says that he's sorry he wasn't honest earlier but only realised this week (again lets remember there was less than 48 hours of me seeing him). I then make him return my dresses and we had a conversation. I essentially told him he was downright disrespectful for doing it the way he did and that I'm confused as he pursued the trip and the i love you blah blah. He proceeded to say whether he told me now or 2 weeks it wouldn't change and that I meant more to him than I had summed up (bs because clearly no respect). Also that he wasn't stable and had a lot on him recently. I then said I didn't want to be with someone who didn't want me and I deserve better. Also said we couldn't be friends because we were never friends to begin with and we would never bump into eachother. Ultimately I also told him that shit happens in life and at some point you have to take accountability and figure your shit out and not hurt people in the process. We hugged and he said take care before saying 'be open'. (the fucking audacity part 2).

It's only been like 10 days but because we only have good memories (sans break up) I'm struggling to be okay. Like I'm fine I have work and a strong social life, but I miss him for him. I remember saying he could be a binman but I believed so strongly our connection was rare enough to give it a go. He even said he had the best 3 months of his life and whilst I get and respect he may be going through something and needs to be by himself. I can't help and feel that I'm the one who lost. I feel so vulnerable and so betrayed (?) because I feel like my trust is so destroyed after I worked for so long to not let people in.

Did I miss the red flags? Am I stupid? The worst thing is I realised that week that I love him too. It was one of those loving in the simplicity you know.

35,px2ze0,1632822950,Talking about sex makes this girl feel uncomfortable!,"So I've been talking with this girl for a while now and we probably might date each other soon. It's been going really well. But I think I kind of made her uncomfortable earlier when I was talking about tits. And I don't think I crossed the line much at all and didn't really think it was that bad of a conversation but to be unbiased I want yalls outside opinions. Some of yall on reddit are very dramatic though so I'm only taking to heart the ones that are speaking reasonably. Lol. So she was showing me her piercings and firstly I had taken some testosterone pills before I worked out that makes me insanely horny and secondly her profile says she's open minded and loves talking about open minded things. So I told her that I love her piercings and that I think they make her look really hot and that piercings have always been a turn on for me. And then we talk about it for a little while and different kinds of piercings and then I bring up that the last girl I hooked up with had a tongue ring and nipple ring and I thought it was hot but also looked like it hurts. Then she said she thought about it once but was too scared and then i said I don't blame you it looks painful. Ok a little more small talk about it then I tell her how I love tits and how at work they were asking everyone ""ass or tits"" and I'm the only one that said tits. And then she says that well I struggle in that section mine is just a handful but I tell her that I like all sizes and would love them and she said oh then I said sorry I be too horny today then went into regular conversations with her. That's all that was said sexually just that. So tonight I ask her if she uncomfortable with that kind of talk and that I apologize that it was so random and told her I was on the pills but didn't ever want to make her uncomfortable. Really I'm just seeing what her boundaries are and stuff and how far I can go. So she says that I made her feel like she wasn't good enough. I don't know where the heck she's getting this from because I said literally nothing that implied that she wasn't good enough. I literally clarified that I like all size tits they are all great. So part of me says that maybe I shouldn't have brought up this conversation with her but the other part is saying we're both in our 20s and should be comfortable with sex talk by now and that I'm not using any girl or her for sex and want something real and a real relationship but guess what people in real relationships have sex. So why can't sex be talked about? And I'm not saying for her to have sex with me and rush things. Like sex isn't fun for me if she isn't having fun so I want her to be comfortable with it first but if you can't even talk about it you're not ever gonna be comfortable with it. And I'm a real sexual person looking for a girl that's somewhat the same and like not instantly I mean down the road after we're dating. But if I can't ever get sex or talk about it then I'm gonna start being unhappy and the guys happiness matters too. So idk I'll see how unopen she is about it but I gotta have my sex and I want the girl to feel the same way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/px2ze0/talking_about_sex_makes_this_girl_feel/
36,px2znp,1632822986,30M feeling very depressed about simple rejection,"About a month ago, I started seeing a woman from OKCupid. 10 hours ago, she called things off, saying she wanted to see someone else.

Now, some people might not mind that as much as I do, but I struggle with clinical depression even on usual days, plus my luck with online dating - over the past two and a half years! - has been utterly terrible. I've maybe had three first dates over that timeframe. As a result, it sent my mind into a dark place.

She told me that she thought I was a ""great, loving"" guy, and that the only thing she thought I could have done better was me asking her more questions, but I just don't know if or how I can believe that.

I tried to decompress what happened, but I could only come up with the following ideas: One, she left for someone more conventionally attractive; Two, she left for someone who already had a car; Or, three, she left for someone who didn't have likely symptoms of ED. Of course, unless I ask her what went wrong, I will likely never know for sure.

we had a convo over the phone after our 2nd date(after drinking with her friends). i brought up a moment. she had sent me a picture of a painting she did of these sunflowers i bought her. i mention how adorable she was for painting flowers i bought her. 

her response was: “dont call me adorable. it makes me feel like a 14 year old girl.” and the  she carried on, “i would have painted sunflowers regardless” 

fucking ouch. i ended the call pretty quickly. i was hurt. i was confused. i just complimented her on something so sentimental that i thought was really really sweet of her to do. 

i slept on it and called her in the am. i said “maybe we should stay patient, and wait for our person?” kinda tried to give her an easy way out. but the actual phone call was to give her a chance so say the right things. she first stated that was a joke. i told her it did not feel like one. then she proceed to change her reason to; she was drunk and in a competitive mood. then lastly added that she knows she self sabotages herself. 

now i know she has walls. im prepared for them. and we talked about it. 

i continue to give her compliments or be cute. we’ve had thunderstorms on two out of our 3 dates. im trying to correlate them with our personalities and relationship. she told me “your thinking to much into it”.

Also I would line to get a chance to explore sexually the same way most women get to with a few different partners. So I really don’t want to be with one person sexually my entire life. But that’s besides the point.

There has to be an age where if you’re a virgin it looks bad and I’m thinking I’m getting close.

No (abandonment issues). But very much emotionally available and excited for something new. We became official in late March, even as far as saying “I love you” and everything has been good since. In June, I had a work meeting where my ex was involved while my gf was at my apartment. While I felt a little uncomfortable for my new gf, I was certain I was over my ex.

This is a message I get from 70% of the guys I am talking to EVERY DAY!

This is a clear symptom of low self esteem and bad past experiences, which you let them define your own reality of the world.

Let me ask YOU this:

IF YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT YOU DESERVE SOMEONE SPECIAL, HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO FIND HER?🤔

🔸I know you may feel lonely and depressed at the moment.

🔸I know you may feel not attractive enough because women don't express their interest to you.

It may seem impossible to believe that you deserve someone special.

❗This is just a frame from which you perceive the world. It's a negative state that you are stuck in and defines your everyday life.

✅The good news?

Frames can change. And the only responsible for this is YOU AND ONLY YOU. Sit down, grab a piece of paper and set up the frames you perceive the world. 

✅Write down "" I deserve to be loved, I deserve to have someone special by my side"" Keep it on your desk and see it everyday. 

Suddenly, the world around you will change. People are going to give you love in unexpected ways.

Repeat this, with all your negative frames. Turn them into positive ones and believe them by default. 

As Wayne Dyer said: ""If you change the way you look at things the things you look at, will change""

Put the effort into changing your beliefs and stop complaining about your life circumstances, simply because

 YOU ARE THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES.

None of this dates have lead to a second date. I’m a decent looking guy (6’2”, athletic body with 10% body fat, dark thick wavy hair and brown eyes). I’m social and can talk easily to new people. However, I have a rare condition in my right leg and I’ve had it since I was born. It makes me limp a little bit, it depends on the day. The limp is not huge, it’s something along the lines of a strained ankle, but you’ll notice it if you’re walking with me. It is permanent and can’t be fixed completely. I have been through some hard things because of it and I can only talk about it to my mother, brother and best friends. I would never make it a big deal in a relationship or mention it because I wanna live a normal life just like everyone else does. I live an active and healthy lifestyle (running, gym, etc.) and I can do all the same things that everyone else can, I just will never be a super athlete. I feel like I lost some years of dating because it was hard for me to put myself out there. The problem is that it is not an easy topic for me to talk about, especially on a first date with a random girl.

It is a really hard situation when I can see that the girl has noticed it but neither one of us wants to bring it up. It was pretty obvious on saturday when I grabbed some coffee with this girl and we walked around the city for like 2 hours. We had really fun and a lot in common but again, no second date.

65,px7hxw,1632839016,"Is it my fault I am still single at 24, or was it my upbringing?","I was raised on screens. For years as a child, I was addicted to video games. What doesn't help was that I was going through online school as well, how the people around me enabled me to remain blind, or how i was basically locked in my room for years as a kid. I have always felt lonely, my friends are all behind pixels currently, and I never found my clique growing up because of social deprivation and isolation. I guess this is how people truly die, alone and slow and unsure of how to express it.

Neither of my parents dated anyone before meeting each other at 21, they have no expressed romantic qualities, I never inherited any, never developed any because of social isolation growing up, and I don't know if it's my fault because of what I do or don't know or haven't done yet out of ignorance or complacency.

I went NEET after school. the last time i was with a group of people my age was before high/online school, and i think I missed out on something incredibly crucial growing up. I don't like being so quiet and shy, I have been recovering. I have learned a fuck ton about all kinds of subjects in my isolation, and now I'm just taking care of myself and my future, I have a plan, just no one to love along the way.

I feel something. I don't know exactly what, but it scared me. Enough to kick start my facial hair and wake me up to my damage. my family enabling me out of love and never forcing me to do anything had crippled me out of complacency, I was the ""good kid"" growing up. I was diagnosed autistic as a toddler, always had a hard time talking to people irl, and I was locked in a closet for days sometimes as a child as ""discipline"" because of my behavior. It has been a long road to recovery. 

I often feel like I am going to be single my whole life, it is all I have ever known. I have never been in a relationship, only dates. I think im too quiet, weird, socially awkward or something, or maybe i haven't met who matches it yet, i don't know anymore...

I'm going to keep making money, invest what I can, as much as I can, and one day help out as many kids as I can because I don't want any to be raised to be as isolated and addicted as I was. I know what it's like to grow up all alone and unsure of how to express myself or even have friends to express that to, to be stuck in a box every day with these screens, it isn't healthy. And now I look around at all these kids going through the same hell I had to, and it makes me so angry.

I like normal stuff, too, like being outside, seeing new places, trying new places to eat, but I'm very much an anomaly in my interests especially out here in the suburbs where a lot of people enjoy their sports, their breweries, and outdoor activities. 

I can occasionally match and talk with women who think I am ""hot"" because I have a muscular body and am subjectively handsome, but beyond the fact we're having a normal conversation and there's sexual attraction, I don't really feel like they ""get"" me or care about my interests.

Been in a serious relationship for almost two years, it has largely been great. As we've gotten closer and deeper we've been more open about both historical hurts and current stressors and struggles.

The reality is that I've experienced much less historical trauma then my partner and have less current stressors and struggles in my day to day life. And I'm doing my best to support my partner in their stress, as a shoulder to cry on, a helping hand, etc.

But, this imbalance, where my partner is often looking for support and I am not is causing some distance in our relationship. My partner feels reluctant to share their struggles and hurts when I am not also sharing and expressing mine, but the reality is I just don't really have anything major and expressing trivial things seems inappropriate as well. I don't want to make up some hurt or pretend issues are bigger then they are, I don't feel like I'm burying my emotions or ignoring struggles.

You briefly encounter a very attractive woman going the same destination as you on train.

The slight blush and look of interest makes you wonder more if she’s into you as you both get on. You don’t wanna be a creep and invade her personal space after you’ve both taken a seat. As a guy we are naturally eager to want to talk to her and maybe get her number. But most of us level headed guys wanna approach with a sense of humor and not come across like a predator so we end up overthinking shit (especially with 2021 societal culture) and bail out of making any moves only to endure the ‘what if’ post-regret.

A week or so ago, when he was video calling me, he went into the living room of his house and video called - as opposed to from his bedroom. And was in a hurry to hang up.
So ofcourse I felt suspicious and also it's been bothering me that he's in touch with his ex from college. So I went full FBI mode and found that she was in his city on THE SAME DAY OF THAT VIDEO CALL and was there for a week or so.
She lives in another state. 

I found some more intimate pictures of them on public blogs of hers. Turns out they have pictures atleast till 2018 and he had told me they just dated for two months in 2014 but were otherwise friends. She was also visiting him on the weekends when he moved to a new city for work.

I don't care what happened in the past but I'm a little weirded out by the pictures on public websites. Especially one of him lifting her up. It's messing with me.

AND I know I have no proof but my gut tells me they met when she was in his city recently and he hid it from me. It's possible that he may NOT have met her (am I paranoid?). He says they talk once a month.

I did bring this up subtly with him because I am wary of men due to past experiences with men who keep in touch with their exes. But he seems devoted and very sweet. But there is still a nagging feeling. I don't know how to shake it off.

So, in my case, got out of a long relationship and back into the dating scene, just about to turn 30. I don’t consider myself to be ugly nor very attractive, but matching with like minded people on dating apps has buen extremely difficult. 

My takeaways from the past two weeks are:

- If you don’t pay, you don’t get as much matches. 
- There are way too many bots. 
- People seem to be into hook ups rather than having a decent conversation. 
- people match and don’t talk or reply in monosyllables. Smh 

At this point I feel like after lockdown the amount of people using these apps have increased significantly and the companies know that. The quality of the service imo has decreased significantly compared to 6 years ago (where I met my last partner). 

Is anyone else having similar experiences? What are your thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxai2m/what_are_the_key_points_for_success_on_dating/
93,pxajq0,1632847808,Dating Someone with a Very Different Social Life,"So, I’ve matched with someone on bumble and thus far the conversation’s gone great, in terms of their appearance they’re exactly my type, we share quite a few interests and they seem interested in getting to know me too. I noticed that it says they never drink on their profile though whilst I have the drinking habits of a stereotypical uni student and (although it’s not something I take pride in) my social life kind of revolves around alcohol and only really see my friends at parties, pubs or clubs. I would like to spend more time with people doing things that didn’t involve me drinking and I honestly think they’d have the potential to significantly improve me as a person. Despite this I think it could make group interactions quite uncomfortable for them if meeting my friends and also (this is particularly aimed at any sober people reading this) is a sober person and someone who’s bordering the point where they’re deemed a high functioning alcoholic ever compatible?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxajq0/dating_someone_with_a_very_different_social_life/
94,pxakec,1632847861,"Girl was into me, I didn't text and plans fell through. Should I have texted?","I had a coworker that I was certain was into me. All the signs were there. She was the one that started being a lot more chatty and flirting with me at work (she began teasing me all the time). She would offer to drive me home every time from work. She made up some bad excuse to get my number. She would talk about me all the time to other coworkers. She would occasionally compliment me, calling me cute or saying I have nice features. She would bump into me jokingly, and would get me to do things like get her coat for her. She would always bring up going out for drinks, or going to the movies. She would walk over to me during our shifts, and stand super close to me when we talked. We would text all the time, sometimes after our shifts. When she broke up with her boyfriend, she brought it up to me several times. 

Here's where I think I fucked up. When she brought up she broke up with her boyfriend, it was one of her last shifts at our company. I didn't press further because I didn't want to seem rude. But when she drove me home that night, she seemed kind of dejected, and was just like ""I'm sure I'll see you around"". I think she wanted me to show a bigger interest in the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend. I then invited her out to join me and my other friend going to a club later that week. She said she's going to get her schedule from work and that she'd come if she wasn't working. This is where I think I fucked up the 2nd time. I texted her later that week saying the plan, and she said she'd let me know. Then the day of, I didn't text her, and I never heard anything from her, so I went to the club without her. My friend told me that some girls want you to text them the day you're supposed to go out that night so they feel like they're wanted. I was just trying to not be pushy. He also said I should've invited her to do a 1 on 1 thing rather than to join my friends. After that we stopped talking completely.

Please tell me I'm not crazy, this girl was into me right? I've started to gaslight myself into thinking maybe she was never into me, but I do believe it was because of mistakes I made that it never worked out.

95,pxalqx,1632847970,How do you narrow down your possibilities when you're dating a few people at a time?,"I (36m) started dating again about a month ago. Recently, I've gotten a little more lucky and have found 4 women I'm interested in.

I'm trouble deciding between them. They're all sweet, intelligent, hard-working, attractive, and we have good communication and seem to have a lot of fun.

I know that no decision can account for all possibilities, but I honestly just can't decide between them.

The problem is, I know that I'll have to because eventually, one or all of them are going to want things to progress, and so do I. I want to only be with one person.

How do you handle these situations? Or do you maybe have advice for me personally?

Trying to go out with each of them 1-2 times a week is exhausting. I don't have this much spare time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxalqx/how_do_you_narrow_down_your_possibilities_when/
96,pxat3f,1632848529,How is my intuition always right about a girl,"If I even think it's over with me and a girl I am almost always correct. For instance I met this girl a couple weeks ago and talked to her for a bit. Nice thing was she actually asked me to hangout which is unusual. We hangout a week later. We went on a hike that lasted over 2 hrs. We walked FAR and my feet hurt terribly the next day haha. Not once did she try and turn around etc.. and we had an amazing time. I said I want to see you again and to text me when she got home. Overall great day, great date, great conversations and laughs. No distractions all good

After 1hr I didn't hear back so I decided to text her and said ""Hey hope you made it home alright"" she said ""yea I'm just relaxing""

In that exact moment I knew this was over before it even began. 

I said I had a great time and can't wait to see her again and never heard back from her again LOL.

But I KNEW! Before I even had a response from her getting home that is was over. To me that's some crazy shit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxat3f/how_is_my_intuition_always_right_about_a_girl/
97,pxayg0,1632848946,I don't know how I feel about her,"So I've (M25) known this girl (F26) for about 2 weeks. First date was lumch for about an hour, 2nd date ended up lasting about 5 hours since we kept doing stuff, ended with kissing. The third date was at her place the day after the 2nd date. We ended up having sex and stayed in bed for like an hour or so. 

We texted later that night and both agreed we felt confused and she felt kinda sad that it may have happened too fast. We both kind of regret it happening how it did. We also both said we still like eachother but since we're both confused about everything not I'm not sure.

Neither of us are really sure why we're feeling the way we are. I think the last time she's had sex might have been 2 years ago but I didn't ask her explicitly. The last time I've had sex was around 5 years ago.
Leading up to the dates I was really excited to be with her and talk to her, etc. But now, like I said I'm really confused about everything for some reason. I don't remember sex effecting me this much the first time.

I still think I like her. Like I liked cuddlingand kissing afterwards and still think positively about just chilling with her again but I feel like because I'm not infatuated or super sure that it's a bad sign.  I'm just not really sure what to do at all right now and could use some help.

TL;DR: slept with girl on 3rd date, now we both feel weird/confused and I don't know what to do or feel right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxayg0/i_dont_know_how_i_feel_about_her/
98,pxb7yu,1632849727,Just went on womens dating strategy and now I am confused. Need advice from people.,"Hello I am a 19 year old dude who has been in one relationship (didn’t end well I got cheated on but oh well we move) and I thought to myself I could be doing things wrong so what’s a better place to hear what women look for than straight from them right?

I went there and now I am just confused I see things in the same post that talk about women wanting a man who is very progressive etc then they talk about how they want men to uphold standards that seem to go against it and I don’t know what to do. I would like to think I am a somewhat decent guy who is progressive, I want to be involved with my future kids a lot, help look after the house and family(if I am lucky enough find someone who would like to have kids), like standard progressive things. 

I guess what I am trying to say is how can I improve as a guy and do you guys agree with what gets posted on women’s dating strategy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxb7yu/just_went_on_womens_dating_strategy_and_now_i_am/
