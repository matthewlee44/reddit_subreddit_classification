1,op7uqt,1626933340,Is social media important for dating?,"(M, 24) I'm going back to college in 2 weeks, and I don't have any social media accounts. I'm probably not gonna think about dating, with all the organizations I want to be in. But if I were to meet someone that I match well with, would I need something like Snapchat or Instagram? I know people use Snap for ""can I get your #"" more than just a phone number. But I hate Snapchat, Insta, FB, all of them. They're so silly to me and the posts on all of them are unoriginal, and build envy. For the record, I look good and am in shape. I just live in a tiny rural TN town, and seeing posts from people I'm not really friends with/haven't seen in forever just wasn't worth it to me. There isn't a dating pool here at all, so seeing tons of posts and ads about dating and sex that make me feel left out, that just became too much. Social media is just really toxic in general. Would it be off-putting to a girl that's interested in me if I don't have social media?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op7uqt/is_social_media_important_for_dating/

A little background on myself. I am a 28yr old male and I have been in 5 total relationships 2 of which were long term. and the last one ending after 4 years in 2012. Ever since then I haven’t felt very good about myself. Lack of self esteem. The last relationship really broke me even though we ended on ok terms. 

Recently (the last 3 years) I’ve been getting back into being healthy and confident again. Dealing with anxiety but slowly building myself up as best as I can! The whole thing is. It’s been so long that I’ve even tried to engage in anything other than just friendships with women that I wouldn’t really know where to start with dating again… 

I have a few mutual friends who try to hook me up with girls sometimes but that’s not what I want. I want to find someone with similar interests who is independent with her endeavors as well. I like someone who chases their dreams. Someone I can spend time talking to about those dreams and mine. I am not a bad looking guy either! I’m 6ft 192lbs with long black hair and quite a few tattoos. I take very good care of myself. 

I just don’t know where to start with the whole thing lol. There are a few girls who I have a mutual friends with other but it’s kinda hard meeting people right now especially with the whole new covid variants going on :(. We’re mutual friends on social media’s so maybe I could start there? Idk lol

After the date he even said he wants me to set the second date basically showed interest for a second date but you know you just have this gut feeling things are not going to work. I thought it was just my overthinking. 

I asked him on a second date he sound excited, after couple hours he said he was busy but wants to reschedule it. We even add each other on steam to play games. The talking was going good too like nothing weird was sticking out! 

We were planning to play games and the next thing I see was he deleted me from every social platform. 

Why people just ghost people out of nowhere? Or I didn’t get the message he was sending. Because if I had the impression if he didn’t want to keep talking I wouldn’t push things.

2. What kind of compliments do girls enjoy receiving even if by a somewhat random guy you think is somewhat cute?

-Compliment something specific, but none sexual: ""You have a nice smile"" ""You have a pretty smile"" ? ""I like your eyelashes"" ""your hair looks good like that"" ""You have beautiful eyes""

i' know that if i' m with her in the future obviously this isn't the safest play of my life...maybe i'm risking to much but i like her a lot, and she is willing to break up with him for now and take a time to re-think if she wants to be with some one or not... we will see, i'm confident enough that i can be his boyfriend but is she going to cheat me... that's the real thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opdg3o/i_like_this_girl_but_she_cheated/
44,opdg9r,1626959219,Afraid of doing anything physical,"Hello, 34 y/o male here. I haven't dated anyone in a very long time (26), but I started talking to a nice girl on Tinder shortly before I left for a maritime school last year and I was gone for 9 months. We still kept in touch and started to hang out in June, for a total of 5 times.

We've had good times together and have always ended with a hug, nothing other than that.

But now, she has invited me over to her place to watch a movie and I'm not sure how to initiate any kind of physical stuff (cuddling) or anything because I have an irrational fear that she will freak out or something. When is it appropriate? Should I sit close to her? I don't know these things and almost feel pressured to do it or she will think I'm not romantically interested.

I was at work at a coffee shop when a pretty chick asked for my number. I was surprised an gave it to her. We text for a bit and I ask her to lunch, she agrees and the date is on. 

The day before the date she messages me asking for my Instagram saying her sister wants to see a photo of me. I give her my account handle. The next text I get says “don’t worry about tomorrow. You’ve gotta girl :)))”. Clearly she snooped into my insta and saw my ex girl. I archived the obvious posts of her but there were a couple of other photos of in there she must have found. 

I say ‘ That’s my ex’ and leave it till the morning. She didn’t reply, I messaged her saying that was a really past thing and I’m just keen to have lunch and meet her. She didn’t even open the message. After the time of the date was passed I just deleted her number.

I just needed to vent because it really was my first shot in so long. I don’t even feel like I did anything wrong but I’ve gone through and cleaned my socials. Honestly, part of me doesn’t mind because I didn’t loss anything in the situation as she came to me randomly. But I am disappointed because I did have my hopes up to go on a date.

49,ope7aa,1626961785,Uni friend (22F) from back home wants to hang out next time I (24F) visit the city. I suggested drinks on a friday/saturday night.,"One of my friends I met my last year in school that i've always crushed on a bit wants to hang out with me whenever I get back in town. We've never hung out 1-on-1 before because of the pandemic, but I suggested getting drinks friday or saturday night next month and she was really enthusiastic about it. I know I didn't exactly specify that it's a date as I wanted to keep it somewhat casual since this is our first 1-on-1 meetup (weve only hung out in group setting during school before the pandemic so it was hard to isolate ourselves together during that short timespan of 2019).

Just a little background info of us. She first introduced herself to me at the start of the school year and added me on social some weeks later. We usually only text at least once a week or a couple times a month but going back over a lot of our texts during 2020 she was a bit flirtatious with me (calling my pictures cute/handsome, cool hair, etc. etc.) and joking around a lot. When I recently got in touch with her was when she suggested that we should finally hang out together and she missed seeing me (havn't seen her in over a year since pandemic started).

**Does this sound like she's interested?** I never could properly get to know her personally (just the two of us) or ask her out since the couple of months we did see each other in school I was working 30 hours a week and doing senior design so it was very difficult. I feel like most of it was just bad timing with me graduating + coronavirus too. I figured I could take her out for a light dinner and chat over drinks and just see where things go before even thinking about a proper second date. She's always been pretty shy so her wanting to see me just kind of felt like a big deal.

I will be starting college soon and I’ve thought about dating and stuff a bit more lately I guess. 

However, I guess I’ve been spending too much time on the internet (Reddit especially) bc I feel like I hear so many people talking about how “holding sex on a pedestal” is stupid and “it’s just sex” and that people who don’t do casual sex and only want to sleep with people they are in serious relationships with are weird and now I think something I wrong with me. I don’t think I necessarily put sex on a pedestal, but I just don’t like the idea of someone I don’t love or care about touching my body…it just makes me uncomfortable. Am I weird?

Like, I commented on a post about sex and hookups on a different sub where I said something about seeing sex as something very intimate (to me personally) and I had some people acting like I was weird. Is there something wrong with me? I am just legitimately repulsed at the idea of allowing random people to touch me like that (I am *not* repulsed by people who enjoy casual sex).

After she dumped me (we were never really together so hardly a dumping but it still hurt) I figured everything I knew in love was wrong, so I started seeing other people and hooking up without that emotional connection or trust. I didn’t like it that much. One of the 2 girls I hooked up with was only because I knew girls liked my body and I was very lonely. So I traded sex for companionship.

59,opf8u6,1626965109,Is there another way to look at this situation?,"I (30M) have been trying to get in to dating for many years without any success. I have been on dating apps for about 6 years, I have been on matchfinder websites, I have gone to social clubs, tried to go out whenever a work group or personal friend has organized something social. I drink, smoke, and sometimes use drugs socially but never alone. I think I am very presentable, I am told I am very friendly and well-spoken. I see myself as a bit dry and dull but equally I'm told I'm actually very interesting and I regularly host parties that everyone seems to really enjoy coming to so I can't be that dull. I feel a little like bragging here which is not good but I do think my interests and knowledge and hobbies extend across such a broad spectrum I really can offer something for pretty much anyone. I have had male and female friends go through my app profiles and the like and everything seems to be both well-presented and accurate... 

Yet there is nothing. I have not met a single person in nearing 8 years. I repeatedly find someone I am interested in only to exchange a few words before they seem to think nothing clicks and move on to someone else. I have seen friends fall out of long-term relationships, date as a single person for a while, find a new mate, develop a long-term partnership, and now everyone in my social circle is starting to settle down and marry. Its not even a failure at dating its like I can't even make it past those first initial barriers of chatting and making a basic level connection with someone before they decide they're not really that in to me. 

I am really at my wits end. I have long-standing issues with depression and absent self-esteem (I don't really understand the concept?). I don't want a relationship to get rid of these things but equally its hard to see anything positive in myself when my attempts are just met with this constant low-level rejection. Is it better to switch off and just hope I luck into something and don't wind up one of those sad lonely people who've never had romance in their life, or is there something more proactive I'm just completely missing?

76,oph526,1626970581,"Reasons women say no to a second date after a ""good"" first one","1. Gross teeth/bad breath


Please fellas, use mints/gum. And brush your teeth before a date. Plaque is nasty and if your date notices she is not going to want to kiss you. Teeth whitening kits are $30 at most supermarkets.... If you need one, use one. 


2. Clothes


Wear CLEAN clothes that fit well.  Wear Nice pants or shorts ( no basketball shorts or cargo shorts on a first date). You're trying to make a good first impression. No holes unless the clothing is made that way, and absolutely no stains . And fellas, if your date is at 6 p.m. do not come wearing the same shirt you put on at 6a.m. Even if you're a clean and hygienic guy, it's not going to smell like downy anymore and she's going to think you have B.O. Bonus points if you're wearing something that isn't in your OLD pics. 


3. Shit talking how hard dating is. 


Don't complain about OLD apps, the women you've met on them, or your other exes. It comes across as bitter AF and misogynistic. 


4. Negativity


If you spend most of the date complaining about your job, your family, your dating past, your friends, the pandemic, etc... It's going to be a major turn off. Very few women want to date or fuck someone that they feel sorry for. Save all your drama and bullshit for your therapist, close friends, or for future dates when you've built an emotional connection

5. Being too complimentary. 


You don't need to shower your date with compliments the entire time. If you do, it comes across cheesy and disingenuous.


6. Getting too deep too fast. 


Don't ask about her biggest regrets, sexual history,  break ups, ten year plan, etc. Avoid topics like religion and politics. Don't mention money at all. 


7. Getting too invested. 


Just enjoy the moment.. the only plans you should discuss on the first date, are the plans for the second date (and honestly I wouldn't even do that. So many times I see posts where OP is confused about why she would agree to a second date during the first and then ghost/cancel. Truth is most of those times she just agreed because you were in front of her when she asked  it's just super weird and awkward to reject a total stranger to their face on a date). Even if you're joking, do not talk about future dates, holidays together, vacations, and God forbid what your kids would look like or what you'd want to name them. 


8. Being too sexual or touchy feely


Fellas, I see this topic thrown around and discussed a lot on dating subreddits. It is 100% better to not physical enough than to be too physical. I've never said no to a second date because the guy wasn't physical or didn't go for a kiss, but I have said no because he acted in the opposite way (and I fucking love sex and have a high sex drive). Truth is, too many guys only want sex and even if you are not one of those guys, if you lead with that she's just going to assume that you are.


9. Making it too long/Trying too hard


Fellas, keep it short, sweet, and casual. Leave her wanting more! She shouldn't think that she knows your entire life story after the first date, and if she does, she might not be in a huge rush to see you and learn more. Don't plan a date that will last hours and don't take her to a fancy expensive restaurant. Meet for a couple rounds of drinks, one cup of coffee, play one game of bowling. 
And lastly...


10. It wasn't fun

77,ophav6,1626971035,Struggling to connect with Americans,"First of all thank you to everyone who responded to my last post here (What they really mean), even if I didn't interacted a lot due to mental condition but I have read all of your comments. Thank you. 

As an immigrant living here in the United States since 2017, I find it very challenging to connect with Americans when it comes to dating, im 31 y/o gay, so I am basically looking for 31 to 45 y/o, so basically not into younger than me, and not too old either that we would end up having nothing in common due to age gap. I know it is extremely difficult to find a good match in the gay world, I am also surprised to find out is not that shiny and glowing in the straight world as well. 
The only time I had a mutual connection with an American is when I was living in rural Oregon in during the fall of 2017, but things were bit complicated back then and it would be impossible to have a relationship. 
Since I moved back to NYC in 2019, I never had a genuine connection even sexual with an American,  it's always a one time date or a one time sex, the only American guys who seem interested in me are guys older than 50. 
On the flip side, I had genuine connections with Europeans, even if they didn't lead to the outcome that I truly want (wich is a Long-term relationship), but I could see that there was something,  like multiple dates, good sex, or even friendship. Actually the only 3 guys I felt something for since I moved to New York were 3 Europeans(a French, a British and a German), im still friend with the French guy(who recently told me that he wants to go back to Europe cause he's having the same problem, he can't find genuine connections with Americans).

When I put my tinder in Europe, I can have hundreds of matches in a week and endless conversations, but due to the distance and also with travel it's almost impossible to have a follow up. On the other hand, I rarely get matches when I put my profile locally and when I do the conversations always end up dry and one of us will quickly lose interest. 

I met a guy in 2019, before I moved to NYC, he lives in DC, he didn't want to get serious, he kept saying that I'm too far, but now he's in a serious relationship with someone who lives in Philly(while he keeps asking me to have sex with him, I recently ask him why he wants chose the other guy over me, he honestly said that he always saw me as a sex friend, nothing more. On the flip side, I met this Austrian guy at the gym, we were both attracted to each other, but he said he can't go any further cause he's in a relationship(that was a great sign of respect for me), and now we're friends and he's the person I chat the most with on WhatsApp, like basically everyday.

Sometimes I wonder if the problem is me, or if it's a cultural shock, I don't know.  And wonder if some of you have noticed that pattern. 

P.S: I was born in Haiti, lived there til 21, and also spent 5 years living in Dominican Republic.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ophav6/struggling_to_connect_with_americans/

This girl and I have been talking for a while. She's big into piercings and stuff, mostly on her ear. She also has a septum piercing, which is fine, not my favorite but I can live with it

The thing is, she recently also got a nose ring. And now it just looks like too much. I can't help but think it's unattractive and it really turns me off.

She's amazing in every other way. But I don't see myself being attracted to her while she has it

80,ophnnu,1626972070,Do guys prefer cute girls or pretty/beautiful girls in general when it comes to dating in your country?,"I’ve always wondered which is more popular overall in the dating world in your country? 

Cute is someone who is usually short, looks younger than their age, other features are things like dimples and more of a roundish face, not necessarily slim or head turning stunning but just cute I guess. Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez are celeb examples. (I know this type is popular in places like Japan)

The pretty type are girls who look like models, usually have a more sharp features and grace, blessed with good genes and usually have a good feminine figure. Celebs like Scarlet Johansen and Angelina Jolie. 

There’s also the sexy type like Rihanna and Beyonce.

81,opho0w,1626972099,Moving on from a long term relationship with little passion to following my heart,"I posted this in a comment somewhere but:

I was in a long term relationship for 6 years that was going south. Had a crush on another girl (NOT the reason my ex and I broke up). Recently went with my crush and other friends in our friend group to the Bucks game 6 in Milwaukee at the deer district where crowds were ridiculous. We held hands through the crowds and kept each other close. There was a point where we were just standing and holding hands watching the game. Honestly, I've never felt such a rush like that with my ex. It was amazing. Her hands are the softest I've ever felt and I could've held them for hours. Never felt this with my ex.

We're really good friends. But to my knowledge, she didn't know I liked her, especially since I'm coming out of a long term relationship. But our interactions always seem a bit too flirty for just friends and we make each other laugh a ton. The 2 of us drove 1.5 hours to and from the game and we have such great conversations that are very open and authentic. 

I ended up confessing to her after the game when I dropped her off at like 2:30AM. She was smiling a ton and I couldn't stop blushing or having a goofy grin. She was really thankful I told her instead of keeping it to myself. Didn't reject me or reciprocate though. We agreed I should be single for a while after my LTR, but I really hope this goes somewhere down the road. She agreed to be my +1 for some upcoming weddings so I'm super excited for that. We're also going to the bars tonight with some friends so we'll see how that goes 😅 

We're both in our mid to late 20's, but I honestly haven't felt something like this since my teens. It's exciting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opho0w/moving_on_from_a_long_term_relationship_with/

83,ophyg4,1626972913,trouble with possible gf friends,"
So i (16m) and a girl (16f) i’ve been talking to for a while get along very well and we’ve told eachother we like eachother and we’ve kissed and currently she’s at a cottage with her friends and i was planning on asking to make things official when she got back. Basically a few months back we were watching a movie over facetime and she made a comment about all men being trash and such which i didn’t like because i find it bad to generalize a whole group and she had said men are disgusting so does that make me disgusting? but anyway i told her the next day how i didn’t like it and how it’s not good to generalize and she apologized and everything was fine. fast forward to last night her and her friends had been drinking and i get a call from her and we start talking. then her friend comes in the room and we start talking and just being kind to eachother and everything’s normal. out of nowhere she makes a comment about how all men are trash and i say to her that it’s not good to generalize and then she says it’s based on her experience so she can. I didn’t like that she said this at all but i don’t want to argue or anything especially while she’s  drunk so i left it and just continued in as normal. Am i wrong for not liking this? I feel like if i said all women are disgusting/ trash t would be very sexist and wrong so wouldn’t it be the same for men? anyway let me know what you think and if i’m not wrong what i should do.

tldr; i don’t like what my crush and her friends say about men and am not sure what to do",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ophyg4/trouble_with_possible_gf_friends/

During our time together, his mother’s long time cancer took a turn for the worst, and ultimately he said it just isn’t a good time for us, his head is elsewhere, and we should stop seeing each other because of that. We discussed options for about a week and ultimately decided we just had to stop seeing each other because we couldn’t be just friends during this time with his mom, and also couldn’t be more. We have had 0 contact for a week and I cannot stop thinking about him...it has not been easy. I also keep having the urge to reach out and ask how he’s doing, check in, and let him know I’m still here and I care (because of what he’s going through, and since we didn’t exactly want to part ways) I don’t know if this is a good idea or not...or if I should just let it be, for myself and my own heart as well.

***I'm not so sure about this strategy.***

I think with this more 'balanced' approach one may struggle to build connections on dates, because it could always be on the back of one's mind ''Hmmmm could I find someone I'm more attracted to if I had better photos'' or  ''am I really putting my best foot forward here''.

For me it makes more sense to just go for it with your best photo's, as long as they are (1) No more than a year old (2) Not all professional shots and have actually been taken with an average camera.

Yes you may find yourself going on dates with people \*\*perhaps\*\* out of your league, Yes you may \*\*perhaps\*\* get some disappointed looks from your dates, and Yes you may \*\*perhaps\*\* spend lots of money and time going on dates which lead to nowhere.

**However**... you will soon/eventually both *understand* and *accept* who is truly in your league. You know you are putting your best foot forward and presenting the best image of yourself, and will sooner rather than later find someone who is definitely on the same wavelength as you both in terms of looks and personality.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/opipvo/dont_be_too_concerned_about_using_your_best/

We’ve agreed that this summer will remain casual because he’s going to be away at school in the fall and we’ve only known each other since June. Way too early to commit to long distance. But I really, really like him. I feel like such an idiot waiting around. I have a job, an internship, but I don’t have enough friends (I have 1 really close friend) to spend my free time with, or maybe just not enough energy to do that lol

I’m new to the traditional dating scene but this guy is legitimately the best guy I’ve ever been with. I’m not trying to put him on a pedestal because I know how dangerous that is, but it’s true: he’s so genuinely kind and just a really great human being.

I know he’s into me. I wonder if I have an anxious attachment style so it’s making me think he doesn’t like me as much as I do him, when that isn’t the case. I feel like he trying not to give too much of himself (emotionally) away because this **is** casual. Idk, feeling sort of lost

97,opjfl4,1626977147,Can I regain the friendship?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me.  She didn’t specifically reject me or say she wasn’t interested but i took this as a rejection because if she was into me she would have giving me an alternative 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.
