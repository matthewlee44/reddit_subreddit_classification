For weeks I had been telling my long distance boyfriend that I was going to be lonely and sad during the holidays. I live with my aunt, far away from family and I had been expressing to him how upset I will be to not have the holidays with him, how badly I wanted it, etc. He reassured me multiple times, he’d make sure I had a good holiday. He often is very busy with family during this time, as he is in the military and they all want to see him. On Christmas he and I got on the phone early in the morning for 30 minutes. I was on my way to the movies and then to the pool and was keeping myself occupied but around 8 I found myself free. It was okay, at some point in the night I figured that we’d have a call. Around 10 he was hanging outside in a park with some long time friends in New York. It was cold and he stood out there with them for over two hours. Also, around that time I told him I’m getting ready for bed. As always though, I don’t go to bed without him, its rare that we go to sleep without our goodbyes and today was Christmas. At 12 I asked him if he would have time to call me and he said most likely not. I got very very upset. He was out in the cold for two hours with his friends and couldn’t reserve thirty minutes for me even after the multiple times we had talks about my feelings. He instantly got upset with me for my reaction because I was not holding back but as always after a certain point he ignores me, stonewalls me, and does not want todo anything or save the relationship. He tells me ignoring me for days because hes upset is normal, I’m acting hysterical, hes busy I should understand, its not a big deal, etc. At this point I make it clear I’m crying and he doesn’t care. He won’t step outside to talk to me. He ends up breaking up with me. He says Im hysterical and he is finally done. He cannot take my emotions and I had overblown the whole thing. 
Im left feeling empty, sad, and like he has no duty to me. He doesn’t ever take care of my emotions, he’s constantly leaving me lonely and only talks to me out of convenience, he never MAKES time for me the way he does for others. Im missing so many details and I was hysterical truly. I was really hurt and inconsolable. I begged for him to go outside and talk to me and he refused. He didn’t want to argue, he didn’t want to make things better. I’m extremely hurt and at a loss but maybe this was for the best. He’s very emotionally absent I’ve talked to him many times over it and no significant change has happened.
I was no saint I just want advice, comments, anything to kind of keep me occupied.

Even when I was a kid where I was among the smallest in the class, I would pick the top few tallest girls as partners for school activities. I've definitely dated girls that were around 6 feet tall. When it comes to dating apps, I tend to swipe right on most girls 5'9 and up (of course I can tell if height is troll or not). I remembered pre-Covid I would jump into bars and whenever I'd see a tall girl, I'd almost hit her up instantly.

However, I do understand that I am limiting myself severely but at least I know what to pick. According to percentile calculator, only a measly 1.3% of women are 5'10 or above. Not to mention that I see half the profiles list them preferring a guy taller. It also doesn't help that some of them are really athletic or look like models which makes it feel like they're out of my league. But despite this ""uphill battle"" I enjoy the challenge and I've had a fair share of dates.

Now you might think I'm into this who fendom, snu-snu, giantess, amazon, role reversal, etc fetish sorta stuff but it's not the reason I like tall girls. Also, no I don't make tall jokes/phrases like basketball, volleyball, asking about height, etc. Isn't there a difference between a ""preference vs fetish""?

I never openly admitted I was into tall girls to ANYONE or profile not even to my best friends or family because then I'd get judged. I mean is it really wrong for men to have a height preference?

4 weeks ago I started a community for college students who wanted to learn about personality development.
The first person to enroll was a 19 year old college girl, let's call her Sasha. And we had this crazy spark, but I was in a relationship so I never explored it. 
1 week after that, my gf of 10 months broke up with me because long distance didn't work for us.
Few days later Sasha drops a text asking me some question, which turned into a full blown conversation and we ended up flirting with each other. 
We decided to go out on a date, where I mentioned I was looking for just a casual relationship. She said she's fine with that. 
In the first date she told me how badly she has been treated by all her exes and dates. She felt used and unloved. And she mentioned how everything I do makes her feel special. Even though I was doing what every man would do, (like opening the door for her etc) she felt happy even when It's the most common thing. 
Later that night, we texted for hours at night. She told me she's falling for me, getting obsessed with me. I could have stopped it right there, but I loved the attention so I said I felt the same even when I didn't. But I also mentioned I can't commit to a relationship, it's fun as long as it is not serious. 
Well, obviously she agreed but I knew how she felt. I could have called it of right there and then. 
Next day she wanted to go get a regular check up, I was teaching nearby so I joined after my session. I took her to the hospital,spoke to her doctor about her health. She felt sooo damn special. I knew I shouldn't have done that, but I did because I missed doing it for me ex.
She kept falling and falling and I kept telling her it's casual but also fed her subtle hopes with it. 
Today after the community session we went for a walk in the park. She held my hands and I could feel her heart beat rising, she getting overwhelmed and constantly smiling. We almost kissed but that turned into an awkward hug. We decided to walk back home and she kept telling me how grateful she is and how much loved she felt. I knew that she's falling hard for me.
I just wanted some rebound sex man, I knew I fucked up.
After we came back home, I told her that I have no intention of dating her (because I'm still hung up on my ex) and that we should call it off because she's definitely falling for me. She broke down. She asked me to meet her tomorrow so that we can come to a decision.
I'm gonna meet her tomorrow and tell her what's it about.

Some context:

- We’ve had four dates
- Each date she’s always asking when I’m next free
- She holds my hand, randomly kisses me, touches me, shows me all the signs, etc
- She’s been suggesting we spend the weekend at hers
- She messages me first every day without fail (unless I beat her to it) but she’s not much of a texter so we set up a call
- We talk a lot on phone and facetime too
- Although in the last half hour of our dates she is constantly checking the time so she doesn’t miss the train
- She was ill for 3rd date but still saw me despite myself suggesting to re-arrange (she was negative for covid).
- During the 4th date she added me on facebook and allowed me to tag her at the location we were at (I asked if this was okay first, she agreed and joked that her family will all ask about me)
- She also mentioned how much fun she’s had and loves how much effort I put into our dates. After leaving the location she pulled me to her and kissed me
- We facetimed on christmas eve and she seemed positive, every time the call disconnected she immediately called back
- When I messaged her merry christmas she replied “merry christmas 😘”

So yeah from the month I’ve been seeing her, I’ve been getting positive signs to suggest she does like me. When we facetimed on Christmas eve she did say she felt she was coming down with something, then today on boxing day she sent this:

Her (9:30am) - “Hey I've done a lateral flow and I have covid. So I'm not going to be able to come out for several days. I'm just awaiting on my pcr results. But I think I deffo have covid, as I have all the symptoms and feel unwell. It might be worth you doing a lateral flow, as I was around you on Wednesday xx”

Her (12pm) - PCRs positive as well xx

Me - Hey that's a shame but can't be helped, hope you feel better soon. I'll have to get a test done too. Obviously you've got to isolate for 10 days etc so let me know when you're free at that point. Can do facetime tomorrow if you're feeling up for it xx”

Her - “Awh thanks 😊. I'll let you know if I'm up for it tomorrow xx”

I believe her but I also like to overthink. The last girl I was dating cut things off with covid and I never saw her again, so I’m getting flashbacks this might happen again. Only difference is this girls explanation is very detailed compared to the last one, but she doesn’t offer an alternative date.

Anyway, plan is to see if facetime goes ahead tomorrow but if she’s not feeling well that’s fine. Seeing as she texts me first nearly every day, if she keeps that up this week then I’ll not worry

I am an 18 year old guy, who has found himself attracted to a friend's classmate (an 18 year old girl) that goes to a different (catholic) high school. He does not talk to her very often (infact not at all) and doesn't know her that well. I saw her on his class' picture and I haven't been able to stop thinking about her ever since. 

My game plan right now is to approach her in real life before hitting her up on Instagram, so as not to seem like a total creep. How do I accomplish that without infringing on her privacy too much or should I just text her directly, however I have bad past experience doing that since she has never heard of me at all. 

I asked my friend and he's told me that she does in fact use Snap Map, which does show her location somewhat accurately at all times. This could be a way of tracing in her in public and making a street pickup but as of right now I'm not really inclined to doing this as it does seem rather creepy and stalker-like. 

My friend doesn't really know where she usually hangs out or anything all we know is that she does live in the school dorm during the week. He doesn't feel comfortable setting me up though as he hardly knows her and talks to her only a few times per year.

The girl is not really shy but is more on the quiet side she looks alright but isn't very popular and is quite desperate which is in truth exactly what I'm looking for. 

How do I approach her with my friend only providing intel and not being able to help me otherwise. 

Thank you very much for taking the time assisting my desperate soul.

The one I followed was to start journaling to really piece together what was going on and how I felt. I'll also add that I just started dating again this year after a 15 year relationship, so I don't have much dating experience, and that I am in therapy and working on my issues. Next appointment is in a couple of days and I want to talk about this situation. Here are the bullet points I came up with for the last 6 months with her

In June I (36m) met a woman (32f) on OLD. We aren't diving across the table to make out, but it's a rare first date where I immediately feel comfortable and connected to someone. We talk that night and she invites me to stay the night at her place next week.

The day before our second date she backs out. Says she is recently out of a relationship and shouldn't have been on OLD. That she likes me a lot but isn't ready to date again yet.

A few weeks later she reaches out again. Says she's still isn't ready to date but wants to hang out and take things slow and see what happens. In this break I had started casually dating someone else, and decide I'm ok with us just talking and seeing if something happens.

We start texting, talking, and flirting a lot. She is sending me cute selfies and we're having deep intimate conversations. She has not given me any indication that she wants to date. I feel like the selfies are for attention/ego boost as I keep calling her hot/interesting/creative.

​​* I had been dating the other woman for about a month and get rejected. I hadn't told this woman about it at all, but then share the whole story with her. She says she wants me to take her out to dinner somewhere nice that weekend. She backs out an hour before saying she got really anxious. She says it wasn't going to be a date. I say I wish it was. She says she really likes me but her head is a mess right now and isn't ready to date someone like me until she gets better. She wants to still be friends. I say I need time to think about it.

*​ She reaches out a week later to check in. I tell her I'll be in town in a couple of days to see a friend and invite her to go to a bar after. She obviously put a lot of effort into dressing cute for it. We're both pretty tired and it's kind of a melancholy night, but I enjoyed it.

​​I start to invite her out more over the next couple of months. She's always up for it. She frequently takes pictures of us hanging out and posts them to social media with cute stories about our day. Her social media is usually just her posting selfies, family, art, memes. Everything I'm inviting her to do is stuff I would do with a gf, but this is all platonic as far as I can tell.

I'm about to go out of town for Thanksgiving and ask to drop off something I had borrowed from her. She invites me to hang out at her place for the first time. While we're there I tell her about my back hurting from work and she comes over and gives me a back rub. Then her hands move to my shoulders, my sides, arms, hands, way more than I expected. I think something is going on here. I turn around to face her and she gets flustered and jumps off the couch and tells me thanks for coming over and rushes me out.

Communication drops significantly over Thanksgiving. That's understandable. When we do talk the energy is different though. We went from texting almost daily to maybe once or twice a week for the next few weeks.

Jump to a couple of weeks ago. We had planned on driving out to a concert together. The day before she tells me she has been making friends in online groups and this one guy since around Thanksgiving has been DMing her every day calling her beautiful and talking to her and she wants to give him a shot. That she's thinking about flying to see him in a few months (he's a few states over, not a day trip). I'm floored. She had said she wasn't ready to date anyone. I had thought we were growing close. I had even ordered her a small but thoughtful Christmas present that I was going to give her when I picked her up. I tell her that he's just stating the obvious by calling her beautiful but that it's cute to see her excited about someone and he'd be an idiot not to like her. This was on the way to the concert. Between driving, the concert, and dinner after we spent 6 hours together that day. It was fun overall but also kind of stressful and uncomfortable.

I'm sad for days. To top things off this is the time of year my ex walked out on me 2 years ago. Stressed, depressed, anxious, I reach out to this woman and tell her I'm in a bad place (I blame the stress of the holidays surrounding my divorce). That I think we're starting to grow in different directions and should stop hanging out. She tells me that's not true (growing apart) but I can take all the time I need to get better and that she'll be there waiting for me whenever I'm ready. I thank her and we haven't talked since, outside of us sending Merry Christmas texts.

So here I am. Feeling rejected and that any romantic feelings this woman had for me were all due to chasing/infatuation. I'm not sure she ever actually was interested in me as more than a friend. The couple of times I've told her I'm interested she's not, and when I date other women or move on, she pulls me back in. I have not made any huge efforts to show that I'm interested in about 3 months. What's going on here? Was she interested and I should have been trying harder, is she legitimately a mess and just doesn't know what she wants, is she not interested in being more than friends at all and I'm just reading too much into things? I really want to figure out how I feel and what to do about this, because it's causing me a lot of stress. I'm trying to talk to other women and find myself hung up on her. I've received advice ranging from ghosting, to putting everything out there, to just keeping her around and focusing on other things. As much as I enjoy talking and hanging out, if I'm being honest with myself I'm more interested in seeing if we could grow romantically than continuing to grow platonically. It feels like at first we communicated very openly about things but the past few months have been muddled.

TLDR

Receiving mixed hot and cold signals for 6 months from a woman saying she really likes me but isn't ready to date anyone at all. She tells me she wants to start as friends and take things slow to see what happens. We start growing closer and spending more time together. My feelings for her start to grow. Then she says some guy online has been making moves on her and she thinks she's into him.

gonna try to make this as short as possible. 

So ive been seeing this girl..

she admitted her feelings for me first along with hitting me up.  
fast forward one night we got in a fight and the next day we talked and she said she wants to take things slower and start off as friends.  

we had been sexting etc which she always initiated but would say it would give her cold feet but shes so attracted to me. 
when we first met she said i dont speak much and when i do everyone listens with such intent and that im funny etc

im also used to always making the first moves and decisions so with her this is different. shes very outspoken about men, consent etc and different so i wouldnt dare making a move without asking. 

anyways so she says about starting as friends but is still attracted to me and i respect it. so i start treating her as a friend and immediately she was flirting and texting me the same night. 

i was completely confused and didnt really play into it. 
we went on our first “date” and had SO much fun.  
i didnt initiate any physical contact nor flirt though as i want to respect her wishes. 

she professed her interest in me and asked if i had the same in which i do after. 

but still i am afraid of flirting and overstepping boundaries/not rush anything. 

the way she is i also feel like im walking on eggshells sometimes which from what i see if partially my fault in thinking so. 

lately ive been in a lull and losing interest in her simply just by the confusion and suppressing my emotions so i dont get attached and hurt. 

she will flirt with me here and there too. which gets me confused. 

the other day she started flirting kinda with me and asked me to go to stores with her so we did for like 2 hours, we went and had a fun time. but again no physical contact. 

last night she flirted hard so today i said fck it and sent a flirty text. things were getting intense. she even was “begging” for my attention.  she then asked if i was intimidated by her. and doesnt want me to feel uncomfortable. 

it took me 2 times asking her and giving examples to why she felt i was. 

she proceeded to tell me that she has been making all the moves. 
as well as the way i respond to her 
the way i conduct myself
 “you dont seem dominant” 

i told her i have been respecting her wishes and trying not to put her in any uncomfortable situations. as well as taking things slow. 
im afraid of flirting and holding back because of that. 

that im used to making all the moves and decisions and if i have permission i will then. 
she then told me how much she wants me and that we agree on telling each other what we are comfortable with and would rather press the gas pedal and reestablish boundaries than nothing at all. 

we started flirting and role playing hard. 

we are seeing each other monday as of right now and im going to kiss her and maybe even a little more. just this all has me kind of confused and the way she said that im not dominant along with it seeming like im weak when in the end im just trying to respect her wishes felt very disrespectful to me. 

i did thank her for telling me though and that im so happy she did. 

what can i do to go back to being myself and not seeming so submissive? and what was i doing wrong?

Not that I should need to provide context, but the virus has such negative stigma I always feel like I have to. My (24F) ex (25M) did not disclose to me that he had herpes until a month or so after I moved in with him. It was at a point in my life where I felt I didn't have a lot of options, I was also so in love with him I had my rose-coloured glasses on. So, I stupidly decided to stay, despite him keeping the truth from me for over a year of dating. I was promised marriage if I stayed, amongst other bs. Long story short, he was reckless and irresponsible and guess what - now I have it too. 

I chose to provide context not to deny my own promiscuity but more to show  that you can be in a relationship, take precautions and still catch it. So please, don't judge anyone because you see the word 'herpes'. 

Simply put, I trusted someone I shouldn't have and now I have to live with that poor decision for the rest of my life. 

Since being ready to date again, I have promised myself that I won't make the same mistakes he did, and if there is the potential things may become physical with someone, I always disclose. I try to give as much information as possible without overwhelming the person. For example, I take suppressant medication which in theory halves the risk of passing it on and I am open to pursuing any other method that lowers the risk to my partner, however the risk, although very small, will always be there. 

At the end of the day, it is a coldsore in an unfortunate place. 

Typically, the people worst affected have a weak immune system, however as one of those people, I rarely get outbreaks, in fact I haven't had one since Jan 2021 and I was diagnosed Sep 2020. In fact, I've been told most people don't realise they have it because they do not show symptoms and it is not screened for during standard sexual health checks. My local GUM clinic actually advised me against taking suppressant medication due to the small number of outbreaks I've had since being diagnosed, and generally not to worry as supposedly 1 in 4 have a type of herpes. They stated I am much more prepared to be dating (in that I'm informed of how it can be spread) than those who do not realise they have it.

The sad thing is, the worst part about the virus is the stigma, in terms of my general health, it really doesn't affect me.  

So far the responses have been mixed, some people have politely turned me down but appreciate that I was honest and responsible. Others have said, and I quote, 'I'm worth the risk', and are willing to pursue a relationship with me.

I thought that with time, he would naturally reach out to me more. But no, it's constantly just waves of hot and cold. 

I have spoken to him many times about him being so distant when we are apart. Sometimes it has been better for a while. Then he is distant again. Lately he has been depressed and has started drinking a lot. He also did cocaine. He spends every weekend getting blackout drunk and staying out till 3 in the morning without me. 

We exchanged gifts this Tuesday and watched the new Spider-Man movie. Things felt great. We loved the gifts we got from each other. Then he went back to being distant. I sent him a sweet text on Christmas Eve, telling him how much I like him and that I'm happy it's the two of us. He left me on read. He doesn't reach out. He's been drunk for days. 

I just... I can't fucking do it. I have all this love and warmth I want to give him but it's too one-sided. I've thought about breaking up several times but today it just... became real.

All I ever see is people who get so worked up and stress over the rules, methods, anxieties and strategies about dating. Post from how there’s no hope for average men to “does my body count matter?” 

It’s like a never-ending blanket of fear that if you don’t live a certain way, follow specific rules or posses particular qualities then your dating life is forever doomed and you’ll never live happily ever after. I understand that outcome isn’t ideal, but is there really a point in stressing so much over it? Or letting it turn you into a pessimist?

We went up the stairs to my apartment. Once we were inside, he frantically checked his pockets and said that he forgot something. Then he went out the door. I actually believed him at first. Then a thought popped into my head like “what if he just drove off and left?”

I checked the bumble app and saw that he blocked me. Then I texted him and it wasn’t delivering. I called him and it went straight to voicemail. What the fuck? I don’t understand what even happened.

I was wearing the same outfit in the pictures, and we video chatted. I don’t know why he would waste gas and 30 mins of his time just to leave as soon as he got here. He was going to get some sexual action so I’m like what the fuck.

If anything, he was a major catfish. His pictures weren’t clear on his profile. His face was always covered up or it had a stupid Snapchat filter on it. I kept asking him for pictures of his face and it clearly showed that he was lying about his weight. But he was still cute. Even when we video chatted I thought he was still handsome.

I was loosing confidence because of getting older problems, like receding hairline and the skin flaws, but what's more than a rejection could happen? 

So we went to the restaurant, we had a good conversation with some laughter, then we went out and it was so cold, so the date was coming to an end until I remembered an advice a guy have written here which says ""take actions in a date, don't just wait for things to happen""

and I did, having the cold as an excuse to hold her hand, we hold hands for a while before I invited her to my place, she preferred her place because it was closer to spend time in

Before we went there I had to make sure that this was going somewhere, so I made up another excuse to hug here - I remember she was a little bit shaking from cold - then we kissed 

We went there, and I slept over at hers. It was a very good Christmas for both of us.
