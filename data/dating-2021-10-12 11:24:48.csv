What was it like?

Im currently texting a guy i basically have nothing in common with, i love to watch tv with subtitles, he doesnt. I love videogames, he doesnt. Hes into snowboarding, im not. He hates horror movies, i adore them.

And yet, our texting is SO good. Like, i really enjoy talking to him. We have such a great banter and he comes of as quite respectful. I dont have to think what to type cause it feels so damn natural.

1,q6pza2,1634056039,Simple Rules for Social Confidence,"I lacked confidence in social situations for a long time. On top of general anxiety, I had social anxieties in nearly every situation. I eventually realized it was because I had no set of rules. Any type of conflict, no matter how small, made me unsure. Was I in the wrong? Was someone else in the wrong? What is okay and not okay for me to do/say? What about other people?

Eventually I came across what was called the personal bill of rights. This was one of the big steps in getting me to relax around people. To me, it was a clear structure on how to treat people. The magic of it is that everyone can follow these guidelines at the same time without overlap. The entire list of rights has about 30 bullet points, but I’ve picked out my personal favorites here that I think apply to social situations.

* I have the right to ask for what I want.
* I have the right to say no to requests or demands I can’t meet.
* I have the right to say no to anything when I feel I am not ready, it is unsafe, or it violates my values.
* I have the right to express all of my feelings, positive or negative.
* I have the right to change my mind.
* I have the right to make mistakes and not have to be perfect.
* I have the right to follow my own values and standards.
* I have the right to determine my own priorities.
* I have the right not to be responsible for others’ behavior, actions, feelings, or problems.
* I have the right to say “I don’t know.”
* I have the right to say “I don’t understand.”
* I have the right to say “I don’t care.”
* I have the right not to give excuses or reasons for my behavior.
* I have the right to make decisions based on my feelings.
* I have the right to my own needs for personal space and time.
* I have the right to change and grow.
* I have the right to be happy.

This gave me a baseline of how to act and treat people, specifically women in dating. I became much more direct and started to ask for what I wanted. I set boundaries more and felt more comfortable saying no. I realized it was okay to change my mind about dating women at any point. I could go with my gut and not have to explain why I was or wasn’t interested in someone.

Are you holding yourself back in dating? Are you unsure of what to do or say when on a date, or in any social situation? Do like I did and reread these values every once in a while. Almost every week I could find another way that this list gave me answers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6pza2/simple_rules_for_social_confidence/

12,q6r1fz,1634059059,He’s going to a wedding with a female friend…,"My (29F) new boyfriend (32M) and I have been dating for around 4/5 months and things are going really well. I’m the happiest I’ve been in a really long time and he feels the same. We see each other pretty much every day, have both dropped the L bomb and things generally are just pretty perfect.

A few days ago when planning a night out with friends he told me he couldn’t do a certain date - I casually asked him what he was doing to which he replied “oh, I’m a plus one to a wedding”. He didn’t offer any further information and I didn’t ask; he can be quite reserved sometimes and I didn’t want to look like I was quizzing him. He then told me he was double checking the date of the wedding and got his phone out, and I saw him scrolling through his text messages between him and one of his female friends. It’s clearly her he’s going to the wedding with.

Now, I’ve not met this woman yet. From what I know about her they’re old drinking buddies who go back a few years - AFAIK it’s always been platonic and there’s no romantic history (though my boyfriend hates talking about exes and history so who actually knows if there’s more to it). They’ve hung out together and gone for drinks a couple of times since we’ve been together and I’ve been fine with it. She followed me on Instagram as soon as she found out I existed but we’ve not spoken. She regularly comments on his social media posts and sometimes it’s a little on the flirty side for my liking.

From what I’ve gathered she’s very recently split from her own boyfriend.. I’m assuming this is why she now has a spare plus one to the wedding. Am I right to be annoyed that 1) she’s asked my boyfriend to go with her and 2) that he’s said yes without speaking to me about it first?

In my last relationship I suffered with severe jealousy and anxiety as a result of being cheated on and I’m so keen not to bring that kind of energy into my new relationship when it’s going so well… but I can’t help but feel a little worried about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6r1fz/hes_going_to_a_wedding_with_a_female_friend/

Off the apps, my luck is just about the same, although it'd probably help if i put my phone down when i'm out lol.

For the life of me, i don't see myself getting married any time soon, so by my logic, which very well could be flawed, it makes no sense to get seriously involved...So that only really leaves me with one nights and FWB situations. I'm not too big into ONS, and finding a consistent FWB is just as hard as anyone to date so, it seems like best on the odds and my past experiences, i'd be better off putting all my focus on ONS even if it sucks...cause i guess its better than *nothing*

There are plenty of bars and stuff to go out to. I've never really been very good or interested with hooking up, but i suppose it's worth trying at this point, i don't got much else going for me.

Went well for a few days, we wrote quite a bit back and forth, but then twice now, she just stopped responding for almost a week. Each time it was just about getting to the point of thinking ""Oh, I guess she didn't want to get to the point of me asking her out"", and then bam, three paragraphs of detailed responses all at once.  
 
I'm not a same day response kind of guy generally, people get busy, the point of texting is the removal of immediacy, but in online dating I've generally tried to stay to a 24 hour rule, and generally find if I don't try to stick to that and let it go for a few days I get a lot of unmatches or loss of interest.

23,q6rv3a,1634061512,Should white people avoid dating POC as an anti-racist action?,"Please hear me out. 

I have no idea what this could look like. I simply want to open a conversation to hear what (mostly non-white folk) think. 

While avoiding dating non-white people is a racist act itself, the intention here is different. It’s not rooted in preference or familiarity, but an ode of respect. 

Two or more consenting adults can make any decision they feel comfortable with. But, should we take a stand against a potentially unhealthy or unsafe intimate dynamic? (Think: Get Out). 

I worry this would create a significant divide. Is it worth it to push through and work on these cultural differences and experiences as a way to mend racial tension. Or, is it unsafe for POC to engage romantically with white people until we’ve established healthier race relations in the US or globally. 

I’ve been in relationships or have gone on dates with people of color and I make every intention to actively be anti-racist and mindful of the dynamic and privilege I carry. But living in a city like NYC, sometimes I wonder if these intimate e relationships evolve from a place of trauma resolution, to process, or avoid genuine lasting commitment and connection. 

Of course not all relationships are the same and some adults are able to clearly outline and understand their dynamic emotionally and intellectually. But many enter relationships without thinking through the societal implications and impact on racism. 

PLEASE feel free to disagree with me. This is just a conversation starter. My thinking may be absurd and I don’t any POC to educate me for free.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6rv3a/should_white_people_avoid_dating_poc_as_an/

So  pretty much what the title says: 32 years old male, I have more or less  around $300k in savings, not super tall nor super short (180 cm,  5.9??), I don't drink nor drugs, even vegetarian for the last 10 months  (since January this year), however I'm completely clueless about dating  and I'm not sure what the issue is.

I'd  say (knowing that this will get MANY negative replies) that the problem  is with the girls in my country: I live in eastern europe and at least  here I'd say there are 3 issues to deal with:

1. Huge  chunk of the female population here these days are some sort of men  hating lesbians or as incels call them: feminazis, basically I feel like  they'll attack me for allegedly killing George Floyd lol, it's really  horrible these days when huge % of the female population are basically  the singer Grimes: pseudo-intellectuals who ""read"" Karl Marx only in  front of cameras. The 2nd issue is with the expectation for men in my  country: here either you need to be a a total simpleton who slaughters  pigs and listens to gipsy music and drives old bmw and has traditional  views for women or option b - some sort of whimp/opinionless stupid beta  male who is dating some feminazi, hence my case for someone who thinks  he has qualities but at the same likes say Jennie from blackpink and  doesn't drink is super rare, I'm like an extraterestrial here.

Finally  the third issue is with my own choice: obviously I'm not a slave so I  (think) I should have choice for what I like and aside from my total  preference for Korean and Japanese girls (who are just non-existent  here) even if I want white women the number of girls is statistically  low for me to find a match. If you remove the ones who are taken,  lesbians, or just crazy and you'll end up with abysmall count or just  none.

Now...if it wasn't for the  stupid covid, I'd have moved to Japan already since I have the money and  know a little japanese but it's hard at this point. I was also looking  for decent sites and apps but can't find any, given the reviews of  tinder I'm afraid to try lol.

25,q6s0da,1634061913,"Men’s advice. Being an active listener is the most important, yet deceptively difficult social skill you can have.","When we’re interacting with someone, it’s difficult to stay present in the moment. We’re often thinking about what we’re going to say in response, what they’re think of of us, or maybe something else that’s going on in our lives. We might pick up on the generalities of what is being said, but details that are important to them are often missed.

In some of manner, you will eventually be tested by her on something she told you previously. Of course, it’s impossible to remember very single detail of what someone tells you. However, if she mentions something that happened that impacted her, her history, something she values, or wants to do, these are the instances where you want to present and remember the details.

At a later period in time, if you randomly surprise her with something related to what she told you previously, it will help cement her emotional bond with you. It doesn’t have to be gift or anything expensive, just a small gesture to show you were listening.

Women are thoroughly turned off when they feel unheard, not listened to, or misunderstood on a consistent basis. This makes them feel unsafe. On the other side, if they feel like they are heard, they will feel more emotionally attached and attracted. It needs to be mutual, if she isn’t demonstrating an effort to listen actively to you, there is an unhealthy balance.

Asking open-ended questions is one of the best ways to engage a woman’s emotions and learn about her. However, if you’re asking questions just to keep the conversation going, and not being an active listener, it becomes a mindless interview. Women hate this on dates. People are perceptive, they know when someone isn’t fully present and going through the motions.

When interacting with a someone, stay present. Humans are naturally inclined to be distracted; focus on your breathing, clench your toes, do what you need to do to bring yourself back in the moment. The ability to be an active listener and remember details will pay off.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6s0da/mens_advice_being_an_active_listener_is_the_most/

30,q6sqm6,1634064060,The uncertainty after a successful date,"Hi, I'm quite new here, and have a question I'd like to get the opinion on.
Short about me:
I'm a 29 year old senior engineer,  have had two relationships, but been single for a while. 

So I decided to get back on the horse, and spent this summer, up til now on tinder (for the first time), this tinder thing is quite unfamiliar. During these 3 months I've dated   5 girls that I had the best feelings about, 4 of them lacked chemistry and we went our ways. 

Then 10 days ago  I met this girl by chance, and we had insane connection right away. The week spent talking with her over text and snapchat was amazing, and we felt we were growing closer and closer.  I've never felt this kind of feeling before. 

Then Thursday evening, while I was working overtime, at 8PM she told me she thought she was in love with me (and I kinda started to feel the same towards her) she then said she wished I could just take the first plane to see her (as a joke), and I replied  that I could buy a plane ticket for Friday and take the first plane if she really wanted to. 

After making sure that was what she wanted, that I was not pushing her, reassuring that she could say no,  I ended up ordering the plane ticket as we agreed on, for Friday evening with return  Monday morning.  Well knowing that we could be lacking the chemistry, we both knew that of course, but we also knew we were good enough friends, so the worst case scenario would be to  spend the weekend together as friends. 

As I flew over, she picked me up with a wide smile and we had a really great time talking and talking, even after going to bed, we she lay in my arms talking til 4 am. 

but then she had some health troubles, she was to tried to wake up, so I spent cuddling in bed with her until she managed to get up at 2PM, so our plans for Saturday was canceled,  and we instead ended up cuddling in the sofa the entire day just chatting while she was tired and in some pains.  The pains got a bit worse and she felt bad for letting me down. I ended up comforting her and found other solutions like me making the food and such which she appreciated.  As we continued the long weekend date, the conversations kept flowing, but I could feel her  energy was different, she started to feel more distant. 

During night to Sunday, she told me was just sad that her health had ruined the date, and  mostly talking about the coming shoulder surgery which she was really concerned about. Then she told me some quite personal secrets, the kind I would only tell someone I truly trust. (I think that telling me these kind of things would mean something, that I  am someone she truly trust, but at the same time  I am sitting here with the uncertainty of what she really feels about me.)  during the night to Sunday in bed she would keep a distant, not cuddling or anything, except when she had been out with the dog, and was freezing. So I told her she could come closer to warm herself on me, and she did, but then she went back to her side. 

 Sunday to Monday she was more distant towards me, had absolutely zero physical touch (like a hug, or cuddling, or not even sitting close  to each other) , still we had good conversations, she just had a different energy, ofc still her health was not good with painful shoulder. 

 When she dropped me off at the airport, I thanked for the weekend and appreciated it a lotz then told her If she would like to see me again, she knows where to find me. She replied that she would think about it. 

Personally I hope she changed her attitude/energy and felt more distant  because of the pains and that she was  very tired physically and mentally. And of course feeling bad for letting me down by not be able to join on what we had planned. Thus ""ruining the date"" like she felt, for me I  felt we just adapted and made the best out of the situation.  And it especially she felt bad since  I had traveled across the country by airplane spending lots of money on the trip to see her, and we wasn't able to do anything we had planned. 

Now it's been 1,5 days without reply, and I've decided to give her some weeks (she will return to my area to her family after the surgery) there she will have plenty of time to think if she wants to continue seeing me more. Question is, should I text and thus risking pushing her more away, or just sit and wait and give her the time to respond when she feels like it.  Right now I know she is very busy at her job, traveling to a ceminar. Once she returns it's straight to surgery then straight to her parents close to me.

I just feel that it's weird she hasn't sent me any text or snap at all, and the uncertainty is kinda killing me, ofc I know it's a good sign she hasn't said no yet, that means something I guess, since she promised she would never ghost me.  but she stopped all kind of communication.

  Based on  this insanely long story  told from my point of view, which I assume very few would read, what do you think? Did she loose interest in me, or was it maybe just the combination of mentally and physically tired with pains and sadness of ruining the  date which got her off tracks.  I mean like she told me some quite secret stuffs,  that must be a good sign? 
Should I give her some weeks, before texting her?  At least enough time to make sure she has settled in at her parents,  post surgery? (she knows I'm willing to travel hours to just see her, only for a short while, the proof is the fact I took that plane). 

Thanks in advance",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6sqm6/the_uncertainty_after_a_successful_date/
31,q6stuf,1634064326,Did I do the right thing? I feel awful,"TW: Sexual assault/rape

Me (M20) and M (F19) were nothing too serious but we lasted around 2-3 months if that. M breaks it off saying she just wants to be friends. I say I appreciate the message, but I like you too much and I just can't be friends because of that. No hard feelings involved, no arguing. This was the last conversation we had

A few weeks later, M reaches out to tell me she was raped. Naturally this made me very upset/angry/confused/sick. I told her I'm incredibly sorry to hear it and that she has my support. I said that despite what's gone on between us, I'm here for her and that if she needs support, someone to talk to, or just needs me to listen then she can reach out to me. She said she would rather not talk about it

Now this is where I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not. I still have feelings for M. I'm in the process of getting over her. Since she said she didn't want to talk about it, I told her that everything we discussed before is still valid, and I'm sorry, really sorry, but I still can't be friends right now. I said I greatly appreciate the fact she told me, and that my heart goes out to her. She apologised for even telling me in the first place

I feel terrible right now. I want to be there for her because I care so deeply towards her but I still have my own needs to deal with too. I *want* to be friends with her but I don't think I can",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6stuf/did_i_do_the_right_thing_i_feel_awful/

I enjoy his company, and generally speaking he’s an interesting person to be around. My issue is, every time we hangout I can feel weird energy radiating from him. The last time I saw him he requested we go for a walk because he was feeling off.  During our walk he pointed out our differences in stride by making a passive aggressive comment.  Something to the effect of,“every time I walk in a group I usually fall to the back….” so I got the hint and adjusted my stride accordingly. I was walking confidently because I wanted to get my energy up, and his attitude was rubbing off on me. Another strange thing is he will text me first and inquire about my schedule but never directly asks me to make plans. After we exchange weekly schedules I’m always the one who has to be straight up and ask…. were you wanting to make plans? Then he responds like I was the one who texted him and asked to hangout in the first place. 

I feel like he is insecure or trying to engage in a power struggle with me. During our time together I act like myself and am generally confident because I want to enjoy the interaction too.

Insecurities make you super sensitive to any signs of trouble in any type relationship (even before you get into one).

Work through your issues beforehand and then confidently date.

45,q6ttkw,1634067193,I seem to always attract the same kind of guys who end up gaslighting me and am trying to figure out where I'm going wrong?,"So I will start off by saying that I am a girl in my mid-twenties, now in grad school, and have never been in a serious relationship. I've found that ever since undergrad, this pattern with different guys would ensue where an attractive guy will become my friend, eventually pursue me, but once I begin to reciprocate, they essentially gas light me into wondering if they were ever interested in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, one friend in undergrad who was within my larger friend group tries to become closer friends with me specifically, constantly flirt with me, clearly wants to hook up with me (which I never ended up letting happen), but after the fact, would act as though I'M the one who is really attracted to him and never address his own feelings of attraction toward me.

&amp;#x200B;

Another friend would consistently flirt with me for years, but once I reciprocated and wanted to hook-up, he basically ghosted me (even though we're in the same friend group lol), and months later said to me (while drunk) that he's really attracted to me but didn't want to ruin the friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

Last example from undergrad is a guy who was my friend for years within my larger friend group, and would flirt with me during senior year when he wasn't in a relationship. We ended up hooking up at the end of our senior year, and after graduation, he would constantly try to push for a long distance relationship, to which I said no because it didn't make sense. Eventually I decided ""why not just try this out and see how it goes"" and he completely reneges and says he just wants to be friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think it's relevant to add that I'm not a flirtatious person whatsoever (couldn't do it even if I tried lol) and in every scenario, I'm the one being heavily pursued here in some shape or form. After undergrad I was frustrated with how these situations all played out (I essentially lost 3 friends after this) and figured grad school would be different... but it hasn't been.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my first semester of school and an attractive guy in my class, that I know has a girlfriend, asks if I would invite him the next time I go biking because he knows that that's a hobby of mine and he wants to do it more. I say ok, and fully expect to have made a plantonic friend that I can go on occasional bike rides with. After the ride, he asks if I want to get lunch, to which I agree. After lunch, while were walking, he refers to a situation at a party we were both at 4 months ago, where we played a drinking game where someone would ask a question and we all had to answer. If we did not want to answer, we'd have to drink. At said party, the question ""who in this room would you have sex with"" was asked, which no one answers. He says that after the question was asked, even though neither of us answered, ""we made eye contact for a half second"" and he wants to ""make sure he's reading the situation correctly."" At this point I'm a little caught off guard, but respond that I didn't say anything because I was aware at the time that he had a girlfriend. He chuckles and neither confirms nor denies that he still has a girlfriend, and for the following days after this he continually gets us to spend more time together. He stops by my apartment at a pre-game I was having even though he completely had other plans for the night (an out-of-town friend was visiting for the weekend), he comes by my apartment the next day because he ""forgot his charger"" and wanted to pick it up and also asks if I want to go on another bike ride with him the next day. After this next bike ride, I assume that after all this he's clearly interested in me, so I decide to straight up ask him about his relationship status to clear the air. He essentially says that he's still in a relationship and just wants to be friends. I ask him why would he bring up the story about the party to establish that we're sexually attracted to each other and he says ""I thought it would be better to address that kind of thing sooner rather than later if we're going to be friends."" WTF? lol.

52,q6udqw,1634068838,Breakup? Breakdown? I feel lost and confused,"I don’t even know where to start in this- as I’ve never posted on this platform before and also have never really taken the time to write all of this out. 
I met my current “ex boyfriend” in July of 2020. We started casually hanging out early on and maintained a pretty good friendship. From the get go though, there was a lot of sexual tension. I held off on acting on this because I didn’t want to jump into anything too fast- (I have in the past used sex as a validating too- and didn’t want to recreate the same behaviors). We hung out from July to September as friends, but I very quickly began to catch feelings. These were feelings I could no longer deny. Because I felt like the feelings weren’t being reciprocated, I cut off the friendship from September to November. Mid November, we reconnected- he had lost his job and was going through it and called to go out and have a good time. We continued to build on that friendship and then ended up hooking up in the beginning of December. Things only escalated (and quickly) from there. We began spending every weekend together, telling each other we love each other, having sex all the time, etc. at the end of 2020, he finally had asked me to be his girlfriend. This is when I thought everything was going to be good. I finally got what I had worked so hard to get. I finally got the man who wasn’t ready for commitment or a relationship to commit.

The beginning of our relationship was rocky. On a drunken night, I ended up going through his phone and finding the girl he was talking to during December (when we weren’t dating) and deleted her. That was really early on and started us on the worst foot. From that point, we had major trust issues. I began going through his phone, we micromanaged social media friendships and past relationships. But soon on came to realizations that those scenarios definitely weren’t healthy especially in the beginning of a relationship. We agreed to stop and start being more secure, and while we said that, I’m not sure that happened right away. 
We did tone down the questioning and micromanaging Though. Then everything seemed to be settling. 2 months into use dating, his living situation got messed up and he needed a place to stay. I live with my grandmother, in my childhood home, but very quickly agreed that the best thing to do in this situation was r him to come live with us. I mean, he had already been staying there for about 2 months night after night. The beginning of us living together, was actually the easiest. We were definitely still in the honeymoon phase. We shared the attic at my house, he moved all of his stuff into my room, but we made it work. 
The bickering came soon after. Mostly about small household things like laundry, dinner dishes, dirty bedroom, etc. but we never really let it effect us. Around the 3rd month, things started to get a lot more intense. (Lets preface a little of this- he definitely has/had a drinking problem. We would fight the worst about his drinking or smoking- after my family history, I couldn’t stand to be around it). The fights got a lot more intense- mostly on my end. I would scream, cry, throw things, sit in front of the door and not let him walk away from a conversation because I always needed to be heard in the moment. These fights happened bad, a couple times throughout the course of our relationships. After a lot of deep talks, admitting I had a control issue and needed some therapy- those fights started to become more constructive. They were less vocal and more just long life conversations. We got to a point of being able to communicate, and communicate well. Things were definitely starting to look up for us. 

The last month of our relationship, I was going through a lot, personally. I had had a change in my work and some friendships and really started to reevaluate who i am, the things I want in my life, and past decisions I made. However, with not being in therapy still, I began to use my boyfriend as my therapist. I started telling him a lot more about my past- family relationships, family trauma, past insecurities, past relationships, etc.) This is kind of when I believed that everything has exploded. In us micromanaging each others lives, we made a “rule” for each other. You could not be friends on social media with people that you either had a past relationship with, a past emotional involvement with, or a past physical involvement with. I’d like to think for the most part we both followed that rule. And I thought we did. However, I guess I hadn’t. A couple years prior to this relationship, I slept with a family friend a couple times. I had just gotten out of a really bad relationship and felt worthless and horrible. I slept with him as form of validation and because it was something that made me feel good in the moment. There was never any romantic or emotional feelings involved. But it had to be a family secret. I felt like if it ever came out, it was going to ruin the dynamic of our families friendship. So I denied to anyone that it had ever happened. I had admitted to my boyfriend that we fooled around before… then a cope days later my guilt conscientious ate me alive so I admitted that we had slept together but told him it was only once. But, through all of this- I had him on social media- I didn’t want things to have to be awkward. In my reevaluation of who I am and the things I want, I had an entire emotional breakdown and admitted to my boyfriend the circumstances of the past hookup and how things really went. He immediately broke up with me. He told me that he believed our whole relationship was built on lies and that we no longer had a strong foundation because how could I lie to him not once, not twice, but three times about the same situation. 

This became really sticky because we were living together. He had options, he could have went and stayed at his moms for a couple days, but he stayed and agreed that we couldn’t be together in this moment but we could continue to work towards something. I just needed to get my head right, restart therapy, and he needed to start getting his stuff together in the way of his career, his living situation, and his mental processing. We spent a lot of time discussing the many issues we had in our relationship. He opened up to be about how he always felt like he couldn’t do anything with his friends because it was going to cause an argument or I was going to be upset with him. I told him about some of the ways he made me feel living in my house and constantly having access to me and my family this early on in a relationship. But through this entire situation, we took no time apart. We continued to sleep in the same bed every night, call each other the same cute names we had always done, have sex, check in on each other during the day, etc. It was almost as if nothing had change. I quickly began to push for the relationship status again. I couldn’t understand why if he didn’t trust me or want to be with me, how he could continue to do the things that we were doing. I was so confused and questioning everything. When I went to my friends and family about the way I was feeling- they threw in opinions about how they feel like I was now being used. That he had nowhere else to go, so things had to be good right now to get him through. I started to express these things to him but it always circled back to the same conversation- that he was staying to give us a real shot and another opportunity to grow as a couple- that he had other options and other places to stay but he stayed because he still wanted me and still saw a chance of us being together (which, knowing him and the history of our relationship, I wholeheartedly believe). We were working towards hearing each others problems, understanding where we each went wrong, and working through them together. 

This was fine, and we were learning a new dynamic, I thought. But I was letting my questioning and insecurities eat me alive. I went out this past weekend, and got pretty drunk. So drunk that I full on blacked out and have little to remembrance of this night, except for what he shared with me on Sunday morning. Apparently in my drunken stooper, I stared to accuse him of cheating on me throughout our entire relationship. I was throwing jabs about how he never loved me because I wasn’t as skinny or as pretty as the girls he previously had on snapchat and that I was never really what he wanted. He tried to deescalate the situation and leave, and apparently I snapped. I ran after him trying to take his keys. I became physical for the first time in my life. He tells me I slapped him a couple times, wrestled him for his keys, and refused to let him leave the house. All during this,  telling him that I believe that he’s worthless and has chosen to live off of me for the past year because he knows he could never amount to anything more and that I’m as good as its going to get, that I was going to get either my family or the police involved (even though I was the aggressor in the situation). That he should be lucky I’ve done so much for him (i.e give him a car, a place to live, emotional stability). I don’t know why I would have said any of that because I genuinely don’t feel that way about him. I love this man more than I’ve loved most anything in life. I’ve always wanted to see him succeed and just be a part of his life. I don’t remember how the night ended, but I did wake up on Sunday morning in the same bed as him. He woke up and gave me the most heartbreaking look I had ever received. He told me that he was officially done with me- he wanted nothing to do with me and that he wanted nothing from me because then it just continuously gets thrown in his face. This is when things started to get really messy.

My family got wind of what happened and quickly got involved. They didn’t believe that I was the aggressor and he was quickly told that he was no longer welcome in my house. We agreed to meet up and talk a little later that day- and I really felt like in that moment I was going to have to choose him or my family, and I would have very quickly chose him. We ended up trying to let the night settle and all of the trouble around my house- so we got a hotel room. We got pizza, went to bed early, he expressed his frustration and anger with the situation the night before, but still everything felt like it could and would go back to normal.

We’ve hit an okay place. We learned that through all of this, parts of our relationship scream toxic. That the living situation has added to the trust issues and stress. That it was kind of a right person wrong time situation. Neither of us were meant to be/ready to be in a relationship right now. We have to focus on our own things and getting our lives together before we can fully give ourselves to each other. He says that he doesn’t know that he could romantically be with me again, but he isn’t closed off to the idea of it. That we need to go back to building a friendship while we focus on fixing ourselves and see where that takes us. He’s moving out today to move into his moms for a couple days, then an extended stay hotel. I offered him a room in my basement, but he very quickly turned it down because he believes that that shows that he needs me or that I’m doing something for him to throw it in his face. This hurts me so bad, because still all I want to do is help him. I want to see him do big things and see him succeed in life. But I want to do it with him. Im scared of what this living situation changes in our dynamic (but I know part of it is for the good). I believe that theres still love here, that love just isn’t enough to hold us together right now. We agreed to take a strict couple days off from talking, but then go back to updating each other about the last couple days, finding a way to plan a date night, and going back to trying to rebuild a friendship. I’m scared that we don’t come back from this and I don’t even know how to cope with the idea of him possibly not being in my life. He keeps telling me that thats not even a possibility but I can’t help but be terrified for what the future holds. I’m hurt. I’m scared.

56,q6urtq,1634070002,| DO NOT DWELL IN THE PAST: Keep your head focused on the now |,"*See original post on my page*

Today is one of the most valuable pieces of advice you are going to get in life

This the biggest thing guys do wrong over and over and that’s...

DWELLING IN THE PAST

The past doesn’t exist. 

You can’t reach out and touch it

You can’t smell it

You can’t taste it

The past ONLY exists in one place and one place only, and that’s YOUR mind

Outside of that it doesn’t matter...

There are guys that are 45 years old who dwell on the mistakes and turmoil that occurred to them earlier in life and that’s all they talk about.

If you are carrying and using it as a limitation, that’s your own fault 

If you walk up to a girl, she doesn’t know any of the problems you dealt with in the past...

So why are you carrying that shit?

Why are you letting things that happened to you years ago hold you back from being great?

I will tell you what the past is good for...

The past is good for the fact that you developed skills from it

That’s it.

In the past you learned to talk, walk, dress, do a job, you learned to survive in the world

Beyond that it does not fucking matter

The sorrows and pity of your past, truly honestly leave them in the past if they are not helping you 

They do not matter

They are not relevant 

There is a thing in economics called the “sunk cost effect”

A phenomenon were people make decisions that are completely irrational and stupid based on the idea that they made a decision before and they’re trying to justify it

Ex. “I spent some money here, and because I spent money here before I’m going to keep spending more and more money on it”

It’s fucking stupid.

If it’s not worth it, stop paying for it.

If it’s not worth It pursuing a particular career option, stop doing it

If it’s not worth it being in a particular relationship, stop being in that relationship

So many guys do the same thing with women

The only question you should have for yourself if you are in a relationship you are uncertain in is...

“Is it right for you now?”

If you are in a club and you get rejected by a girl that you were trying to pursue, 5 seconds later nobody would have cared about it

You can cling on that rejection and let it ruin your night, but the only person you are affecting in that situation is yourself

Most of the time the people that you think are watching you and scrutinizing you and your mistakes, they are still dwelling in their own

What you want to do from moment to moment is this...

“What is the situation rationally, logically, and honestly”

Based on that, what is based on my judgement the best thing to do?

Then do it.

Once you’ve done it, it’s gone

You put it down and move on

Live your live in the moment and what you can control which is the present. 

Anything you gained from the past, any skills, positive philosophies, experiences that are useful keep them

But anything else that’s damaging or harmful, trash them and move forward in life.

The best version of yourself is waiting for you on the other side.

61,q6v9w9,1634071484,It’s ridiculous how this one girl is always on my mind,"I (M25) had my first real date with this girl (23) which was totally my type, super intelligent and beautiful. I literally couldn’t look at her face for long durations without blushing. We were really into each other, and as stupid as it sounds I felt like a teenager again.

We broke up about 6 months ago, it was mutual, she brought it up because she was changing careers and was at a big new chapter in her life. She also had things at home she had to be responsible for which I won’t delve into.

I haven’t seen her in person for about 5 months now, and we rarely text, when we do I just feel sad because it’s not how it used to be so my vigour isn’t there and the convo usually fades away as quickly as it starts. I don’t know if this is mutual because we haven’t talked about our feelings, she’s a very closed off person. Even when we were at the peak of our dating espionage getting her to open up was challenging.

I really just want to totally erase her from my mind, Ive done everything like not checking her social media since the breakup, no contact for multiple months, keeping myself busy irl, meeting new people.

It’s just really hard, and I have nobody to talk to about it and it’s killing me, I really need help. I hate it, my sleep is terrible, I probably get around 4-5 hours on average of mediocre sleep, before I’d get 8. I have chest acne something which I’d never had before.

Going to the bar with my mates is great, and I have a brilliant time, but then I’ll just suddenly remember. I’ll see something which reminds me of her and my mood will change. I’ve been on one date since, about it 5 months after the breakup and I just had to call it off because I felt awful using this girl as a distraction.

I’m an investment banker and he works in accounting. It’s clear my career means much more to me. It never bothered me much that he makes much less than me because money is a momentary thing but we differ so much on certain things like educational background (I have a BA &amp; MS from Yale, he has a BA from Purdue and said he thinks masters or further education aren’t really important to him) or long term goals (I know what mine are and he’s not completely sure which is okay— I can’t force my ambition on someone else but you must have some idea?). 

I just don’t know if or how to bring this up as a concern.

I’ll try and keep this short but essentially I was seeing this girl three years ago, she really liked me and I stopped seeing her for awhile as I did not want to hurt her. 

We became really good friends but I could tell she still had underlying feelings but I still was not ready for something serious and did not want to hurt her. 

Fast forward two years and on her birthday I slept with her friend which she found out about and was not to fond of. 

She ended up getting a boyfriend and we lost a bit of connection but she is single as of three months and we are reconnecting. 

We’ve been hanging out, she’s stayed over at my place and is obviously comfortable with me but I don’t know if this is out of a place of friendship or more. 

I’m not sure if she would still give me a chance after I did her wrong but the difference is I am attracted to her when I wasn’t before.

(after we have been friends for a long time),"So me (F18) and a friend (M18) started hanging out since we didn't see each other that much anymore (we went to other schools). Right from the start we felt very comfortable around each other. As we saw each other more, feelings were developing. He told me he liked me the third time we went to do something and asked me if I wanted to be his gf. I told him that I wanted to move things slow since I didn't want to lose him as a friend. 

We have had 5 'dates' so far and I think I do really like him. Last time I asked him what he thought about the situation, he told me he still likes me, but looked at us as friends since I didn't really said yes when he asked me to be his gf. After that I kind of told him that I did really like him. I was a bit to scared and unsure yet to ask him to be my bf, but I do think i really want him to be.

The thing is, we haven't really had physical contact. I would love to hold hands with him or even kiss him (if he wants to). It's not that I don't like him because we don't touch each other, but I think it will make things really clear. I'm just to scared to do so, maybe because I'm afraid he doesn't want to since we aren't gf and bf yet. I think it also has to do with the fact that we have been friends for so long. How do I break this barrier? And how do I know if he want to? 

I have to say I got a bit insecure after he said he looked at us as friends, I'm afraid he changed his mind about the relationship thing.

I just don't even know where to start, i work with old people, not in school, and tinders never worked.
 Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6x4dt/i_need_help/

I don’t have time to chase people nor will I play games. Well he absolutely blew up on me. His response (paraphrased) He told me not to come at him sideways he was testing me and now that he seen how I reacted he’ll go from there. I’m sorry if you feel like you wasted your time. I tried to explain how he was making me feel and he got even nastier. The. Said he had a girl get mad at him because he wanted to go home and sleep on a Saturday night and she got mad.

84,q6xmh4,1634078740,Did I do this right? I told her I think we both need space.,"I would like to preface this post with we are technically not exclusive and there is a distance element to the situation. 

About a month and a half ago, I (32/m) invited a long time friend (31/f) of 9 years via internet to come across coast to visit me for my birthday and stay with me. We had been very flirtatious, and there was a lot of chemistry, but both agreed that there was no expectations and it was just to have fun.

Well, that was not what happened. We both got attached instantly. We were crazy about each other and the chemistry was off the charts. She cried as she left, but we’d been FaceTiming and phone calls every day since she left. I proposed to her I would come and visit in December and we could see if there was still chemistry, and if I would be open minded to moving to her. I already had plans to move towards that area anyway, so I was open minded to seeing her spot. We also had preemptive plans for her to come back here in April to go to a wedding with me.

We started putting December plans in order. She paid for the deposit on an Airbnb in full to establish is a spot so we weren’t impeding on her family (she had not long ago moved out of her ex’s house). I had some car troubles come up and she offered to get my plane ticket and have me pay her back which I said was unnecessary.

But starting a couple of weeks ago, I noticed a shift in the vibe. She had become more cold, but still wanting to constantly communicate despite it being fairly monotone. She would initiate nearly all of the communication. I would occasionally ask what was wrong, and she would say nothing it was just dealing with stuff. 

In the 6 weeks she has been gone she had gotten me something in the area of $500 worth of very thoughtful and sweet gifts. The last one included a postcard where the last line (paraphrasing) said she hopes we’re lucky and this works out and I end up out there with her. 

Last night we were on a FaceTime call after a pretty normal day when she suddenly got quiet and looked uncomfortable. I asked what was wrong and she said something with me was bothering her. At that point I had what I thought was warrant to tell her to talk to me about it for both our sakes.

She explained when she ended her last relationship it was to be single for a while and figure out her life. I asked her what she wanted and she said she didn’t know. So I told her I think it’s best we take a few days to reflect and not talk and get perspective, and that I didn’t appreciate the levels of anxiety she was putting me through along with the mixed signals. She said she had days where this felt right and natural and how it should be, and days where she questioned everything. I told her I didn’t any to be back burnered or dragged along so I think she needed to take time to think about what she’s risking and is it worth it. She said we should talk this weekend and I said that works, and if she needed anything she could contact me.

Was I too harsh? Was there any other way to handle this? Does anyone have insight?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6xmh4/did_i_do_this_right_i_told_her_i_think_we_both/
85,q6xry6,1634079241,Having a pre-date routine helped with my dating anxiety,"So I used to get super super anxious before a date just because meeting a stranger can be daunting and scary. But at the same time, I still wanted to be able to go on a date. 

One thing that REALLY helped me was having a pre-date routine. I would apply this lotion and scent that was comforting to me and I had a pump up playlist. The lotion comforted me while I was on the date because whenever I catch myself getting anxious, smelling a familiar scent made me feel more comfortable. (I applied it on my body but focused on my wrist). The pump up playlist helped me get into a positive mindset for the date!

90,q6ynla,1634082115,Could I ask for some advice," 

Hello all,

I’m just here to get some help, and mainly tips to help me through my 20s. I will start by saying I'm 19, and a straight male, and have some issues around emotional balancing, and self-care. 

From childhood up to my high-school years I didn’t go out much and was homeschooled (this was all at home, so it was only a very small class with my siblings). During year 6 I got scared of my mum when she lost her bearings (she might have some mental health issues but never gone in to get help) and told me that she “never wanted to see me ever again” (and this has had an impact on me and how I view girls - they scare me). The only girl I talked to was my sister and I rarely talked to her. In my high-school years, I went to a single-sex school and as I was new to joining a big school, it was a , massive culture shock. The first friends I made were bullies and teased me over my appearance, eyesight and height. After this was all sorted I ended up in a group that really didn't share many interests with me and in 2019-August 2021, my life was hell. I got another dealing with bullying online this time when I was helping someone through a hard part of their life. I had a medical issue (something that is rather personal), I renounced being religious which caused a lot of family issues, and earlier this year a best friend of mine left me after an argument. Since then I've been in and out of counselling mainly to sort out my low moods of depression. Several weeks ago I finally got a good counsellor, but the issues around finding a girlfriend, asking a girl out or retaining a relationship were all left out. What I did get out of this was that I have emotional dysregulation, which causes me to not be able to handle or control my emotions properly (which causes me to panic). Since then I have managed to find all the emotions which are triggered by this scenario I'm in, and I'm currently finding methods to regulate my emotions and make sure I don't panic. The issue that hinders this is that my friends have been teasing me about being single, how I’m not good enough, and being a virgin and it’s really upsetting me, as they are my closest friends atm but they are really pushing me out emotionally. It has also gotten to the point my online friends are blatantly ignoring anything I’m sending to them, and not interested in my written reviews of games, or group updates on steam or discord. I have tried all the means I have thought of to try to make new friends and hopefully find a girlfriend: pubbing, joining groups (following my interests), being more proactive, tinder, social programs made specifically for these issues I have. But this just hasn't worked out, no one even sheds an ounce of acknowledgement. 

I have some goals progressing into next year mainly getting healthier and starting a course through my university, but I am a little scared that if I focus on this area the opportunity or time I could put into attempting to find a girlfriend will fade out (and this will make me feel less detached and empty). At the moment I am just lost, all the information I have gotten has completely mentally overloaded me. I’d just like some tips on what to do progressing forward (as this really hurts me inside as I feel alone and left out)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6ynla/could_i_ask_for_some_advice/

Travel references but has a crap job. This is the most common one I see 😂

This was a new one I saw recently - wants to find a partner who can teach her how to play golf or tennis lmao.

References wanting to be treated like a queen.

Wanting someone with ambition and a good career even though her job sucks.

We got really close and things were going pretty well, but when I asked if she wanted to be in a relationship, she told me that she doesn’t. I still hung out with her and took out with her hoping she would fall eventually, but then I started being really possessive and started jumping to conclusions. We then both agreed that I need to work on myself a little bit and stop talking for a little while. 2 days after we agreed to stop talking, she posted something on her story about how “all men suck” with a little jab at me. I still want her in my life, but I don’t know how to react to it. Like I assume she just wants a reaction but I don’t know if I should say something or not.

- Sits next to me in class even though there are open seats elsewhere (multiple times)

- Asked me out of everyone in the class to help her out with stuff

- Has texted me first a few times 

- she keeps the convo going when it starts to die off unless I end it 

- Uses a lot of 😂 and “Haha” reactions to everything I say

- Banters with me (like if I flirty tease her she plays along)

- told me I should go to her performance

- I’ll hit her with the 😉 and she hasn’t shyed away yet

97,q6z6gc,1634083924,I (23M) Think I'm Done Trying,"I've been convinced that I'm not going to find a relationship, at least not a healthy one. I've been trying for years and every rejection just feels worse and worse. Apps, random encounters, social circles, social events, classmates, none of it pans out. It's not even like I'm unsocial, I make friends easily (just started an M.S. program this fall and I made 5 friends in like the first 2 weeks) but whenever I get around to asking someone out it falls apart. 

I can't blame the women for this either. Some are truly callous but most either ghost or give graceful rejections. The older I get the more that is true and I really appreciate that. But even the graceful rejections seem to open old wounds. 

Honestly, I think at this point even if a stunning, kind, smart, funny woman approached me and asked me out I'd just get more depressed about it all. I'm not sure I would be able to let myself get my hopes up. That always just leads to more pain.

98,q6z904,1634084162,Why do women stereotype when it only harms them in the process?,"I’m an Indian man who would love to have a fun and prolific dating life. I unfortunately discovered that due to many derogatory and mean stereotypes about my people, no one swipes on me in online dating apps. 

My next approach was to try hobbies. And this has given me some success. Had 2 nice relationships that lasted a year. One broke up cos she moved cities and the other broke up cos she wanted to marry. Now again I’m flirting someone who shares the same hobby. Overall I’m content until I compare with my Caucasian flatmates.

Despite being Caucasian, they exhibit every single trope and stereotype associated with Indian men. They have not only slept with 100s of women but they have also hurt and insulted these women (emotionally). Some of the things they boast about make me cringe and I suspect some are borderline criminal. They also make fun of me for putting too much effort in hobbies in order to meet women. I’m moving out of the flat cos these guys are toxic.

I’m the “nice” guy who has coffee with the ladies my flatmates sleep with in the mornings. I often wonder why these nice women won’t give me the benefit of the doubt and give me a chance instead of being used and abused by men who they think conform to some unrepresentative stereotype. I have heard the preference argument many times but I feel that is counterproductive.

Or are you comfortable enough with your biases and preferences that the potential upsides of being open-minded don’t matter?”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6z904/why_do_women_stereotype_when_it_only_harms_them/
