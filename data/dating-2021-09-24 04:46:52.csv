16,pujc7o,1632488704,Dating someone on the spectrum and finding lessons learned.,"Hey all, 


I‚Äôve been having quite a hard time surrounding what‚Äôs happened in the last week and would love some stranger‚Äôs opinions. I struggle with a few things, but my anxiety has been through the roof the last couple of days so I‚Äôm trying to be as objective as possible to make fair conclusions and move on. I‚Äôm using this a bit to journal and get some things out so I apologise for the bad writing. 


So, I‚Äôve dated a lot this year, but haven‚Äôt really found anyone that I really sparked with. I found this girl on one of the apps and we immediately clicked. We chatted a lot and I‚Äôve never felt more ‚Äòseen‚Äô by someone. Based on the conversations it seemed to be reciprocated. It was the first time I was 100% excited about someone. Though, she would also say things like ‚Äúwhy me? Are you just dating me because of X?‚Äù which really bummed me out. She‚Äôs on the spectrum and, like me, has struggles with anxiety, depression, and some low self-esteem problems. We are both deep talkers and would have great deep chats etc. I‚Äôve been around a lot of people with high anxiety problems, and she mentioned dating can be quite mentally taxing, so I thought I‚Äôd make it easier by just being extra clear where I was at. There are very few things I‚Äôm proud of - honesty and being genuine are the only things, I think, that really stand out for me so I thought this would be easy. 


We have a conversation where she tells me that she has a real problem with people making her question her vision or hearing. I was fully on board as I‚Äôve had memory issues and people that mess with me on that really stress me out. I‚Äôve also been heavily gaslight in an earlier relationship, so I thought this note was super reasonable (which it is).  


After many phone call dates and online hangouts later, we have our first in-person meetup. We meet up at a park and have a walk around. The date is okay, we‚Äôre chatting. She‚Äôs a bit quieter than normal which is making me more nervous, but I just chalked it up to her anxiety. Over the span of the date there are two events that will come up later: 


1.	As we‚Äôre walking, we hear a noise and look around. I have a lot of drones around my apartment, and I immediately recognize the sound and lookup. They‚Äôre always hard to see but I spot it and point it out. She can‚Äôt see it and asks me if I‚Äôm sure. She says it was an electric scooter that just passed. She wasn‚Äôt convinced there was a drone at all, and it turned into some light-humored banter back and forth. It was the first time I had seen her smiling so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 


2.	We‚Äôre sitting watching some marshlands and 100 meters away we see a group of birds. One looked bigger than the others and I asked if that was a swan. She thought it was a bunch of smaller birds together and we had another light back and forth I thought was just banter. Again, she seemed quite positive about it. 


The only other thing to note was she started crying ~20 minutes after the second event. She said she felt really embarrassed about crying but she was feeling overwhelmed (I think that was the word?). I rubbed her back and reassured her that if she needed to cry, she should cry, there‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of and we chatted about what was on her mind, etc. It was a sweet moment I thought.


From my perspective, I really enjoyed the rest of the date, and we had some good deep chats.


Cut to a couple of days later of texting, she brings something up and I, wanting to be cheeky and make her laugh, mentioned something along the lines of ‚Äúhmm, I‚Äôm not sure to trust you after the drone incident lol‚Äù. I thought I was being cute. She then says that those two events from earlier have been incredibly stressful and confusing for her. She brings up the note about messing with vision and hearing. My heart just drops like a stone. I hadn‚Äôt even associated the note from a week or two earlier and what went down together. I immediately felt horrible and started apologising because I obviously really upset her and crossed her boundary. I had just categorised it as a disagreement with banter and didn‚Äôt realise that was what she meant. She said that she was masking in those moments and was quite stressed and frustrated. She said she has been in some relationships with heavy amounts of gaslighting which burned her, so this really threw her off. 


She mentioned that her gut was telling her to keep dating me, but she is in a depressive state and didn‚Äôt know if she could trust it. She was kind of insinuating that she might not trust me, and I could be manipulating her like her partners in the past. The rest of the call was talking about those feelings and me just feeling like a massive rotten shit of a person for making her feel like that. She said at the end she wants to see me again. 


The next day she sends me a text saying she changed her mind and wanted to move on. I said I respected her decision and told her how horrible I felt for causing her that stress and I hope she did well in the future.


It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôve just felt so utterly putrid for putting that on someone. I‚Äôve talked about it with some close friends/fam and they‚Äôre bewildered because they say I‚Äôm super honest, a massive softy, and don‚Äôt have a mean bone in my body, etc. They‚Äôre probably biased because I know them, so I wanted some feedback from others. I‚Äôm very scared of deluding myself into thinking I‚Äôm automatically okay. I was hoping if there were some people on the spectrum, they could offer some help or critique with what I did. I felt like I just missed an amazing chance at a relationship with this girl because I was too dumb to make the connection. I don‚Äôt want to make that mistake again. The icing on the cake was that she thinks I was lying to her about stuff, etc which is the opposite of who I am. I feel repulsive when I lie, I really hate it. I went even more honest to make her comfortable which just made me feel more vulnerable which makes this worse now. I feel like an idiot.


Obviously, I crossed her line. I feel like I‚Äôm a very perceptive person when it comes to reading people and feelings, but I completely lost the ball with those moments. That‚Äôs my fault. If there‚Äôs anything else I need to take on board, let me know, I‚Äôm all ears.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pujc7o/dating_someone_on_the_spectrum_and_finding/

22,puk2xg,1632491066,Guys who can't keep their mouths shut,"I'm 24F and have just dated two guys who are very talkative. I wouldn't say I'm a quiet person but I'm definitely introverted and seem to attract extroverted guys who are a bit on the talkative side. Now I don't mind extroverted people at all. In fact, I have some friends who are extroverted and I like it when they lead the conversation and I follow to keep the back and fort going. However, with some of the guys I've dated, the conversations I had with them have been mostly one-sided, with them talking non-stop 'at' me , not 'with' me, about anything that comes up in their mind. They would talk non-stop about themselves or about the most mundane shit ever in detail. They don't even ask me what I think or pause so I can give some input to the topic. They strike me as self-absorbed and seem to like hearing their own voice more than engaging with me and sometimes even talks over me. 

One of them even talked for almost half an hour just explaining to me the meaning of their name, from their first name to their surname, and I'm just baffled why he'd think I'd actually give a fuck about that. I try to give them cues while being as polite as possible but it seems that it's not getting through them unless I say to them outright that they've been talking a lot. How do you even tell a person they're being so talkative without being confrontational about it? 

By the end of our dates, I always feel like never wanting to hear their voice ever again. They message me saying they had a good time with me and want to see me again but I refuse and end it after the date.

They're nice but it's such a turn off when some guys do this. Being so hyperfocused that they don't care enough if the person they're dating actually gives a fuck about what they're rambling on. I like hearing guys talk about the things they're passionate about but don't forget you're in a conversation with somebody and so ask them questions too to make them feel you care about knowing them too.

So please, for you guys who like to talk a lot, I hope you're all self-aware enough to include the person you're with in the conversation and be mindful of how long you've been talking. It could be the reason your date doesn't want to see you again when you thought things went well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/puk2xg/guys_who_cant_keep_their_mouths_shut/

He seems to be a very sweet and smart guy. He enjoys literature, is an activist, vegan, and is a minimalist. 

So we never shared our social media or gave our full names but today he shared with me something on twitter and I got his full name by his username and so I looked him up to see if perhaps there‚Äôs more information about this guy and what do you know..

I looked him up on google and saw that there were a few pictures of him on the images section. I thought it was probably related to activism and he‚Äôs ""popular"" within a group. 

But I was soooo wrong. 

They were pictures from a few articles on him being in court and his history of jail. (He‚Äôs been to jail in the us and also in the uk) 

To summarize, he was charged for multiple things but they mainly were assaults and thefts. (This is recently btw like less than a few years ago) 

He has even made fake charities to raise hundreds of dollars... but I‚Äôm not sure if he was charged with anything with the charities but it was mentioned. 

Then I go on the video tab on google and find out there‚Äôs a few videos of him on YouTube so I go and watch them and I was sooo shocked. 

That‚Äôs where I find him saying he supports p3d0philia without hesitation. 

I‚Äôve never been in this situation before. Should I simply block his number? Or tell him I‚Äôm no longer interested in dating (to generalize and not make him be aware that I know this about him now) or should I confront him about it? What would you do?

28,pukxf1,1632493629,I probably ruined my relationship [NSFW],"I (23M) have had a string of absolutely atrocious relationships throughout my life. That's not to say I've had no blame for all of them, however my life has been strongly geared towards self improvement over the last 3 years especially.

I'm atleast slightly attractive I'd like to think, I make good money, have my own home and car, and have a lot of hobbies, was in the military. 
So recently I got into a relationship after months of searching and she's wonderful. 
(25F) Recently graduated college for biology (I'm big on environmentalism also), She's smart, absolutely stunningly beautiful, and I greatly enjoy my time with her.
Well things were going wonderfully and she moved in with me after 2 or 3 months (fast i know but everything kinda just clicked) until my vengeful ex decided to message her and make me out to be satan essentially, and told her where on my computer I had nudes uploaded from previous phones I jacked off to on occasion. 
Admittedly I know I shouldn't have had them and am a fairly big on being antipornography so I suppose that was hypocritical and sleazy of me but I had done it for so long I didn't think much of it.

Upon hearing this she searched through my computer and found them, and it started issues.
She said I was sleazy and it seemed like I was a player because of that (In the past I did have a lot of sexual partners, which I admitted to her early on but so has she. Unfortunately I use to have a problem with sex and porn due to incidents earlier in my life but I've since resolved them.) and if that part of what she said was true, everything else must also be.

Well, originally she wanted to break up but we talked about it and I gave her space. We stopped having sex entirely and she completely stopped putting in any effort into the relationship. 
I was understanding of how she reacted because in a similar situation I'd have done the same. So even when she didn't care I didn't treat her differently or worse, I've been doing everything I can to make it up to her. I've attempted to talk with her about it multiple times, sometimes she will, sometimes she wont and when we do talk I really feel as though we make progress and she's willing to work with me. Then nothing changes. All the while she's working on her new job, her grandmother is dying (she doesn't care too much) and generally lifes been hectic. 

Its been like this for around 2 months now, with her putting in no effort, not showing any interest in me, going back and forth between wanting to stay and go, taking anger/frustration out on me, ect.
I've been as patient and understanding as possible, never retaliated or taken any negative feelings out on her (mainly because i feel i deserve the mistreatment for what I did), I've supported her in all her life decisions thus far (starting and quiting a job, completely changing career paths), and been financially supportive (she doesn't pay any bills or rent). I've begged her to go to therapy, couples counseling, or talk to me and she wants to, then she doesn't saying ""I don't want to waste my effort"" or ""we shouldn't be having problems this early on"".

She'll say she loves me, she misses me, wants to be with me, but it almost feels like she's wants it to end or that she really doesn't care. 
I'm nothing but loyal and I want to fix this so badly. I went through and I've deleted all the pictures (i did so on the day of the event bc i realized i was in the wrong)
My question is, will it ever get better? Does she not care at all anymore or is she just taking time to come to terms with it?
Am i being exploited for money? Will I get cheated on?
I'm doing everything in my power to be as positive and supportive as possible but internally I'm freaking the fuck out. I don't want to be a piece of shit. I don't want to have scared away the best woman I've ever met, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of.

32,puliql,1632495387,Did I mess it up with this girl?,"Hey guys, i'm a 23 year old college student who is currently talking to a 20 year old college student, and i'm wondering if I missed my chance with this girl.

Backstory: Back in April, I met this girl at one of my friends parties, we hit it off well and we ended up making out that night. Before the semester ended, she came over to smoke at my place and we made out some more. The semester ended and we both left to go home for the summer, so I wasn't able to see her for a few months, we kept a little contact talking to each other once a month or so. I usually only text to set up dates/hangouts but she initiated and I knew I wasn't going to be able to see her for a few months so I wanted to keep some contact. Anyways, the semester started a month ago and she came over once after a party for about 45 minutes, we made out some more, but she left earlier than I anticipated so I wasn't able to go for sex. About a week and a half later I texted her saying I wanted to take her out, she agreed and I took her to a place for sushi. The date went really well, and after dinner she came back to my place, and we started making out, and after a few minutes of this I asked her if she wanted to go into my room. She said yes but seemed a little shy and said ""I like kissing you"" which kind of threw me off a little. Anyways, we get to my room and lay on my bed, I start feeling her up and it starts getting a little heavy, but she keeps pulling away because she got a new piercing on her septum the week prior, and my nose keep hitting it. After this happened a few times I said that we didn't have to keep it up if it was hurting her. We eventually stopped, but ended up making out a little more afterwards before the night ended and when I dropped her off at her place we kissed some more. I told her I liked spending time with her and she said she does too and had a really great time that night. Now here's the thing, I hit her up the next monday (our date was the prior wednesday) to see when she was free that week and she took a lot longer to respond to me than she usually does. She apologized and said that she was busy with school projects and that she had friends and family coming for the weekend so maybe next week, I said ok and the next tuesday after I texted her saying that I wanted to make her dinner over at my place, she replied a day later saying that she was heading to a musical festival for the weekend and couldnt do anything this week either. My question to you guys is, did I blow my chance by not escalating towards sex sooner? Should my plan from here on out be to wait until she reaches out to me? I don't want her to get the impression that im only after her for the sex, I really enjoy her company.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/puliql/did_i_mess_it_up_with_this_girl/

41,pun3wa,1632500179,"All I get on dating apps is time-wasters, I'm sick of it. Is eharmony etc. better?","I'm on all the main dating apps. It goes in waves where I'll have quite a few matches and I'll be chatting to about three or four women at once and then other times there'll be a lull that lasts a few weeks where there's barely any matches on most of the apps. The one where I get consistent matches alot of the time is Facebook dating. But it's not even the main issue. It's the time wasters.

I've now gotten to the point where I'm absolutely sick of time wasters. Women who chat to you for a while on the apps, they'll flirt and everything but the majority of them don't actually go on a date. There's the occasional one that I'll go on a date with but so many women just time waste. The best one was my ex-girlfriend who I met at work before matching with her on an app, she wouldn't mess about and make false promises. Seems like she's the exception!

When I have a good period and after a while of talking, I try to arrange a meet with a match. They often agree but often don't give me an exact date, it's always ""I'm free on this day and this day"" and then when you've continued chatting for a little while longer and you follow up closer to the time, the amount of times they'll just gradually ghost you. It happens so often.

It's quite clear that they're talking to another bloke and that they're their first choice while they're leaving you as an option in case their first choice bloke falls through. It's maddening!

Is eharmony or similar better? I've always thought of those as having more serious people on there, people who won't actually waste your time. The only thing is, eharmony is stupidly expensive. You can't do anything on there without paying and it's all up front, you can't go with them for a month and then cancel so you have no way of trying it out for a little while and cancelling after the first month if it's crap.

Recently I was looking on his phone and saw a picture of a girl (porn star) with a dildo on, I asked him about it jokingly (I‚Äôm aware people watch porn. No biggie) and he kinda got nervous which I understand. He said he was interested in lesbian porn. He said he saw the porn star on Twitter and screenshot her picture and link so he could
Go back to it later. He said when he clicked on the link it was a 30 second clip of her with a guy instead of a girl and she was pegging him. He said he was curious as to how it worked. He watched the whole clip but then realized that wasn‚Äôt his thing and scrolled to something else. 

The problem I‚Äôm having with this is that this happened on a Sunday and he told me at first that he didn‚Äôt watch it but then he said he watched part of it and now he‚Äôs saying he watched the whole 30 second clip. I tried to keep the conversation light because I understand talking about porn can be awkward so I asked him jokingly if he was interested in that or if he wanted me to buy a dildo. He said ‚Äúabsolutely not. I was curious as to how it worked but that‚Äôs not my thing, I don‚Äôt want anything near my butt and I don‚Äôt want you in a dildo‚Äù.

44,punbhx,1632500780,"After a solid year of dating (phew), I finally found someone I am head-over-heals for, maybe a bit too much. But, I fear I gave it away too soon and it could be seen as a turn-off.","I have been dating regularly for a year now, and really was starting to get burned out. Started to get really disappointment in myself for not wanting a serious relationship with any of those people, a few were pretty great people, but never felt a spark. Then someone special appeared through OLD and I've fallen for her probably way too early and kind of told her.

Background: 

I started deleting a few of the apps out of exhaustion but, for some reason I swiped right on someone that I thought was well 'out of my league'. Minutes later we matched, talked for a bit but, I assumed nothing would come of it because she was way more attractive than me. I asked her out as a YOLO, and to my surprise she said yes.  It was the most nervous I've been on a date since I was a teenager. She turned out to not only be really hot, but have a personality that totally got me hooked.  Date lasted 5 hours, we were the last to leave the restaurant and got kicked out because they were closing. We hugged goodnight. I asked her out again a few  days later and we spend a solid 6 hours together, extending the date to go two another place, kissed, then texted after we got back until 0100.  She asked me to meet her this weekend at her place (hmm) before checking out a local event.

The problem: 

I often blurt out what I'm thinking...so I told her one too many times how much I liked her.  She has never directly responded to these comments other than smiling.  I realize that when I have had people do this to me super early in dating I have pulled away and became turned-off.  Of course it could be just me, but it seems super clingy.  Now I have done the same to her! My mind has become super clingy too, uh oh. So far, this is 100% someone I want to pursue a serious relationship with, so I don't want to screw it up.

Questions: 

Do I back off and not give away my feelings this soon?  Do you also get turned-off by people telling you how much they like you very early in dating?

Today in the morning she messaged me saying that she didn't get the message notification on her phone (maybe true, maybe not, but whatever). Saying that she thought I was great but that she thought we are just too different, as far as meeting up again goes.

Man, she was really beautiful. Again, in the back of my mind I suspected that she wasn't feeling a second date, but it just sucks you know? I responded that I understood, and whoever she decides to be with is a lucky guy, and that, as they say, is that.

Just wondering how other people with anxiety in social situations have managed to overcome it and start dating/finding a relationship.

Of course I‚Äôm happy for my friends and want the best for them. And I don‚Äôt mean to be selfish at all. But I hate the fact that when your friends get into a relationship they start ditching plans with you. Or choose their bf to do the plans we used to do with. 

One of my closest friends is getting into a relationship with this guy. And of course I‚Äôm happy for her but am worried that we won‚Äôt get to do the things we used to do anymore (go out, go to the beach). I also have a bad impression of this guy because they both left me alone to hookup in a nightclub for over an hour. She felt really bad and promised to never do it again. 

She told me she wants to invite him to another one of our plans which I‚Äôm more than happy for. But am worried she will do it again regardless of how many times she‚Äôs apologised. 

I was in a relationship too earlier in the year but never wanted my friends to third wheel with us (because third wheeling makes me uncomfortable, like I shouldn‚Äôt be there if you get what I mean). And I never ditched plans. 

Just fear that I‚Äôm going to lose all my friends when they get into relationships. All my friends were in one last year and I was barely out or doing anything. I felt this urge to be in a relationship because of it and that‚Äôs sort of the motive towards my previous one. My relationship was toxic and I don‚Äôt really want to get into a new one just yet (I‚Äôm also trying to just enjoy life and they will just come). 

But whether all my friends get into one I feel lonely and start becoming depressed.

She does not drive, and the mountain I would like to hike is car accessible only. I told her she can pick up anything more reachable for her if she does not want to depend on my transport but she accepted my choice of a trail(which really surprised me tbh).

Now, I want all the advice you can give me since this is a first time I'm going on a date outside the urban zones. Give me all your experiences and possible bad outcomes. I already checked the weather and it won't rain. I prepared a blanket to sit on the meadow as well as food and water and a small speaker for music.

It might be necessary to say the girl is not in the best shape with her cardio, which is the opposite for me. I also know the trail very well since I was there 4 times already and won't miss anything if we don't reach the peak.

‚ÄúRobert has sent you a new message‚Äù on tinder.

I flipped out. Lost my cool. I spend a lot of money on her and treat her right it‚Äôs been two years. We have never had any problems or issues. We sleep together on a regular basis. Everything‚Äôs been perfect.

I waited a couple of hours until we got back home to talk to her.

So I asked her straight up was she wanting a threesome or to get dicked down? Was she trying to go out with someone behind my back?

She started crying and said she doesn‚Äôt feel pretty.. Common thing she always says she‚Äôs fat and not pretty and ugly. I always compliment her and give her roses and treat her right.

So she said getting matches and a ton of compliments boosted her self esteem. I told her it‚Äôs really immature and not cool and I consider that to be cheating. It‚Äôs a dating and hook up app.

She said okay you can go through my phone I have nothing to hide. You can read the messages and see my bio whatever you want. She handed me her phone and I declined to look through it. So she said okay here I‚Äôll deactivate in front of you I apologize it was stupid. She told me she‚Äôs never given her # out or personal info.

I confronted her again and she told me she literally doesn‚Äôt feel attractive or pretty and she said she just wanted a confidence boost and she realizes that was the wrong way to go about it.

She‚Äôs 21 turning 22. I am 25. I am with her 24/7. So I know she‚Äôs not meeting up with anyone..

If she was I would definitely know considering she‚Äôs in my bed every night and we are together throughout the day.

Obviously I am annoyed/mad over it. Her brother is 20 and he said I was being a dick to her. He said you‚Äôre mad over a stupid app she wasn‚Äôt feeling pretty and wanted a confidence boost..

I said it‚Äôs literally a dating/sex hook up app. Not cool whatsoever and disrespectful to me.

My account on tinder was banned years ago lmao so I have no way of getting on tinder to see if I can find her or if she makes any new accounts.

And i started to feel something more towards her. But also my insecurities are showing up again and i hate it. Girls and guys. How do i stop it ? I don't want to feel jealous over someone i'm not dating (maybe yet) nor i don't want to be needy guy who needs reasurance every fu*king second.

96,pusk1z,1632517494,Hey so I am overthinking a lot of things and here are a couple of them‚Ä¶,Okay so first I apologize in advance if I am confusing but just let me know if you are confused about anything I am about to say. So here it goes: what is it like dating someone? Like how are people so okay with trusting someone like that? Like the level of vulnerability in relationships baffles me. Like are y‚Äôall not amazed at that? The vulnerability? The fact that you are entrusting someone with your time and there is a extremely high possibility that the person you are dating could easily disappoint you? Am I overreacting? Like okay I know I‚Äôm overthinking but am I overreacting too?? I think I am. But let me know what y‚Äôall think and please answer all questions. I thank you in advance and have a good rest of your whatever time of day or night you in.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pusk1z/hey_so_i_am_overthinking_a_lot_of_things_and_here/

Why is this? She usually comes through and says yes, but just wondering why someone would do this. She will even send me Snapchats without answering my text.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pusoci/setting_up_date_problems/
