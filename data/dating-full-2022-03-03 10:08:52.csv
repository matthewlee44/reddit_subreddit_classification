But I felt this was too important not to share.  I am writing this post for two reasons. One to help men who might be on here, to help them learn from my mistake so they don't lose the greatest love of their life. And two, that the person I hurt might read this and find it in their heart to speak to me again one day.

I met the greatest love of my life online back in October 2021. She was stunning, and gorgeous, and smart, and strong, and independent.  Just amazing. We went to a movie for our first date, she was even more stunning in person. We got hot and heavy quick. Everything was electric. I felt so comfortable with her. I couldn't stay away. The second week we were together I spent the night every night lol lost a lot of sleep because I had to get up extremely early to get to work. I knew I wanted to marry this girl, I was going to marry this girl. I wanted to love her, comfort her, provide for her, take care of her, be loyal and honor her  The last good night we had together was Christmas Eve. That night will be burned into my heart forever.

But I started the relationship with a lie. I had hooked up with someone before I met her. She was a nice enough girl but I really wasn't attracted to her, just lonely. So when my girlfriend and I discussed previous relationships I made up a lie about my fling. At about the 1 1/2 month mark my girlfriend got cold feet and broke up with me.  Out of loneliness and desperation I reached out to my previous fling. She was down, but the very next day my girlfriend wanted to talk and we got back together. Now this previous fling, I came close to cheating on my girlfriend with her at the start of our relationship.  Hell, I might as well say I did cheat on her, though I never had sex with my fling while I was in the relationship; but it was so close that it might as well have been cheating. I ended up just ghosting her. So now that I was back with my girlfriend I had to get rid of the fling again. I had felt bad about ghosting her once, I didn't want to do it again.  I've never been in this situation before so I didn't know what to do. So I lied, I lied a lot. I led this other girl on, pretending to want to be with her while I was with my girlfriend. I made her think I was into her deeply, when I was really just buying time.  Eventually I just ghosted her again. She did not take kindly to that and started googling me lol. She found my facebook and the person I was in a relationship with then proceeded to send her screen shots of our text.  My girlfriend confronted me about it. I feared loosing the love of my life, I feared hurting the love of my life. So I lied, I looked her dead in the eyes and lied like my life depending on it. She knew I was lying. And for a month, she gave me chances to come clean and be honest, I just lied some more. Until she couldn't take it any longer and broke up with me on New Years Day. I eventually came clean but it was too late. She was kind though, agreed to wait a few day before she made a final decision. Unfortunately for me it was still to tell me to hit the road.  One of the last things she said to me was she forgave me and hoped we could be friends after some time had passed.

After all of that though, I was pissed, I was angry, I was full of hate for the other girl. I texted her and said a lot of terrible, disgusting, horrible things that I am ashamed of. No one should ever be told the things I said to her. I'm taking an educated guess that she also sent these horrible text to my ex-girlfriend. Because about two weeks after our break-up I had a sinking feeling something was wrong, my ex was hurt or in danger or something happened. So I reached out to her to make sure she was ok.  When I finally got through to her, the response I got was ""Stay away from me. Never speak to me again"". I have no idea what happened. But I found one of her post tonight. The things she said about me I found shocking, painful, hard to read. She said I was abusive, and narcissistic. Well, I never laid a hand on her. But if she felt I was abusive emotionally or psychologically, I didn't realize it, and her feelings are valid. I've never been diagnosed as a narcissist, selfish yes but I try to do better everyday, I suffer depression, and I have a personality disorder, I know these things and I'm honest about it, and I go to therapy for it to try to improve and be better.  But she does have a history of dealing with narcissistic people; so I have to take that to heart and believe it a possibility. I've tried to make amends with her. I sent her a two pairs of earrings, I told her I would take her to get her ears pierced but I kept putting it off. So I got her these earrings so when she did get them done she would have two nice starter pairs. But lol after what I read tonight she probably threw them in the trash without even opening the box.  

So the moral of this long winded novel is don't make my mistakes. J.J. was the love of my life. I've never been able to be friends with an ex before, never wanted to. But she is so important to me that I wanted her in my life. Now, I don't know if she will ever speak to me again. DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKES. Learn who you are. Find your flaws, work on them, improve them. Become a better person now. And when you find that person you love, don't ever lie to them. Be honest. Doesn't matter if you fear losing them or hurting them. Be honest always. There is never a good reason to lie.  Take care of yourselves, become better men.

J.J., should you ever read this; know that I am truly sorry and remorseful for everything I did. I read your comment and I took it to heart. I will be better, I will improve myself and work on myself.  I just hope you will forgive me one day and reach out a hand of friendship. Until this I love you, I miss you, and I wish you the absolute best. I hope you find happiness.

Tldr below sorry for this long ass rant plus looking for advice thing.


We’ve (21F,20M) been dating for about a year and three months.6 months of it being ldrs. Back in December our relationship was on edge and we were fighting about him not giving me time but giving it to other ppl, complete strangers in class. We were fighting about it at the morning and he said he was going to hang out with his friends that day because the girl was going back to her hometown even when he had finals that week.
He said he was going to bring his laptop with them and do assignments while they hangout.so I thought it was just three friends
meeting somewhere and talking plus studying.
(A female and a male friend) I told him I’m not comfortable with him hanging out with her if they are alone because he said the male friends coming or not wasn’t certain. Then I sent “jk “ after a few minutes. But Then I asked him if he’d really return if it turned out only to be her and him and he assured me ‘ what would I do alone with her?’ .
Then with time difference and all, it was time for me to sleep and while I was sleeping it was their time to hang out. She picked him up and they ended up hanging out at her place alone. He texted me he didn’t go back because he felt bad to leave her alone and they just ordered pizza and watched tv. When I woke up and found the texts, I felt betrayed and asked him to leave her place but he said she’s his ride and argued a bit before going back. After that I felt really hurt and told him why he would do it when I was against it and it was like that for a day. 

Then after that day I broke down again and only then he told me that he just wanted to smoke a cig to distress and I asked him again why he wasn’t honest about wanting to smoke which he said it slipped his mind.(he can’t buy cigs with his age there and she could ).After that my trust issues got worse and it got harder for me to trust things he say. I know I took it very hard and it doesn’t feel good for me to resent him. But I felt like my boundary wasn’t respected and he lied to me and assured me while didn’t care.Also hid his intentions of going there even after seeing me breaking down for a day made me feel like he made that excuse up. 

A few months has passed and even now I struggle to move on from it.i felt so unheard and uncared. I was begging for him to spend time with me all through out our ldrs which he didn’t listen to. Earlier this day we talked about it again and he said he didn’t mean to cause it and that he shouldn’t be fully responsible for me not trusting him. That it was because of my own trust issues. I agree to some part of it, I know my trust issues are making it hard to recover from. Then he told me today that he was going to hang out with whoever that day regardless of the situation. He told me that after months and now he thinks me not trusting him is on my trust issues. Whenever we would talk about this problem, he’d always say ‘ I just went to hang out with her and I told you all about it’. This time he’s shifting the blame on my trust issues.

In the past he would cross boundaries with another female friend of his on a comment section of fb about bdsm equipment post regarding to brushing each other pubic hair which I asked him to delete and unfriend her but he kept her on other account of his. Around June to November, he’d spend time with me alone to only jerk off and would get back to gaming. Only after remember he would video call me while he games but would go straight to bed after he’s done with his friends and would only spend time with me to jerk off. And then on this month, last week he spent decent 3 quality time with me in 8 months and tells me I’m being too much for wanting him to spend time with me for getting mad at him not giving me after care after jerking off. I don’t know if I’m being too much or if he’s gaslighting me. I’m lost please help.


Tldr ; Bf (20M of 1.3 years (6m ldr))hanged out with a female friend at her place despite of me being against it and hid the intentions of him going there to smoke and covered that with “ feeling bad because the third friend didn’t come. I got trust issues before him and it got worse after that and 3 months from that, which is now, he said he’s not fully responsible for me not trusting him after that and tells me I never trusted him from the start and it’s all on my trust issues. Now he tells me he was going to hang out however the situation turned out back then because he felt cooped up back then. He’s only telling me about it rn. I’m already on a break from him trying to recover and work on my stuff. I just want to know if I’m being too much for not trusting him anymore.

This guy and I started talking recently when I was visiting friends where he lives and he was showing interest even asked about meeting up to go on a date .

I don’t know if I should just give him my number and if he wanted to reach out then he could.. even though he told me to contact him..

Great profile pictures? Check.

Great written profile? Check, and that's easy because I write for a living.

Body? Check. I've been weightlifting for the past 18 years 5 days a week. Very fit and muscular.

Face? Check. Maybe I'm not a model, but I'm definitely a lot better looking than most guys out there, especially ones around my age (late 30s.)

Height? Okay, I'm average height and maybe this is where it all goes to shit... but it shouldn't!

Dick size? Check. Trust me ;)

Personality? Check. I enjoy talking to and meeting new people, am always complimented on my sense of humor, and am not a douchebag especially when it comes to my treatment of others. I have well-rounded hobbies and am open-minded. I put the effort in to engage in conversation as well.

Finances? Check. Bank account is nicely padded, saving weekly, no debt, and responsible with my money.

Vices? Bad habits? Not unless you count being on dating apps, but other than that, not much of a drinker, not a smoker, and never got into gambling.

It really sucks and it feels pretty lonely out there. I don't think I matter to anyone. Maybe this place would be better without me. 

For context, I'm in my late 30s. During ""cuffing season"", I at least was getting matches weekly that were very engaging in conversation, willing to do phone and video calls, and I even had a couple of dates. They didn't lead further because we mutually weren't feeling it, but at least going on a date is better than nothing at all.

When you hear these words, take a deep breath and tell the person that you accept them where they are, but that you will need more. People don't say these words to partners they believe are right for them, even in circumstances that are difficult.

So, my ex had been my best friend for a long time before we caught feelings for each other. We told each other about it, and eventually we started dating and it was the best experience of my life. Much better than all of my past relationships, I felt like I belonged.  


A few months pass by and we obviously have a few hiccups and disagreements here and there but nothing major, we always communicated and solved these issues. Until January.  


In January, she told me that she didn't feel right and wanted a break. I was very confused but I said if you really want one I have no problem. A while later, she told me she wanted to breakup. I obviously was taken by surprise, I didn't expect it. I asked her why, what happened, etc and she just kept saying ""it doesn't feel right"". Obviously I had to give in and then we broke up.. but stayed friends.  


And nothing really changed. We spoke with each other the same amount, spent the same amount of time together listening to music and watching movies. Some time after this she said that she wants to get back together and that she was wrong, and I was overjoyed. We met the next day and had great fun! Just walked around and made conversation as we usually did. I went home and then in the evening she said that she doesn't feel right again and that she wants a break again. I felt like shit and just said okay have it and went to sleep.  


Over the next few days, this sort of kept repeating. We spend time - evidently have feelings for each other - emotional conversations - she says she doesnt feel right - we spend time and so on.  


This happened till Valentine's Day. On that day, she said that she didn't want to date but she wanted me to be her valentine. I thought we were on the right path again, so I said yes. Over the course of the next few days her looping behaviour and stuff was gone. She started being the way she was before January again.. or so I thought.  


One day, she says that she feels I like her best friend (who also is a very close friend of mine) and that she feels insecure. And guess what? She wanted time off again. This time I told her that I can't do this anymore, I'm out. And I removed her from my instagram account. We didn't speak for a while after that.  


Until one night I felt sort of alone so I texted her thinking she was asleep (I would unsend these messages after I was done ranting) but turns out she was awake, we made up and.. I love the girl so I went back. I told her that I'll try to be her best friend like I was, as she seemed not ready for a relationship.  


But.. well she said a few things that make me feel that she still loves me. Hell, I know this. The way she puts it makes me feel she wants to get back again but I know if I act upon it it will end with her saying she doesn't want one despite her actions.  


How do I deal with this? She has been my first everything and I have really strong feelings for her but I really don't know what to do because I feel I am too naive.

On a long car ride back from a weekend getaway I told her that I had a first date with someone else but realized after the date that I didn't want to see anyone else, she said she hasn't dated anyone else since we started seeing each other and agreed that she didn't want to see anyone else going forward.  after that talk I wasn't sure if that meant we were exclusive or not.  up to this point we had agreed it was okay to openly date other people.  fast forward to this week and she's going away for 5 days to visit a male friend across the country for her birthday.  I haven't met the guy, and my partner hasn't given me any reasons not to trust her. Overall I'm okay with it but I guess I'll be paying attention to her behavior when she gets back.  just thinking about it more makes me wonder though - I assume she'll be staying at the guy's place, he probably has a sofa and one bed like most guys, I'm assuming they'll share a bed.  She said he just moved to LA over the summer and has been wanting to visit him. one of the things that kinda bothers me is that when she gets back she will have the week off from work but instead of wanting to hang out  she's going to go to a show with a girlfriend and has other plans apparently because I won't see her until 4 days after she gets back.  idk, i'm probably overthinking things.  for context, I had a crazy messed up childhood so my compass concerning romantic relationships is way off, could use some advice.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162742,public,self,overthinking things?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t5to0g/overthinking_things/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I've heard about people getting scammed, and it happened to my naive self.  Calling my bank at 1 AM to cancel my card was definitely an uncomfortable experience.   After that, I tended to try to stay with stuff like Reddit r4r for any of my OLD escapades, but it never went well.  I always was polite in messages, but rarely got responses, and often got a lack of engagement that was just frustrating.  So one day I look in the mirror and I'm like ""You know what, I don't look that bad, and I have like...1 good picture of myself, let's give dating apps a try again.""  So anyway here's my experience on Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder after using the apps for about half a week with my somewhat crappy profiles.  Just for additional context, I live in the Metropolitan Area and am male. 

Tinder: I found Tinder to be the worst.  Despite matching with people multiple times, none of them actually replied to messages.  Eventually I just started saying the goofiest stuff I could think of because I gave up any hope of actually getting a proper response.   Maybe I need to start hitting the gym a bit more before I hit my ""fuccboi"" phase?  I also noticed that a ton of profiles are just advertising their instagram accounts or something like that.  I decided to at least test the waters by shooting a few instagram messages to people I matched with, but as expected, no response back.   Initial Take: Tinder is a trash fire.  Fitting.

Bumble: I actually got some matches rather quickly, as in within the first day.  One of them failed to actually message me, and the other one I actually managed to hit it off with and have continued to talk to.  Less ""Follow me on Instagram"" profiles as well.  Initial Take: Bumble is better than Tinder.  The ""Girls make the first move"" thing doesn't actually feel that intimidating when people on Tinder don't talk anyway.

Hinge: I've heard before that you basically have to run through all of the ""this is way out of your league"" accounts before you actually get to anyone you can match with, and that definitely seems true.  After a few days of nothing, I matched with someone and was able to start a pretty good convo.  Bad News: The second person I matched with was doing some sort of sex work thing.  I'm not Anti or anything, that just ain't what I'm looking for, thank you.  Hinge feels like you're putting more effort into it, but also once you get past that initial bump, you're being more picky anyway.  Initial Take: Hinge isn't half bad, and also better than Tinder.

Recently I leveled up my game a bit. I've also been through some bad dates, but overall I am having real nice time with women because I simply enjoy their presence in the needed polarity for sure.

However, there is this one girl who striked up a conversation with me the first time I've seen her.
She came from a village, and is a very shy girl. She says to most of the questions that she doesn't know and overall keeps a really lowkey in classes.

There is something about her. The way she looks at me while others are talking made me see that her eyes have a certain glance to them. Then I made a test, I talked to her and started to smile and she smiled back. The I came in the front of her and made a deep look into her eyes and started to smile and she did smile back immediately.

Hi everyone.

I’m just seeking a little advice mostly from women. I’m a 44M and I live in the UK.

My wife and I are separated but due to financial reasons, we still live in the same house. We have two kids aged 13 and 15.

I recently got some legal advice from a solicitor and he’s advised me that it’s best to start seeking divorce asap and then shared assets can be spit which is our house. It can be sold and we split the equity 50/50 or one of us can buy the other out.

In the meantime due to  a lot of loans we have to live in the same house we have separate rooms etc and we do our own stuff but it’s difficult.

I’d love to meet other women or have hookups. 

I haven’t been on a date for over 20 years! 

What’s tinder and other dating sites like? Are they any good?
Women, these days, are you cool bringing a guy back to yours and would it be cool having to pay for most of the date? Is a guy with kids cool or is it baggage? 
I can’t bring women back to mine and I don’t have much money left each month to go out on dates.

I do chat on Reddit with women, but that’s nothing compared to meeting in person. I love women and love the company of women and I get on well too.

Any hints, tips and pointers would be greatly appreciated! :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162747,public,self,44M separated looking for advice,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t5ve7a/44m_separated_looking_for_advice/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I'm feeling lost in the dating world and I don't know what to do. I (30M) have been struggling with dating since high school. I've never had a girlfriend, never had sex, and I havent gotten past the second date (twice). I've kissed a few girls and had a partial hookup, but nothing more. 

I've tried meeting women in person and online, both ending in severe heartache. In person, I have extreme anxiety trying to approach and talk to women; either I don't know what to say or I can't justify going to talk to them. When I do manage to strike up conversation and ask them out, it either ends in rejection (which sucks, but I can live with it) or they give me their number and never respond/avoid me in person. 

Online, I barely get any matches, despite my best efforts to make an attractive profile. Of the matches I do get, most ignore me outright, and the rest ghost me after less than a week. 

I developed serious trust issues and paranoia, so any hint of something going wrong in messes with my head. Recently, I matched with someone I thought was perfect for me, and conversation was great. One day she just stopped responding. It devastated me, and I went to a really dark place. 

I've never considered myself an attractive person, but I've been told that I'm at least average, if not decent looking, and I do have some social skills. I'm overweight (which I'm working on), but even in my prime, I couldn't meet anyone. 

I'm scared that as I get older, I'm going to have a harder time meeting people, and at some point my chances to be with someone will be completely gone. 

If anyone has any advice or words of comfort, I could really use them. I can provide more details if needed, through comments or DM.

We started off really strong, connecting at a speeddating event, and I realized that I really liked her when I saw how she had cut her hair in a sharp sidecut. We chatted happily and I bought her a glass of wine. A few days later, she texted me wanting to hang out and play boardgames. The date went well and we resolved to meet again, although I got covid at this point and we couldn't meet for another two weeks. We did however chat and text gleefully. 

We met up recently for a quick date, and then once more for brunch and some light cuddling. When we cuddled she got very turned on and very emotional, and I took it as a sign that she was developing feelings of romantic attraction, and I started to develop similar feelings quite strongly.

Our next date took us down to the harbor where we talked, but I felt she was pulling back somehow, and she became argumentative. When I tried to hold her hand, she felt 'claustrophobic'. When I asked her if she wanted a kiss goodbye, she felt it was way too much. 

Now she called me and mentioned that she thought my feelings had grown faster than hers have, and I guess they must have. I think she feels apprehensive having more physical contact, since she's afraid of leading me on. She says she's still interested, but that there's a mismatch in our expectations.

I do have pretty strong feelings for her at this point, so I'm wondering what to do about it. I would like to see  her again, and most of all I would like to get more involved with her. But if she feels uncomfortable deepening the relationship, I suppose I could wait for her and see if she developes feelings. It would suck if she didn't, but I think I wouldn't mind taking it slow and pulling back my expectations a bit.

We've been friends for over three years and we've become really close, to the point we consider each other the most important person in our lives. Our friendship is really special for both of us. Last summer, I told him that I liked him and gave him 5 embarrassing letters in which I described what I felt towards him and why I considered him such an incredible person. I thought he didn't like me back, so  I asked him to reject me in order to leave those feelings aside and focus on being his friend. He told me he couldn't say 'no', but 'yes' neither because even though he didn't have a crush on me he considered me a very important person in his life and he couldn't assure that he wouldn't end up falling in love with me.

After that we've gone through a lot; I kissed a girl I used to have a crush on while I was drunk and felt totally guilty and he kissed another girl just because she was pretty. He cried when I told him that I had kissed her, because he was afraid of losing me. The fact is that even after all this time I still love him.

I didn't understand why he couldn't give me an aswer (he has rejected tons of girls before) and he said that he didn't understand himself either. Then he confessed to me that it was never a joke when he told me that he liked me, but got scared and decided to pretend it was a joke. And well, it's obvious that he has to make up his mind, but what should I do? Should I try to forget about him? Or wait even though I don't know if he will ever say 'yes' to me?

And that’s exactly what ended up happening even though I made a move he either just didn’t notice or he literally ignored me. I said maybe he didn’t notice because after looking through his page at first I found out he is an actor but not very well known, not Instagram verified obviously and only had around 9,000 followers I didn’t even know who he was at first just thought he was some random really hot guy. And he was into the same obscure music and art as me which is why I was so into him and so upset over this. But because of the scene and how small he was I totally thought there was a chance for him to notice me but he didn’t at first. But now he’s with someone and I’m really jealous and upset over this and would continuously stalk his gfs instagram and I kept watching her stories like all the time and almost every time it would always be pictures of them or him always together and it would make me even more upset it’s been 9 months and they’re still together. He wiped his personal account and turned it into his hand page and then he almost never posted on there, it was dead then one day he made this video saying some bullshit like ‘I don’t know how to make a linktree it doesn’t work when I tried it can someone help me with it’ and I thought this is my chance and I just messaged him like whatever try this maybe just because I wanted to talk to him obviously.

Anyways, I started talking to this guy a month ago, from a dating app.
He is 7 hrs away from me so its a bit of a challenge to try with this one. But we did plan to meet. We have a wonderful connection. He is very honest that he still talks and go out with other girls(no sex, thats what he said). I dont like the feeling though. I dont talk to multiple people. I do it one person at a time. And he knows that.
So last week something was off. I new there was something going on and indeed yes. 
Okay those other people that he was talking and seeing they were there before me, yes I didn’t like the feeling but I was okay.
But this time it was different.
He is talking to a new person went put for dates already and planing for more.
So I did really got so upset. I know I might jot be in the right place to get upset but I did okay.
He said he really likes me but, the distance is a bit of a challenge but he said he will still see me so okay. But he really like this girl also. 
So what I decided to do to not get hurt anymore further is, I cut communication with him. I said try that girl out first if that doesn’t work out and I am still single then yes lets go meet.
But why is it so hard to accept these kind of situations? 
I fall hard I developed feelings easily. How do I not do this over and over? I feel like I always end up with someone who only half likes me and not put an effort to me. Im tired of all this.

A week ago, she calls at night and asks if I want any food, so that she can bring it to my apartment. I decline, because I don't want to seem too available (especially since she's been flaky).

A few days after that, she loses an item of jewelry (given to her by her mother) and calls me while crying. I ask her which shops she went to, and where it likely fell out. The next day, I decided to head to the shops myself to be thorough about her finding that piece of jewelry (instead of just calling customer service at the shop).

Now, even though she was willing to go out of her way to bring me food to my apartment a few nights ago, she was ""angry"" and ""bothered"" by me going out of my way to help her find her lost piece of jewelry. I was extremely confused. Ever since she expressed she was bothered, I ignored her text the next day of her asking ""how are you?"", because this experience showed me that she's irked by me on some level and doesn't want me doing things for her that are more than what a friend is expected to do. And I don't want to give my time to someone who seems to be irked by me on some level.

Over a few weeks we had been doing this weird circle trying to figure each other out -- and admittedly ourselves, at least I was. 

Then, two weeks ago I kind of laid it all out there. My wants, desires, wishes, plans, all of it. I felt safe. I even told him NSFW stuff (small bit in a very long email) - he was traveling for work and I needed to write to get it out there. I told him that I wanted to tell him all of it in person and talk when he got back. 

He replied how ""great"" and ""wonderful"" it all sounded and how in tune we were and said that he would reply to my message in an email and we'd talk when he got back. 

Three days later he replied with a short message to say that he is ""very interested"" and ""intrigued"" to go further and again said that he'd write more until we could meet up and that he was excited to see where this all leads. 

He got back home five days ago and nothing from him either in text, email, or in person. He's gone out a few times with mutual friends but with me he's been completely silent. 

I have resisted all urges to reach out to him but it's slowly killing me inside. 

I've reread my email a thousand times and I can't pick up on anything that would have scared him or had him judge me negatively but apparently I did. 

I don't have anyone to talk to about this here because of it being a small town and smaller circles and I really don't want anyone to know that we were even thinking of dating just yet.

I would consider myself average looking (meaning nobody would ever look at me and think fuck that dude is hot, neither would anybody think that dude is so fucking ugly...I guess), yet I have an insecurity that most would probably consider unattractive and/or ridiculous. I have a small d\*ck. This does not only lead to heavy insecurities about dating, but also about showering in public places. However... this post is about my feeling of never ""being good enough"". I mean, a small dick is not considered attractive and this is not only due to porn, but also due to social media (e.g.: the tik tok trend ""*Eeny-weeny, teeny-weeny. Shriveled little short dick man. Don't, ...*"") and other jokes about it... Big car... sure, he must have a small dick, ""big"" and ""Small dick energy"", Putin has a small dick because he is an asshole, and so on. Hearing something like that honestly hurts and stays in my mind for a long time.

Since there is nothing I can do about it (honestly nothing at all, at least at moderate risk and a significant improvement, talking about plastic surgery) I just feel like a piece of shit whenever I hear other dudes talking about their sex life.

My ""circumstance"" does not only affect my physical attractiveness, but presumably also satisfaction during sex (not only because of penetration, but because of confidence too probably). Only if it ever came to that of course (I am still a virgin), but this is actually even holding me back from approaching girls. I would really like to have a loving relationship but how could I ever not feel insecure. I know I am probably overthinking this way too much, but I just can't stop... I am searching this way to much (reddit, google,...) and with the knowledge that there won't be an answer and it depends on the person... As far as I remember doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result is the definition of madness. So how do I f\*cking stop? 

There is no one to talk to about it and I feel like it never comes up in body shaming discussions (correct me if I'm wrong).

*Just for clarification*: I don't think all women care, want big dicks (I also do not think anyone will truly enjoy a smaller one, there is a reason the average size is the average size) or that dick size is a major part of the relationship and a trait that ultimately defines attractiveness, but I just feel like it and I'm probably still right partly. There's nothing a woman could have that would be the equivalent of a small dick. Nothing. Approaching a girl would make me feel like a catfish... everything beyond that, just inferior. 

I know this question will probably appear, so : It's about 4"" long, 5"" in girth.
