While I know it's a subjective opinion and differs from couple to couple, I wanted a general perspective.

To give you a context, me and my girlfriend live nearby (20 mins away) and meet twice a week. Initially we just met, and texted to make plans. Overtime, we started with goodnight/goodmorning, and flirts here and there.

Then we started talking on call, with it ranging from daily to alternate day for 1-2 hours (all of this is in addition to our meets).

While I understand that we've grown closer and hence feel the need to talk more, sometimes it makes me feel the value decreases and after a point there's not much to talk.

For eg, there was a week we met daily. Then we met 5 days later. The happiness of seeing each other after a gap of 5 days was substantially higher because of the gap.

So my question is, while I'll let the conversation flow naturally on how comfortable we are, is maintaining a little distance normal and healthy?

One part of my mind wants to create small gaps so we enjoy talking more and have more stuff to talk after absence. 

The other part of my mind gets anxious and starts feeling if we go long period without talking, the feeling will fade away.

It was mostly sex but we both had a past with relationships that didn't work out and we connected that way. He had cheated on his last long term ex girlfriend and the guilt ripped him apart so that's why he is scared to get into a relationship. My ex told me he loved me then next day blocked my number and totally disappeared and I never saw him again.

Last time I saw this guy (f buddy), we went to the park...held hands...kissed...shared quite deep emotional stuff...I told him about my ex and started crying. I felt bad after. Then something changed after this...he told me he wanted us to be honest and to let him know if I ever ""catch feelings"". I told him it has been many years since I have felt in love, so unlikely to happen...but since then he has been on my mind :(

He didn't call after that day:(. We had agreed we would make plans and tbh we were both horny as hell that day so I was gonna suggest that he came over this weekend but I'm scared because I think I'm about to fall for him :(

She wrote that she‚Äôs a demi sexual but I never heard that term before.


We started talking and her personality was just humble , funny, wise and calm.  We were so chatty and interactive not something typical I get from those dating apps.  

We felt like we needed to see each other immediately, so I asked her if she had free time to go out and without even hesitating, or making me plan everything, she just requested me to meet her at this beautiful park for a walk, very simple of her. 

We  met,  gave cheek kisses to each other and she suddenly spontaneously hugged me. I felt like my whole body was tingling  and I was warm and flushed. 

I never experienced this  sensation with any hook up before.


We kept talking to each other and looking at each other deeply , until  we found out that 2 hours passed. It was getting cold, she said it was getting dark and decided  to start walking towards the exit of the park to return home.

I remembered that she mentioned that she‚Äôs demisexual so I asked her about it, she told me that she‚Äôs still a virgin and didn‚Äôt feel like anyone felt right yet and it‚Äôs impossible for her to feel aroused to the point of being penetrated by someone she‚Äôs just seen in a day. 

But she told me that she always wanted to try something .. She blushed then looked deeply into my eyes again.

I felt like she felt pretty safe around me that‚Äôs why she felt comfortable telling me. 

She told me, looking at my abdomen , that she always wanted to feel what a penis would feel like in her hands, and she always felt fascinated by how sensitive that area was for men and asked me if I felt okay if I would let her experience this sensation, but without me touching her in any way. Just her. Feeling my penis.

I accepted I felt comfortable too around her

We sat in the back seat of my car,, we started kissing, she was so sensual and soft with her kisses on my neck, 
I took off my pants and she saw my big erection. 


Her pupils dilated, and she put her little cold hands softly on it and began feeling it, of course asking me first if I was okay with it. And I noded and was almost on verge of moaning. 

She began kissing it so gently, then licking it until she reached the tip. I won‚Äôt elaborate more about the event but God I was in another dimension. She left me shaking, the feeling was so good I never wanted her to leave,  I never felt this sensation before in my life. And I never expected this timid beautiful girl to be so sensual and making me orgasm just with the soft touch of her lips.

I was still dizzy from the feeling, she kissed me gently and got out of the car leaving sedated.

I checked them out, continued the conversation and didn't think anything of it. Then she asked me for my IG and I told her I had deleted during the divorce. Same goes for Facebook too.

I tell her I don't have either and the conversation just stops. Next morning she texts me saying it's creepy I don't have active social media. That it indicates I'm sort of weird loner or have some crazy fucked up secret to keep.

I never cared for either and only joined up to make my wife happy. Nearly all my activity was liking and sharing her various posts. I just don't want to live my life on public display pretending other people care what I had for lunch. So when things ended I deleted them along with all sorts of stuff associated to my ex wife. 

But none of that mattered to her so I'm fine with not going further.

I had to make a post but the title says pretty much what's going on here.

  
I'm 25, work as an engineer, have decent looks with a well defined jawline, and sometimes I'm kind of funny. I gave up on tinder and have been using hinge for awhile now, and usually get about 2-3 matches a day. Getting #'s is successful, and as the title suggests, the person is very eager to meet me for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when the problem happens. I pick a relatively good way to meet, whether its dinner, coffee, an alcoholic drink, or something like that. I dress alright, not like suit level but I don't look like a bum in sweats. I make sure I'm showered, smell good, look myself thoroughly in the mirror, keep my phone in my pocket on silent and go into the date on time. I listen, let her come up with topics as equally as I do, and never try to force a physical move unless it just feels right, such as if she is close to me when we are leaving and a hug would be good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 0-9 so far this year. 9 first dates, and every single one of them had a response afterwards or a few days after struggling conversation that was something along the lines of ""I don't see this going anywhere"" or ""I don't think you are right for me"".

&amp;#x200B;

Is this just bad luck? Sometimes I try to establish the second date on the first date. I follow up usually the next day or same night after meeting, it's literally like after we meet, the person is just like What The Actual Fuck Was That and you can literally tell by the way they reply to me.

Her friend called to see where she was sitting, but after a few seconds she switched from English to Spanish.

She even tried to kiss me when the game was over. 

I never let her know I understood everything she said to her friend. But I also don‚Äôt plan on ever going out with her again. We‚Äôre not dating so idc who she hooks up with, but the whole situation made her seem a little toxic.

For the one I have great chemistry with, we laugh a lot together, we like to have fun the same way, and the physical and emotional attraction to one another is through the roof.

He has a good job but his approach to life is a bit more ""go with the flow"" which makes me slightly weary because I want stability as I do want children eventually. He does too, but he isn't as concrete about his plans. He is a good communicator though and shows good emotional maturity which I appreciate. My biggest concern is being able to see our 5+ year future at a glance. (I'm a bit of a planner but also like spontaneity). 

For the one I have seemingly great compatibility with, we work in the same field and have a similar approach with how we plan our lives and careers. He is a go-getter and knows exactly what he wants. He has a great career with a clear path on where he is headed. Our chemistry is not terrible, but it could be better. I don't laugh as much when I'm with him and while he is a sweet and empathetic person, he is a bit more serious of a person.

After several parties and failed attempts, I had little to no success in the first 2 weeks. Once school started to pick up, I was like F\*\*\* it. I'm just going to focus on myself and have the best f\*\*\*ing college experience of my life and get wasted every weekend while talking to as many girls as possible. With that I started binging Trailer Park Boys late at night. (Great show, 100% should watch) Little did I know watching that show eventually caused me to stay up late missing one of my classes. 

One day, after binging the entire season 7 of Trailer Park Boys in one night, I overslept and missed my first class. I ended up having to attend the next class session. I got in the class, and I just randomly sat down. After class, I was just about to leave to grab lunch when I noticed some familiar people in a group gathered around the teacher after class. I talked to them and we each introduced each other, exchanged numbers and formed a study group. In this group there were 3 girls and 3 guys including me. We got lunch and we vibed pretty well, talking and sharing stories about ourselves. Then everybody starts to leave, I walk with 2 girls and they each were going into separate directions. I chose the other girl who had I felt was different from any other girl I've talked to before. We talked while heading to lunch and Idk it just felt right. We sat next to each other, did some work, talked and I thought nothing of it. We hugged, I left going back to my regular class time.

In my other earlier class section, I started to realize it was really boring. So I made the permanent switch to the class where we had formed the study group earlier. I met up with the group again, had lunch, talked. This time we headed to the computer lab, and I was just talking to a friend within the group just going through typical excel nerd shit. She leaves with the others, but then out of the blue she comes back and sits next to me. We strike up a convo, my friend takes a nap with a mask on his face and I just invited her to come to the basketball game with me and get ""lit"" with me. Mind you, I think both of us thought nothing more than a friendly hang out.

Comes game time, we had fun and chatted a lot before and after the game. We then grabbed food and talked some more. It was mostly her talking about her family and stuff going on. Later, we both head over to my friend's after party. Turns out at that party, all my friends had brought their GF in town. We were the only ""single"" ones. We both got drunk, one thing lead to another, and we kissed.

Shit gets awkward, but we texted a bit and we met up to discuss what had happened. She said she wasn't ready yet for a relationship cuz of her crazy ex. I was like ok cool whatever. Fast forward, the whole group decided to meet up to watch a movie, which happened to be at my place. We all got high, the rest of the friends drove off and she asked if she could stay the night. I said sure, and then later on she gets a phone call that wasn't good. We talked it out in my room, I said you can sleep here if you want. Then while we were in bed, we both stared at each other and started making out for the next 2 hours lol. It was pretty f\*\*\*ing fun. We both left for class the next morning and thought nothing of it.

Then we text again later that day and the phone call still got her really upset. I offered to come over and we made out again, this time with me sleeping over at her place. We do this for 3-4 more times, ran the 4 bases until finally the friend group caught on. We then eventually both agreed to be official. And we've been together for 1 whole year and counting now.

Fast forward to late August when he messages on fb. I ignored it at first figuring he was just pulling a submarine. He messages again about a week ago and I opened the message by mistake as I was sharing memes with another friend. He seemed apologetic about before, and psyched about making plans though I said I was busy with work for a week but we should chat on a regular to get a feel for our times (we both have odd work hours)

I was wary about giving it another go, but otoh, it was a little exciting to think about this handsome new person. It‚Äôs been two days now tho and I haven‚Äôt heard from him. 


I‚Äôm less bummed about it as I was the first time figuring this could happen again if I gave it another chance, but I don‚Äôt get the logic of it tbh.

I‚Äôm Indian and my boyfriend is Tibetan. We have been dating for 2.5 years now. My parents have been super accepting of him him, but his mom really doesn‚Äôt like me, all because I‚Äôm Indian. Nothing to do with my personality or anything else, just because I‚Äôm Indian.

Btw we are long distance which makes it even harder because his parents don‚Äôt like him spending any time with me (whether it be on the phone, discord, going to see eachother). I get upset because of all this and I don‚Äôt know whether I can deal with this any longer. We have plans to move out together next next but that‚Äôs still up in the air.

I (M26) started texting a girl on a dating app. Conversations were very smooth, and she seemed interested in me. She pretty gentle and not superficial. Yesterday i wrote her if should would like in a near future to meet up dans do something together. She replied that she would adore it ! We scheduled it wednesday night, but she gave the idea to go eat at the restaurant. Thing is, i read a lot of girls here in reddit say that a guy that doesnt pay at first ""date"" are cheap. Thing is, for me, a first meeting is just friendly, that is why i always try to disomething that doesnt need someone to play. But this time, she seems to want this.

I got a lot of experiences in the past where i paid for the other person at the firsts dates when they were just not interested in reality.

hhh.. So I am new to dating. Okay like I have gone on dates but never had feelings for anyone or a crush until I met this one guy. We met online in the context of he was a member of a state group chat for ppl into gaming and geek stuff. We ended up messaging  private outside the main chat and things were awesome. We were gonna meet in person but we lived on opposite ends of the state and he ended up moving to a state over 1,000 miles away. One day he just never responded and that was that. that was five years ago and I knew I really liked this dude but I figured guess it wasn't meant to be.

Well earlier this year I reached out and sent a meme on twitter and we started talking again. I found out he was going through was breaking up with his boyfriend (the first one he had and came out to everyone with). up to this point it was his longest relationship and he had been thinking of moving back. 

At the time I had no intention of anything I was just glad to have a close friend back. It was like reconnecting with one of your bros. Well within a month of talking everyday and all the time, playing games and vibing on discord and helping him sort through his emotions I realized I had feelings for him. I understood he just got out of a very important relationship so I wasn't going to press but then I started noticing he would be flirting with me and one day we both expressed our feelings and I was overcome with this emotion of joy. Like warm but electric it was amazing! Something I have never felt before for someone. Remind you I am 23 and having never really been in a relationship so all this was so exciting and I couldn't believe we felt the same. 

I told him how I didn't like long distance and I wasn't sure but he told me this would be the best way to get to know each other. I said I was willing to try and put in the extra effort and explore these feelings.

Man the following month was awesome we talked all the time, got to know each other much more and deeper and everything was great. He planned a trip to come back to the state. I knew it wasn't just to visit me, he still had friends up here and family he was gonna visit but I was so excited to finally meet this guy in person. Like I never even had seen what he looked like. So the week comes and he arrives on a monday. I  made sure my whole week was cleared so if he had time to hang I could. We only were like, an hour away from each other with a big city equally distanced away. Well, that week came and he was like, busy.. He kinda avoided the whole let meet up and do a date/meet up. I finally got him to meet up on that Friday (he was leaving on that following tuesday). We met and yeah, he was better then I could have imaged and we clicked.  it was kinda awkward at first both being kinda introverted people but he had me do all the planning. Its like I had to be the one to say let's hang even though he was the one with the schedule and visiting other ppl. Okay we spent the whole day together was great arcade, mall, restaurant and walk around the city date. All went well and we both went home and texted later that night and everything was cool and we were excited. 

I was able to get him to do one more date that sunday and that was a great day, we explored a town, played soccer, frisbee went on a picnic and laid on a soccer field looking at the stars and the moon. Then he went home..

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get weird. So he gets home and he stops responding as much. Normally we would respond in like 10 or so minutes and I normally dont care but he started sounding less interested in the conversation and sometimes wouldn't respond for 2-3 hours. He said he was busy with work and stuff which I understood but I would see him online with his phone on discord and he was one twitter so he clearly was using his phone. His responses were always closed and he stopped talking about himself and just kinda, did the basic hi how are you, nice. things. When I kinda played with the idea of applying to jobs down there or what his plans were with moving back here after visiting and he would always just avoid or change subject. So I stopped, I want to say I didnt push on the idea just was one convo.

I asked him how everything was going as we were a month in and kinda wanted to see the vibe of this dating thing. He then went on a long rant that culminated with, *""I dont think I can do this long distance relationship thing. I cant really get to know you and I express me affection physically and in person etc.""* I wont lie, this kinda hit hard but I knew this would be challenging. So we agreed we would just keep talking normally like friends and stuff which was fine cuz its not like we did anything.

Well, what has been bothering me is... The way he ended it he kept reiterating ""*Oh I am not saying I wont move back and not calling off the possibility of a relationship. I might move back I have nothing keeping me here.""* Ask about stuff in the state and talks about how much he misses etc. its all very confusing. The biggest thing is he now just hardly talks to me now. Like, guy doesn't play games with me anymore, sometimes doesn't message back for 7 hours or so and he says he work is busy. He said, yeah I have been trying to not use my phone as much and lean off social media. Okay thats great but THATS HOW WE TALK, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO TRY THIS WHOLE LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP THING. I made sure I would message him back. But he also says he always available to hang and do stuff with his friends. so like I feel like I am some back friend or something. He plays games on discord but wont play with me. He always says ""MAYBE"" and like, maybe means no. 

And just, I hate emotions right. I want to get over him and my feelings. I want to just stop messaging him cuz I should. He has treated me like crap and keeps dragging me on like I am some kinda back up. and like, he still talks to his ex. I know this cuz when we were on a date, his phone kept going off and I unintentionally looked once when his phone went off and like, I know they have kept in contact. He refollowed them on twitter and just.. I feel like i was some kinda of emotional rebound for him and that makes it hurt so much more. Like are they hanging again, why does he seem to have so much free time hanging with his friends down there. I get so annoyed with how he just, stopped talking to me... Yet I keep messaging him back... I don't know should I just stop messaging him one of these days? Should I confront him about it? Guy always says ""*yeah I am always down to game when I am not busy""* but always seems to be busy when I want to game and stuff. AHH I hate it but I like him and I need to shut this door but I is just so hard cuz it is something I wanted for so long and I had a taste of it. Maybe its because I haven't felt like this towards anyone in my life idk just... I am exhausted. I know I should let him go and just cut him out but.... HOW...

At first things were great but it quickly went to crap as Jake was a narcissist, rude to me, put me down a lot, and has anger issues and blows up at the smallest things. But for some reason, I didn't leave because I was attracted to him... and probably because I was lonely and I was desperately trying to hang onto those good moments we had and hoping he came around eventually (I know, I'm stupid). When he wasn't in one of his weird moods, we still usually always had fun together so I figured we could just keep things casual for now. Plus we never really established a relationship and it seemed more like a FWB type thing and I was okay with that. Jake was also dating other women so I figure I might as well do the same and keep my options open.

Jake had told me has an identical twin brother and they used to be roommates but apparently they had a lot of drama and crap involving their exes so his brother Ben moved out. He had a lot of negative things to say about his brother (then again, he spoke negatively of almost everyone he talked about) but a few of the things he told me like how Ben was a gamer and into nerdy things intrigued me because I like those things. Of course, I wasn't going to tell him I wanted to meet his brother but I was curious about him. 

So this past weekend, Jake was moving from his old apartment to a new one across town and his brother was over helping him move. I had forgotten some of my belongings at Jake's place so I asked if I could swing by and grab them real quick and he said it was fine so I went to his place. When I got there, they were both stoned out of their minds on CBD gummies and just sitting around. The 3 of us eventually ended up hanging out and having some drinks while they slowly moved stuff to the truck. Jake was in one of his weird moods where he doesn't talk and just has this intense gaze and runs around frantically doing stuff and Ben just told me that this is normal behavior for Jake. Ben and I ended up talking a lot the whole time since Jake didn't seem interested and honestly, I was really vibing with Ben. I didn't know if it was appropriate to pursue anything with Ben, but since I knew Jake wasn't interested in being in a relationship with me, I figured it'd be okay to try. So towards the end of the night before I went home, I slipped Ben a piece of paper with my number on it and told him if it was too awkward to talk to a chick his brother was 'kinda' dating to just not worry about it. 

When I got back to my car to leave, Ben texted me immediately and asked if I wanted to hang out later. So in the end, I invited him back to my place and we ended up talking and hanging out for hours and eventually hooked up. Turns out, we have way more in common than me and Jake and he was also a lot nicer and confirmed all the negative things about Jake was his personality and that he had ruined almost all his past relationships because of his behavior. Ben and I are planning to hang out later this week and go on a date but now I am conflicted because I am not sure how Jake will react when he finds out. I don't want to mess up their already rocky relationship and I realize the situation is pretty awkward. Obviously, Ben already knows I've been with Jake but they don't really talk or hang out much. On the other hand, I feel like Jake already has a feeling we were hanging out because he called me randomly at 4AM in the morning (this is 2 hours after Ben and I left his place and Jake was suppose to be in bed for work the next morning and not awake) and I didn't answer because I didn't know what he'd ask or what I'd tell him if he asked his brother was there. I have never been in a situation like this before so I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't really know Ben that well since I just met him so I don't know where this is going to end up going, but at the same time I feel like I do sort of already know him because of what Jake is told me, pictures I've seen, and since.... they're identical twins.

But at least, I can now check off my ""dated both identical twins"" off my bucket list (/s) and in case you're curious, yes they are the same size if you know what I mean and even kind of do it the same way. And also, there's no way I'd confuse the two brothers because while they are identical and the same height, Jake has short hair and usually clean shaves and has more of a lean soccer player build while Ben is more muscular and big and has longer hair and a beard. But yea I guess my question is... how the hell do I deal with this situation?? I suppose I should end things with Jake if I am going to try to date Ben?
