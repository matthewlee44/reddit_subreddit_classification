This website is ridiculous. Obviously, I'm not naive enough to think their algorithm is literally 'scientific' or whatever, but I did assume that if I paid some money I'd be more likely to find serious guys looking for a real relationship. I still think that might be the case, but this is by far the worst matchmaking service I've come across, and they were going through charge me $50 on a monthly basis.

As far as relevant demographics go: I am a gay man, late 20s, right outside Albany, NY. I'm a manufacturer interested in nearby dudes with similar occupations, but I have very few hangups otherwise (e.g., race, height, etc. are all left blank in search parameters). I'm really not being picky or weird here, just looking for somebody who lives in more or less the same world I live in.

I got 5 matches my first day. Of those, one was located in another state. Before I paid for my subscription, I had a free account in that other state, so I'm not surprised that it wound up being ""carried over"" into my premium matches. However, his was the only profile I was remotely compatible with, as he was an assembler and a handsome dude.

One of the other 5 matches had no photos whatsoever—well, I am neither naive nor new to the wonderful, wonderful world of online dating, and I am sure as hell not interested in anybody who can't put up a single face pic on a paid dating site. The other three were all from white collar backgrounds, with interests and backgrounds that bear no resemblance or relation whatsoever to my own. Over the next two days, I received exactly zero new matches.

When I first emailed to complain, I was told to modify my search criteria in order to cast a wider net. Specifically, I'm now expected to go galavanting across the country to go on dates—because, again, the only actual search criterion I had was distance.... and I live in the friggin capital of New York. I don't have the time or the resources to be taking weekly trips to Virginia for coffee dates that probably won't lead anywhere. Nor am I interested in a long distance relationship that we all know is not going to work out.

I have had WAY better luck with Tinder, Plenty of Fish, and even Grindr. It is absurd to me that eHarmony has been able to get away with charging obscene amounts of money for such a lousy service, all while boasting that their algorithm is the divine Logos immanently actualizing the eschaton one preordained match at a time.

I'm glad they gave me my refund after a few emails, because I was about ready to start saying some very nasty stuff.

Her proposed solution was either we move in together or ""the other end of things"" (presumably, also seeing other people/breaking up).

Dave and I had a one night stand but he did and said all the right things. Wanted to see me again and kept texting me sweet things. Opened up to me and made me feel understood. I thought that I finally met somebody who saw me more than a one time thing. 

I opened up to him about how I felt and told me that he felt the same. He told me I was his girlfriend but the entire time his actions did not match his words. I got over invested and it is my fault. He always told me that he liked me but the problem was that he is having a rough time. If I get upset that he is not giving me attention, he will call me sensitive and emotional. I felt that I was the problem so I started suppressing my emotions and accepting what he was willing to give me. Things started getting progressively worse. He will cancel dates, takes ages to reply to me, and did not even bother calling me. When I complained about it, he got upset and said that I can leave if I want to. I lashed out and he blocked me. 

I can't believe I let myself believe him when everything was clear. He never liked me. He thought I was a convenient fuck. He even never even bothered to drive me home and always made me pay for my commute to him (uber). I should have seen that. I am in so much pain. Feeling suicidal to be frank. Feeling alone, empty, betrayed and devastated. Even though it has only lasted for 2 months, Dave broke my heart and left a deep hole in it. I have never been loved before and he gave me the illusion that I finally found my person. I can never get over him or what he did to me. I am so stupid. I am so desperate to be loved that I fell so hard for him and he dropped like a hot potato the moment things were no longer convenient for him. 

He couldn't tolerate anything from me, on the other hand, his ex used to hit him and he happily stayed with her for 4 years. he told me he loved her. I should have known that I was not the problem, that he just didn't love me or like me enough. Of course he loved her, she is more beautiful, successful, rich and has a better social circle than me. What's there to not love? meanwhile, I am a chubby, okay looking girl, who is struggling to make ends meet and has zero friends.

Please send help..

I met a girl on tinder 3 weeks ago, we had some small talk and I asked her out and she agreed and we exchanged IGs. I told her that I am very busy this week and would take her out next weekend. I didn’t texted her for a week as I was very busy but last weekend I did asked her for a date that Saturday. 

On the day of the date, we both wanted to try this amazing Italian place so we decided to go there. I asked her if she would like to walk around the area before the dinner as I didn’t wanted to get in a formal dining setting right away (it’s a very nice st with lots of shops and outdoor seating restaurants). But then due to reservation timing issue, we had to directly meet at the restaurant. I felt that the date went pretty great. We drank, we ate a lot, we laughed, at one point I changed my seat from across the table to next to her and we were having a banter about music choices and I made sure that she was comfortable by the change in distance. She is just so sweet, smart and adorable that by the end of the dinner I was much more attracted to her than I was going into the date. Then we walked around the place for a while she tried to remember where she parked, we were still having good conversations and laughing. I really wanted to hold her hands by this point but she never removed her hand from her jacket as she was feeling quite cold, so I didn’t try. She offered to drop me off as I don’t have a car and we simply hugged and exchanged numbers. 

After this we texted each other on a daily basis but as both of us are quite busy on weekdays it was not long conversations but we were connected and sharing daily events and sharing some banter. We made plans to meet again this weekend. We specifically chose Friday as she didn’t have to go to work on Saturday (she sometimes work on Saturdays) so that she is not worried about office early morning the next day. We decided to meet on this one street in downtown and try out some bars and then maybe go for ice cream . As Friday came, I was very excited about this date as I thought I could have a great connection with her. 

2nd date: We decided to meet at 7. And she texted me on time that she has left her place. As I am a very punctual person I reached there at 6:50 and after waiting for like half an hour I got a text from her that she is unable to find a parking and has been circling around the area for like the past 20 mins. I get into the car with her outside a parking garage and we decide to park at this really shady lot. At this point she is noticeably irritated and is clearly not in a mood for the date and saying “she will leave early”. I understand that she has had a long day at work and then the parking situation really pissed her off (she had expressed concerns about parking situation in downtown before the date). I thought it was partly my fault as well as I did not plan well. That’s why i didn’t made much out of it as I understood her frustrations completely. I hoped as the date might progress when we eat and drink, she might feel better. But now she is not in the mood to eat or drink anything. We walked a bit and then went to a outdoor seating bar where some live music was playing. We talked but it was nothing too interesting or we just reiterating things about first date. I was so hungry but I didn’t wanted to sit and eat a pizza while she watches me. When the server came, she just asked for water and I ordered a drink for myself as I didn’t wanted to sit there and just order water. I am still trying my best to engage her but it doesn’t work very well. So of-course this date went pretty bad and she decided to leave after 1.5hr as she is now feeling sleepy, i suggest that it’s still quite early and we can checkout the ice cream place, but she is not in the mood. Again she offered to drop me off even after I insisted that I will take the uber and she doesn’t need to go in the opposite direction. 

By this point, I was a bit frustrated as well as I had imagined this date to be even better than the first one as she seemed interested as well in the messaging. When she dropped me off, she nicely said that “it was nice and thank you” and I replied with the same and after a very awkward hug I went back to my building. (I was back in my apartment at 9:15 🥲). She did suggest that we could hang out again and i asked what’s her availability over the weekend but decided to discuss it later over text. I was not sure what to text her after this kind of date. By the time i was thinking she texted that she has reached home and she had a nice time. To which i replied that I would love to hangout with her again sometime and she should let me know if she’s available in the near future. And also said sorry about choosing downtown. (I don’t have a car, so i really don’t know about these parking struggles).

My true preferred age range is 30-37. And I get the least amount of likes from guys when I set it to that. And yeah yeah yeah someone will say it so here it goes: it’s cause these guys all want 20 year olds. K thanks. 

Anyways moving on. 

The very few likes that I do get from guys in that age range are not AT ALL what I’m looking for. And I know people are gonna say I need to just accept “what I can get” but I’m talking like MAJOR lifestyle discrepancies (among other things) between myself and these people to the point where I wonder if being single is even that bad when compared to dating someone you have to compromise on literally every single thing on. 

So one day I was like okay you know what I look a lot younger than my age, like by 5-6 years - due to my lifestyle but mostly genetics (both my parents look a decade younger). So I was like I’m open to dating a younger guy (one who’s mature and has his life together). So I changed my age range to 25-37 and my phone blew up with likes from SUPER hot guys, like all USC grads and everything and I was like ok wow! Some were trying to be causal but most were open to a relationship. 

I’ve tried setting it to older too like up to 40. I don’t typically get likes from guys 37-40 though. I think it’s probably cause there’s fewer guys in this age range on dating apps or maybe they’re also trying to get with 20 years lol, who knows. But it’s fine cause I don’t even desire guys in this age range anyways. 

I still feel really bummed out that I can’t attract guys my own age or what is believed to be appropriate for me. 

I know people are gonna tell me I need to stop complaining because I’m getting likes and matched anyways but like…. It’s not from what I want. Like I don’t understand what’s so unusual about, for example, a 34 year old guy with a 30 year old woman?? Why aren’t guys in that age group interested? 

Does nobody just want a 30 year old woman anymore???? Women in their 30s date and marry allll the time lol with guys their own age too. So what’s going on??

I get that perspective, but often feel the flip-side is missing. 

*Traditional dating was far worse.*

This concept of thinking all of our grandparents stayed together because Instagram didn't exist does not tell the full story. My grandparents are in their 80s and have been together all their lives. He was an abusive alcoholic who beat her, cheated on her, and demeaned her but she stayed with him because she couldn't afford to leave. On top of that, divorce was shunned.

I'm not saying that was *every* traditional relationship, but it was many.

We're in an age of so much opportunity, and I genuinely feel our culture likes to shift the blame instead of looking inward. LGBT+ people can now get married, people into alt relationship structures can find their people, hell farmers can even find their people! Women can financially support themselves, people don't have to stay in physically/mentally abusive relationships because of religion, family shunning, or finances. 

Are there issues? Of course. Have we over-corrected in some areas? Yes, absolutely. But this is the most opportunity we've ever had in human history to actually improve the quality of our lives. Mental health is not stigmatized, you can create at-home workouts, information on events/meetups/hobby groups are a few clicks away. The opportunity is there. 

Despite what people think, most people are average and most people are not living their entire lives online. Most people find love, most people get married, most people aren't out here only dating supermodels or rich people or famous people.

Everytime I've read a post here about someone's dating struggles and they've said they ""tried everything,"" I often ask some follow-up questions and turns out, they've barely tried anything.

Keeping it real here, the problem isn't (just) people's standards. The problem is people aren't leaving their houses. They're not socializing. They're not trying. They're not starting conversations with people, *in person*, yes, *not just online*. We *all* know that dating apps have lopsided experiences, make people more superficial and aren't the best way to find lasting connections. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing *over and over and over* again and expecting different results. 

(I'm not saying you can't use them or they can't be a backup, I realize they work for some but my only point is that if they're not working for you, you might have to try other avenues where your more attractive qualities can get extended interaction)

* Here's a possible experiment I encourage anyone to do over the next week or so: Go to a few new places alone. Maybe happy hour at a bar, or a workout group, or an open mic, whatever you're into. Make it a goal to strike up random conversation with anyone who looks open to it, could be the weather, hobbies, what you're drinking, music, sports, etc. 50% of those people have to be people you're NOT physically attracted to. 

See how easy it is. Try. See how receptive many people will genuinely be to casual conversation. Don't just do it once and give up. Try 20 new people. Then take that same casual energy, and apply it to people in the future you find attractive. Report back with the results.

A bunch of people showed up who neither of us knew so we wound up talking all night. Before she left, she asked for my number and then texted me when she got home. I eventually asked her out for a drink, it went well, and the second or third time we got drinks she said that she wasn’t looking for anything serious because she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship 3 months prior and they were very co dependent. I said I understood but we continued to talk and got drinks a few more times. We were both living with our parents at the time so neither of us could really invite the other inside. After getting drinks like 5 or 6 times over 2 months, I moved to the city and immediately invited her to stay over, an offer which she enthusiastically accepted. She works like 20 minutes from my apartment so she came over right after work, so at around 4pm, and we spent the rest of the night and following morning together. This was the beginning of September. Fast forward to now, she has come over almost every Friday after work, with us either making dinner, ordering takeout, or going out to dinner. When we’re together, she’s clearly very into me and obviously I’m very into her. When we’re not together, she takes an annoying amount of time to respond to simple texts (like sometimes 24 hours). It’s not like I’m inundating her with texts, as I want to give her space, seeing as things picked up pretty quickly. Plus, she has a lot going on in her life right now. I try not to let her lack of responsiveness bother me, as she is a genuinely nice person, but it does and causes me to overthink every little thing I send.

As I said, I’m very into her and she’s clearly very into me (when we’re together), and at this point I can say I would want a more serious relationship with her in the future. When she’s not around, my friends and roommates have referred to her as my girlfriend and I’ll always clarify that she is not my girlfriend. A few of my friends have expressed shock/confusion when I say that I haven’t talked to her about being exclusive/the status of our relationship in general. This is another thing that has caused me to overthink.

So, I guess the point of my post is: how should I interpret her lack of responsiveness over text and how should I move forward in regards to the status of our relationship? I’m thinking I should give it another few weeks before I address it.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Anyway after we got out of the movie, we were walking over to the restaurant to have dinner (like a 5 min walk) and she pulls out her phone and calls back her friend that had been texting her. As she’s talking to her friend she’s like “oh no he broke with you??!!” And then she whispers to me “I have to go.” She gets off the phone and says her best friend just got broken up with so she needed to go and comfort her. It was obviously a way for her to get out of the date.

I walk her back to her car and she’s like “I feel so bad!” And all this bullshit when it was clearly fake bc she didn’t even text me the day after. I don’t know the whole thing just pissed me off.

She responded enthusiastically,  and said that she would absolutely be willing to introduce me to her, and that she personally thinks I'd be a great guy for her.

That was a few days ago, and I really don't hang out with this girl at all so I have no idea where to go from here, or when she will introduce me to her friend.

its only ever been hi hows it going in the hallways, until recently she's been calling me by name, idk where she got it from cuz I didnt tell her, she starts conversations that arnt really work related and she's been brining me stuff like coffee snacks etc.

now at first I thought nothing of it, but this past week she's been asking me if I know her name, she makes me say it, including her last name, this has happened now like 5 times, ofcourse I know her name and she knows I know it yet she keeps asking if I know it, what's that about?

yesterday I wore jeans to work as I was going out with friends after, when her and her friend asked me why, instantly she said is it a date? I was like nah but they kept saying its defo a date. 

her friend then comes to my dept n questions me for 5 mins if it is actually a date or no 😂 


anyways I brought them some ice cream and I couldve sworn the was a spoon I hers,but she cae to my dept to ask for a spoon.


now I'm pretty dense with this stuff and my self esteem isn't the highest so I find it hard to believe she'd be in to me.

but what I wna ask is from what you've read here, do u belive there's something goin on with her? is she into me? do I make a move or not?

I met my GF 5 years ago while we were both pursuing a very challenging career... We bonded through all the shit that this career path put us through and we honestly wouldn't be where we are today without each other. She would literally do anything for me and I'd do anything for her...and I honestly couldn't see myself raising kids or growing old with anyone else... 

During all this time, something's that been tough is how much she hates my family. My family is very different from hers or that of her previous relationships and this has led to a lot of problems over the years. 

While her family openly shows gratitude and is very giving, mine is reserved...so she doesn't get those things with mine. As a result, she's builds resentment over things like them not openly thanking her for what shes done for me... I understand how this sucks for her, so through the years I've tried to mediate any misunderstandings. There was this time two years ago when her and one of my family members talked things through and it finally seemed like everything was going to be okay...this was the happiest I'd felt in a really long time, but a week later she was already bad mouthing this family member. It just really sucks being caught in the middle, especially when nothing seems to change... She still refers to them as my shitty family. 

My family is far from perfect and I do acknowledge their wrong doings but her hate for them is what's toxic. It affects her too, I know she doesn't want to feel that way, but she does and I know it affects her mental health. We may be doing wonderful but if she stumbles upon something that reminds her of a certain family member, she'll distance herself from me because I'm associated with them. 

I honestly don't know if there's any mending this. I am either happy in the relationship or happy at home but not both. My parents have sacrificed a ton for me...and I hate pushing them away, but this relationship has caused me to do that. I hide texts from family members as if I was hiding an affair... I wasn't there for my family in critical times when I know they needed me because I was too worried to pick up in front of her...

I just want to feel at peace, that's really all I want...as much as I love her and care for her, I don't know if continuing on is the best. I could really use any words of advice.

He and I live in different countries, and there is a small language barrier between us, but we still got along really well. We hung out for multiple days for several hours at a time. While on the trip, he met some other people our age, and they would go to the bars at night. He invited me to come, and so I did.

I met the other teenagers, and they were all really friendly. One guy (19M) in particular was very friendly, and we'll call him Guy B to avoid any confusion. I had to sit down on a couch because I was getting a bit drunk, to the point where I was almost falling asleep, and Guy B sat down next to me. He put his hand around my waist and placed my head on his chest. I left early, but everyone else was still there. Guy B started talking about how he wanted to get with me. Guy A got mad at Guy B and pushed him, telling him that he couldn't have me. When Guy B asked why, he told him that it was because he liked me.

And of course, as any teenager would, the next morning, they all told me. They did nothing wrong; that's what teenagers are going to do. But I got really excited because I liked him too, and before he left, I asked him if he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time.

I was bummed out that he was with someone else, but I hoped that we could be social media friends at least. I sent him a request on Instagram, and he left it pending for about two weeks before rejecting it. That's when I knew that he didn't want me in his life. I have to admit, it really hurt, but I understand that he was trying to do the right thing for his girlfriend. Even if he did like me, he needed to distance himself in order to fight for his relationship. I just wish he hadn't gotten my hopes up like that.

Two months after he and I met, he broke up with his girlfriend. He then started being all over my social media, watching my Instagram stories and my TikToks multiple times. He still hasn't reached out to me, though. But the reason why I know that he still likes me is because he still talks to the other kids we met on vacation. They tell me that he thinks about me everyday, and that he's sorry for what he did to me. And that he fantasizes about having a future with me. Eventually, I had enough. Why couldn't he tell me himself that he likes me? I told them that I think that he's a POS, and one of them ended up telling him. He was crushed that I thought that about him, but that he still hopes for a future with me.

I know he felt badly about leading me on like that, and he still likes me, so I wonder if I'm wrong for calling him that or if I should be happy to call him out on his BS?

Tl;dr: guy I met on vacation led me on, only for him to have a girlfriend the whole time. Because he liked me, he cut off all contact with me. He broke up with his girlfriend, and now wants me back. He tells a bunch of our friends to tell me that he still thinks about me.

I found her attractive but we went around 2-3 weeks before talking to each other. It was random, but one day we both started talking and really hit it off. We talked for a majority of our shift and she eventually decided to give me a nickname. Ever since then we both talk a lot when we are working together. We have now been talking for around 3 weeks.  I have a lot of fun and I am very comfortable around her. She also makes sure to say hi to me whenever either of us clock in. One time I didn’t say hi, cause we were extremely busy, and she found me later and complained that I didn’t say hello. She also seems to be comfortable around me. She randomly will speak in accents or do little dances when she is around me. She also will say my name in funny ways when she sees me. I also recently learned that both of us are going to the same university, which is why she transferred to my store. On top of that, both of us are interested in the same major/careers. However, her school workload is way more than mine, she is taking 20 credits and I’m at 13. Which means that she only works 2-3 days of the week, so we don’t work together often. One day when I clocked in she asked me about my day, and I went disc golfing earlier at our campus. She said that disc golfing seems interesting to her but she is really bad at throwing discs. Now in my head I really wanted to invite her to play with me but in the moment I decided not to. I was really kicking myself later on, but it is what it is. I really want to ask her to hang out with me outside of work sometime, but we haven’t worked together in a little over a week. I would just like some input on a couple things. She is a really social person and talks to a lot of people, but the stuff I mentioned above are things I think are unique to me. I was just wondering if you guys think she might be interested in me? I think there is a chance, but not entirely sure. Also, I was planning on asking her if she would be interested in joining me for a round of disc golf when I see her next. However, I know that it might not be the most ideal place for a first time hang out. I was just thinking that since she said she was interested and the course is within walking distance from where she lives, but still not sure. I just don’t know where else to suggest as a hang out spot. Lastly, I am going to a Halloween party and was considering inviting her. It would be mainly my friends, so mostly guys, and a few of the girls that live around my apartment. I wasn’t going to invite her unless we hung out before the party, so we can get to know each other more first. Also, I would also invite any friends that she wanted to bring. Sorry that this wasn’t the shortest or most well written piece but I just need to clear some thoughts. Also another thing, I don’t have a ton of experience with dating. Most of my previous ”relationships“ lasted about a month and the longest being back in high school at 4 months. Looking forward to your input!

We have been texting for about three weeks previously (almost on a daily basis). On the date, it seemed like she had a great time! We laughed, joked around, and she even gave me a BJ and complimented how I looked downstairs. On the drive back, she kissed me goodnight and, when I texted her after I got back home, she said that she’d give me an even better BJ next time. 

But, suddenly, the messages stopped. It’s been a week since i saw her and she only messaged me 3 times. Plus, she turned off her location on snap maps (which she had on before for me). 

At this point, I’ve come to terms that I did something wrong and she’s not interested in me any more. I get that. But what exactly I DID that made her not want to see me has been driving me insane this past week. I keep on wondering what I said, or didn’t say, that made her suddenly seem disinterested.  So, I was thinking about just reaching out and asking her for some clarification. 

Honestly, I’m trying to get back out there after a 4 year relationship and I just want to know what I did wrong so I won’t make the same mistake again.
