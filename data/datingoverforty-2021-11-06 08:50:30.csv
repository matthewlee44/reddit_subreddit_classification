0,qo1hzv,1636209269,Had to break up with him,"He (M63) and I (F61) were together for 4 years. I broke up with him a couple of years ago because he is bad with money. Although he has a decent job (makes about $58K) he has not filed taxes for 10 years, lives in a rooming house with 4 other men, and is almost always broke.
I went back to him, though, because I loved him and missed him so much. I thought that I could live with his irresponsibility with money since we weren’t married and I am financially independent.
I see why people say not to go back to an ex because you will break up again for the same reason. This is exactly what happened to me. I broke up with him last month - again. We hung out ALOT at my apartment and so I told him that we both had to take the time to clean it together. He counteroffered  to pay for a reasonably priced house cleaner. I found one who charges only $85/month. He’s been giving me money for that for almost a year, but, the last couple of months he said he didn’t have it. He also pays for groceries, and the last couple of months have been lighter on groceries as well.
He has a car payment and pays for part of the college tuition for his youngest child. He also pays for the room he rents. 
I pay rent, and utilities - which comes out to considerably more than he contributed, plus, my income is about $15k less than him.
I expressed all this in a post I did before the breakup because I was struggling with the idea of a breakup and one gentleman said “ you are his retirement plan “.
That comment rang so true to me that I broke up with him.
Now, a month later, I’m sad and lonely and wondering what he’s doing…I don’t want to go back to him, but, I miss him so much.
I’m angry at him too because he knew what he had to do to make things ok with me and just never did it, even though I offered to help out (budgeting for example), he changed for an instant then went back to being broke. I feel that he chose to be financially unstable over being with me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qo1hzv/had_to_break_up_with_him/
1,qo2ixa,1636212247,Girlfriend expecting me to feed her,"I've (46M) been dating her (40F) for 6 months now. Spends at least 3 nights per week at my place, often more. When we met she had no job, a month ago she finally got an ok one.

During all that time she had literally never paid for any date, ever. I felt sorry for her not having a job, and struggling to make ends meet (while I have a very good pay). So, every time we're together at my place, I felt like an obligation of feeding her. If I were on my own, I'd often go to a diner nearby, order something online, or I'd just do something super basic. With her we ended up going to the restaurant once a week, ordering online once or twice a week.

Recently I told her that I am starting to be tired of this, and that, if she is not going to contribute financially, she could at least cook once in a while (at least once a week). She made things way more complicated than need be, explaining that she needs such and such ingredients, that she'll have to take her recipe books with her, and so forth. I told her that she can bring whatever over, I can even get groceries for the ingredients if she gives me a shopping list (I am in-between jobs right now so I have plenty of time). It's only been 2 weeks since we had that big discussion, and so far she stuck to it, but it feels like she's dragging her feet having just that small contribution.

I wonder how I can make her understand that I don't envision a relationship other than on the basis of some equality, and if we can not be equal financially, that can be compensated on other fronts (e.g. housechores).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qo2ixa/girlfriend_expecting_me_to_feed_her/
2,qo46sn,1636217238,"A question for the men, do you find friendships with other men satisfying?","I'm curious to know if the men in this sub feel like they have satisfying relationships with other men in their lives. I'd be particularly interested to hear from straight men, so meaning that the relationships would be platonic. 

On the surface this might not seem like a dating question, but I think it's an important thing to consider for men and dating. 

A lot of times the only emotionally rewarding relationship a straight man has in his life is with his significant other. The obvious implications are that he can start to lean on this relationship too hard for his emotional needs, and not have other satisfying relationships in his life when/if the romantic relationship has problems or ends. He might not have anybody else in his life to process challenges in the relationship with either.  

I know this is a generalization and over simplification, and that's part of the reason why I wanted to put the question to this group. I'm especially curious to hear from single men over 40 on this.  

I know for myself that I struggle in my relationships with other men. I had a difficult relationship with my father, so obviously there are some issues there. But I also find that I prefer to talk more about emotional topics and exploring how we can all be learning and growing as humans. I notice that women are all too happy to engage in these conversations with me. Men not so much. 

I've been trying to reconnect with male friends as of late as a way to counterbalance too much dependence on relationships with women in my life. I gotta say, it's been frustrating. 

They talk a lot about movies, sports, gaming, and--of course--crypto currency (SO MUCH TALKING ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCY). I find that a lot of my guy friends are also pretty beholden to their own wives and girlfriends and live according to their schedules. I don't know if that's just my friend circle or does this happen for a lot of men over 40 in relationships. Is it part of the emotional dependence?  

Even in one-on-one conversations, when I bring up some of the more emotional or personal growth topics that interest me, my male friends don't usually engage much. They don't seem to have much to say, and/or change the topic quickly. Even the guy friends that do have a more personal growth bent to them seem to be more into the Joe Rogan-style of thinking, which I have a hard time relating too. 

So that's my question, fellas. Do you have emotionally rewarding relationships with other men in your life? If so, how do you do it?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qo46sn/a_question_for_the_men_do_you_find_friendships/

5,qo5chv,1636220719,Reconnecting after 2 decades,"Late teens, I met an intriguing fella through a friend. We had a date, but I didn't know if I felt a spark. He was a virgin and seemed especially virginal, somehow, which was something I didn't really know what to do with. But he seemed so special. I didn't keep in touch, but not did I forget him. The 2nd time we hung out, he said that I was someone that he could love. I think I wasn't ready for something so serious, at 18, 19 years old.

A few years later, I found myself in his city (1-2 hours from my own) and looked him up in the phone book (ha!). We had a perfect evening. He introduced me to some of his friends, we visited their art studio. We chatted it up all night at a diner. But I still felt unsure if he was someone to keep dating. I remember that the friend who introduced us asked me what I thought. I don't remember my answer, only her response: ""not enough has changed."" (To keep us dating, especially sort of long distance)

20 years later, I'm spending more time in his city. I googled his unusual name and quickly found his cell. He responded positively, though he was shocked. He said at first he thought it was some scam text. Completely unprepared for company, he still invited me over. 

Once there, he said he wanted to keep distance, what with covid. I brought dinner. We shared it outside by a fire, where we hung out. I glimpsed his bachelor pad. Messy, so I wondered if he was more self conscious about that, rather than truly concerned about covid. I don't know what to think. Clearly no kissing or hugging transpired. At this age, I have a hard time believing he isn't seeing someone, but we both perhaps bizarrely sidestepped all talk of romance. Neither of us even asked the other if we'd ever married. But I haven't and I suspect he hasn't. When I left, he offered a little ""don't be a stranger.""

I can't help but wonder if I should or shouldn't get my hopes up about him as a romantic possibility. He's unreligious, which is the only box he doesn't check, in my search for my person. I've been ready for something serious since my late 20s, 30s.

Dating casually to just “get out there” does not seem to help. It feels like cheating even though I know my ex is not invested and expects me to move on. 

Being emotionally unavailable is also not fair to the people trying to date me. 

Taking time off only works for so long and I don’t want to be alone indefinitely, especially since I am not getting any younger.

12,qod64t,1636245151,When do you start talking about the future?,"So I recently got out of a year and a half relationship. Yes, he was pretty mean at the end as I ended it and he didn’t want to… despite the fact that we clearly had different goals and some mutual dealbreakers.

Anyway. I’m trying to learn and improve.

One comment he made was that we had made plans for the future and not to do that with anyone in the future again because I misled him. He implied it was very immature to make those plans and then break up. I never misled him, just as things came out of the woodwork I changed my mind, which, as I understand it, is normal in dating.

I understand it was making future plans and not following through was hurtful, and that his comments came out of anger. At the same time I did feel lovebombed some times in the relationship.

But he also said that I was immature about dating in my 40s, basically. That it isn’t like dating in your teens (I don’t think it is). But also he knew I had limited experience (being married for 25 years) of modern dating. I’m trying to suss out if that is the case.

The issue for me was that I was all in early on… but then dealbreakers popped up. Initially I was thinking we could have a life together… those conversations didn’t seem out of place. 

When things about the relationship or the plans didn’t sit right with me, I did raise it.

Pretty much every man I have dated (a few during times we broke up) really pushed talking about the future and my willingness to cohabitate. Is that normal? I’m in an economically depressed area and I guess in theory a “high value” woman (hate that term).

I realize my boundaries have to be a lot higher about that and my preferences more plainly stated. 

I also think when I started dating, newly separated, I looked very malleable, temporary housing, easy going,  flexible job that could work around others schedules. A lot of that has changed, but also, before I date again, I already swore to buy a house so small that no one else can ever move in to it with me 🤣

Anyway… I didn’t mean to “futurecast,” I thought we were talking about a future together but then I learned things that showed me it couldn’t be a reality. Isn’t this a normal part of dating at any age?

- both of us were married before. 
- she recently got divorced after 3 years of separation. 
- I am not divorced yet. I have a child from the previous marriage and expect my divorce to take another year (or more) 
- we both were not divorced when we started dating. Both of us were looking for a companion emotional and physical support. 
- we have been dating for 2 years now. 
- we both live in a different country and have been meeting each other. We have spent close to 6 months together this year as we can work remotely.  

My GF wants me to get divorced asap and get married to her. She also is very clear she wants to have a child and recently got her eggs frozen. I am only ready to date and want to take some time to get divorced and settle my daughter with my ex-wife. Getting married is not a priority for me.  

But in the last two year I have found my gf to be an amazing partner. She makes me be a better person. She have helped me be more successful at work and helped me start a small business on the side. If there is ever an example of “behind every successful man there is a women” this is it.  

While she is amazing as my partner she is also extremely needy. She has a dependent personality and wants to be with me all the time. I fear it will be very difficult for her to share me with my ex-family. I want to be a very involved father. I want freedom to share my time, finances and other resources with my daughter, and worry my GF won’t let me once we get married.  

So what do I do? Should I go ahead and get married with this person who makes me better but cannot share me with anyone else. Or keep dating with these struggles for 1-2 years until my daughter is old enough and I have enough saved for her future. Or break up as I might not be ready, and I don’t want to waste her time.

The many posts I have read regarding this topic is testament to the fact that I am not alone in this and strangely other people’s posts somehow makes me feel better that I am not alone in this and how infuriating and tiring this is for all. 
I am 43f and have come to the conclusion that dating is just completely luck dependent there isn’t much you can do and this really isn’t even dependent on how you look, how old you are, what you make or do for work. 
So I dated older guys and younger guys both + and - 10 of my age, fit and good looking , ordinary looking and dad bods. Again this post is not intended to try and assume people are the same because they are not but simply highlighting my own experiences. It will be nice to hear if other women experienced the same. 
The older guys I dated between my age and 53 were generally more stable in their careers, emotionally possibly more mature but most ( again not over generalising and completely my own experience ) had difficulties performing sexually and this was a problem for me. I don’t want to go into details but generally it didn’t bode well for me feeling undesired and again I know people might downvote me for saying that I should be more understanding or that this is nothing to do with me and I know have been patient and given it time but at my age I also know what I want so there is really only so much time you’d keep going at compromising. So I thought by going younger I would have a better chance but when I went younger, I met guys who were very flighty and flaky. Love bombing intensely then unreliably ghosting or gaslighting for no reason at all. 3 younger guys I dated would either throw tantrums when a text is not responded swiftly or will start dramas without reason. 
This could be just me and my luck, I think positively that at least I get to enjoy the attention of men of a spectrum of ages but at the same time I feel like maybe this is really the end of it for me and I need to give up.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qokvgg/dating_fatigue_and_fail/

Which leads me to my question - when are we ready to date?  And if we need to work on ourselves (seriously, who doesn't), does that have to be mutually exclusive from dating?  Can it happen at the same time?

If I waited until everything was perfect, my date would be meeting me for the first time by paying respects at my funeral.  I understand not seeking out a relationship if you still have feelings for someone else, have just had a traumatic experience that requires intensive therapy, and other really serious situations... but don't we all have some kind of stuff going on?

Given this is a 40+ group, aging, sick or dying parents has got to be something that many of us are dealing with.  Divorces, kids becoming teenagers, losing jobs due to COVID, or losing loved ones to COVID  or any disease come to mind.

On the other had she was a fresh divorcee, was clear from the beginning that she “didn’t know what she wanted” and that we were not 100% compatible (she’s very impulsive, kind of a hippy, I’m not). 

Anyway, to the point of this post.

This is the 3rd post-divorce (3 years ago) relationship I’ve had. They’ve each been 1 to 3 months. In each case, the relationships ended quickly after a high point.

Relationship 1 – We’d been dating and having sex for months, but on one particular date it felt like things really came together. I literally said to myself “We’re not just dating, we’re a couple”. That night she got very upset over a text argument I had with my ex-wife, regarding our kids. Honestly, the girl I was dating was ridiculously uptight; It wasn’t much of an argument. Anyway, that was basically the end of the relationship. We had 2 or 3 awkward dates before ending it.

Relationship 2 – Only lasted a month, but this woman was the whole package: smart, beautiful, interesting. She seemed very into me. Too much too soon, actually. It didn’t make sense to me. I thought she had to be faking that much interest so quickly. We had sex for the first time and I literally thought “Wow, I was wrong. She’s not faking. She really is into me.” I hid my dating profiles the next day. The day after that she ended it via text.

Relationship 3 – This woman. Yes, she was clear she did not know what she wanted. And I had said I was OK with her going on occasional dates with other guys as long as she wasn’t having sex with them (because she is so fresh out of divorce) . She never mentioned any actual dates (not that I expected her to). But, we were seeing each other 3 times a week. Just this week: hung out Sunday (almost met my kids), date (and sex) Tuesday, date (and sex) Thursday where the conversation was more couple-like, with talking about some longer-term things, texted Friday and saw each other briefly Saturday night (after she came back from a day trip). I started feeling like we were turning a corner. Maybe this was going to be more solid. Sunday morning we met for breakfast. She ended things because she had started dating someone else.

**The summary**

I’ve had many first dates that were disappointing. I had a few that I was excited about, but the woman did not want a second date. And they wore down my will to date. But, these three failed relationships have crushed my soul (yes, an exaggeration) far more than all the crappy one and two date things.

The thought of going back onto the OLD sites is nauseating. What’s the point of all the shitty first dates? Just to get a little happiness, a little confidence and then have the rug pulled out from under you? That seems like torture.

They share custody of their 12 year old son. They also had a messy divorce; she cheated then he cheated. He told me they both were young and immature. But it’s been 10 years and they’ve moved on, supposedly, but they seem super close now. He recently wrote a recommendation letter for her to get a job and he vouched for her when her potential employer called him. Also, she one time forgot her lunch, so he took it upon himself to make a lunch and drive it to her job (30 minutes away). She communicates with him about her relationships as well. He recently told me her relationship is rocky. This made me feel a bit intimidated that they’re so close, so I asked him, “Do you think you’ll ever end up back together.” And his response, “Probably not, but I don’t like to say never because you don’t know what the future holds.” His response made me feel insecure.

31,qou8s6,1636308773,Need advice on how to get things moving — so basic it’s embarrassing,"I (47F) have been meeting up with a man (also 47) for coffee and exchanging texts. I am really enjoying the laid back slow burn as we warm up to each other. I think he is as well. We’re both so wary after looong marriages with the wrong person and the pace has worked for us up to this point. At the same time, I think that in order to progress and not get stale, we probably want to start chatting voice to voice beyond the quick calls (e.g. because one of us is running late or whatnot — always while “on the go”). Meeting for coffee for a couple of hours between other obligations doesn’t allow for those deeper conversations that emerge when unconstrained by time, distractions, etc. There seems to be a mutual understanding that disruption to our schedules and obligations require a deeper connection that I think we both want to explore, but we need to get to that next level of getting to know each other.

This is embarrassing but I genuinely don’t know how to encourage this. I’ve never initiated calling a guy but am willing to try, despite it being extremely uncomfortable for me to be the initiator. At the same time, I’m worried it’ll be awkward and ruin everything. He is a single parent of 2 girls (5th grade and 9th grade). Being a mom myself (but mine started college), I wouldn’t call during the evening/ after work knowing that’s pickup time then dinner then HW etc. etc. I remember as a working parent I rarely could settle back in my room before 9:30 /10 pm especially once kids enter high school. And he’s very involved in his role, which I respect. But I also feel that cold-calling someone at/ after 10 PM at this warm-up stage could be a little inappropriate. It’s quite likely he feels the same way about calling me late at night. He’s such a gentleman which is why I’m willing to get out of my comfort zone and create momentum, I just DON’T KNOW HOW and am completely frustrated with myself. I know this is embarrassingly basic stuff. I just don’t know how to date is all.

37,qp25f0,1636332444,I can’t believe I was dumped for this,"Need to vent

So I was dating this guy for a few weeks. We met online so I wasn’t expecting much to be honest.  But I was pleasantly surprised and we were having a great time together. We were divulging a lot. Seemed to have a lot in common. Got very personal. 

I should have known better than to believe everything he was saying at face value but I’m gullible I guess. I let his words make me think it was maybe going somewhere. 

Had me over for dinner last night. Made my favourite dessert. We were talking about how we’re both givers. I told him that I have never orgasmed from sex before and that every guy sees it as a challenge, which is really annoying. He assured me that he’s not that kind of guy. Fair enough. We had talked before about bedroom stuff so it wasn’t the first time I told him that. We eventually started making out. I told him I was on my period so I couldn’t sleep with him but there was plenty I could still do to him. He said he was fine with it regardless but I didn’t want my first time with someone to have any restrictions. Anyways, we go up to his bedroom and he’s rock hard. We fool around. Cuddle. Talk. Nothing really eventful. 

This morning I get a text saying he didn’t feel a spark last night. Really? He’s telling me he can’t wait to do all sorts of things to me. The parts are clearly working but no spark?? How does that work exactly? 

He said he’s really into giving someone orgasms thru intercourse and it’s specific but the truth. That’s what he gets aroused by. 

Fair enough. I love giving and receiving oral, I just don’t finish without some mechanical assistance lol. 

So I literally got dumped bc of my inability to orgasm thru sex?? How does someone not take that personally? 

I was gracious and thanked him for his honesty. But I’m pissed. Why not just tell me this before he took me to his bedroom? I can handle someone saying it’s just not working. It happens. 

Anyways, I don’t care about the guy, but I am feeling pretty shitty about myself right now.

We were there about 2 hours for appetizers and drinks , bonus she likes craft beer/IPA’s which is a big thing for me. 

We have agreed to meet again before we left and have confirmed this by text, I think next time is going to be a hike.

Stumbled upon Reddit very recently. Reading through comments, learning that dating online might not best suit my personality although not completely dismissing it until I know more . But so far swiping / not swiping /dismissing a human that might be interested in me, sounds against my core values. I cherish every single soul out there, and am all about humanity and personality. I can’t see myself dismissing  a person behind those words/ pictures in that way and don’t see myself respond to multiple ppl at the same time. Every human is unique, complex and takes a lot to get to know them. I have to be able to pay close attention to every single person in my life. But no way I’m judging anyone for going with apps . I understand ppl have to somehow meet and that’s sometimes the only/ quickest option in the fast paced world we live in. I get it. 

I am 52, 5’8” F, 120 lbs, physical therapist, love my job. Get good amount of attention from men/ patients. I’m always humbled and grateful for it but the clinician - patient relationship is dear to my heart and want to keep it sacred even after they are not my patient anymore. Was married for quite a few years but a tragedy happened and we drifted apart. No foul play, we are still very friendly and I will be there for him to the day I die. I love men, grew up w lot of boys and find men non dramatic, easy, straight to the point . But I also love my girl friends and have been very lucky w/ great quality ppl in my life. I don’t want to sound bragging about myself but I eat super healthy, take very good care of myself, have great social circle, financially stable/ completely independent, read, go the gym. I am active in the community, contribute to the humanitarian causes, homelessness issues , just so you know what can I person I am. I’m looking to get to know a man preferably in their 40s-50s , and my first and foremost criteria is a good human being everything b/c to me else is relative .

40,qpexbh,1636382151,Why does this (and other) reddit subs seem so biased against dating males and/or the male perspective?,"Firstly, I'm a 39 year old cis male, and I've been subbed to this and other dating subs for quite a long time. I know the ire that's coming my direction for even daring to post this, but I feel it's critical to those seeking authentic and non-biased advice that there's a definite pattern noticed not only by myself but also to many, including female, friends that I have shared this observation with.   


Generally speaking, the pattern usually goes something like this: Someone posts stating how men are doing ""x"" or behaving like ""y"" and the post is filled with supportive or complementary responses to op praising their strength and worth while unequivocally condemning the male. Oftentimes the most frequent advice to women actively dating is to consider breaking up with or just to downright dump men that exhibit character flaws or are in controversial situations. On the other hand, when a man posts something similar, I have witnessed many responses that there must be something with the OP, or that they need to be more tolerant of women that they are dating.   


I find this interesting, but also concerning and frustrating. It's important to identify the implicit bias here, because I feel like it's harming people's chances of finding the ones that may be the right match for them. People (men, women, and everyone in between) are often extremely flawed creatures, and at this age there is a distinct likelihood that we all live with some kind of baggage or damage that we must cope with. While it's important to never compromise your sanity or safety, a successful relationship requires some degree of compromise and even sacrifice if it's going to work. In fact relationships take work - actual effort on both sides to reach understandings, overcome conflicts, and accept the things we cannot change for the pursuit of a greater happiness.   


All I'm saying is don't be so quick to dismiss each and every single person in dating life simply because they don't fit Reddit's mold of the perfect match. Make that decision for yourself. Yes OLD sucks, and it sucks for both men and women for possibly different reasons. There is a vocal minority of creeps and losers that are out ruining it for the rest of us, and I do understand why many women want to feel guarded and safe in that environment. I'm not referring to those obvious situations.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qpexbh/why_does_this_and_other_reddit_subs_seem_so/

42,qpk1ly,1636396774,Dating app safety features?,"Hello all- I am looking for some feedback. Don’t worry I’m not part of ANY APP, I’m just trying to see if what I think is important to me would actually be important/wanted by others. MODS if this is against the rules, I’m sure you’ll automatically delete. 

I’m spamming a couple of dating subs/dating apps subs as I’m looking to see what you would look for in safety features of a dating app. I know right now there are a couple apps who are “verifying” their participants (which is verifying their Social Media account to cut back on catfishing?), and others who are trying to create a button you push when you’re in an emergency and they will send police to you. I know many of us take on our own safety measures- sharing location- keeping contact with others throughout your date, but I’m wondering if there is a prevention aspect that is missing. 

I just finished a user experience certification through Cornell and my app idea was creating a dating app where you ACTUALLY verified the user (vs. just verifying their social media?). What I mean is: the app would be able to verify a person’s actual name, age, if they are married currently, if they have children, if they have any prior convictions due to violence (domestic, sexual assault, etc. reported in ANY state). I am wondering because I’m an AVID Dateline/Investigation Discovery/True Crime follower and the rise (or maybe just more reported) cases of violence, catfishing, attacks, etc. to online daters seems to be astounding. I feel like if you could get a little more information about a person before going on a date, maybe you wouldn’t even start the date with someone? 

I realize there are privacy issues here, but honestly, you can google all this about someone- but it takes a lot of digging sometimes (and potentially costs money, and only possible if you have their REAL NAME), but I think just having that information, all in one place as a feature of an app could help to cut back on online dating horror or know ahead of time if they are married/have kids (often lied about topics….). And honestly some sites you make a username, and that person could be literally ANYONE. And how about more strict reporting guidelines? For instance, if something happens to you, and you don’t know that person’s real name, they delete the match, and all communication/information is deleted- how can you easily report them?

This is an issue for men and women- maybe in different ways- but everyone can be harmed out there, and I’m just wondering if getting a little more information up front- or having an app that’s exclusive to people who are wanting that sort of verification and help to report abuse, would that be something you would care about?

We dated for 6 months and moved in together when Covid went down. It was fast but we wanted to hang with each other when the world went nuts. We had a blast. He was loving, kind, and attentive for the most part. We had a blast and many adventures together. 

He definitely has some damage from a tumultuous divorce and a subsequent relationship that ended a few years before us. It was clear he was slow to open up and scared but his actions showed he was all in.

About 2 months ago I felt him pulling away and talked to him about it. He said he loved me but felt we’d lost our spark and he thought maybe we were meant to be friends. I was shocked and blindsided. We decided to limp along and try and maybe get in therapy but it’s taken awhile to gets appointment. And frankly he doesn’t really seem to be fighting for this. I feel like I’m dragging him along to try and solve this issue. 

Now things are awkward and my walls are going up and I’m watching my relationship slip away. I thought we were great together. I thought in midlife I’d found my guy. I thought the passion died a little but it was something we could fix. We crammed about 5 years worth of time in 2 years bc of all the time we spent due to Covid. 

But he’s been saying he feels meh about us and that he doesn’t light up when he sees me. Oof. He says he doesn’t know what to do himself or how he feels.

I don’t know if he’s avoidant, it’s low T, or he’s lost lost all feeling for me bc of some incompatibility he sees. Maybe it’s all of it! 

It’s so hard to find someone who feels like home, especially at our age. I just can’t believe he’s checking out and not really doing anything to bring the passion back.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, input, ideas, advice. I’m ready to go but I don’t want to. It’s my birthday today and I just feel so sad. I’ll pick up, I’ll move on, but man I don’t want to. Thank you!

48,qpqhbn,1636414940,Feeling confused,"A little bit of background info so sorry if this is long: I (F) have been dating my partner (M) for about 8 months. He has undiagnosed ADHD which makes communication challenging and this has triggered my anxious attachment. I have been trying to deal with this and be understanding but sometimes it really brings me down. We see each other 2-3 times per week at my house, mainly during the days when we both WFH. He has met my teenage kids and they get on well. When we are together he is loving, affectionate and really good with my kids.

The main issue I have is communication. I have explained to him that communication is important for me. I’d like us to have a phone call on the days we don’t meet and some chat check ins. If we don’t have this I feel distant as I have no idea what he does and I like to share my day with him. He has acknowledged he has an issue with communication and it has gotten somewhat better since the beginning and I know he is trying. His punctuality and time keeping have also improved which are ADHD relate and some other issues we were having, so it is obvious to me that he is making an effort. However sometimes his silence makes me uncomfortable. For example today he was at mine’s until early afternoon, had a long discussion about something very personal, sex, lunch together and then no contact. I texted something after he left, he responded “ok” and that was it. Am I correct to feel uncomfortable or am I too demanding. Is this amount of contact normal? I am not sure if he is going to text anything else tonight and I’d like a goodnight or something, just to show he is thinking of me. 

Another thing that makes me uncomfortable and of course I have not raised it is that he does not seem to make much effort to include me in his life. We spend our days at mine’s, he has met my kids, my best friend, even suggested meeting my mum when she visited but he hasn’t introduced me to his kids. I know he doesn’t have any very close friends so I wouldn’t expect to meet friends and his parents live abroad. His kids are much younger than mine and he has a complex and negative relationship with his ex. They are with him 100% currently but this might change.

 Again, am I correct to feel uneasy about it? It was my choice to introduce him to my kids but it was unpractical not to, as he is here often and I didn’t like keeping him secret from them. I have raised them alone for 10 years and he is the first man that I introduced them to. I am the first gf he has since breaking up with their mum 3 years ago, so obviously they haven’t met anyone else.

Often I thought and tried of ending it with him but obviously I love him and also I get confused about whether I am rushing things and I am being unreasonable or I feel like this justifiably.

But in my experiences,  I find men tend to be pissed off when asked for it and flat out refuse to do it. Their excuses is that it should built on trust and they don’t find the need to prove it to anyone. But a lot of these guys I only known for 6 weeks or less. That’s too little of a time for me to risk my health on the line.

In the early stage of dating, I’m usually very upfront about this because I’m highly allergic to latex &amp; non latex condom. I usually will address the std test again after dating for awhile where intimacy about to happen but I would always face with that same reaction from them. 

Is this normal for men to be offended about? Or am I approaching this subject incorrectly? Does asking to practice safe sex is frown upon?

61,qq4am3,1636466433,Identity crisis,"I’ve been a mother for twenty years now to my only daughter (who just happens to be fantastic and amazing btw!) and did the whole parenting thing by myself. Being by myself was my choice and I was always very happy, no regrets. So, for twenty years I knew who I was and I had a fulfilling purpose. During this time I was also a very useful daughter to my parents and a great sibling to my brother. I don’t mean to sound arrogant or toot my own horn too much but I held the family together through extremely difficult times when my father experienced various health conditions both physical and mental. I guess I was the mediator for many years. There’s so much I can do these days with the situation at hand so I’ve taken a step back from this too. 

My daughter has now moved out to Uni and perhaps this is a typical empty nest syndrome but somehow it feels different. I’m not grieving in the slightest. I’m glad she’s gone living her best life and carving her little way in life. Plus after the covid year which should’ve been a year travelling for her but wasn’t the uni thing couldn’t have come soon enough. She needed it. 

My career is non existent, as in it doesn’t fulfil me or inspire me. I worked from home anyway before Covid so I don’t think being alone is an issue. Although the work I do is an issue. It’s plain, it’s boring but it pays the bills. I don’t own a thing, literally not a sausage. I wonder if this could be part of the problem. Do we need to own things to feel accomplished? I don’t own a home or a car. These things have never bothered me in the past. If I sought to own something would that help me define who I am? Do I need to own in order to be defined a success? 

I’ve never been married so I can’t identify with being a wife or even being divorced. I’ve had one meaningful relationship but he died. We split up just before his diagnosis which he did tell me about but he chose not to tell me when he became really ill so I couldn’t be there to give support and love. I found out through a work colleague that he had died. One hot sunny day last summer my boss called me to say “I’m really sorry to give you the news, Harry has passed away”. What a cruel way to find out the love of your life has gone. I had an online best friend for a few years who was such a source of comfort to me, he was a best friend in every sense of the word, and I was his. He also died, which I still can’t quite get my head around but now I don’t have a best friend and I am not one. 

So now it seems I find myself asking these identity questions that I have no answer to and can’t help wonder if others feel similar? When significant others disappear what’s left of you? What defines you? 

By the way, if you’re wondering how this is relevant to dating I’ll give a very recent example. I have a friend that I met on a dating site who lives in New York. We’ve chatted on the phone and video for 20 months now and talk regularly about meeting. The possibility of meeting in March has come up. I always knew he was a success as he had sent me links to his business site that details his credentials. What I didn’t know really was how that looked in the real world in relation to my world. He told me something recently (well two things actually) that made me realise that this guy is never going to be interested in me romantically. He doesn’t know that I don’t own a home or a car and I suspect when he finds out things like this he will stop talking to me. He knows about my job and that I’m a student (woohoo I AM something!!) but I’m convinced the divide between us is too great and I should probably just tell him now. 

In contrast, I went on a date recently with a man whom I thought I’d probably have a similar problem with as he is also very successful career wise. As it happened he told me about his 800k debt issue which bizarrely really helped lower my anxiety about our financial differences. So far we are getting on great! 

Although those two examples are money specific my issue is more general. It’s that odd feeling when I wake up in the morning and momentarily I wonder who I am and what my purpose is. I can’t be alone in this?

65,qqeqsr,1636495969,"Men who want low commitment or “casual” relationships, why?","I know a too typical source of tension for dating these days is women looking for more commitment from men, while many men are looking for “hook ups” or less committed relationships such as FWB or “connection without ownership.”

I know it’s frustrating for women to sort through these guys, especially when the men are being dishonest or might not even know themselves enough to understand and be straightforward about their desires.

But I also see a lot of pathologizing of what’s going on for these men. I see some women posters in different subs call them “freaks,” “immature,” “afraid of commitment,” or “just out for sex.”

Obviously, I understand that this whole dynamic is incredibly frustrating and even dangerous for women, so some degree of venting and developing strategies to avoid these men if they want to is certainly in order. Some posters are much more gracious about where these men could be coming from than others. And it also needs to be acknowledged that a lot of these men are not coming from a healthy place at all and that’s a big part of the unsafe dynamic that it creates for women in the dating environment.

But I also know that there are men out there that are coming from a much more measured place and a sincere desire to not engage in high commitment relationships. They’ve considered it all carefully and have come to the conclusion that more relaxed relationship expectations are what they want, perhaps even better for them.

So I’d like to hear from these men on this post. Why do you seek out less committed relationships? Have you had bad experiences with more committed relationship situations? Or do you perhaps have “commitment issues” and are indeed “just out for sex”? Or do you just not want a relationship?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qqeqsr/men_who_want_low_commitment_or_casual/

80,qr04ht,1636567093,Thinking About Ending It,"I am thinking about ending my(F44) 7 month relationship with my boyfriend(M46). It is a mostly good relationship and I feel loved and I am definitely in love.

We have traveled together before and have plans and tickets/itineraries to do so again. At his suggestion we planned to return to his hometown for Thanksgiving. He then backed off that citing his sister not being ready to introduce his tween nephews to someone new. I didn’t love that and don’t think tweenage boys give a single care who their long distance uncle is boning but whatever. I don’t interfere with family decisions. He said we will do our holidays together and he will just make a quick solo trip home between you fulfill those obligations. And that was good enough for me.

Last night it came out the real reason is he hasn’t told his ex wife he is in a serious relationship and he’s not ready to. This is unacceptable to me. He was married when we started dating but she had moved thousands of miles away months before we met and in my conversations with him leading to us becoming a couple I believed him to be committed to divorcing and already having grieved the marriage. He was quick to finalize the divorce when I made it clear that was a condition of becoming serious. He is divorced. It’s not keeping me a secret from his wife but keeping me a secret from his ex wife.

I am seriously considering ending our relationship over this even though I love him and see real potential. I don’t want to go out of my way or his to hurt his ex but I believe any feelings she has about this that aren’t a mixture of grief for the marriage, sadness he loves someone else, happiness for him to move on, are not appropriate and healthy and are not mine or his to manage. And I feel that I deserve a place of high priority in his life, as he has in mine. I believe I deserve to be loved in such a way that my partner wants to take me home and doesn’t need to hide me from anyone.

85,qr97x1,1636593072,Old Soul (41M) seeking advice from like-minds.,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a youthful 41 at heart, but feel much older in soul, and therein lies my difficulty. By 40, I had lost both parents, and my wife of 11 years, to disease. The recovery has been slow, but recently I find myself thinking about possibly trying to date again. Through a lot of soul searching and reflection I find myself less attracted to women around my age, and more so to women in their 50's and 60's. 

So many around my age are either looking to start a family (some frantically so), or are recently divorced and are dealing with that trauma, kids, etc. Others I can't seem to relate to in terms of life priorities. I feel very disconnected from people around my age outside of casual social interaction. I should say that I don't have kids, nor desire to begin at this point.

So I'm drawn to those who are older than I, who may share similar experiences, similar loss, and the shift in perspective these things bring. Life experience, tenacity, survival, wisdom... Those are what draw me to a person.

I have a few very platonic female friends/acquaintances who are older than I, and the impression I'm given is that a woman in her 50's or 60's would never think a man in his early 40's would take interest.  So I'm seeking perspective from anyone who can offer. Are women of this age interested in dating a man in his 40's? Is age a thing at that point? Or is it simply about the ability to connect and relate? 

I don't know what I'm looking for long-term. These are just small steps. This is a very interesting situation I find myself at middle-age. Both confusing and fascinating.

We ended up at his place again and had sex. He then arranged a taxi (covered the cost both nights I visited him) and checked in with me. The next day I messaged him and we told each other we both had a lovely time. 

He didn’t message me for a day and then I asked how his day was and he told me his brother suddenly died from cancer earlier than expected and he is talking with his family. He will fly out to attend the funeral this Sunday and will be back on Thursday. 

I might be a fool but I feel that there is something amazing. Maybe it was just a fuck for him but maybe not. 

Given he is grieving I can’t really talk to him about us. Time is running out to get to know each other. He is not messaging much which is absolutely expected given this incredibly sad time. 

I asked if he might consider visiting my city and he said he always wanted to and one day he might. He wants to meet after he returns and before I go. 

I know it sounds crazy but I want him so. Given his circumstances (grown kids live in different country to him already and and his business doesn’t need him in Austria plus English is his mother tongue) he could even visit me or move there if he wanted. I have my own career, so no one has monetary interest here. 

In this situation I understand the lack of messages and obviously anyone would just sit and grieve. And not date and chat much. I very lightly hinted my feelings of wanting to get to know him better but I don’t want to disturb him. 

Due to my mother’s condition I might extend my stay but I can’t stay much longer as my kids need me. I can’t move back to Austria for the guy because my children are 13 and 15 (his are late 20s/30s). 

Am I right to think he likely will not even consider me even if he likes me? Is his response indicative of that? Or is it clouded by grief? He was close to his brother who was only 55.

It’s so hard because time is running out but in his case I would focus on my family not a woman I met 2x. 

I decided that maybe it’s best not to catch up before I leave because it would break my heart if he is not interested in exploring it further. In that case I won’t tell him if I’m extending my trip by a month or two. 

I know love finds a way, but it’s a tricky situation and I tend to think he is not interested in me. But hard to tell. He suggested a third date after sex. 

I’m not bothering him, I’m not messaging him just venting here. I do believe in love against all odds but it has to be mutual.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qrk6tf/found_love_on_another_continent/
92,qrm390,1636639689,Things I’ve Learned Post Divorce,"I started dating 2-months post signed decree. I learned a lot, but I think I have hurt people along the way. 

I heard a lot of “you shouldn’t date post divorce.” I got angry with this because I was over my ex.  Which was true, as the marriage failed years before and we lived in separate bedrooms. I also harbored no anger or resentment of the failed marriage. The big BUT is, I didn’t know how much trauma I had been through.  Almost a year later from signed decree, it took a lovely woman that I had been seeing to tell me that I was selfish and wasn’t compromising.  We are no longer together. I treasure her bravery in communicating with me. 

My trauma from my marriage was there haunting me all along and I had no clue. I gave and gave in my marriage without compromise from my ex. And when I came out of the marriage my safety response must have been that with anyone new I wouldn’t give anything of me away as subconsciously I didn’t want to go back to that role in my marriage - as I wanted my needs met and that was it. It was simple things, not really asking how the other person is doing, when they ask how you are. Or keeping them out of things because inside you had to do it on your own because your ex-wife was part of that thing in the past.  I didn’t know that I hurt the woman I was with by declining something that she wanted to support me in. I also was not giving her her needs. The damage was done. I met her too early in my journey, she was the only person I’ve met that truly was empathetic to my past working through a spouse’s mental health issues. 

I know I’m not ready for a LTR - even though I want one. I struggle with this because I also don’t want to hookup as I don’t feel comfortable. 

I need to create my own memories before I can start dating long term. I need to learn again to be willing to open up and show my care about others and compromise again. I’ve lost the most important part of me and it’s scary to wonder if I can learn to bring it back. Thank goodness I’m still seeing my counselor. 

I think we are all broken.  It’s just a matter of having the courage to pick up the broken pieces, embrace them, and work with them to build a better person.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qrm390/things_ive_learned_post_divorce/

95,qroybi,1636648052,Honest opinion from men for a female friend in her 40s.,"This is not meant to be a post that is about peoples bodies and what is good or bad because I truly believe that every man and woman has power to be beautiful or not inside and out and often the inner energy often reflects in their outer beauty. With that said I have an honest question to ask the men here. Also anyone that is attracted to women regardless of your gender. This question is from a college friend of mine I’ve known forever who is a single woman and is about to start dating. She was married for 12 years and her ex-husband left her suddenly saying their entire relationship was a sham and that he didn’t ever love her. He had started a relationship with another woman at this point although he never confessed to it. They got very serious publicly right after the divorce papers were signed.

Her message for me to post is below.

“There are a variety of people and shapes and sizes no matter what the age. I went through different stages during our relationship. I was fairly slim and a little soft when we first met. May be in the 130 to 140 range being 5 foot five. After I had our child in my late 30s the changes with my body even as I  exercised were really a struggle. I was never able to get rid of the little pouch/pooch/shelf? That was my stretched skin and the muscles underneath even when i had exercised them left a pouch over my pubic area. My weight varied around 150 to 160 after having the kid over the last eight years. I lost a little weight when I really got into yoga and running. Obviously in my 40s my body continues to change and as i have gotten into the menopause area my metabolism has slowed down. With coronavirus and work being very demanding as a respiratory therapist i was not able to exercise as much and the muscle tone i had and the weight i lost went away and I’m pretty much back to how I looked after i had the baby and am around 160 pounds. I have become very self-conscious about it. Generally speaking when you meet a woman in her 40s and her body has changed because of pregnancy and in during menopause, especially those whose breast have sagged and stomachs will never be flat unless they have surgery no matter how much they exercise. do you guys think this is disgusting? I feel so gross. When I am intimate that pouch flaps up and down and looks like an ocean wave. My face is sagging now because of the old pregnancy weight and I just feel like A big saggy blob even though I only weigh 160 pounds… A tight size 10…. Probably should be at 12 but I just can’t except that I went from a size 6 to a size 12 in two years. I honestly want to know what a bunch of guys think. I can always work out more and always eat better but I do it while, pretty damn good job. With guys in their 40s Has it become more acceptable and expected for our bodies to be in this shape? It just doesn’t feel right to me. Also this is probably some confidence due to my ex-husband and his history of dating stick figures before and after our marriage. Thank you for your honest feedback. And if there are any other ladies that feel the same way could you please share so I don’t feel so alone? Thank you”

she does not do Reddit or social media so I will just be sharing your answers with her when we hang out. She is asking with the very best intention so please no shaming or meanness. She is not shallow. She is just very self-conscious and is looking for the truth. Thank you.

96,qroymu,1636648075,Should I advance or not?,"Met a very attractive guy last night at my Jeep club meeting. He came to me, spoke first and stayed by my side for the rest of the evening. There were a lot of people there, he was new to the group, and we talked more to people talking to us than to each other. ( I hope I worded that so it makes sense).

I asked him if he wanted to go somewhere else, just him and I, so we could talk more. He declined. He asked twice for me to take his number and call him if I felt like doing something some other night. He walked me to my Jeep and asked ""can I at least get a hug?"" I hugged him and did get his number. This morning I sent him a ""good morning, it was great meeting you last night"" text. He replied ""great meeting you also""

I know it's super early from meeting him, but I've never had a guy turn me down for a drink or more 1 on 1 time  - especially when I offer to pay. 

I feel like I made it clear that I'm interested in getting to know him more.  I am wanting to offer taking him to a restaurant/bar that also offers ax throwing tonight. Is it too quick? Should I wait a few days? I'm hesitant since he declined my offer of food and drinks last night.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qroymu/should_i_advance_or_not/

What do I do in this situation? I'm really worried if I cancel today, I am going to have to wait another week to see her and her interest already seems iffy right now.

Ok troops!...some of this you may already have learned, but still fun to talk about.
1. If they are not showing their teeth in any of the photos, most likely they possess none, black and brown colored burglary tools, or look as thief they have sponge toffee stuck on every other one.
2. If they only have photos from the neck up, they are indeed a few pounds overweight...like 100+lbs each leg. This includes at least 50% of the people who claim they are ""average build"" average is now 3XL for dudes, and size 18+ for women. 
3. If dudes are wearing hats in every picture like Mike  Love from the Beach Boys after 1966...they are bald or balding and are very insecure about it. See...George Costanza.
4. If they use face filters and put deer eyes, rabbit muzzles, or puppy ears on, they must likely look like a boiled boot. Next..
5. If women put down they love to travel and dine out and every pic is of them in a sparkly gown in an exotic place...High maintenance and you want afford them.
6. If dudes are standing beside their jacked truck, powerboat, pool, Harley, etc....they belong to the look at me!...size doesn't matter club.
7. If a woman is showing her ample cleavage or a dude is flexing his arms and abs shirtless...they will indeed hit on all of your friends because they are attention seeking sexbots.
