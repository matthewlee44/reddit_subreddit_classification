1,rqxvko,1640748310,Should We Call It After 11 Years of Complications?,"My friend and I have feelings for each other and are deciding if we should move forward with dating.

Background below, but also summarized at the end as I know it's lengthy. 

**Background:** We've known each other for 11 years and early on in our friendship, he caught feelings for me. I did not return them, but I liked the attention and company so regrettably took advantage of the situation to feel less lonely. We never hooked up back then. However, I wasn't careful with his feelings and actively sought out his friendship and company. Separately, I also briefly dated his best friend which hurt him a lot. 

We drifted a part for a couple years due to life, location, etc. in addition to him purposely distancing himself from me. However, in the past 3-4 years we've reconciled as friends, I apologized for being a shitty person back then, and we became close again. 

Maybe 2 years back, we tried to date but it was short-lived. It felt unnatural at that time, I was wrapped up in city dating life (being very upfront about it with him) and not ready to commit, and being long-distance got in the way of seeing us as a serious potential and I ended things. He was disappointed, but he understood I wasn't on the same page as him. 

Fast-forward to the pandemic and we started talking every day. When I told him I was interested in trying again, he did not want to open that door back up and said he didn't have feelings for me anymore. Also, skeptical that my feelings were genuine and not due to quarantine/isolation.

We still continued to keep in touch and talk afterwards. For me, the feelings were hard to get rid of, but I started to work on myself by going to therapy. From there, we've seen each other a few times and have hooked up, which left me hurt as I knew where his heart stood. After the last time, I told him I needed some space to process out my feelings, hard to do as we run in the same circles. Half way through this year, we went to the same cabin trip and had kissed the first night. For the rest of the summer, we didn't speak and I made a lot of progress getting over him. 

Last week, I had caught up with another one of our mutual girl friends and she revealed to me that she had hooked up with my friend during the same cabin trip back in May. I was livid. I felt so dirty and upset that he had treated me like a fling with a stranger so I called him after and let it all out. After I said that it probably wasn't a good idea to be in each other's lives, he  told me that he still had feelings for me. 

This week, we had a long conversation about where we stood and what we were looking for. The feelings are there on both sides, but for him he isn't sure if they are enough for the risk and sacrifice due to our history, still not being in the same location, and him going into a busy period of his PhD where he won't have a ton of time or money to spend on the relationship.

For me, I'm still all in despite this. However, I struggle with going into this without hearing his plan. Since he's been hot and cold with me all year, I don't know if his feelings are genuine and if he'll want to put in the work. I told him I needed consistency and for him to show me I'd be a priority in his life, but I don't know how he would do that if he will have limited time or means to do so. 

**TLDR**; My friend and I are finally close to being on the same page romantically after 11 years, but after so much time being hot/cold from both sides we have a lot of mistrust and would have an unideal start to our relationship, being long-distance and during the most stressful/busiest time of his PhD.  

**So my questions to the community are:** 

\-  Are feelings enough or is this even worth pursuing if there has been a lot of hurt on both sides and external factors that are not setting this up to be the ideal beginnings of a relationship? 

\- Should I be taking his hesitation as a red flag for how he will potentially act in a relationship with me? 

\- Should we just call it and not move forward?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqxvko/should_we_call_it_after_11_years_of_complications/

4,rqxz2e,1640748604,He snapchatted me almost every minute/hour of every day for over a week and then one day starts to ignore me… why?,"Has this happened to anyone else?

Background: I met him at a party. We have mutual friends and really hit it off. He even walked me home. We snapchatted almost every minute/hour of every day for a week (from 8am-4am sometimes). It was never anything sexual… or even flirty. The most flirting he ever did with me was call me “nerd” and I loved it aha. 

He did ask me out to a bar twice (while drunk). Once it was at 2am and the second time was Christmas night. He even said that he was gonna come to get me so I could go, but it was 2am. And then on the night that he asked me to go at 2am, from 3-4am he asked me to go over his house to “sleep and watch our fav show”. He was literally begging. I didnt go any of where he invited me because I feel like he wants something different than me. I’m interested in a relationship whereas I am assuming that he is not? 

But even after “rejecting him”, we still talked daily and A LOT. But then one night his friend (we’ll call him Jay) snapchatted me and told me that he (Jay) “thinks he’s in love with me”—even though I’ve only hung out with Jay once along with other people; basically, I barely know Jay and never even flirted with him. And Jay also said “I might have to unadd you but it’s not your fault”… minutes later, the guy I have been talking to (let’s call him Matt), sends me a picture of him over his friend Jay’s house… I can’t help but think that Matt was telling Jay and his other friends that we are “talking”?

Even during that night, Matt and I were still talking back-and-forth for hours but then the next day, he started ignoring me and leaving me on delivered for long periods of time all while his snap score is going up. The same thing is still happening. And last night I asked him if he wanted to hang out before he leaves (he’s in the military) and he just sent his face and took hours to respond to me again… I was so hurt because I really really like him and wanted to hang out. I know I turned him down three other times, but I was nervous and the times he invited me out were just not good times for me personally. So I am wondering if he was just using me? Or maybe his friend/s have something to do with this? I’m really hurt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqxz2e/he_snapchatted_me_almost_every_minutehour_of/

We’ve hooked up a few times in the past and it was really fantastic, easily one of my best. So, you could imagine how excited I was to hear him say how he felt. It was like I was finally seen by him, for real this time. 

We met up a week after he said that, went out to see a movie, and after it was over we had car sex. Time goes by and he’s not responding to my texts but is suuupppeeerrr active on Twitter saying things like “I just want someone to make-out with” and my personal favorite “wish I had a gf for Christmas”

16,rqz2hy,1640751936,Am I overanalyzing it?,"I think I have a tendency to overanalyze things. I’m also sensitive 

Some background, I’m 17, he’s 17. We’ve known each other since elementary school and have been good friends. He took an interest to me in middle school and now I am interested in him as well since we began talking more and becoming closer. He wants to go on a date with me someday but I’m not ready yet since I feel too young and dumb and I want to work on myself before getting into any kind of commitment. 

He’s quite nice to me and I enjoy his company. He went to a different school starting freshman year, so there’s no way to talk in person besides over text which we’ve been doing for the past 3 or so years (only recently getting SUPER close in 2020 just before quarantine.)

Today something really bothered me. He’s out with his friends, I can respect that. I am okay with him being away from his phone and all that. One text I sent him while he was with his buddies was just something about me doing blablabla. He then texts back an hour later telling me “THE TV IS BROKEN // FUCK”

This just peeved me a bit. Not only does he take forever to respond but he completely ignores the thing I said to tell me something useless. I can’t do anything about his TV, so why bring it up and ignore what I say? I send a dry text and he then sends me a funny video of himself. I just think he’s very oblivious or something. But I hate it. It makes me feel like he doesn’t listen to what I have to say or takes no interest in it. And I completely understand that he’s with his friends, but it still bothered me.  feel selfish because we aren’t even dating but since he’s been waiting on me so long it only feels like we are pretty much “together”. I think my feelings are valid, I just care about him and want the best for him. it just hurt my feelings that he ignored me. It concerns me because if I’m going to waste my time or potentially be with this person, if he’s gonna be indifferent I want nothing to do with it. But it hurts me because I really like and care about him. I want to get to know him even more. Please let me know if I’m being dramatic or if anyone who is currently coupled has an experience with an indifferent partner. It just really isn’t reassuring when he can act like that towards me. I did tell him that he very slightly upset me but I’ll get over it because I saw something funny and I wanted to send it to him, but not exactly let him off. I wanted to leave it up to him if he was curious as to what he did. All he said was “I am sorry” Again he’s with his friends so i don’t know how hard it is to text. But when he’s like that it just makes me view him differently …. Im just waiting for his next text back eighth now. But i wish he was even curious to know or talk about what he did that upset me. Why doesn’t he want to know?

28,rqztbr,1640754284,Incompatibility? Differing values? How do you know?,"TL;DR is basically as the title says -- how do you know when you are too incompatible with someone to be in a happy relationship? How willing are you to ask for what you need or for change, and how much do you think you should expect?

This is mostly hypothetical, but I do have a reason for asking. As some background, my (22F) parents' relationship with each other naturally shaped my perception of relationships, which was rather unfortunate because theirs is not particularly good. They have very different desires, and although one will yield to the other, they very rarely if ever do so happily and without anger or snide and rude remarks. My mother would often come to me after an argument and say things like ""make sure you're with someone who you're evenly matched with, unlike your father and I."" Because of this, I know I'm coming at it with a lot of preconceived notions and fears about falling into an unhappy marriage.

The reason I ask this is because my boyfriend and I get along incredibly well in a general sense, but we do differ in some of our desires (both small and not). As a result, I fear these differences will eventually come to a head at some point and cause issues. For what it's worth, if he is doing something I don't want him to, he will stop if I am blunt enough, but I guess I have this perception that if things were truly \~meant to be\~ we would get along easily or want to do things similarly and I wouldn't have to ask him to go against his wishes.

I’m wondering how many people are actually like me here on reddit?  Could it do with the fact that I do *not* date “with intention,” I’m that I have a “if it happens cool” mentality to relationships? 

Now I *objectively* may notice criteria that makes me decide if someone is worth meeting up with (ie baseline bar for aesthetic attraction, mutually asking and answering questions, capable of intelligent convo, similar sense of humor, effort in profile, etc.) but won’t feel sexual/romantic chemistry or attraction (the “spark”) until we meet up for anywhere between 1-3 dates (after which I’ll turn down if I don’t feel at all).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqzx4v/how_seriously_do_people_takeinvest_in_matches/

33,rqzzky,1640754843,In love with my best friends sister?,"Ok ill try to keep this short but heres the story: Basically me and my best friend/roommate threw a party for which he invited his sister, who I hardly knew at the time, and a couple of her friends. After said party I hear that his sister had a little crush on me for the party, which at the time I thought nothing of. I learn of this after the party from my roommate, who tells me it would be weird if we dated or anything like that. Since I am close really close with his family and interact with them frequently, if anything bad were to happen there is large potential for awkwardness. However as time passed and I got to know her better, I began to realize I have feelings for her.

Over the past year and a halfish, I begin to realize I have feelings for her. We have a snapchat streak and since I am close with my best friend’s family, I interact with her on a somewhat regular basis. However, I am hesitant to ask her out or anything still remembering what he told me after the party.

For even more context, about a year after said party of incidence, our other roommate asked said sister out on a date (with hesitant permission from my best friend) and was rejected, however I feel like I would have a better shot. We interact frequently and at least I feel like we connect in many different ways.

I am scared to talk to my best friend about this since losing our friendship would be devastating to me, however my feelings for this girl are somewhat strong, as currently and for the past few days I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her. Advice would really be appreciated, since I want to talk to my best friend about the issue but do not really know what to do. As I said, losing out friendship would devastate me, and we still have another 6 months on our lease and I am very close with his family.

42,rr0jep,1640756597,Would love some advice on a crush I have,"I'm currently a very sad (mid-twenties) boi in his feelings and would love some advice - 

So there's this insanely cute girl I've been super into for the past half-a-year. She lives in my apartment building and we met due to the fact we both have puppies and got them around the same time.

I've been trying to work up the courage to be more confident around her. I'm not the most outgoing person, and I take a while to open up to people. I've had ample opportunity over these past several months to get her contact info and set up a doggy play date or something, but I kept freezing up whenever I'd run into her because I was nervous and frankly intimidated by how gorgeous and cool she was. She seemed very friendly with me from the get go, but I kept telling myself ""She's just being friendly. She's not flirting with you. She's made friends with every other dog owner in the building, I'm no different. You don't know if she's single. She's out of your league"".

Not only did my own self-esteem issues prevent me from doing anything, but the last thing I wanted was to make her feel awkward by asking her out in the case she's not interested given we see each other fairly regularly.

As of late, I've finally felt like I was ready to just go for it and either ask her out, or at the very least get her number. I've noticed a trend the past handful of times I've taken my dog out that when I walk past her first floor apartment unit, she happens to come outside with her dog the moment I walk by and am headed back inside, almost as if she saw me through her window and intentionally came out. I could totally be off and completely overthinking this, but this has now happened a multiple times to the point where it doesn't seem possible to be a coincidence. This made me feel really good, like holy shit, she might actually be into me! Every time I run into her she's very chatty with me and plays with my pupper. 

This evening I was chatting with her for about 5 minutes or so after she came out with her dog when I was heading back inside. After talking about the dogs for a minute, she tosses out the fact that she's moving to another state in a few months. I feel absolutely devastated. I know I shouldn't be considering I really don't know her that well at all, nor am I actually confident she's into me, but I've been beating myself up for months for not going after her. Then I finally work up the courage to take action and go after what I want, and I get hit by this massive blow. I told myself earlier today before I ran into her that the next time I saw her, I was just gonna go for it once and for all. Then I get hit with the fact she's moving, and I just couldn't do it. 

So what should I do now? Should I just distance myself? Move on? Forget the idea of her? Or would it still be worth trying to get to know her? I know this sounds silly because I barely even know her. It's just that I haven't been this attracted to a woman in so long. She just seems so perfect to me, but I know my judgment is a clouded.

Even though he really, really likes hanging out with me, he has a lot of fun with me, our conversations are really in-depth and fun. Oh, and I’m super attractive. 

We hooked up two years ago as a one night stand — I was cool with it, so was he. We went out own ways, I met someone. I broke up with that person, this guy noticed and came back around, but we didn’t hang out for about a year later due to the pandemic, but talked fairly consistently.

I agreed to hang back in January, but kept our visit light, we talked all night and had a great time, made out a bit, but no hookup and I sent him home. Timing was weird for us this entire year, but he kept in contact, trying to get together again this entire year. I finally caved and felt ready to actually date again, prior to our dates I made it clear I was looking for something more serious and no hookups. He agreed. 

We went on a date earlier this month, hooked up, had another a week and a half later, then a few days later, I get that message. In our last text exchange, he swore the sex didn’t change anything and make him think less of me when I called him out about feeling a little used. He said that wasn’t the case and it wasn’t about sex.

What gives?

Some possibly important details: I’m friends with his sister (I was in her wedding a few years back) and he recently came out as pansexual earlier this year. I believe I was one of the first few people he told, I was and am cool with it, but perhaps he’s still figuring out who he wants. What he wants in a partner. Who knows. 

I replied to his rejection, we talked it out, we haven’t talked since. But, I’m baffled because I felt like he was trying pretty hard and liked me a lot leading up to our dates. Perhaps he built me up so much in his head, I was a disappointment? But, why tell me how great of a time you have with me and how attractive I am, etc. it seemed like an odd rejection. Maybe he felt guilty?I’d have just said, I felt no spark rather than telling me how great I am.

54,rr1jm5,1640759977,"I need serious ""girl talk"" help choosing between 2 men","I met 2 men through my local city subreddit just the past day, immediately after breaking up with my ex. He honestly broke my heart so badly, I was so lonely in the relationship, that I have no choice but to move on that quickly, even though I know that's not healthy. It's like I don't want to, but I have to, to be able to move on with my life.

Now I know if I have to ask reddit for dating advice it's usually a bad idea, but please bear with me. (Also note that I am quarantining covid so meeting with these men isn't a possibility rn to gauge in person)

Guy #1: initially commented seeking out movie buddies in my city that he recently moved to, I reached out to him asking if he's still looking for that and we exchanged numbers. He seems nice enough but sort of like he's trying to come off as a nice guy pretending he's someone he's not. The reason why I say this is because he commented one or two sexual comments/posts, also involving using drugs, that he deleted once I messaged him. Nothing too bad, just a bit...casual and out there for me. I'm not one for casual sex or (party) drug use at all, but it seems he's pursued it before. However, he also seems relatively stable from his post history and from our text exchange. Especially compared to my mess of an ex, who's emotional instability and insecurity ruined our relationship and my life. 

Guy #2: I do not know much about him, we have not yet exchanged numbers but chatted in comments agreeing to meet up for coffee once we are both done quarantining. Seems nice and stable from his comment history, no sexual stuff which is nice to me since I'm more conservative about that sort of thing. However, he lives in a part of town that's becoming notorious for crime and I fully admit that I am paranoid/wary of going there, so it makes me wonder about the logistics of that in future moving forward.

So, what do you all good people of reddit think? I know this is probably a bad idea, but I also don't do/like dating apps since I don't like putting my photo online. I know some men personally that are friends that I could date irl, but I'm too close to them so wouldn't want to break their heart. So these are 2 possible dating choices I have available to me now.

We went on a weekend trip together in November thinking it wasn’t going to be more than small talk and good sex, but the trip ended up being beyond what we imagined - our connection in every single aspect felt natural and very powerful. We have been in consistent contact since, with our feelings growing more and more everyday. I tried to cut it off in fear of getting hurt since he has a job lined up back in the US and I would ideally like to stay in the UK, but what we have is too special and unique, and we both agreed it’s worth the risk of getting hurt. 

Despite taking ownership of a possible, painful heartbreak from now - does *anyone* here have a similar story that ended up working out? I’m just looking for some encouragement or advise - I don’t want to bother my friends too much about this, especially since none of them have been in this position before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rr1n1d/anyone_have_happyendings_with_relationships_that/
56,rr1oke,1640760470,So are dating apps really worth the time? I just signed up for Bumble and it seems like it has a lot of mixed reviews.,"Okay I just signed up for Bumble and I posted 2 questions on r/AskReddit about dating apps, 1 about just dating apps in general and another for Bumble specifically and it really does seem like a lot of guys had the worst experience.
Here are my posts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rqn3uf/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_dating_apps_and/

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rquaac/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_bumble_dating/

So after hearing what all of these guys said, should I really try out Bumble or not?
Based on some other things that I have heard, it seems like Bumble and dating apps/sites in general are very luck based.
If you put a lot of lazy work into your bio and pics, you will have way less chances, but if you are good looking in your pics and have an interesting bio then you will get more chances.
But here’s the thing though, something that I’ve definitely heard a lot is that a lot of girls simply go on dating apps just to get a guy's attention, and I may be able to sense those girls just by looking at their lazy profile.
So I think what I’ll probably do is create a very entertaining and interesting profile.
And then X all of the girls with a lazy profile.
And then check mark the girls who actually put in the same amount of work as I did into their profile who also share the same interests as I do.
BOOM INFINITE IQ😈.
The reason why a lot of these guys probably don’t have the best luck is because they probably just don’t understand how algorithms work and they check mark all of the lazy princesses who put zero effort into their bio, take hot pictures of themselves(well, using Instagram filters probably), and then just post those pics.
Also something else too is that all of the lazy attention princesses have probably taken over most dating apps and bots have probably done the same too and so I feel like there may not really be alot of REAL girls on there actually looking for a relationship, and so that’s probably something that I should think about more.
But yeah what do you guys say, SHOULD I TAKE THE CHALLENGE???😈.
Heck, I honestly see this as a possible very entertaining online dating game instead of just apps and websites and I would honestly record myself doing this stuff on my computer and then post it on my YouTube gaming channel and title it “Bumble Dating App Matching Speedrun Part 1” lol🤣😂🤣😂.
But anyway back to the question though, and I’m going to ask it like a normal person this time haha.
But yeah should I take what I call, well, the online dating algorithm breaking challenge?

57,rr1sfb,1640760842,Am I wrong for being sad that my boyfriend doesn't post news about our future baby?,"Hi Ive been in a relationship for 2 years with my boyfriend. We've wanted to settle pretty quickly since we were both looking for something serious and that could lead us to have futur together. In July 2021 we found out I was pregnant. We were shocked since we both thought we couldn't have children and we had some accident in the past but were lucky to not get pregnant. 

Ever since we started dating he wasn't posting me very much. I didn't care before but now that I'm pregnant it has bothered me. Some of his family members didn't know we were we expecting a baby. It was a shock to them since he never mentioned it to anyone.

I feel like I shouldn't be mad cause of this but at the same I feel like he's embarssed. He avoids coming to the appointments with me and I mostly go alone.

The obvious alternative would be public places such as bars/pubs, but it's quite clear when you go out that women are there to hang out and have a pleasant evening with their friends, not to look for hookups/partners, and so approaching them in these situations would be completely inappropriate.

Meanwhile, the majority of my friends of a similar age have been in serious relationships for many years, and/or are having kids (not that the latter of those two things is of any interest to me).

I have Asperger’s and most autistic people I’ve met are a total train wreck to interact with and I don’t think I’m different, whenever I try to put myself out there I come off as a total try hard and it’s just embarrassing.

I also look really ugly and I think my physical features are indicative of a developmental disability, I have a giant forehead (no hairstyle looks good on me) and my jaw is sunken in so I have a bunch of loose skin under my chin and no jawline. Unless I grow a full beard I basically look like someone with special needs.

I have no idea what “my type” is, what kind of woman would be interested in me, how I’d meet them, or if I’d even have a chance with someone I’d like. I see no reason a woman would want me unless something’s really wrong with them and nobody wants them either.

67,rr2gf3,1640763300,Am I being unreasonable or is this relationship doomed?,"I've (27f) been going out with someone (29m) for about half a year now and at this point I just don't know if there's any point in keeping this relationship up.  

He checked all of my boxes when we first started going out, really polite, kind and intelligent.  We have a few common interests and it was easy to have a conversation together.  It's been a couple months though and I feel like the more I get to know him, the more doomed I think this relationship is and the less I like him.  

We talked about what we'd like in the future and I told him light heartedly, a house where I can raise chickens, have a bee hive, garden and just chill with my dog would be nice.  He shot it down pretty fast and said that's not what he'd like.  This entire time I've known him, he's been talking about how he wants to switch jobs and find a new apartment.  It's been five months and he's now saying he'd rather stay at his current job for a few more years and he's not sure when he's going to move to a new place.  Ok, people are allowed to change their minds, but I honestly get really irritated when he mentions how he plans to move every time we meet up but never does anything.  To compound it, he's been at his current place for years and has no furniture, his excuse being that he's planning to move soon.  For christmas, I tried to be considerate and get him things based on his likes and hobbies.  He got me a box of chocolates after I spent the week prior baking a requested recipe upon his request, not taking any of it back with me and telling him it was because I didn't like super sweet things...   

I feel like all the things I'm having issues with are so petty and unreasonable and can be excused.  I'm also sure I have just as many traits that are annoying too and he's being too polite to mention it. But I feel like I can't say anything about it, because the response seems mean and uncaring e.g. I don't want to hear about your apartment hunting because it's been months and you haven't made any decision yet or I don't appreciate you shooting down my ideas even if you think that's what you'd like.

70,rr2pgl,1640764254,21F with no dating experience??,"So I grew up with sisters, no male friends, and obviously no boyfriends so I’m pretty much naturally bad talking to a guy. It’s gotten better since starting college but I still can’t mentally handle talking to a guy. It might be my severe anxiety and self-esteem issues.

I have a date in a few days (my 2nd date ever lmfao 😭) and I’m going crazy in my room. I’ve been friends with the guy on social media for over a year now, but we didn’t start having consistent conversation up until a few days ago. He seems nice, a bit of a party boy. We’ve mostly been asking each other basic questions about majors, pets, etc. He hasn’t asked any creepy questions asking for pics or suggesting hooking up (ex: wanna come over?) so that’s a relief. 

But the thing is I don’t know if I don’t find him attractive at all. I wouldn’t say he’s ugly (he lifts weights so he’s fit) but he’s not really my usual type. So should I even be going on this date, with the intention of possibly starting a relationship, if I don’t feel any attraction to him? Or am I judging too soon? Did I say yes because I just liked the fact that someone found me attractive enough to ask out? Or did I say yes because I like him? I have no idea.

I’m also very sensitive when it comes to physical intimacy, mostly because of my past trauma of sexual assault. Last time I went on a date to the movies with a guy, he kept trying to hold my hand the entire time and I was having a silent breakdown. What if that happens again? I’m also not really comfortable with PDA for the same reason, so I have no idea what I should do if he tries to hold my hand, etc without upsetting him.

I have been single for 18 years, I haven't even touched a member of the opposite sex in a non platonic way in all of that time. And even when I was seeing someone it ended because I was incapable of initiating any sort of intimate activity/behaviour, verbal or physical. I was too nervous then and it is so much worse now, now I just feel overwhelming terror.

My biggest issue is that I just have no idea what to say to people that I haven't already previously spoken to. Even then it can take me months of being around someone to be comfortable enough to engage them in conversation. On top of this I have really poor social and communication skills in general. 

I really just don't understand how to approach people and what to say or do in that situation.

 I think meeting someone in person(in a bar for example) is beyond me so I have been trying dating apps. I get plenty of matches but I am basically encountering the same issue, I just have no idea what to say. I have no idea what to say in an opening message and  no idea what to say in any further messages. I have tried but I either just get one word responses and no reply at all.

Do I just say hi and ask someone out?

Do I spam people with questions about themselves?

Other than saying hi and asking people how they are I really don't know what to say.

Apologies for the nonsense wall of text it probably doesn't flow very well but I'm sure you'll get the gist. 

Advice welcome. A script I could learn and copy off would be even more welcome.

86,rr4cuu,1640770745,Girl stopped talking to me after holding my hand 💀 what did I do wrong?,"Girl stopped talking to me awhile after we met despite making moves on me. What did I do wrong?

This is the first time anything like this has happened to me :,) not trying to sound conceited, but up until this one girl, I’ve always been the one who’s less interested and even then, I’ve never distanced myself away from someone after a date. I still love to keep some of my dates as friends as long as they’re willing to be platonic so I really struggle to wrap my head around what went wrong this time as nothing like this has ever happened to me. 

I (21F) met this girl (23F) on Instagram in my city and our conversations were great. She and I were keeping the conversation alive, it flowed, we joked a lot, flirted quite a bit and she, just as much me, was interested in sustaining the conversation. 

After a couple of days of talking with pretty fast replies, on my birthday, my plans with my family had to be postponed. She found out when she was with her friends and all of them were insistent we spend my birthday together. I didn’t want to bother and it made me nervous meeting 5 new people at one go so I told her I’d meet her after if she was still down. I celebrated with my friends for hours and she was still very keen in me coming over at midnight to hang with her and her one other friend even though I kept telling her it’s ok if it’s late and she wants to rest instead. 

We talked a lot that night and eventually her friend left and we were in bed together, just chatting. I didn’t want to pull any moves too soon but she kept touching my hand and even held my hand multiple times which was rly nice. 

Then fast forward, it’s been a week since, and the conversation has died out. She took hours to reply and she hasn’t opened my message for 3 days now (we were talking about my vacation). I’m so confused. 

I accept it, I’m just.. lost. I totally respect her decision but I just want to know what the heck to do to avoid this in the future cause damn, unreciprocated interest is a bummer when they started things :|",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rr4cuu/girl_stopped_talking_to_me_after_holding_my_hand/
87,rr4fmg,1640771026,I'm (19F) devastated I may never genuinely connect with guys my age.,"Basically I had a one year relationship in high school that ended last year and I still can't get over that person. I'm now in college and I'm so jealous of (seemingly) everyone around me meeting so many different and interesting people, gaining relationship/sexual experience and also experiencing heartbreak but then recovering. I feel left behind, as if I've closed myself off from vulnerability because I'm afraid of rejection and going through heartbreak again (I was the dumpee and the breakup really fucked up my self esteem). I even tried Bumble and talked to a bunch of people I found interesting, but i don't think dating apps work for me ultimately. Currently I'm in therapy and trying to work though these issues. Does anyone have a similar experience? Is there anything I can do to be able to trust people more? I'm afraid guys my age are only looking for hookups which frankly I find disrespectful to myself. I'm more the relationship type and I can't stand the idea of using someone for the sole purpose of getting laid.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rr4fmg/im_19f_devastated_i_may_never_genuinely_connect/

89,rr4j85,1640771426,Love is cruel.,"It’s amazing, but it’s cruel.

I just got out of a long relationship with someone who was my best friend for years before we dated.

When we started becoming *really* close as friends but still not romantically in any way, we were very different.

She had no friends. She mentally was unwell. She has no confidence, she didn’t love herself one bit. If there was something that could be wrong, it was. A lot of past trauma plaguing her.

I was on top of the world. Physically, mentally, and emotionally never better. Beacon of energy and love and stability. Never been happier or stronger.

She really clung to me (and in hindsight guilted me incredibly hard if I didn’t give her enough attention even though we were just friends). Eventually we got together and fell in love. Some of the highest of highs I’ve ever felt in my life.

I stuck with her through some of her horrible lows. Like LOWS. She (unintentionally?) hurt me so many times through faults of her own. She slowly dismantled and controlled small parts of me.

A year and a half later, she leaves me. Handles it horribly, hurts me deeper and more damaging than ever necessary. Strings me along with mixed signals for a month. We weren’t even fading the weeks leading up, but she was caving from external factors.

Now it’s like she transferred all of her negative energy into me and she’s just whole. She didn’t seem to try to fix anything at all, there was not one bit of “commitment” through the entire process.

I’m hurt, given up on, as unstable as I’ve ever been in my entire life. It’s fucked up. I’ve had to get into therapy which is something that has never even crossed my mind. I took care of her and built her up and gave her everything and now I’m the one left in the dust. She somehow took a “rock” of a person and sent me into the depths. It was cruel and has really shown me that no matter what you mean to someone or what you’ve given them, they may not bother trying whenever things get rough.

I’m so confused by this I asked her if she wanted to date and she just said she’s not ready we should keep fooling around but just stay open ended.

-&gt; When and how shall I ask her out given that she has only Sunday Holiday and other long hectic weekends ?

-&gt;What activities shall I plan on meeting so that she feels good after days of hardwork ?

97,rr5u6n,1640776381,Question regarding dating and/or relationship acquisition in the early 20s crowd,"So, I've only been in 1 very long term relationship that started when I was like 17. I'm in my early 20s now, and I really have basically 0 dating experience, and I can't really figure out what the general consensus is regarding how to go about pursuing relationships in this age bracket. 

I feel like as teenagers, you know basically everyone that's in your potential relationship or ""dating"" (emphasis on the quotations) pool. You don't actually date people, you already know everyone either from school, extracurricular activities you frequent, etc. Relationships start via mutual interest. Sure, you obviously get to know them over the course of your relationship and you could call this ""dating"", but it's nowhere near the adult version of dating. The way I view a date is you meet someone for the very first time, and just straight up ask them out on a date. You know almost nothing about them except the tiniest seed of interest, hence the date to test the waters and find out. I know that's not *always* how it's gonna go, but I think that's a pretty stereotypical date scenario. 

So where I'm going with this is; I've found another girl I quite like, and I'm in a weird inbetween zone. I know her via a mutual friend, and we've briefly hung out once. After that I asked for her number, and we've been talking for a little bit now and there seems to be mutual interest. We're seemingly pretty compatible, all that jazz. Do I ask her on a date? Do I just tell her I like her/how I feel? Do I ask to just ""hang out"" and *then* tell her how I feel if things keep going good? To me, I already know basically all I need to know that a date would reveal to me. My preferred flow from here would just be straight to a relationship.

Just curious on how people around my age feel about this. Is not going on a conventional date weird? Do women have a strong preference either way? I'm in very new territory here and I really don't know anyone in my life who has ever met a significant other via a date. It's always been just from speaking with someone they know over time and going straight to a relationship without much ""dating"". I know there's no one size fits all answer to this stuff, just want some thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rr5u6n/question_regarding_dating_andor_relationship/
98,rr5vwi,1640776557,"I’m not into my tinder date, do you think this could still be the start of a good friendship though?","I’ve had tinder for months now, and it never works out.   There was this one guy that I Vibed with every time I chatted with him.  I got him into two shows and we talk about it, and I get excited over it. 

One day we accidentally bumped into each other in real life so we thought okay why not meet up. He drove  me to a nice restaurant and paid right. To me it wasn’t a date but to him it was. But it’s still basically my first date, I’m twenty one and never been in a relationship

Long story short in real life I didn’t find him attractive.  I’m just not attracted to him. I told him I don’t see him as more than a friend to be nice, and he got upset and said he was genuinely really happy and wanted something between us in the future, which was flattering, but I just know that I’m not into him. He thought about it then said it’s okay and he takes it as a learning curve and will keep his expectation low. He’s still not over his toxic ex anyways. 

Because I love attention I just kept talking to him. And at some points thought I was developing feelings, he’s watching a fav anime I got him into and can’t wait to talk about it with him!  Unlike every other dating app person we seem to get along well

So I asked him out again to the movies.  But when I’m with him, I still instantly didn’t feel attracted to him, AGAIN.     Not to mention he gives me red flags.  He goes on about girls and boys having red flags, but HE himself already gives me red flags - he seems like a nice guy that hangs around the wrong crowd, partying hard, social smoking drinking and drug taking, says to me he wouldn’t mind having a one night stand with one of his ex female friend, then changes his mind.   (To me RED FLAGS, and the fact that I’m not even attracted to him) These type of people have I’ve never really comes across or hung around.  My friends and I are always innocent good girl next door types that are never in relationships LMFAO

But I do enjoy talking to him, and I want to know how the show I got him into goes.  It’s best to start talking to him less and less, right? If I don’t want a relationship.   He seems like a nice guy. But does it sound like he could be a good potential friend?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rr5vwi/im_not_into_my_tinder_date_do_you_think_this/
