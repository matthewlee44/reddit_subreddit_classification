I’m giving him space this week while he’s on vacation. Limited cell service, plus he deserves to just enjoy his time there. I was considering talking to other people to help keep myself from getting attached, maybe even going on a first date while he’s away. But that also feels wrong.

8,pnfn6k,1631540372,Is this normal behavior?,"I’ve had a string of terrible flakes from women recently and it sucks big time. I can’t figure out if this kind of behavior has been normalized or I just had an unlucky encounter with a string of horrible people.

1. Met on hinge and we’d planned to meet the next evening at 7:00 pm for drinks. We both had plans before that so we texted each other to coordinate. She texts me at 6:30 pm to check in to which I respond to telling her that I’m heading to the location. 7:00 pm, I don’t hear anything from her. Text her multiple times and she didn’t respond. The next day, she texts me saying that her phone died and that she was free that day. Seems like a bullshit excuse considering that she could have texted me the same night if this was really the case.

2. Planned a dinner date on hinge. She seemed super excited. Messaged her the day of to confirm and she unmatched.

3. Met a girl on bumble who was super sweet and sent me a voice message. Asked her if she wanted to grab drinks and she said she did. I proposed a place and she said she liked it. We were supposed to meet at 9:15. I get there at 9:15, text her I’m there, no response. I call her and it rings but I can’t reach her. I wait till 10:00 and didn’t hear from her so I unmatched her.

4. Met on hinge on Friday and she says she can’t meet till Sunday because she’s on a shift. We agree to meet on Sunday at 7pm and text through Saturday. On Sunday, I text her asking how she was doing and if she was still down to meet. No response. Text her at 7 asking her what happened. She responds at 7:30 saying that she “forgot she had dinner plans with friends and maybe tomorrow will be better”.

This kind of behavior completely baffles me. If I ever agree to meet someone I try my best to make it and if I can’t, I let them know ASAP. I do this because I value my word, don’t want to waste anyone’s time and certainly don’t want to hurt them by thinking I flaked on them because they’re so low on my list of priorities.

I don’t understand a couple of things:
1. why do people agree to meet up if they’re not going to commit the time
2. If for whatever reason they can’t make it or change their mind, why don’t they have the basic decency to let the other person know ahead of time? 

These are literally my previous 4 dates and I’m starting to get really discouraged. Is this kind of disrespectful and immature behavior common today or did I just run into a string of bad apples?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnfn6k/is_this_normal_behavior/

She was looking at me with dilated pupils, constantly touching me, dressing really hot and smiling and laughing at everything I did.

Most of my life no girls have even considered me, then one came along and I got insane imposter syndrome, this is terrifying for me because now that it's over, I'm thinking ""what if its the same next time?"" What if I find it impossible to maintain a relationship because I find it impossible to believe that I am attractive. When I asked her out and she said yes I genuinely got stressed and caught up on the way she said yes, even though she said it straight away.

18,pnh3wo,1631545000,"Please help, I need usable advice","
Hello all, first sorry if this is in the wrong place, the other subs I've tried have all rejected me for being too new.

Second a little tldr, I'm a male virgin who can't seem to get attractive women to even notice I exist. 

The detailed version, this may take a while, sorry. I'm a 40year old male virgin who seems invisible to the opposite sex if they are any more attractive than ""cute"". I have tried many times over the years but I cannot even get a woman to acknowledge my existence if there is not some kind of business going on (I don't mean sex workers, I'm not quite that desperate, yet). I've tried approaching women in bars and clubs, when I was in college, when I was active duty military, when I'm in bookstores, when I'm out doing my one big hobby (wargaming), when I take my cat to the vet or outside so she can play in grass, I've even tried dating websites. Big old goose egg each time. If I find a woman attractive she doesn't even notice my existence. Now ones I want to avoid, some of them seem to respond to my presence (not in a good way either). I've been told that I'm not a bad looking guy, and female coworkers say I'm a great guy to be around, but single women, (nerd alert)well let's just say Tie Fighters in Star Wars have more success than I do with women. I would not be posting here if I had not felt close to rock bottom. I truly don't know what to do at this point. I've heard all the cliche statements, be more confident, be patient, there is someone for everyone, God has a plan, ECT. I need some real advice here. I don't want to hit my 41st birthday and not even have a girlfriend.

 As for what I'm looking for in a woman, nice personality, good sense of humor, height weight proportionate, have some kind of faith grounding, and not have kids ( I want kids of my own, not to raise another man's children). I don't really care she's more experienced in bed than I am. I fully expect that the last of those will cause people to say I'm being unreasonable, I get it, but I need to have some minimal standards, even if that makes me seem shallow. 

Thanks if anyone actually read this to the end. Double thanks if anyone actually has a clue what is so wrong with me that I can't even get a hello from a pretty woman.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnh3wo/please_help_i_need_usable_advice/

20,pnhbct,1631545622,"I've been rejected many times in life, but this one is definetely up there with the best. Help me fellow redditors?","M30. I've had my fair share of rejections in life but I encountered one today, which even baffled me. I had a date with a girl this weekend, which went really well. We had lots of common ground and it went on for 2.5 hours. All good, no red flags. During our date, she asked about dating history, so I told her i had an ex-girlfriend and that we broke up in 2018 as we werent on the same page etc. 

Today I ask her for a second date and she says to me ""I feel you havent healed from your last relationship, or something is still upsetting you. You're a great person, I would genuinely love to be friends"". Normally, girls would either not reply or say that she didnt feel a connection or we didnt have much in common - which is fair enough.

Now, I found her comment very bizarre as I told her I was over my ex, and i was super happy/positive on the date (and in life generally). Her comments seem very very specific, if that makes sense. And I've never received a rejection with such a rationale. 

My only theories are, that shes hiding something in her personal life (e.g. shes still talking to her ex) or she generated a random bullshit excuse to cover it up, which evidently is a very crappy excuse.

24,pnhlf0,1631546468,Oddly upset with how things went [Venting],"So, I'm not really looking for advice or anything, but I just needed to get this out there and hope that I might get some perspective. I apologize for the length.

I (34M) met a woman (31F) through Match back in mid-August. We hit it off pretty quickly and were messaging back and forth quite a bit since we had so much in common. Due to a busy travel schedule for her and a busy work schedule for me, we only managed to get together for 2 dates, one a couple weeks ago and the second this past Thursday.

We were messaging regularly between the dates, and the dates themselves were absolutely wonderful, with Thursday's date ending in a long goodnight kiss and tentative plans for a 3rd date (she had to coordinate some things in her schedule, so nothing formal was set).

Then, yesterday, she texted me in the morning to tell me she couldn't see me again. She had met a guy shortly before me, and they decided on Saturday that they were going to be exclusive. I let her know that, while it bummed me out personally, I understood and wished them well.

The thing that gets me is how upset I find myself. We had only been on 2 dates and been messaging for less than a month. We hadn't hit any big milestones or anything and were still just getting to know one another, but my heart sank when I got that text.

Now, for those that aren't on Match, it has an icon next to a match's name that says how recently they've been on. Since she is one of my most recent matches I messaged with, her name is still towards the top of my list and I can see that she has been logging in since then. Odds are she's just informing other matches of the situation as they message her, but for some reason I feel hurt and lied to. The reality is that regardless of the reason, she's not interested in pursuing a relationship with me, and I should just let it go. I plan to unmatch her so that she's no longer showing up, and I've already deleted her contact and text chain from my phone, but this just sucks.

I know I'm overreacting to all of this. She's a wonderful person and so much fun to be around, and I truly wish her the best. I'm just surprised by how sad I am that it wasn't me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnhlf0/oddly_upset_with_how_things_went_venting/

I'm also fairly sure she's tried to kiss me, but the situation hasn't felt quite 'right' for it so far - she settled for a kiss on the cheek the last time.

She's expressed insecurities about things moving a bit too fast emotionally, so we agreed to take it one day at a time and see how things go. Nonetheless, we spent pretty much the entire weekend together and agreed to take a short break from hanging out just to catch our breath a little.

Today (Monday) she asked me if I'd be fine if she went on a date with a guy who has apparently been very persistent recently and she wouldn't want to stay wondering what he's like. I said that it was up to her, but I can't help but feel sort of jealous. 

In some ways I feel like the best thing I could do is nothing, but it's definitely got me feeling a little uneasy because I could definitely see us as a couple in the future.

I used to consider her as a good friend too, but what can I do, they broke up long time ago and my ex really wanted to be with me. but than it started to get complicated because his ex is all the time texting and asking him questions saying that she doesnt feel good. and our common friends I assume dont know how to handle this situation and they do / say negative things as well to me. they know 3 of us.. 

so his ex stopped contact with him and than returned and saying she is feeling not ok. he is afraid that her illness will get worse. so now she wants to hang out with him all the time. I feel excluded and not heard. 

we had huge fights because of his friends attitude, and he blaims me for all. he says all is in my mind, his friends are good, I make up things, things are over between him and his ex... 

so I broke up and I said I wish him the best and will remember him good. he said he enjoyed being with me and he likes me. when I feel better he d like to meet up again and he is there when I need help.

Long story short I was the dumper, did the no contact thing for 3 months. I knew I wanted her back right away, but I also needed to work on myself a bit and get a few things in order.

I contacted her and apologized, and we have been talking again. FaceTime, calls, texts for the past couple weeks. She is def the type of person that is receptive when you lay it on the line, “I still have feelings” “I still love you”. All that stuff kinda got her to at least respond more, she hasn’t said much back yet. I assume she’s still a bit guarded.

We love 2 hours away from each other and used to spend weekends together. So I’m having a bit of trouble with a first date, plus I also have to bring my dog (he can’t go to daycare yet and I have absolutely no one to watch him. She likes him anyway)



Anyway, I’m thinking of asking her to go:

Apple picking for a little and then maybe have a small picnic in the bed of my truck at a lake down the street. A couple blankets, lights. Just hangout a bit after, not hookup. (She had sent me the truck picnic idea before we broke up). 

Then just talk as friends, avoid the serious talk. But I want to wow her, I think she’s that type, she likes those romantic things.

32,pnih5o,1631549163,I want to stop repeating patterns,"Hi everyone. Me (23f) am dating this guy I really like. He’s always been really nice to me, supportive, and understanding. The relationship is a lot different from a past one and this feels pretty stable. I’ve known the guy I’m with for some time now, we’ve been friends for about three years now.

I notice there are still times when I can get a bit toxic or am on the fence of doing that. For example, I loose trust really easily and start questioning how supportive they really are. This isn’t just a relationship thing, I do this with everyone anyways. Anyhow, it can lead to the other person feeling pretty upset if I get standoffish about it. It hurts them and sometimes, I run my mouth during moments when I should be supporting them. I’m in therapy right now and am medicated for ADHD. I guess I’m wondering what else I can do to sustain the relationship? I’ve never experienced anything this stable before.

(Btw, this is a minor thing and I may be overanalyzing myself/the situation, but I just want to make sure things stay healthy and I work on it before it becomes a big issue, if it ever will).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnih5o/i_want_to_stop_repeating_patterns/

&amp;#x200B;

Since i'm a child, i always dreamed of the ""generic life"" (as some would say) of having a family, so, yeah, i would like to find someone who will want a serious story and with whom it will work well. My parents always told me to work hard in school, find a good job and have a good life situation and that all those things would help me get what i whish in life.

&amp;#x200B;

After i was done with school (I did two banchelor degrees at the same time (Maths and Programming)), i decided to move away from where my family was living. I've lived my entire life in suborban areas, and needed some change. Also, i wanted to try living in a city since there is more people, so more chances to meet someone. I found a great job which i love, but after one year (at age 24) living in the city, i decided to buy my first (small) house in suborban of this city since urban life wasn't for me. I'm not saying that i thought that what i have or did would ""impress"" girls, i just thought i would mean  that i'm kinda responsible and smart.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, i'm still not able to find someone who both like me and want the same serious thing. Don't get me wrong, I had some dates and girlfriends in the past, but it never last because either we were not at the same ""stage"" in life (even if we are the same age, still live like a student and party almost every night) or they just don't want anything serious (fwb or one night stands). I think i'm at least an average looking guy, but lately (for a year) i didn't get much matches on dating apps, and some women called me ""ugly"" and/or ""boring"". I was not completely unhappy in life, but those words and reality did hurt me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like nowdays, with all social media influences and dating apps, people are only looking for the big ""sensationals"" things, when i personnally love and find the sensational in the little things of life. Is dating all about the sensational nowdays? I feel like there is a game to play, and i find this stupid.

I dress to fit my body but EVEN THEN at most you get a glance from a woman walking by. I get the feeling you could look like near a model and still not have anyone approach you or trying to initiate.

So how true is that saying for men? Does it really just happen or am I going to be sitting here when I am 30, looking good but never having had a date?

She was a bad texted on hinge too but great in person, we ended up having sex etc and talked, but she still is a bad tester and that’s fine but with how busy life is it’s hard to get to know someone when they text badly and or text flippantly ( sent me a rolling eyes emoji after I text her hours ago). 

Personally going to call it there, let her show some interest and effort and if she doesn’t then good too. Hopefully I don’t get accused of “using” her or something because I thought things would be different, I am not here for low efffort tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

I got really lucky last week, and landed a date with two great women. I've gone on two dates with each now, and like them both.

&amp;#x200B;

One of them has had bad luck in her life: father passed away last year. Good friend passed away last year. Her family is abusive and toxic, and she is distancing herself from that situation. Somehow, she has turned out pretty normal. Small group of friends. University educated, but dropped out after 3rd year when dad passed away, does not plan on finishing. We both love riding motorcycles (went for a ride on our first date, and that was a huge rush of excitement), both like working out, and we both had the same favorite band and as teenagers (which was a great topic of convo for a night). She doesn't like her job, but is looking to go to community college to pursue a new career. She's 12 years younger than me. I'm very attracted to her in all aspects, except I really find it a burden to listen to all of the shitty things her family has put her through. It seems that has taken up all of the space in her life, and she's focused on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other woman has a successful business, as I do, is very active outdoors, as I am, and seems to have a large social circle and a good family. University educated. Very full calendar (trains 6 days a week in long distance trail running and weight lifting). I don't have the same fitness goals as she does, so we won't be training together much. Has just moved 1 hr away from the big city, but commutes to her business twice a week. I find her equally attractive. Yet I feel intimidated by all of her successes, large social circle, full calendar, and 1 hr distance. I'm nowhere near the superstar she is, yet very impressed and find it all great.

&amp;#x200B;

The first one needs help, which I'm not opposed to doing. There's something noble in helping people out. I do realize that a person who needs help has to put in the initial effort, has to make change, can't be ""rescued"". But I do believe some people just need a boost in life. The second just shines in all kinds of ways, doesn't seem to need anything except a partner, yet I don't know if I can ""keep up"" or if I'll actually be able to spend much time with her. I wonder if she'll lose interest in me because I'm not the superstar she is, and because we won't be spending much time together during the week.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnj4by/met_two_great_women_need_advice/

I am very outgoing, adventurous, and loving. I like to go out to eat, go to movies, go camping, traveling, go to the beach, shop, and just being out in nature. I do try to workout a couple of times a week, if not more. It depends on how by body is feeling that day!  I want someone funny, smart, adventurous, loving, and caring, like I am. I do not smoke. I do not do drugs. I do seldomly drink(a glass of wine at Thanksgiving and Christmas)! I have tried my best by searching for love on dating sites, but I have gotten scammed terribly on those!

48,pnjltc,1631552553,Seriously ... don’t play games,"I met this guy a few weeks ago at a wedding and was very smitten by him. There was definitely a lot of flirting and we have a lot of friends in common, and a lot in common as well so I definitely wanted to pursue it. I went as far as sending a friend request on Facebook, sending a sweet message on how nice it was to meet him and asking him out. He responded with how he likes me too and wants to have a zoom date. I texted saying I was up for the zoom date and asking what times worked for him. 
I think I’ve been left on read because it’s been 2 days. 
Around the same time as I met him, I’d been texting someone online (we also have a lot in common). After the wedding, we went on one date and then he texted me saying he was going to be MIA because of a deadline. I was happy that he let me know of that and once the deadline was over, we went on a second date and it was awesome!!! 
Honestly, after meeting this person and an amazing second date, I have very little interest to pursue this person at the wedding. I still don’t know him well and I’m sensing either his lack of interest or desire to play games and I’m not up for that!
If it was him playing games, he lost someone who genuinely wanted to connect, get to know him and be intimate. 
So word of advice, if you don’t like someone please be honest. If you do like someone don’t play games. 

If something did genuinely keep him off his phone the last 2 days and he texts back about it and asking for the zoom date, I will admit I was wrong and go on that zoom date (provided it isn’t too late and the guy I’m currently seeing and I move forward).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnjltc/seriously_dont_play_games/

It was night picnic at beach with wine and some food. The 1st date was a bit of physical contact. This 2nd one Is e made out multiple times and talked about personal stuff and laid down cuddling with each other and I was playing with her hair giving her kisses on the sand till like 4 am the next day. The only thing that idk if it was mood killer or what was that at some point she asked me what I was looking for at the moment. I said I was looking for a relationship and she answered with she had no idea yet. She also mentioned she has never been in relationship before. She is a bit sheltered socially. Will say we were buzzed as we almost drank the whole bottle of wine at that point. Anyhow she dropped me off home made out with her a bit before I got home and told her she sets up next date. I don’t remember if she said yes or no. We texted a bit the next day was thinking about calling her that night but I went out drinking with friends. Today at the point of writing this is the morning for me and thinking about calling her at the end of the day if she hasn’t set up the 3rd date to talk about setting up. Today’s my brother  bday so I will be preoccupied with that so I won’t have to overly think about it during the day. Do you guys/girls think it comes off as too needy calling her later if she hasn’t setup the date yet? I do like this girl and just want to kiss her again.

69,pnlakb,1631557576,Going on a date with girl I drunkenly met at a concert?,"So I went to like a small DJ set the other day in my city and met a couple girls but she seemed to want to dance more and I just felt more of a good vibe with her. Another dude actually told me to go up to her, I think his gf was friends with her and what a wingman that guy was bc I literally just grabbed her hand, and we started dancing and that was that. 

I tried making out with her and it first maybe it was too much and she didn’t open her lips that much, and maybe I smelled like vodka and tequila bc she gave some gum lol. We danced a bit more, I just get extremely touchy and was grabbing on her waist, her butt, but never obnoxiously (I hope), and once we started getting better with the dancing, we started kissing a bit more, and she danced with her head into my chest and it felt like a good time.

I had to leave bc it’s as getting late, I helped her find her friends bc they went to chill in some other room, and I dropped her off snd kissed her goodbye. Usually I’m used to girls not meaning anything and they just want to have fun in the moment, but she’s been pretty responsive over text and so I asked her out.

I’m sort of afraid that it’s gonna be awkward and maybe we had beer goggles and it ends up being like weird, but at the same time I’m just curious to see how she actually is in person. I said we could do a picnic date and I’m probably going to bring wine just to ease the nerves, but still it almost feels like a blind date (at least for me) bc I remember her being really cute but I can’t exactly remember her face.

70,pnlcut,1631557773,How do I not get overly involved in someone at the beginning of dating?,"First, a little backstory. I matched with this girl on tinder, and we hit it off pretty well. She was not comfortable meeting right away, so we decided to text for a while until she has more trust. The next 10 days we were sending huge texts, it went really well, and then decided to go on a date. The date went fairly well, we laughed and had a good time going for a walk. At the end she seemed a bit off and when I asked her for a second date she said she had to think about it. Later that evening a text followed where she explained, that she thought I was kind and cute but that her gut feeling just wasn't right. Fair enough so far. My problem is that I really liked her and that I allowed my mind to imagine us being together, which makes me feel way more horrible than I should right now. I just feel heartbroken, and I know this is just stupid, because I barely know her.   
So, to come to my question. What can I do to prevent myself from getting overly invested in someone (or rather the idea of someone my mind made up), when dating, so that I don't have to suffer this much when I get rejected?

74,pnljuo,1631558359,Most of the advice here only works if you’re attractive or at least average,"After living for 22 years as an ugly guy and having received just about every piece of dating advice known to man, I’ve come to the conclusion that most of the dating advice and about 90% of the advice here, is for attractive people. 

Okay so we know that the biggest thing here is, “just be confident” or “have good hygiene”.

So first I really think the idea that if you’re struggling with dating you’re some smelly obese basement dwelling neckbeard is a really fucked stereotype which reaffirms the idea that if you’re single you must be terrible. Second, confidence with nothing to back it up is arrogance and it like bad.

Like I’ve been with my girl friends when a fellow ugly guy approaches them and they will complain about gore confident he is because he’s “too ugly to be that confident” or they’ll say he’s creepy for talking to them at a party. When an ugly guy has confidence it’s off putting to women. When an attractive guy does, he’s hot.

I feel similarly with the advice to “just live your life and meet people naturally”. This is really only something that works for women and hot guys. No average looking or less guy is going to have a woman just attracted him by him existing. That’s a massive load of bullcrap. Ugly and average men have to ask out women they have to find women that like them. They don’t just get women by existing.

Lastly “looks don’t matter it’s really your personality that’s hurting you” anyone that has ever said this is an attractive person. They just are too blind to the fact that they get special treatment by the world for being good looking, but since that’s all they’ve known it must be normal and how everyone else lives. It’s the same as white Americans denying any existence of white privilege. Or people that were born rich thinking money can’t buy happiness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnljuo/most_of_the_advice_here_only_works_if_youre/

What would you do???

I met with a woman I was chatting to on tinder. When we spoke online she said she was just curvy and her pictures suggested she was.

We agreed to meet at a local bar on a saturday afternoon. When she turned up she must have been 300 pounds and 5 feet 8. She was wearing a tight white dress and high heels, which made her look even larger.

We had a couple of drinks at this bar and saw that down the road there was a football (soccer) game taking place. The team was a tier three team so barely professional.

We agreed to go and watch the match. Outside the game we purchased tickets and a ticket to the half time match lottery.

She could barely fit in her seat and ended up taking up most of mine. We were getting stared at due to how tight her clothing was.

When the half time lottery draw was announced, to our suprise she has won, a minor prize of a around £360.

She walked out onto the center of the soccer pitched to collect her prize when all of a sudden loads of the fans started shouting ''who ate all the pies'' ''you fat bastard''

She waddled back her seat before sitting down next to me and explaining that some of the fans were jealous of her curves.

We left the stadium after the match and we have not spoke since.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnlkmg/crowd_reacts_to_my_date/

78,pnlue8,1631559290,I don't know where else to post this. I'm kind of famous and last night I had the absolute worst date ever. I'm also really sad.,"I won't go into too much detail. No, I'm not a multi-million dollar worthy YouTuber, but I'm famous enough to be known in multiple countries across the world, and I'm able to make a decent income out of my online footing without relying on a separate job. My channel is focused on DIY projects. I think I'll leave it at that.

The girl followed me on my Facebook page last month. She's gorgeous but more importantly, she seems to have a similarly niche channel to mine, albeit with little to no subscribers. We interact here and there a few times; a comment here, a story reply there, you know the drill. Those story replies eventually turn into real conversations and before you know it, I had developed a crush on her. Every day or two, she sends me a random picture she thought was funny and we'd talk for a bit. Over the course of a couple of weeks, I find out that we have a lot in common; we're interested in the same genres of movies, the same TV shows. At this point I have a suspicion that she likes me back and as I'm building up the courage to ask her out, she asks me out one day.

""You came across my mind today so I made you this keychain. It's not much, it looks awful, wanna go for a cup of coffee some day?""

I suddenly feel like the happiest I'd ever been. I clean myself up, shave my beard, cut my hair and get a new pair of shoes.

We go out and... it's the worst date I've ever been on.

We meet up at a local coffee shop, we exchange greetings and we start talking about each other. Well, she does. For 10 minutes straight, she just talks about herself. When it's my turn to talk, before even a minute has passed, she cuts me off mid sentence and changes the subject.

""So, how'd you get your channel so big?""

I'm taken aback but I answer her. More questions follow. ""What tips did you follow? How long did it take you to reach your first milestone? How much do you make off of it?"" She takes out her phone and shows me a couple of videos she was editing and asks me for advice on who the hell even knows what at this point. Then she asks me if I can help her grow her channel, if I can be her go to guy for questions and future advises. 

I swear, the moment she cut me off and brought up my channel, even though I couldn't see my face, I could picture a warm smile turning into an expression of pure loss. Confusion. All of that, was for *this*? 

At the end of our date, she hands me the keychain she made. It's fucking beautiful, which makes this even more painful. I fake the hardest smile as I accept it. The bill comes and I reluctantly take my wallet out, forcing that same broken smile before she pushes my wallet down and insists on paying. In any different scenario, I would not have let the woman pay but I was just out of energy at that point. I put my wallet back in my pocket as I watch her pay. 

As the waiter leaves, I sip on my iced coffee that's now watered down and tasteless as she texts someone on her phone. A car stops near the entrance, she puts her phone down and tells me her boyfriend's here. She tells me she'd had a wonderful time and would love for us to meet again. I fake another smile as I watch her walk out the door. 

I sit there by myself for 2 minutes. I fake-scroll on my phone to look busy, take another sip of the now desaturated iced coffee, and I let out a silent little laugh.

""What the fuck, man.""

Look, she wasn't malicious with her intentions. She was actually extremely nice, the keychain she gave me was tailor-made for me, and it's clear how much effort she put into it. I actually hate how much I love it, lol. It's just, something was lost in translation. What I thought was interest in *me* as a human being, was nothing more than interest in *my influence* and what I can offer. I guess, looking back, her paying the bill for the both of us was her way of paying me for my troubles.

86,pnm9of,1631560585,New to relationships and want some outside input,"My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) have not talked since Thursday night, today is Monday. We had just been dating for a month and starting dating over the summer. We met last year in college and hung out a lot during the summer, despite living an hour and a half away from each other. I had never been in a serious relationship before this one and I asked her to be my girlfriend relatively soon. She was ecstatic and we started dating, having a great time. We then moved back to college and have had a lot of fun. 

We both come from very different backgrounds. My family is very open and lets me have a lot of free reign. She has a great relationship with her parents, but they are much more conservative and she is super innocent. Earlier on in the relationship I tried to initiate having sex, but she said she wasn’t comfortable doing this yet so I stopped and apologized. She told me that she had previously been in a 4 year relationship that she ended because he was pressuring her to have sex. I completely ok with waiting until we get to know each other better, but don’t want to wait until marriage. She said she didn’t want to wait until marriage, but wasn’t ready yet and I am completely ok with this. 

I also smoke a lot of weed. I started smoking my sophomore year of high school and smoked daily until this past summer.  Since then I have stopped smoking daily and maybe smoke once or twice a week. Because of this, weed has been something that seems pretty casual to me. I had brought up the idea of her smoking with me a few times (she has never smoked), I even tried convincing her to smoke with me. I did not realize how uncomfortable all of this made her feel until later. She didn’t say no the first time I asked, so I waited a week or so to broach the topic again. Wednesday, the day before the last time we talked, I brought out my dab rig and was planning on smoking when it was just the two of us. I realized how uncomfortable she seemed and decided not to smoke and put it up. She thought I was bringing it out to get a reaction from her, but I genuinely did not mean to and was just going about my day as usual. 

After this night we had a talk Thursday night. I had just gotten sick that day and was really tired. But basically we talked about how we are really different people and have different values, which I agree with, but I said I really enjoyed spending time with and want to continue. After our conversation she left. I sent her a Snapchat later that night apologizing for my actions and making her feel uncomfortable. She opened it the next morning and didn’t reply so I decided to let her have some space. It was Friday morning when she odr me and I haven’t talked to her since (today is Monday). I’ve been sick this weekend so I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and I really do want to keep hanging out with her, but I’m not sure how I should go about it. 

Other than all of this I really enjoy spending time with her. She is one of the nicest people I have ever met and she is super genuine and driven.

And then he said even his in the relationship he said he never fell in love or get butterflies, but he does treat them nice and do romantic things, but its because hes feeling lovey dovey and gushy, but because its the right thing to do.

So he does romantic things because hes trying to the right thing not because hes feelings feelings of infatuation.

He also says he knows how to act when women show other emotions like crying and he said he feels awkward when that happens.

So I asked him how did he even get relationships in the first place and he said all his exes are the ones who pursued him.

So yet questions is he the type that needs to pursue the women first to fall in love? Should I take a step back and let him pursue me and make effort for me instead?

I like being by myself but sometimes when the opportunity is right there, I can't speak or say anything. Im always worried something bad is going to happen and that I won't be able to cope with it. For example, I was driving today and I saw the road being worked on. There was no sign and as I approached, one of the construction workers shouted at me when I didnt know. Im sensitive to that stuff. How do I get over this? fear of failure, mistakes etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnmir4/im_paralyzed_by_fear/

He would message me everyday all day for months and it started giving me anxiety so I told him we should just be friends. 

I went on Instagram today and I did want to see if maybe she was with him now, (I blocked him) and she blocked me!

I've literally never talked to her, she should have no idea who I am. I never let him know I knew about her either, I just wonder how she found out about me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnmmwe/i_was_in_a_triangle_situation/
93,pnmn5o,1631561737,"Exclusive, but are we?","I'm an Indian American female in her 20s. Just for some background, our culture heavily involves parents in dating/marriages. There are matrimonial websites (think the equivalent of catholicmatch.com ) for Indians, where parents often make the account-sometimes jointly with their kids-and look for prospective brides/grooms for their kids. Just tossing this out there because of the relevance it has to my post.

I met a guy in real life, through some friends, and we've been dating now for a few months and had the exclusivity talk. We both seem to be looking for similar things in life-marriage in a few years, settling down. He's made it clear that before that step he would want to make sure of a few things including being sexually compatible and being together for a few years...I personally, would not want to have sex with someone who wasn't at least a boyfriend/in a committed relationship.

Here's the spin. I found out recently through a female friend who is on these matrimonial apps that this guy's mom recently created an app for him and she has been logging onto it every single day. This was after our exclusivity talk. I confronted the guy, who told me that he doesn't want to involve his mom or dad or any relative in his dating life or tell them about his dating life because they may get overly involved. I do happen to know many parents who are guilty of doing this, so he's not entirely wrong, it does place lots of stress on the kid. The guy doesn't want to tell his parents much about me, or even how serious we are, up until we decide to get married, which will likely be in 1-2 years' time (he said he needs that much time). He has assured me he won't talk to anyone else, even if his parents find him a prospect. 

But this leaves me in a bad boat. I like that we are exclusive but that's not the same as being boyfriend/girlfriend. I can't go on for years and years in this state of ""exclusive, but not bf/gf"". On the other hand, if his parents are actively seeking out prospects for him, are we really bf/gf? What if they find someone they like better and refuse to even accept me?

And, if we are indeed in this state of ""limbo""-I'm not comfortable sleeping with him-let's just say that.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar situation. Or words of advice from anyone more experienced than I. I'm sitting here, not seeing anyone else, all dating apps deleted, but I can't help but wonder if I'm wasting my time as his parents may find him someone better.

One friend told me to just go and start seeing other people but something rubs me wrong about that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnmn5o/exclusive_but_are_we/

95,pnmtgn,1631562265,I have the stupidest crush ever,"Ok ya’ll are gonna judge me because I’m a grown ass 21 yr old woman but here goes.
So I met this old family friend of mine after 12 years. We were never really close as kids, played football together sometimes and maybe spoke a few times. 
Anyway, our families (and some others) had a get together 3 months ago and holy shit. He got so hot lol. He’s super tall, lean, has the most stunning smiling ever etc you get the picture. 
Throughout the get together I caught him glances at me a couple of times, but I honestly thought they were coincidences because why would HE look at ME? 
I had some other friends with me and asked them what he’d been up to. They told me he’d just dumped him girlfriend of 8 months over some drama. I didn’t think much of it. 
Anyway, two-ish hours after the get together ended, I got a follow request from him on Instagram. I accepted and 3 days later he replied to my story and boom. We began talking everyday.
Now here’s the thing: I am a university while he has a job. He’s the same age as me, but he started working early. 
I’m not the best texter so our replies would be spaced out 7-8 hrs. 
Also, we live in different cities. 
I know it’s awfully stupid, because a) we dont even talk to each other THAT often and b) I know we could never be in a relationship because we’re in very different stages in our lives and c) WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT FUCKING CITIES. 
But fuck me, all I think about is this guy. I dont know if it’s the fact that I’m really attracted to him (physically) or if our spaced out texts have conditioned me to always be excited to talk to him, but I feel so….helpless? I have absolutely no control over my feelings. I post stories SPECIFICALLY catered to him so he replies and we can have yet another conversation. And he ALWAYS fucking falls for my stories lol. 
I’m usually a very mature person. I don’t even like all that much Instagram lol. But this crush is making me act like a 12 year old. 
All I think about is meeting him in real life, going on a drive with him, kissing him, HELL SUCKING HIM DRY LMFAO THIS SHIT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!
Please tell me what the fuck I should do with all these feelings. 
I haven’t told him I like him (and I dont plan on doing so because it’d be weird given that we havent even spoken properly irl). I know it’/ never gonna happen. How do I get over him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnmtgn/i_have_the_stupidest_crush_ever/

I’m a very insecure person however I don’t show it, I find it hard to trust a guy. I literally ended up staying there the whole day when we woke up in the morning but he kept putting movies on, next thing it’s 9pm.

He gave me a hug when I left but never offered to give me a lift home or pay for my taxi when I said I was getting one I texted him to let him know I got home safe he read it didn’t reply till morning and kinda hardly spoke to him today.

99,pnn3e3,1631563090,Question mainly fore the ladies but skilled fellow males can answer too.,"M26. 

How the hell you spark interest into a girl.

Not talking about the ""I see a girl I like and she does not know I even exist"" type of scenario, no, I'm talking about the ""I've started chatting with a girl I see 3 times a week in the morning because of my job"" type of scenario.

So I deliver stuff for my family shop and one of the places i go to is this complex with a bar in it. There is this girl I see almost every time I go there and one morning she said something to me like ""Oh sorry i left this thing in the way"" (It wasn't really in the way) so when I was leaving I stopped and said ""Soo what's your name? I know the names of basically every other worker here but not yours"" and she warmly replied her name with a nice smile on her face. Next day I stopped and tried to chat with her for a minute and paid for a bottle of water and in the end I asked her instagram name and she wrote in on a paper for me. 

See, the issue here is that I cannot make a distinction between the ""I am being polite"" type of smile and general kindness and the ""I'm letting you know I want to know you"" type of smile and general kindness. 

So I guess this could be a first question. How to tell?

And second thing, some people told me that before asking a girl out you should at least try to connect with her in some small way, some would call this ""flirting"", a thing I am ten-thousand percent not familiar with. So kinda hitting on them in very mild way? I have never had much expirience so I don't know any tricks or good things to say. 

Any suggestions on what to say to try and mildly flirt with someone before actually asking them out? 

BONUS EXPLANATION: I made it really sound like I have never interacted with a girl in my whole life and that is not true, I had a wonderful three years relationship with a great person and I have learned a lot from that experience, problem is she was into me before I even started talking to her so I have never really experienced the flirting part, only the actual relationship part which I feel I am very good at.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnn3e3/question_mainly_fore_the_ladies_but_skilled/
