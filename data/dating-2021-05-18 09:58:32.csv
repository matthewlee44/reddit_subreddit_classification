2,nfde9v,1621351161,Is women being attracted to buff guys an american thing?,"Hey all. I have been hearing from lots of corners of reddit that men get a lot more attention once they get buff/in great shape. I started working out 3 years ago (not for that reason btw, purely for health at the time. I was severely overweight) and would say I am pretty muscular right now. Got nice back/arms, chest a tiny bit lacking but working on it but overall I would say in the top 10% of men for sure. 

I live in Germany and have been noticing next to 0 changes apart from the first year, which was just cutting. A lot. More than 70lbs. I am also 6'1.5'' (187cm) and got a pretty great face. Don't even get glances when I am out. The only thing I have noticed is that female coworkers are slightly more kind to me.

It's pretty funny considering the rhetoric on almost all dating related subs is that once you get in great shape you will drown in attention. Tbh I saw more men that were 5'7'' attracting women. Again, I didn't lift for looks but I wonder: Is this physique thing an american thing? I heard for you guys being buff is a status symbol and that generally the culture is way more open and approaching strangers way more common.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfde9v/is_women_being_attracted_to_buff_guys_an_american/

9,nff7b8,1621355458,Don't know what to make of this guy? Gut keeps telling me to stay away.,"35f I've known this guy 32m for about 4-5 years. We met through another guy I was dating at the time (I know, don't judge. I don't do that sort of thing really) 

I could tell the ""friend"" or acquaintance of my bf at the time was into me. There was a mutual attraction but I ignored it. The guy I dated turned out to be a player &amp; we eventually broke up.

Then this guy approached me &amp; told me he liked me. Even though I was attracted to him &amp; sensed a connection (more so than the last guy) I told myself not to pursue it bc he knew my ex. He was a bit mad at first which I questioned why he'd want to date a girl who dated an acquaintance of his? 

So we became friends instead. We hung out a handful of times over the course of a year, but he would still try to hint at more with me confessing he really liked me &amp; thought I was amazing. At first I didn't know what to make of it? I didn't know if he was just trying to impress me to get laid but more and more I felt maybe this guy really does like me? 

The problem though was I noticed red flags about him which was another reason I initially decided not to pursue anything with him. My gut just kept telling me not to. He's this dark, mysterious guy who's into dark, creepy shit from death, skeletons, vampires, ghosts, witches, Wicca, occult shit, aliens and so forth. At first I brushed it off &amp; thought maybe it was just a part of his rocker, musician image. The one thing we did have in common was music. We liked a lot of the same genres of music &amp; bands. That's how we really connected. Other than that I wasn't into the same dark shit he's into. 

He also likes girls who are like that &amp; are a little on the goth side. I'm more of a girl next door, classic rock, nature loving, hippy free spirit sort of chick. I can have a bit of a dark side &amp; I tend to think &amp; question about the world a lot &amp; the truth behind it all. I feel he's always been fascinated by me to am extent &amp; more so bc I never really made myself available to him &amp; never threw myself at him which I think was a part of the appeal, him liking the chase bc I felt I wasn't his normal type he's into. I found him always trying to impress me even changing himself slightly to get me to like him. I thought it was sort of cute but also a turn off. I like ppl who are true to themselves. 

Eventually I gave him a chance &amp; we dated but it only lasted two months bc he soon did a 180 &amp; started acting hot and cold &amp; noncommittal even though he was the one who kept telling me he wanted a relationship with me. He started playing games with me which I didn't like &amp; even felt he was putting me down to an extent &amp; gaslighting me. I quickly realized it was a mistake to get involved with him like I initially felt. I also found out he was still flirting &amp; talking to other girls. 

When things ended he was very nasty to me &amp; seemed competitive like it was more about winning vs coming to a compromise or peace. I quickly learned how immature &amp; screwed up he was. I stopped talking to him after that for about a year. O dated someone else in the meantime which looked promising but then that ended unfortunately.

I knew I didn't want to get back with the first guy, but there was a part of me that felt we had unfinished business &amp; was hoping we could at least remain friends. When we reconnected he did apologize to me but I could tell he was hoping for more with us. I knew if I got involved with him it lead to the same issues as I felt he had not changed. We hooked up a few times but I made it clear I wasn't looking for a relationship &amp; just got out of one with someone else. Eventually I told him I didn't think it was a good idea we kept sleeping with each other bc I'm doing a lot of healing &amp; self work not only from my last relationship but also from the situation with him. He understood but I could tell he was a little hurt &amp; disappointed. 

Since then I've felt he's tried to hang out with me &amp; he's even brought up the topic of marriage, he'll send me house listing. Its like he's trying to drop hints but ive made up my mind that I dont want to be with him. He also seems controlling &amp; possessive &amp; very jealous even over the smallest things. He doesn't really go out that much &amp; mostly stays at home even before Covid. Hes an extreme conspiracy theorist &amp; i feel like he keeps trying to change me into what he wants me to be rather than accepting me for who I am. Also I know he's still flirting with other girls. It's like I feel he's trying to get me to commit &amp; settle down with him while still keeping his options open.

After that I decided to distance myself from him more. He basically stalks my Instagram &amp; DMs me stuff from time to time. I've always felt a bit of obsession with him &amp; have even questioned if he is into voodoo. He also told me he joined a Free Mason group but didn't like it bc they were too hokie for him. He seems to have this need to control everything around him &amp; seems obsessed with power.

15,nffhgp,1621356114,Hate the games people play,"I just need to rant about the stuff that’s happened to me over the past month. 

I met a girl at my university through a ballroom dance class. Things between us started by us practicing together on weekends, where we started to build a good connection with each other. She started showing signs of interest and the tension built up until one day, we were hanging out at school, walked back to her apartment, and ended up sitting in her room together, where I made a move and kissed her, to which she kissed me back and proceeded to cuddle with me until she had to leave for her play showing. At this point, I thought everything was good and we had a mutual interest in each other. 

At our next class, everything seemed fine and I acted normally and didn’t make any attempts of PDA or anything. But at the end, after everyone had left, I was saying goodbye as she had another play showing in 45 minutes. Since everyone else had left, I figured a hug was harmless, but she got very defensive and pulled away. I asked her what was wrong and she told me to grab my stuff and we went to her apartment again. She said she felt awkward about hugging in public and stuff. It seemed really odd to me because hugs never seemed like a big deal to me. I asked her if she was ok with me and ok with what we were doing and she said yes to both. She proceeded to kiss and cuddle me again until her play showing. 

As the week went on, I had one text conversation with her in which she seemed a little less engaged, but she still made contributed so I thought it was fine. At the end of the convo, I offered to take her out that Friday, to which she agreed. When Friday comes, she flakes on me saying that she forgot it was her sister’s birthday and was spending the day with her, but would still meet me for dance practice on the weekend. It bothered me that she would flake on me, so I said something about it when I saw her in person. She just kinda seemed to brush it off but still agreed to go out with me Monday after class. 

Monday comes and she does come with me after class. We got food and went back to my apartment, where we had sex for the first time. Afterwards, we talked and cuddled and play-wrestled in bed for hours. She even initiated round 2. Since I had to get up early in the morning, I dropped her off at her apartment at the end of the night. 

For a few days, I felt great. I mean, she definitely likes me if she was willing to do all of that with me, right? Well, I began to notice that she didn’t start text conversations with me anymore, which made me a little suspicious, but I brushed it off thinking I was just being anxious. We practice again and I offer to take her out again the next Monday, to which she agrees. She doesn’t flake this time and everything goes pretty smoothly, except when we went for a walk, she got really nervous about holding my hand, which again seemed odd. Afterwards, she agrees to go back to my apartment, and we have sex again, followed by the same stuff from before and she spends the night with me. 

After this night, I begin to see the real behavior changes. She doesn’t initiate any conversation. If I ask her to let me know about something, she either tells me really late or “forgets”. All signs point to her not being interested, but I guess I was in denial. Why would she sleep with me if she didn’t like me? She continues her games and flakes on me some more until I confront her about it. She says she wasn’t looking for a relationship and said her friends and people from our class commented how we looked cute together, how we should date, how they could tell she liked me, etc. This apparently made her decide to “stop giving off the vibes that she liked me” and it was only ever a casual thing for her. She then said she felt we should be “normal friends.”

This all sounded like bullshit to me. She knew how I felt about her and kept going with it. She would pull back, then sleep with me, and repeat. If she didn’t want anything with me, why go through all that? Why not say something, but instead push me to the point of saying something? I feel lead on and like she played with my emotions. I thought she really did like me, and everyone else did too. She broke my trust and I don’t even know what was real or fake in whatever it was we had. And she was so selfish about it. 

My best guess is that she just lost attraction at some point. I don’t know when or why, but it just hurts when someone you care about doesn’t care back. I wouldn’t call myself heartbroken, but I do feel angry and a little hurt over what she did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nffhgp/hate_the_games_people_play/

But thats not everyone theres people like me who were alone there was nobody to help us with the landmines we just had to figure it out and while now we have less of a need to find a partner since we’ve learnt how to operate alone it sill feels shitty and you ask yourself why the hell did you even start running along the beach with landmines in the first place and then you remember you didn’t, you were always running down the beach since the day you were born because thats just what life is and then you think why am i doing this alone the answer weighs on you as you come to loose answers some better then others some just equal amounts of bad from a different pipe but for me my answer was because nobody wanted to run down the beach with me i was always alone thats not to say you never have people with you cheerin you on theres other people running down beaches only they’re not with you they’re on another beach with their own landminds and usually with another person it makes you happy to see those other people and it encourages you to keep running but theres still an ever lasting feeling of loneliness thats what school was like no girl ever wanted to date me and yes sure i never asked or pursued or anything but thats not the point the point is no girl ever made it clear it was an option because it wasn’t i was a fat ugly kid (thats not to say you can’t find love if your not handsome or beautiful just that it wasn’t an option for me) it dawned on me later after i left that yes i was ugly really ugly and its not different now, now it might actually be worse since i work at a bar i have a coworker hes tall and i mean tall hes prolly 6’3 (as im only an even six foot i look short compaired to this guy)super lean and has a solid jaw structure chicks are constantly hanging off this dude and i have been a witness to it countless times, i then got my brother a job here and im taller then him hes alittle chubby like he needs to lay off candy and jog and chicks hang off him too and i realised that never once have i had a chick look at me the way others look at them never once have i had a girl ask me out or flirted with me to say i could not even the shy look away when you catch someone staring at you never once in my life have i ever had someone express interest in me the way others do to them and god i wish it would just happen once girl guy i don’t care just one person to turn around and express interest im not gay and nor does having a girl express interest in me have to end in anything it would just be nice to have it happen if only once and thats when the realisation truly hit me i am ugly and no girl is ever going to do that no girl is gonna turn around and tell me i look good or express that shes into me because it never will even if i bulk up and get ripped i am at my core ugly and theres nobody that would give me the time of day and yes i know that love isn’t all about looks thats not what i want out of this this isn’t about finding love or hell even a one night stand its just to know that im alright sure i ain’t movie star quality good looking and i don’t want to be i don’t need to look the best i just wish someone would look at me the way that people look at my brother and coworker but i know nobody will and it was stupid to ever think during school anyone would i don’t even know why i care but i also can’t let go",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nffp3a/being_ugly/

I thought he was cute at first and he was nice to talk to. But now I’m starting to lose interest. He’s almost too nice, complimenting me almost every other text, sending pictures of himself all the time, calling me pet names...

I feel bad because I know there are people out there that would love to be treated like that, but I’m not used to it and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Every picture he sends I feel less and less attracted to him. Every time he compliments me I feel awkward because I can only say thank you so many times and I don’t have anything nice to say back. 

I talked to my friend about it and she said to just give him a chance and maybe if we actually went out on a date, I might start finding him more attractive as I get to know him more, but I don’t want to talk myself into finding someone attractive or liking them. It doesn’t feel genuine.

We hit it off on our first date, to the point that before it was over we both said we wanted a second. Chemistry seemed to be really strong all around. Our second date also went really well, she invited me to her place for a drink afterwards, introduced me to her roommate etc... When I left she made it clear that she wanted to kiss me but that she'd feel more comfortable after receiving her vax in a couple weeks. Sure, no problem, no rush what's two weeks? Well we kept it up, and after our fourth date she decided she wanted to kiss me at least before the shot, which we did. We both had weekend plans so I didn't expect to hear from her much and vice versa.

Here's where it gets weird, yesterday morning I get a text saying she sees me as a friend and that she's not feeling it. I was polite in defeat but I'm honestly shell shocked that we went from having our first kiss to her not wanting to see me again days later. No clue what happened but it feels pretty shitty to go from the high of having a first kiss and thinking that we were on the same page to being back to square one. It's  a helpless feeling to know I never got a shot to make the relationship more physical/romantic. Like I was set up for failure in that sense. Probably just sour grapes but that's how it feels. Not fun to have to just get a text and say cool got it! With someone you'd built somewhat of a rapport with either, like damn, we shared some intimate details about our lives and I just gotta say k bye! Weak.

48,nfj17x,1621364383,My partner wont tell me my red flag. Help me find it.,"So a couple nights ago we got in an argument at the bowling alley. We are both competitive, so on the way to the alley, we kept talking up our game. When we finally got to playing, he wasnt doing so hot. In our practice round, you could see his frustration building up. Finally, we placed our bets and the new game started. I had bet that if I won he would have to give me a massage and if he won he bet that he wouldn't have to. Usually he is super picky with the bet, so I asked him , ""Are you sure you want that as your bet?"" He said yes. In the middle of the game I was drastically beating him. Around that time a romantic song comes on and I wanted to dance with him a little (we sometimes do that). However, when I reached to get him from his chair he seemed hesitant   but get up anyways, just as I was clasping his hand he pushed me away and told me to go bowl, to hurry up and finish my turn. Of course I got a little but hurt, but i decided to channel that energy to completely demolishing. Which did happen. He was very very upset, saying I hate this game and he didnt want to massage me. That ended up putting me down. So I became withdrawn. The more we talked to try and fix it or atleast communicate the worse it got and the angrier he got and the sadder I became. I love bowling, but at that point I didnt want to play anymore and simply wanted to go home.

It seemed like we werent getting anywhere but I was still hoping for the best as did he. But that's not what happened. It soon erupted, we weren't seeing eye to eye. He couldnt understand why I was acting the way I was acting. He told me he was wanting to say certain thoughts that might hurt my feelings. At that point I was like bring it on. He said some bareable things but then he proceeded to show me how i looked in his eyes. I didnt like it so I left.

Like a day later we met up at the local park to talk about what happened and attempt to fix the situation. His whole point is he told me I wasnt going to like what he was going to say/do and that I [me] shouldnt give him bullshit over it. However my point is that demonstration of how I looked at that moment hurt my feelings and I wanted him to acknowledge I was hurt and apologize for hurting my feelings even if it was unintentional. After we got our points across we looked for solutions, and I pretty sure we came to a conclusion on his end but he refused to apologize, he ""didnt feel right apologizing"" is what he said. So we argued and before we went our seperate ways he said he would distance himself until I found out what my red flag was (if ever) and did the thing he wanted me to do.


Look I'm not necessarily asking for advice. I'm just hoping you'll help me find this supposed red flag. I dont see it much on my end. Sure I interrupted a couple times, and admitted to having some trust issues but I dont think it's those since we've already talked about them.

49,nfj6tf,1621364724,I told someone I’ve kind of been seeing that I like them a lot. I’m highly sensitive and keep over thinking... I haven’t been this anxious in a really long time :(,"This is a mixture of dating &amp; anxiety. I also included additional (optional) details at the end. 


I’m a woman in her early 20s and have been seeing a guy pretty regularly the past 3 weeks. In total, I’d say we’ve spent about 17-18 hours together. I know it’s still early on but he’s expressed that he likes me multiple times (verbally and physically). Even during the first date, he was already asking me to let him know if I’d be free a couple days from then. 

I recently took time to think and concluded I really do feel the same way. I told him. This was over text so I said I’d elaborate the next time we we meet in person (due to other reasons we were unable to meet that day but I really had to get it off my chest). I know it sounds like middle school crush drama. I should be able to say “I like you a lot too” without being so nervous. But I hate saying things I don’t mean, especially when it comes to emotions and feelings, which is why it took me longer to say it to him back. He is sick so he said he’ll reply and express his feelings when we meet in person. 

My mind is just running 10000 miles an hour. I’m worried he’ll tell me it was a nice thing to say, but that he doesn’t see it going anywhere with me. Or that I’ll be rejected in one way or another. 


Additional details: 

I never really learned how to navigate relationships and my dating experience is more limited (I only started at 19). I grew up with an abusive childhood where we never said anything like that in my family and had a hard time trusting people when they constantly let me down. I’m not trying to blame all my problems on my upbringing and I am working on them through therapy, but I do know it has greatly contributed to my anxiety and tendencies to withdraw when I feel threatened or think about worst case scenarios. I also grew up with barely any physical touch and thought for a long time that physical affection was uncomfortable for me, but through this, it turns out I’m just highly selective. For the first time with someone, I enjoy our hugs/kisses and feel connected to him physically. 

Every time we’ve hung out, even if it’s just on the couch, it’s been at least 5 hours. Time flies and I genuinely my time with him. Our conversations are so fun, lively, and my anxiety is low around him. I also see a lot of green flags in him so far: he honors my boundaries, was there for me when I had something rough going on, reminds me that I’m an amazing person who’s accomplished lots for my age and has a good future, supports my ambitions, values communication, isn’t afraid to talk about his own emotions/be vulnerable, and respects me as a person. He also supports himself on his own, has ambitions, and understands hard work. I guess the only thing is that he got out of a multi-year relationship in early 2020 that was toxic and bad for his mental health. I also got out of a 1.5 year relationship around that time that ended mutually.

50,nfjdks,1621365155,"Serious question, why is it easier to pull teeth than to convince women to work out?","Now hear me out. Based on all the media that I've seen, the constant wave of celebrities undergoing physical composition transformations, and increase understanding of how biology works in school systems. Why isn't it as harsh of a priority for the average woman to work out in order to pursue a more desired version of themselves. 

Now I'm not going to pretend that there aren't men who blatantly ignore the suggestion to go get more active. But whenever I have been at a gym, a track, or even a group class there does seem to be more men than women in those fitness spaces. 

So despite all of the evidence, pop culture and social media demonstrating that increased fitness and a well-developed physique Garner's more desirability and attention, why isn't it a staple mainstay for single women to take fitness seriously? 

Now I'm from the United States so I understand that we have more obese people than anywhere else in the world. But still though it feels like being fitness oriented is dominated by men and lacks representation amongst women. 

Now I understand that working out requires increased knowledge of physiology, nutrition and training techniques. But I feel like for the first time in human history the information is all around us. There really is no excuse for not using it other than lacking willpower.  

And am I wrong in assuming that adherence to a fitness lifestyle and a nicer physique is going to help dating prospects?

I met this guy on okcupid back in 2019, his name is Daniel, and we dated but not seriously for about 5 months.

I ended thinks with daniel and started seeing a different guy who ghosted me right after sex.  I ended up reconnecting with daniel a year later, he had done keto diet and lost 50 lbs and i told him we could hang out but only as friends.  we have been hiking together once a week.

I sort of lost my head last week and suggested a trip away, due to pressure from a friend and also from seeing how happy my mom is with her boyfriend but I think it's a bad idea.

Is it okay if I just go like ""you look so hot today"" and caress a girl's thigh (or when is such a thing okay). Or is it okay to go ""you wanna do it, wink-wink"".

Also, I think that it would be polite to probe the girl with lesser stuff to see if she is interested without creeping her out when it turns out that she is not interested.

He said he wasn't, reacted badly, and judged me for asking a question like that. He brought it up a couple more times, one time making me feel so bad I started crying and he said he regretted bringing it up again. I did question him on why it bothered him so much and he said he has felt that I don't trust him and I am always questioning him and that offends him as he is a very loyal person. The disagreements we had after this was when I was seeking reassurance. He used to gladly give me reassurance, but he started getting angry and said he is tired of having to repeat how he feels a thousand times over, and that by now I should know. He said this also made him feel like I don't trust him, as it seems like I keep questioning things he has already told me the answer to.

What I personally believe, just as a straight man, is that my self care is my own responsibility. Not hers. 

To me it seems selfish to express my uncertainty or pain to her. As a general statement, most of the time i compartmentalizations things. Whereas most women I’ve dated do not, and everything is linked. It’s likely in my own selfish revelations of a bad feeling could cause her more stress than I could be dealing with before admitting it. 

I don’t judge men who do freely express themselves. In-fact I’m jealous. 

I really am stating the values I had to give myself, hopefully helping another guy lost on this topic as well. I talk with my buddies about my crap not my girl. Not because she can’t handle it, but because she’d likely be pulling double weight hearing my problems while dealing with her own.

62,nflgw9,1621370078,Toxic optimism masquerading as dating advice is harmful. Be realistic.,"I just want to point out  something that I feel is actually very harmful.

There’s some people on this sub that give out a level of optimism that I feel is incredibly bad for people that are in actual need of advice. I’ll admit, I’m a little bit of a pessimist when it comes to dating, but some of the following things I see that just aren’t helpful.

&gt;“No one is truly ugly” or some variation.
Some people are ugly. Half of the world is below average in terms of looks. I’m one of those people, and I’m assuming a lot of people on this sub that are hopeless are also these people. To say that were not ugly despite no one ever being attracted to us physically, people telling us to our face that we are ugly, and getting zero matches on any dating site or app is just a lie. It’s a nice thought but no. A lot of people are truly ugly.

&gt;“There’s someone for everyone”
Unfortunately no. Tons of people die alone. Tons of people die virgins. Unfortunately there is not someone for everyone and a lot of us are doomed to die alone. Saying that we’ll find someone eventually is just hopeful wishing.

&gt;”You should never settle”
Settling is a thing most people will end up doing. We all know the stereotype that women sleep with hot guys that they actually are sexually attracted to and then end up with normal average guys that are more stable. There’s some truth to it unfortunately. This is because they realize they have to settle. Guys also settle, most of us can’t get the hot girl we want so we settle for someone attainable. Everyone settles.

Just stop with the toxic positivity. Be realistic in advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nflgw9/toxic_optimism_masquerading_as_dating_advice_is/

Yesterday my girlfriend (23) broke up with me because she said she was focusing too much on me and not herself.

She still cares a lot about me and has feelings but it’s important for her to not be in a relationship at the moment. She told me that it wasn’t anything that I did.

My response back was dry and I didn’t ask him any questions or return the compliment. I’m afraid he will think I’m not interested in him or that our last date wasn’t as great as he thinks it was.

81,nfo8xb,1621376893,Post Date Report,"Date:  05/17/2021

Location:  Craft Brewery in town

Participants:  Me (28 y/o male) and Her (28 y/o female)

Overall Rating:  0 / 10


Girl was gorgeous.  Whipper snapper thin, 5'2"" maybe 110 soaking wet.  The date was originally scheduled at 6.15 pm but she texts me at 5.00 saying she's out of work early and if I can move it up an hour.  I'm not doing much at the point so I acquiescence and start driving to meet her.


She's wearing decent enough clothing and had a corner bench at the bar when I arrived.  Same cute girl who'd asked to meet me last Friday. So far we are doing alright, she's not a catfish!


Start off with a hug and the body language is interesting.  I'm getting a sense of Asperger's from the girl.  Her facial expressions are on point but she's unable to meet, make, or keep eye contact.  Figured it has to do with the nature of her work - she's a Ph.d in Mech Eng.


Conversation is smooth, where she lived, who she works for, the annoying traffic around our town.  She doesn't say anything offensive, rude, or surprising till about an hour into the 'date'.  Looking down at her iWatch she tells me her boyfriend is cooking her dinner and she's gotta leave soon


I'M FUCKING DEAD AT THIS POINT.


A mortified expression briefly crossed my face.  I'm hoping between her glance down at the iWatch and her Asperger's she didn't notice me politely cursing underneath my breath and my facial reaction darken.


Apparently she spent the entire weekend traveling with her boyfriend too, so she is genuinely in a relationship and go figure this wasn't even a date.


Regardless, I tabbed out / paid for us (I had 3x beers and she had 1x) and we left soon thereafter.  She thanked me for picking up her tab after the fact and we talked briefly about what her 'boyfriend' had cooked for her (Pasta Carbonara in case anyone wondered).


Well...Ummm....Needless to say there won't be anymore dates with this girl.  But I do have her number and we may hang out later

I’ve only rarely met people like the guy I currently chat with. People like him are all cute. They show personality, seem to care. Then they seem to lose a little interest in getting to know each other better. They’ve already gotten you on their hook and don’t put a huge effort into coming off like a trustworthy person anymore, still make conversation now and then. And ask for pictures. It’s not a crime to ask for them. But if you say no, and they say “come on, you know me, I’m not a bad person” just block them. 

Don’t be naive to think they care only because they actually wasted their time to seem like it. Don’t seek for excuses to keep talking to them. They will just keep trying to pressure you into sending pictures. 

I’m currently in this situation of realizing what a person he is and I have a really hard time considering how cute and kind he was a few days ago, but now that he showed his ugly personality, I will happily block him everywhere.

However, she sometimes somewhat frequently does this thing where she gets into bouts of sadness and jealousy where she would be insecure and say stuff like how I might like other girls, she’s not pretty enough, she doesn’t mind if I like other girls, etc. She’s particularly hung up on this one girl (back in middle school) who I use to like for only about a year and who I’ve asked out (and got rejected by) but never dated.

I feel really lonely and the fact that I’m almost 25 without experiencing any of these has me extremely worried. I think it’s too late for me.","I feel really stuck right now. But all I know is that it doesn’t feel good at all. I just don’t feel like I’m good enough for any girl on the planet, like I have nothing to offer in terms of looks and other things. It’s even worse that I don’t have any friends at all in my life, so outside my parents I’m socially isolated. I feel like social anxiety and my utter social ineptitude has ruined my life. I’m also 5’8 and have never been in good shape at any point in my life and have had a hard time with my weight (I’m 230ish rn) due to a complete lack of discipline and a somewhat picky diet. I also haven’t been back to school in a while, have been unemployed since November 2019, and still live with my parents. Basically I feel like a massive failure. And I feel like my own neuroticism prevents me from trying to better myself. 

Never having a girlfriend sucks. It’s super lonely to never have someone who loves you to spend quality time with. It’s not just about getting laid.

And even with all that I feel like my complete inexperience with women only makes me even less desirable. I can’t imagine many women wanting to be some mid 20s or older guy’s first. Which is partly why I lament missing out on teenage love so much. Probably doesn’t help that I was watching some romcom anime and reading manga that made me feel worse. Especially when there was sex and virginity loss involved (these aren’t hentai, fyi but sometimes some of the stuff I see on r/wholesomehentai makes me feel awful and lonely). Horimiya and Kaguya-sama: Love is War being examples (both main couples, in high school, make it official when they finally have sex). It’s not just the sex part that triggers my depression in this (things like kissing, cuddling, holding hands, or simply seeing close friends have memories together also kills me inside), but the sex part is the worst since I view sex as the highest showing of affection and intimacy between couples, and I have always wanted to do it with someone who loves me and I have a connection with. I wish I could have lost it with another virgin that I was dating so we could be each other’s firsts and explore together. Especially since now my inexperience is something I feel like if I ever have a chance with a woman at this point, I’ll have to lie about it. It’s all reminders of missing out on young love in high school and college, reminders of how alone I’ve been for so long. Missing out on young love is something that has felt like a tremendous loss in my eyes. Hell not only anime can upset me but also other forms of media showing romance (Stranger Things for example made me upset when I saw the entire main cast start dating at like 14), or seeing couples, or reading posts on this very subreddit.

It’s just something that makes me feel sad, not ever having a sexual romantic relationship with a girl who loves you to pieces. And I often feel like it’ll never happen.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfpcfr/nearing_25_years_old_never_had_a_girlfriend_still/

I was seeing this guy for a little (4 dates in the span of a month), and he just recently ghosted me. I did see some of the signs coming, since he began to lessen contact after our third date (where we had sex). But in the week he ghosted me, HE was even the one to bring up on his own 'So, when are we seeing each other again?', and saying things like how I should see his new office - things that, to me, indicate some interest and a desire to see me again. This, along with the fact that I really felt like I connected with this guy are really messing with my head and lowering my self esteem. I know it ultimately doesn't reflect on me, but all I can think about is what I could've done wrong.

I know things are over, and I also know that I probably idealized him and the possible relationship in my head. I know I should go on some more dates (and have begun to talk to people on apps again), but I just feel like when I do this my head won't be in it, and I won't even enjoy myself or get to enjoy the other person. But, I also don't want to wallow in my own self pity. 

So, I was wondering if anyone has been through something similar - why do people do this? :( - and if so, what you think I should do. What has helped you get over someone who you never even had a defined relationship with?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfpdam/tips_to_get_over_a_nonrelationship/

95,nfpjw8,1621380278,"Believe people when they say ""I'm not looking for a relationship""","""I'm not looking for something serious"" and ""I'm not looking for a relationship"" are phrases I have heard many MANY times from past people I have gone on dates with. 

However, its as if what they said went in one ear and out the other. I have been guilty of trying to change them and convince them that they actually wanted a relationship with me.

That has never worked. When someone tells you this, you should take their word for it and move on. If you are interested in a relationship and they explicitly have told you that they are looking for something casual, it's not your job to try to change their mind.

No matter what I do, what I say, what I wear etc, they wouldn't change their mind. I have wasted countless nights crying over someone who had no interest in being in a relationship with me. 

If you're in a similar situation and you want a relationship, I would definitely advise you to listen to their words and actually believe them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfpjw8/believe_people_when_they_say_im_not_looking_for_a/

99,nfq7ks,1621382134,Do you think she might be cheating or being disrespectful or just friendly?,"So she has been working with this guy for around a year now. He is aware she has a boyfriend. It started off with light flirting but then she switched to working in his department and things changed. She is around him a lot, people constantly see them giggling with eachother and they tease and banter often. She added him on social media and they dm eachother sometimes and texting increased (gifs, banter, flirting). Coworkers noticed she touches him playfully by holding his hand or playful pushes. He touches her face and etc. She gives him lifts to his home sometimes and even gives lifts to his car.  


Not sure how to approach this. i am bf.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfq7ks/do_you_think_she_might_be_cheating_or_being/
