0,pbpv87,1629943401,Should I cut my losses??,"Today I had my back go out and can barely get around.  I run 40+ miles a week and am overall healthy.


So, my GF who I‚Äôve been dating 4 years on Friday has been pressuring the hell out of me to get engaged.  Well, I have a 16 year old and she has a 16 and 18.  I suggested we wait til the kids leave the nests and then move in together.  No Way!   She wants a ring.

Then I suggested we move in together now and get a place big enough for all the kids.

No Way - she wants a ring.

So, today I throw my back out and it is very rare for me to not be active daily.  I have a pretty high pain threshold.   I‚Äôve run mountain races up to 40 miles in the snow and muck.

She barely acknowledges the fact that I can barely get up to even go to the bathroom.   Other friends are offering help and asking what they can do.  Does she?  Nope.

Am I supposed to even consider marrying a girl that has that little care or empathy?

More background.  I do a lot with her kids (they need a male roll model) and a lot of heavy lifting for her.  Mulch, move this, fix this, etc.

I‚Äôm giving way more than I‚Äôm receiving and this may have been the straw that breaks the camel‚Äôs back. 

Am I overreacting??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbpv87/should_i_cut_my_losses/
1,pbpyak,1629943690,"28 years old, still making the same mistakes","It's this girl I like, but thing is there's always a girl I like, never a girl I'm dating. I try so hard to stay out of the friendzone, but it's like everytime she comes around, it's like she tries to size me up to put me there. There was a huge party last night, a lot of people we knew came through, and she tried to hook me up with a girl that I don't really have any interest in. Not only that, after the girl got drunk, they tried to get us alone in the bedroom by closing the door, no way I'm starting anything sexual with an intoxicated woman, not only is a heavily intoxicated woman a turn off for me, but engaging in any sexual contact with one is totally wrong. So instead of doing that, I sar down and had a convo with her, and even played a few games of DBZ Xenoverse and 2K(The party was at my place )


The girl I liked came up to me today at work abd asked me how did it go, I told her we didn't do anything abd she looked disappointed. Not to mention the fact that everyone thought I was going to do something with the girl obviously felt like I can't get a girl unless she's been drinking which made me angry and hurt me pretty bad.

Literally just about every girl I've been attracted to or interested in has either ended up with me being rejected, or friendzoned. Tell me why one my friends grabbed a bottle of wine earlier and asked the girl I like does she like wine (he saw her bring her own bottle last night) and she did a happy scream and ran towards him. (I rarely drink)

Last night a guy we know from work came to the party and she gave him a huge hug, I haven't gotten one from her yet, she always keeps our interactions distantly friendly. This is gonna sound crazy, but I actually get mad at myself when I'm interested in a woman, I ask myself what's the point, I'm so burnt out trying to date, especially actually wanting to have a family one day",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbpyak/28_years_old_still_making_the_same_mistakes/

He agrees to pick me up at 7pm so at 530pm I texted him to confirm the time and he never replies, no biggie. I went to shower and check my phone at 6pm. Still no reply so I send a follow up text.

4,pbqdok,1629945193,I experienced a Pelotonsexual,"I bough a Peloton a couple months ago and would post to my Instagram story after a workout sometimes. This girl (who I had expressed feelings to in the past) would respond to them and would usually lead to a solid conversation. One day out of nowhere she asked if I wanted to get drinks. I of course said yes and things went pretty well from there. She would come over all the time and would use my Peloton and thought nothing of it. Typical dating stuff I suppose. After 3 months she got in really good shape and just as quick as she slid in my DMs, she went back to her supposed ex-boyfriend. 

I quickly realized I was used for my Peloton. 

In the end, it wasn't too bad because she bought food every now and then. And the wear and tear in my bike is probably nothing. Just sucks because I thought it was going pretty well.

I got to the restaurant and opened the app to let him know I was there and noticed he had unmatched me. I immediately recognized this was a red flag, but what could I do? I was already there.

As a female it‚Äôs been easy to get dates but after going out with 8 different guys I still haven‚Äôt found anyone I‚Äôm compatible with and it‚Äôs getting to the point where i don‚Äôt even want to try anymore. 

It‚Äôs been bad date after bad date where there‚Äôs been zero chemistry, our lifestyles are not compatible at all or just weird ones‚Ä¶ like the physician who offered me drugs and the engineer who kept ordering the most expensive items and then made me split the bill down the middle‚Ä¶.

I‚Äòm new to online dating so Im not sure if this is typical or if I‚Äôm doing something terribly wrong. The guys Ive been seeing are well out together on paper and have professional careers but nothing seems to be working out or they turn out to have some sort of drug/alcohol/emotional issue. I do chat with them a little bit before meeting but the conversation is generally light. Maybe I should be better about asking questions and screening?

Im a put together person, have my life together, earning a good living, and own a home, but maybe I‚Äôve gotten to old to have a decent dating pool.

50,pbvf6f,1629967247,"First date was ok, wtf am i going to do next?","So, for context, I'm a teenager, met a girl who knew a friend of mine on instagram, at first I just messaged her because I saw an interesting drawing on her story, and I told her it was nice and she was good at drawing. Surprisingly she responded and a nice conversation started, I actually enjoyed talking to her, in a platonic way let's say.
The thing is, it's probably in my nature, but I had witty responses that made her smile( as she said later).
After that, a few texts in she starts adding ""&lt;3"" in a few messages, then says stuff like ""I ADORE YOU"" as  I learnt later that sometimes she loved texting with caps only. Not a problem for me, It's ok, i end the conversation on a positive note and then i see after a few minutes she adds me to her story, and basically added a photo wuth our convos captioned ""this guy made my evening wonderful""
By this time i was incredibly surprised, how? and why? Stupid I was to go with it though, and I started talking to her the next day because she seemed i credibly interested and she gave obvious signs and guess what, I asked her out, she agrees we choose a place everything's fine. Third day she says she has a book which she biught and her mother doesn't let her keep it. She asked if when whe meet she can give it to me, I was ok with it.
Then, she goes shopping, she texts me, says she bought me a gift, by this time,I didn't even know what to expect next, but she bought me a gift, and she was also nice and caring, she had nice personality.
So we meet up, we met up yesterday, we went on a double date with her cousing and her bf, again, I was ok with it no problem. Because of the double date thing we didn't get to talk that much, but we had some nice moments together, we laughed at some jokes, we laughed at her cousin, we laughed with her cousin. It was a nice date, ended with a hug and I felt like she enjoyed it. She even put some photos of us on her story, I did the same aswell. I go home, say it was nice and if she would want to meet up again this time at the mall and she said yes, and that she will talk to her mother. We continued texting a bit and she seemed quite cold, i do not know why, i mean, she looked fine all the day. I end the conversation saying i gotta go, we say goodbye and knowing she likes texting and probably is free acter 2 hours i text her saying what she's up to. She leaves me on delivered, meh, that's it i guess, she'll answer tomorrow she doesn't want to text know
Today she still hasn't answered, maybe she is busy but knowing she's around my age and we have holiday, there's no way she couldn't find at least 3-4 minutes to talk, it's close to 12 o'clock in the day.
The thing is, i do not know what to do with the gifts she gave me, If she doesn't want to meet up again I guess i will just ask her to meet up to give her the gifts back since we hadn't known each other for long and give her the book she wanted to hold me back. 
But...I guess I'l just wait, It's already sad that she has probably lost interest in the space of seconds, or she's playing mind games, but she was very nice, i liked her...

But. 

Last week I made a terrible mistake of suggesting a videocall. He was incredibly cringe. Voice kept shaking which of course can be explained cause he was nervous.  But he had like umh... nasal?? voice. Complete turnoff and it was very hard for me to listen to him and for the first 30 minutes he could hardly say anything just kept kinda giggling nervously...?? When we've been texting he's always been chatty and would made me laugh like constantly but now not?? His looks were also incredibly revolting, couldnt look at him tbh. 

He also showed me his home which was a mattress on the floor (no bed!!), no coffee maker (cause he doesnt have any guests, EVER?), he told me he was in fact quite a loner and had no kitchen table or sofa cause no one ever visits him. And at the same time I felt kinda bad for him, and at same time I found him incredibly .. repulsive. 

The very next day he kept bombing with texts asking if we could videocall again. I dont ever wanna talk to him again.

What do I do? Can I just block him?? I dont wanna block him cause we still had a good connection during the past months when we texted and stuff.

There is this girl i matched on Tinder last year in September (so almost 1 year)  


we were talking for like 2 or 3 weeks, i really enjoyed it and had some fun conversations.

unfortunately we never met because she was really busy with moving houses for her apprenticeship and also family related issues.

After a while we kinda lost each other and stopped texting until 1 week ago.   
She posted a really good picutre of her on her insta story, then i texted her that she looks really good in the picutre and we started texting again.

Yesterday she suggested if we should meet sometime this week and i said im free on Sunday. Im not quite sure on how to approche this meeting as I'm not sure if this is a date or just a friendly meet up. 

Also this is my first time with my 22 years, meeting a new girl on my own / doing something with a girl alone (not in a friends group or smth) and im quite nervous about it.

After an awesome date, when is the right time to ask what‚Äôs next?","I‚Äôve been chatting with a coworker for about a month, and it‚Äôs been fairly good. We‚Äôve gotten to know each other quite well, we flirt and we occasionally hang out for movies, small dates and dinners. We text very often, and it‚Äôs the typical type of flirting where we obviously like each other but float around saying it with texts of appreciation, suggestive emojis and gifs. It‚Äôs silly but fun.

We had a really good date the past weekend where we really opened up about our past relationships and what we look for in a person. Although it was a very good time, neither of us brought up the possibility of dating each other, and we left the night casually. I‚Äôve been kicking myself for not just pulling the trigger and going for a kiss or just straight up saying how I feel.

As silly as this sounds, I wonder if a month is enough time to admit how I feel, or if we need more ‚Äúserious‚Äù dates like that one under our belt. I obviously like them and wonder if they not only feel the same way, but would consider being more than friends. I feel silly saying that because as a 30-year-old, I‚Äôve already done this kind of thing before, but it‚Äôs been a little easier in the past where in those situations, we were more up front about our intentions, whereas this started a little more causally.

So I guess my question is, after one really good date, what‚Äôs the protocol: should I try to get to know them a little more, or drag this on a little further?

60,pbwzdl,1629974765,Red Flags in Men ( or any gender ),"
My post about red flags in women yesterday, (requested by another user), got a lot of attention, and I was asked multiple times to make a list for men.  Again, *this list can apply to all genders, but sometimes people comprehend things better when written from the sexual orientation they understand*.  Every situation is different, and not every red flag necessarily means a relationship is doomed.  Some things are fixable, but this is just a general list of common things to watch out for.  I had a **LOT** of feedback on my last list, so I stopped updating it and will have all additions on this one.  Some of the suggestions were more based on preferences rather than red flags, so I left those out.

**If he isn't responding/engaging in conversation** - He's most likely not interested, and if he is, is it really *worth* it?  If he wanted to talk to you that badly, he would.  Nobody will wait days to answer someone they are genuinely interested in.  Sometimes life happens, but they should communicate that with you.

**If he's obsessed with you** - This might seem great at first, but can turn south quick. Codependency is not healthy, and can create a foundation for control, manipulation, and abuse later on.  It's better to have a life outside of your relationship, rather than let your life revolve around it. 

**Always expects you to pay/bad with money** - This one made more sense on the women's list from a traditional standpoint, but definitely still applies to men as well.  Sometimes people are in a rough spot in life, but is it *your* responsibility to pick up his side of the bill every time? No.  Watch what they order, do they order something reasonable, or go right for the steak if it's on your dime?  How do you build a future if your partner lacks financial skills?  How do you feel about being the breadwinner in this situation?  Is he using you *for* your money?  Just stay diligent and be careful.

**My exes are psycho** - This is one to take with a grain of salt, because sometimes people legitimately just have bad luck dating and reading people. But in a lot of situations there's one common denominator and a reason their relationships ended badly. So stay on your toes. 

**He slaps/hits you if he's upset** - This one is a big one especially for women, who are more often victims of domestic violence.  Physical violence is NEVER okay in a relationship, man or woman. If your date/SO hurts you in some way, run. If they do it once, it's likely it will happen again, and could be *much* worse. Not to be confused with play fighting or BDSM in the bedroom, which if consented to by both parties, is okay.  This also applies to safety when driving, etc.  Does he make you feel safe in the vehicle? 

**He makes her mental health your problem** - A lot of people legitimately have mental health issues, but it is not okay to make them someone else's responsibility. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around them all of the time. If they can't handle their emotions on a day to day basis, they have no business being in a relationship. If they ever ever ever say ""if you leave me, I'll kill myself"", run like the wind. Contact police, family, whoever you need to, to get them the help they need. But that's the end of your responsibility. That is nothing but an abuse/control tactic and is never okay. 

**Showers you with gifts and affection, but uses it against you** - This one is tricky. Have you ever heard of ""love-bombing""? Basically, someone will shower you with affection, but use it against you later. ""I did XYZ for you, and you can't appreciate it?"" You didn't ask for it, you don't owe them anything. It's manipulation. 

**Makes fun of you for humor** - He'll joke about your flaws or make rude comments, but say ""babe it was just a joke"". There's always some truth behind every one, and a lot of people will use humor as an excuse to make fun of you/complain about you. If it hurts your feelings, it was probably meant to even though he said it wasn't. Don't encourage those mind games. If it's a one off situation it might be an honest mistake, but if it's reoccurring, run. Again, just like the play fighting, sometimes that is just the nature of some relationships.  If you both make it clear you are okay with that type of humor, that is okay.

**He's always picking a fight** - As much as people like to say ""relationships are work"", they shouldn't be like this. Relationships really should be a source of stress relief. If everything you do is a problem to him, you need to find someone where it isn't. You shouldn't have to fight for a relationship, it should come naturally. 

**He doesn't say what he means** - This one still applies to men. That just means he has poor communication skills and expects you to just read his mind. Nobody is a mind reader, and relationships don't work without communication. I *promise* you that there are men out there who are worth it, *will* tell you exactly what they want. How are you supposed to know unless he tells you? That's not fair to you.  Communication is the key to a good relationship.

**He plays the poor me act"" - Some people are truly down on their luck. But for some they use it as a tool to manipulate you. They just need some help back on their feet, but never seem to actually get back on their feet. They're usually just using you as a meal ticket. Somehow they end up in your home, unemployed, and eating your food, if this happens, run.

**He only talks about his ex** - Sometimes this is unavoidable if they've spent years of their life with an ex. However, this is often a sign they are not over them or might be comparing you to them. You shouldn't have to compete for your partner. On the other hand, I do want to add that sometimes your partner may have been the victim of abuse.  They might have some unresolved trauma from past relationships, and that can be hard to get over if they aren't having any outside help.

**He isn't consistent** - Some days he's super interested, and other days he's not. He might be working, might have other commitments, but watch for patterns. If he's hot and cold all of the time, you might not be the only one on his radar.  What kind of job/other commitments does he have? If he does have other commitments, are you okay with working around those?  He should be communicating with you when he's going to go cold for a while.

**He has cheated, or indicates he has cheated in the past** - If your partner has cheated, there is a very good chance they may do it again.  A lot of cheaters just become sneakier once caught, and will tell you whatever you want to hear to not lose you.  You can never fully erase that memory from the relationship.  If he cheated in the past, what were the circumstances?  Use your best judgement, people do grow and change, but some never will.  If he cheated on someone *with* you, use caution.

**He doesn't hold himself accountable for his actions** - For example, (using an experience I had), he borrows your car and locks the keys in it.  You don't have a spare.  He suddenly makes it *your* fault that this happened because there is no spare, and it's now *your* responsibility to fix the problem.  That is not okay.  Make sure they understand when something is their fault, and take responsibility for their actions.

**He tells you he is a ""nice guy""** - Usually nice people don't have to tell you they are nice, they just show you.  Someone telling you they are a good person, usually are trying to *convince* you that you are.  Be cautious.

**He doesn't respect/respond to boundaries** - Boundaries are *soooo* important in a relationship.  If you set clear boundaries and he violates them, reevaluate that relationship.  Your partner needs to respect what you are and are not comfortable with, and there should be no ""compromise"" on that.  If he truly cares and respects you, there should be no issue.  Once boundaries are crossed, that opens up the stage for abuse later on.

**He lies about little things** - It can start with a little lie here and there, but can quickly snowball into bigger and bigger lies.  Lying is not okay, relationships need to be built off of trust and communication if they are going to last.

You might be thinking, well how do I find a man that doesn't have any of these red flags? If it were easy, everyone would be in great relationships. But it's not.  Sometimes you need to sift through *hundreds* of men before you find him. (Different populations use different types of dating sites). It is not worth dating someone who doesn't give you the love and affection you deserve. Again, this list does not include *all* red flags, but just some major ones I see come up a lot. 

I can't link anything here, but look up different types of emotional abuse tactics. 
Read them, get familiar with them, and save yourself some hurt in the future. 

Remember, you never are obligated to stay in a relationship. Their life is NOT your responsibility. Take care of yourself first. And communicate, communicate, communicate. 

Also, did you find things that *you* do?  Do *you* have red flags?  That's okay!  It's good to recognize faults of our own that we may have.  It's important that we see these and know what to work on in the future.

How I see this is that I may have followed every rule to a tee and said all the right things, and flirted and did the stuff that all the dating advice gave, but the problem was that I was doing all that stuff to new girls I just met. 

I take away two things from this:

1 - Timing - you have to get to know someone before you ever try to make moves on them, not just because they were a cute female that crossed your path - why cold approaches tend to fail

2 - Frequency - if you are trying to game every girl you meet into dating that‚Äôs pretty bad as well no matter how charming or kind or good at conversation you would be

So recently I started going to the quiktrip by my friends house. I usually get the same thing and noticed a new girl. Me and my friend ordered my sandwich and when I got it she was smiling. And asked which one of us ordered the food . 

I told her it was me and she said the food was bussin and she made it . And that she put love in it . My fiend told me after it looked like she was flirting with me .

That was actually our first encounter .

Next time I came in and I didn‚Äôt order anything just came to get a drink and she saw me and said hey super happy like. 

I see she has a nice personality but shes makes food for multiple people daily didn‚Äôt wanna jump to conclusions. But I‚Äôve never had that happen to me at quiktrip.

Recently when I came in she saw me ordering and walked up to me . Then asked me what are you getting? Same thing? With the same smile. 

I said yes and ordered another sandwich . I came back and she handed it to me . Then said next time just order it . Don‚Äôt even worry about paying for it I got you .

I told the same friend because he didn‚Äôt come this time . And said it seems like she‚Äôs trying to get my attention . I could be wrong but she never gives him free stuff. Even when he comes with me or goes alone .


I came back and it was a little busy . She asked what I got and she made me 2 sandwiches this time .

At this point it could be obvious but I think hella hard about everything lol. I was thinking next time I come to give her my number .

Do you think she‚Äôs just being super nice or trying to hint to me?

Not looking for anything serious, I thought Tinder would be a good place to find casual contacts. As such, I move fairly quickly to meeting up, and if there is real life attraction, go to his or mine. 


Now, the issue is, somehow I attract people who want to talk about their childhood issues, have my advice on their mental health problems, want me to help talk them through a tough spot at work, usually very quickly into me meeting them. I also find that some men want someone to take care of them, or even worse, start talking about future kids 2-3 dates in (as in how our kids might look like, not kids in general).



I am the common denominator, so what am I doing wrong that I‚Äôm inviting such intimate (in all the ways I‚Äôm not looking for) conversations? How do I keep things casual?

so is it a fair assessment that..

it doesn't matter if all the guy goes after all the pretty girls. it matters that she chooses him. and from her anecdote it seems guys that approach her are consider unsuitable. so that made me ponder, do women know who they want right off the bat just by eyeball, and it is just a matter of time that either he comes to talk to her, or  she play coy and get to know this guy before having anything serious with him?
