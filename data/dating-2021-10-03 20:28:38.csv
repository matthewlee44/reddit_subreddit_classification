1,q0vgq1,1633310991,Am I doing something wrong? Advice is Appreciated!,"Hey everyone, my name is K, I am a 38-year-old male, who has been separated for almost a year. My ex and I have agreed to this separation and both feel that it was better for us. We are only keeping it a separation due to financial situations at the moment that we are not able to handle at this time. We do support that if we do find ""other partners"" that we would like to marry, that then filing for divorce of course has to be done. But for ourselves we do not want to pursue a reconciliation. We were married for 14 years and have known one another for over 17 years so we just parted on friendly terms. We share our 12-year-old daughter, who lives with her mother in another city, 3 hours away, and I get to have her stay with me every other weekend or sometimes longer depending on our schedules. I am currently a full-time student that is completing a Bachelor‚Äôs in Mechatronics Engineering (1.5years left), but if I decide to pursue a Master‚Äôs would be 2.5 years. I am not the typical untraditional student. I do work to support my lifestyle and provide for my child, have a house, car, trucks, and motorcycle and such.

Been trying to get back in the dating scene after 17 years, and holy shit have times changed! Tried going to malls, Sam‚Äôs Club, or Costco, because I don‚Äôt drink or hang out at bars. I know like attracts like but it is hard to find women who are into my lifestyle Hunting, fishing, camping, shooting (lots of guns and a conceal carrier), mechanic, tattoo artist, candle and soap maker, mixed martial artist, and whatever else you can think of. I do not think I am better than anyone else, I just work hard to get what I need and have. If I need something done, I get it done. Anyways, I‚Äôve been told by women they are always in a relationship, typical response! I then tried online dating since I met my ex on Match, but that‚Äôs even worse. Found one gal I am interested in, named Kris. She didn‚Äôt have a subscription but posted that she worked at a flower shop that I was familiar with.

One day, I built up the ‚Äúcourage‚Äù to stop in at this flower shop after a doctor appointment. She wasn‚Äôt there, because I just missed her going to lunch, but left my number with a gal there. Surprisingly, she texted me! I told her that I saw her profile on Match and that she mentioned she worked there, and thought I would stop in, but I missed her, which was a bummer. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here now!¬†üòä¬†Till 5‚Ä¶‚Äù, I then added, ‚ÄúAwesome! Can I come visit you? Didn‚Äôt know if you were free, and didn‚Äôt want to intrude.‚Äù, she: ‚ÄúSure! If we get busy, I have to work though‚Ä¶‚Äù Of course, I understood that. I lastly said, ‚ÄúNo worries‚Ä¶I‚Äôll stop by in about an hour.‚Äù I had a meeting. I went and met her and I thought we had a nice introduction where we began talking about how we hated online dating, then of course, a customer walks in trying to get flowers for a gal he liked. The guy was trying to figure out what to say in the card because he was trying to be a secret admirer‚Ä¶he was old by the way. I tried helping him out with his message and then finally after a long wait he was leaving thinking the flowers were going to be delivered. Kris came back out asking if he left and I said I believe so, she said crap I need to tell him that we are not able to deliver these. I asked if she would like me to go stop the guy real fast because I knew which vehicle he was in, she said yeah, so I ran stopped and she handled that issue. After she cam back in and said that she was sorry, but she had to get back to work because she had some orders to get done. I said that was cool, but also asked if she would like to go get some dinner after work. She said that she could because she had to get home to her kids. I then said if she had time this weekend, and she said that maybe I need to find a reliable babysitter because her teenage daughter is kind of flakey. I said that‚Äôs cool and I understand, because I too have a daughter that does that. I went home, waited an hour and texted her saying how nice it was to talk to her briefly and how she interacted with people. I now know I made the mistake of offering to take her to lunch some time if it is more convenient, after watching your video! Mentioned that I hope our schedules agree soon so we can speak again, and that if she wanted to text me that she can or call whenever. Told her, ‚ÄúTalk to you later.‚Äù Then on Sunday, I texted her, ‚ÄúGood morning! How was your week? Hopefully, it wasn‚Äôt too busy‚Ä¶‚Äù No response, which I figure she is probably either busy or ignoring, but I never assume. I was just going to let it ride out and probably stop in at the flower shop on Friday like I did after my doctor appointment just to get an honest vibe.

Or should I not, and wait longer? Please any overall advice would be greatly appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0vgq1/am_i_doing_something_wrong_advice_is_appreciated/
2,q0vjgf,1633311269,I need a little help with my approaching,"I see a lot of post like this but I wanted to put my own experience on here to maybe get some advice. I was so happy about the last post I made most people were very kind to my question. 

I have a bit of an issue approaching women. The first problem is my schedule. I am a full time uni student and also working full time in order to pay for each semester so as not to have student loans. So far this is going great because I have no loans, the issue is I have no time in my day for social activities. For example my Monday consists of classes from 8-12 traveling to then work out at the gym, then heading to my job and working until 10pm. Once I get home it's time to shower and complete my assignments before heading off to bed to start again. The weekends would be a great time to approach but considering a lot of my interest aren't that popular with Americans in general let alone women it wouldn't really be much good. I live spending the weekend watching F1 and IndyCar for example but I don't like football or basketball. I am not a drinker and I don't like (nor can i) dance so partying isn't my thing either. 

Here is where the question comes in. I have a gym partner she is very kind and we workout together. The thing is I met her at the gym at 11pm on a weeknight and when we met we were the only two in the gym. Now I have read many times here that women HATE being approached at the gym unless they are not pressed for time and are finishing up their workouts. The things is since that is the only public place I go to on a daily basis and there are plenty of women that frequent the gym what do I do. Do I try to approach them knowing that it might be the only chance me and this young lady come to the gym at the same time? Or do I leave it be and just continue my lack of success on old. 

I feel that my hobbies would be well received in every country but the USA like my love for Dubstep and my love for F1 and WEC. But sadly I feel like I was born in the wrong country üòÖ

Also I should add if you haven't see my last post that I am a natural body builder and a black male at that so I find it quite shocking that the young lady I did meet in the gym didn't call the police on me. 

I also should say that I get super nervous when approaching women because I am a person that likes to make everyone around me happy and comfortable so that thought of having someone upset at me really keeps me from doing anything sometimes. 

So much more I could add but I hope everyone gets what my delima is. I also hope I have not offended anyone because that is not what I am trying to do.

Tldr: super busy schedule and hobbies that don't really lend to social setting in my country. The gym seems like a good place to meet ladies since many frequent the gym but most women here say that it is a big no no.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0vjgf/i_need_a_little_help_with_my_approaching/
3,q0vl6j,1633311449,Why am I fantisizjng about a future with someone I barley know?,"I (F25) has been with Joe (M31) for 4 months. It started off casual but has turned into much more. We met each other‚Äôs sisters, multiple sleepovers a week, are exclusive etc. 

My two other serious relationships were abusive and toxic. So joe is like a breath of fresh air. He makes me feel safe and secure. I love spending time with him. I objectively know that this is still a very new relationship and we are still getting to know each other. However, emotionally I am imagining a future with him (moving, having kids etc).

4,q0vq8r,1633311963,Should I not have asked why she doesn't want to have sex?,"So I recently got together with a girl that I had been friends with for a while. We were at my place and we were just talking and having a good time. Soon, we're making out, and she starts giving me head. Eventually it escalates to us in bed, no pants on. However before anything continues, she tells me she doesn't want to have sex, to which I respond are you sure and she says yes so I say okay, without giving it much thought. So I just start kissing and fingering her for a bit. But after giving it some thought I got kind of curious about why she didn't want to have sex after all the foreplay that we did and if it was a problem I could fix or anything, so I asked why she didn't want to. Note, I know she is not obligated to do anything more, just because of what we already did and I respected her choice, but I was just a bit confused. She got really upset and stormed away, saying she shouldn't even need a reason, or ""one percent of a reason"", to not want to, and had me drive her home. 
However, rewind to a couple weeks ago, when we were hanging out together alone, we were on the topic of sex and I told her that I had never really felt comfortable giving a girl oral, but I would eventually warm up to it, to which she not only questioned me about why, but also made fun me for it and made fun of me with other mutual friends of ours, but I didn't really mind and things went on as normal. I didn't think I was wrong for asking why, especially since she's done the same, but I still tried to talk through it and make sure everything was okay but she doesn't want to talk it through at all and keeps calling me foul for what I did. Am I in the wrong here or is she being a hypocrite?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0vq8r/should_i_not_have_asked_why_she_doesnt_want_to/
5,q0vq9e,1633311965,"I‚Äôm 25 (M) and I‚Äôve never gone on a date or been in a relationship. I think I want to, but envisioning myself as a dating man is something I cannot fathom.","Back when I was 17 I found a girl from high school attractive and fun, and I tried to flirt with her, and overtime I got the unspoken, non verbal message ‚Äúno.‚Äù That‚Äôs okay, and I‚Äôm over that, but looking back I realize that my attempts to flirt with her were awkward and cringy. I honestly hope she didn‚Äôt think of any of our interactions as creepy. That wasn‚Äôt my attempt. 

Anyways, all my friends are getting engaged, getting married, having children, and leaving the area in all different directions and states, and I‚Äôm starting to realize how lonely adult life can be for single people most days.
The problem is that I seriously can‚Äôt envision myself with a girlfriend. It‚Äôs like envisioning me as suave, classy businessman who is confident in his personality, looks and abilities.  
I get self conscious about a dozen things when interacting with people I desire to impress, and this doesn‚Äôt even mean ladies, just people at work or in group activities. 

It‚Äôs so hard for me to actually imagine having a woman in my life who accepts me for who I am, my struggles with mental health, and my insecurities. I try to imagine a man who‚Äôs confident in his ability to kiss a girl or take her on dates, but I honestly don‚Äôt know that form of ‚Äúme‚Äù, obviously because it doesn‚Äôt exist yet. 

I just would like advice because I can‚Äôt help but get depressed when I look on social media at all the happy friends of mine that have made their whole world their relationship and seem genuinely happy with that- and it makes me feel that I truly missed out something valuable or possibly even essential. 

I don‚Äôt want to come off creepy or cringy when flirting with girls nor do I want to burn bridges with women friends because I asked one of them out and she says ‚Äúno‚Äù and now things are awkward between us‚Ä¶

My brother has been trying like crazy to find a girlfriend and continues to be rejected and honestly, that level of dedication only to be dropped over and over again makes me nervous about trying the whole online dating thing, but not sure how else to meet girls who are open to going on dates.

6,q0vqhx,1633311988,27M - I would really appreciate some feedback,"I have been trying dating apps for a long time. I get a majority of my messages from bots and any matches I do get disappear within the week. People are slow to respond but asking for a phone number because of these shitty apps is somehow ""too fast."" I literally don't understand that because we are talking on a dating app which is on your phone, I see your name and location, besides the fact we were already talking when I ask for the number. Little side rant there.

I don't feel like I take good pictures at all and don't know how to really update a good sense of fashion. I would like some advice if this is even my problem or whatever but idk.

I feel really weird going out to bars and stuff by myself. It's always like people stare me down like I'm the weirdest, creepiest person alive and I'm just out there nervous as fuck that people keep staring at me. Lol So I guess I should just get out more but I have been wanting friends to go out with for a little comfort. I have some good bar games I think would be fun to try if anybody would be interested from this post. I am living in Orlando FL where I just moved last month. :)

I really don't know what is going on though. I ask a woman on a date, she says yes, and I offer a day and place to go. Then they start to act like I'm a creep. Or they open my message asking for a date and then ghost me even after we have the ""what are you looking for"" conversation and we both want to date.

I actually just had somebody block me because they said being a fan of manga/anime is really important for them. I was explaining how I haven't had tv service for a long time but I have been wanting to watch shows for a long time. Another side rant, the anime/manga community is surprisingly quiet whenever I ask for a show recommendation which is a separate annoyance.

Ugh, I am just struggling a lot and I don't know why nobody wants to talk with me. I don't feel like I ever show frustration with people or that I'm too weird. Saying that I haven't been able to watch any type of shows in over a year because I have been working 2 jobs doesn't seem like something to block a person over but it happens to me at least twice a day. I really only get frustrated after the profile just disappears at the most random times so I don't think it's how I speak to people.

My chats are normally pretty good too I would think. I try to avoid one word answers and be open. As an introvert, this is really difficult and people that keep saying ""life of the party!!!"" love to respond with yes, no, idk or whatever so chats are sometimes really hard for no good reason. I can get not being interested in me, but why bother messaging me if you can't fake interest?

One girl was met off a dating app, went on a date, and had sex at the end of the night. I enjoyed her personality and a day or two later began texting her more. Her verbage got really slow and stale so I stopped texting her. The end.

Next girl I met out at a bar in town. Hit it off went to multiple bars. Kissed a lot exchanged numbers and went our seperate ways. She texted me and we had good conversation and had plans to go out on a date. Something came up a few days later that made it not possible for her to make it we suggested a week later would work better. Again, our conversations began to degrate and again, the end.

9,q0vuvw,1633312445,I shot my shot with a girl in my class and she laughed in my face and said ‚Äúof course not‚Äù. I think this was my sign to give up on dating.

But I‚Äôve never had this happen to me.

So I asked this girl I had class with out today. I asked her if she wanted to go to the Starbucks on campus to grab some coffee and study together. 

She laughed in my face. Like full on head back eyes closed laugh. I think I‚Äôm a funny guy but nothing I‚Äôve said has ever made a person laugh as hard as the notion of me asking this girl out made her laugh.

After she picked herself up off the floor after my hilarious ‚Äújoke‚Äù she said of course not. And continued laughing. 

It was incredibly painful. Like I know rejection is going to happen if I keep trying to date but if this is what most experiences are going to be like for me I can‚Äôt handle this.

In the last few months I've been randomly out in public and just run into a girl working somewhere. Met a charming southern girl while traveling and talked to her for literally a moment. All she did was tell me they were closing at a certain time and that was it.

I had a feeling like I thought she a pretty, clean face, liked her personality being rural and country, and like she was educated. It wasn't any sort of lust, more like I would like to stop and talk to you more in a friendly way. But not to just be a friend or something, a little more.

A couple of times looking at videos a similar feeling happened. Just had another thing today where a girl with a pretty face and nice personality said hello to me where she was working. It was like she gave off a positive energy similar to above because she had a pretty face and a very warm southern personality. I notice a lot more intensely like personality, how nice their hair is arranged, eyes, pretty face.

What is this? I've never had experiences like this before and don't know what they mean. It's foreign to me.

The best way I can put it is it's like I'm drawn into their face and or personality without explanation even when it's a video when they're talking. There's no sexual lust at all, it's more like a a heaviness to it like I'm breathing in air or something. It's like someone put on their perfume and I noticed it without any scent existing.

22,q0wwzk,1633316338,Is there something wrong with me? (23m),"Quick run down of my dating life. I‚Äôm a straight male, pretty successful at being able to get dates, I want to find a partner and I have a pretty good idea of what I‚Äôm looking for. My career. I just started working in the field I wish to peruse and have a great drive for it. It takes up a lot of my time and trying to make room for dates because I don‚Äôt want to be alone and want to share life with someone.  

Now. I get these dates and the girls are usually into me. Yet I find myself so many times not wanting to make a move. Tonight. Had a movie date, 3rd date with this girl. I just didn‚Äôt have the drive to make a move with her. I think she wanted me to. I just felt like I didn‚Äôt want to and as a guy I feel like I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòman‚Äô. I wasn‚Äôt nervous. Just didn‚Äôt feel chemistry.  

Is not a one time occurrence. Happens more often than not. Girls interested heavily in me and here I am not making moves. It‚Äôs hard to explain how I‚Äôm feeling. I just see other guys go on dates and if they like them or not make moves. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want to give them the impression I like them if I might not like them. Or I move slow.  

Just seeing if others have similar thoughts or feelings. I‚Äôm not being very detailed so I apologize. I don‚Äôt know exactly how I feel. Just seeing if anyone can relate so I can brainstorm.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0wwzk/is_there_something_wrong_with_me_23m/

I have found myself in another online thing, I doubt it will work out. I know they don't really have much chance working out. Especially if it is another continent. I have had lovers in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.

33,q0xo48,1633319226,Girl I was dating asked what celebrity I thought was most attractive. Trap question? Should I have lied? Should I have been honest?,"We were getting pretty open one night about various topics and she asked me ""Who is your celebrity crush?"" I know, that could mean a few things, but the context we were in was strictly physical attraction.

There's a few ways this could go if this was encountered by another random pair.

* The person named has very similar physical attributes to the girl you're dating.
* The person named has very different physical attributes to the girl you're dating.
* The person named is somewhere between the two above.
* You claim, truthfully or not, that you don't have a celebrity crush.

My situation fell into one of the categories above, but regardless of my experience with this question:

* Guys, what would you have done if they look nothing alike?
* Ladies, what would you have done if your guy named someone who looks nothing like you?
* What if you/he claimed not to have a crush?

I have some pretty base level guesses at what she was looking for, but they range from confidently seeking physical compatibility to hoping for validation. We ended up splitting for other reasons, but this stuck out in my head as an odd question and I'm curious about other perspectives in the different ways it could have played out. I don't necessarily want to tip my hand as to what my situation was because I fear it will just turn into a discussion about that opposed to the more open set of situations.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0xo48/girl_i_was_dating_asked_what_celebrity_i_thought/
34,q0xp06,1633319325,I am looking for advice. Maybe somebody to look over my profiles or go over what I may be doing wrong?,"I have been trying dating apps for a long time. I get a majority of my messages from bots and any matches I do get disappear within the week. People are slow to respond but asking for a phone number because of these shitty apps is somehow ""too fast."" I literally don't understand that because we are talking on a dating app which is on your phone, I see your name and location, besides the fact we were already talking when I ask for the number. Little side rant there.

I don't feel like I take good pictures at all and don't know how to really update a good sense of fashion. I would like some advice if this is even my problem or whatever but idk.

I feel really weird going out to bars and stuff by myself. It's always like people stare me down like I'm the weirdest, creepiest person alive and I'm just out there nervous as fuck that people keep staring at me. Lol So I guess I should just get out more but I have been wanting friends to go out with for a little comfort. I have some good bar games I think would be fun to try if anybody would be interested from this post. I am living in Orlando FL where I just moved last month. :)

I really don't know what is going on though. I ask a woman on a date, she says yes, and I offer a day and place to go. Then they start to act like I'm a creep. Or they open my message asking for a date and then ghost me even after we have the ""what are you looking for"" conversation and we both want to date.

I actually just had somebody block me because they said being a fan of manga/anime is really important for them. I was explaining how I haven't had tv service for a long time but I have been wanting to watch shows for a long time. Another side rant, the anime/manga community is surprisingly quiet whenever I ask for a show recommendation which is a separate annoyance.

Ugh, I am just struggling a lot and I don't know why nobody wants to talk with me. I don't feel like I ever show frustration with people or that I'm too weird. Saying that I haven't been able to watch any type of shows in over a year because I have been working 2 jobs doesn't seem like something to block a person over but it happens to me at least twice a day. I really only get frustrated after the profile just disappears at the most random times so I don't think it's how I speak to people.

My chats are normally pretty good too I would think. I try to avoid one word answers and be open. As an introvert, this is really difficult and people that keep saying ""life of the party!!!"" love to respond with yes, no, idk or whatever so chats are sometimes really hard for no good reason. I can get not being interested in me, but why bother messaging me if you can't fake interest?

After about two weeks of good times this girl asked me to cutt off any connections with other girls and claim her as my girlfriend. I told her no and that if what I was doing was problem then I should end it so no one ends up upset and that we were bound to leave each other anyway. 

So i ended things. But she went NUTS. After I stoped talking to her she blew up my phone, broke into my house while I was asleep. She also watched my house sitting in a car accross the street.

It's been 2 days and I still feel miserable about it. Huge part of it was cause I was being an idiot and kept him from leaving, that was so wrong of me, I feel so bad and really want to kick myself. It's obvious he's not interested cause we didn't exchange number in the end despite him saying he enjoyed tonight (white lies probably). I guess some part of my ego feels a little bruise hence why I'm feeling miserable. 

Told my friends to relay my apologies to him for keeping him after he sent me back, I'm not sure if they did, they just keep on saying don't be silly he thinks I'm nice.

First, she sometimes tell me how I‚Äôm not interested in going out with her or things of the sort ( I have never said anything of the like even though our relationship has started very platonically).       Is this a flatline sign that she is not interested?
Because on the other hand, there is times like it feels like she‚Äôs hitting on me?

Ex: we were talking about coffee sometimes (yes very random) and she said she dosent drink coffee but that I could offer her one (sounds like a date nah?)
Ex #2: Very playful and kinda touchy
Ex #3: Commenting on my style
Idk... I have. Lot of female friends and none do things like that.

I‚Äôm confused and as I‚Äôm interested in her, I just want to know wether or not I should pursue this. Wouldn‚Äôt want to make anything weird.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0zalj/should_i_ask_her_out/
54,q0zb56,1633326048,Dating Chinese Women,"I've been meeting/dating a few Chinese women recently, but having a hard time establishing or escalating physical intimacy with most (3/4).  

The two I have currently gone on several dates with (4 - 5) I haven't been able to kiss yet.  Girl 1 I tried kissing on 2 different occasions, she mumbled something about ""taking it slow"" one time.  She's kind of cold so I'm less interested in her at the moment.

Girl 2 I tried kissing after at the 4th date, but she was not ready for it.  She is warm and caring, and enjoys holding hands, so I'm confident of her interest level in me.  In the longer-term, this would just be a small blip on the radar if we ended up continuing to date.  

**BUT, I'm used to things moving much quicker physically.  I don't think it's unreasonable to be encouraged with her level of interest in me, AND at the same time be frustrated in the here and now.  After she refused the kiss, I told her I think of her as a good friend (which I think kind of flustered her; maybe in her mind she's already thinking of us as a couple, who knows).  Thoughts?**

As an aside, one of the Chinese girls I was originally just friends with wanted to date.  She was plenty attractive enough, but after she told me upfront that it may take her several months before she felt comfortable having sex (she's had a number of sexual partners in the past), I told her we should just continue to be friends, because I would become frustrated and anxious.  We did end up dating, but it did not last long.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0zb56/dating_chinese_women/

57,q102xa,1633329601,For some reason I thought of the worst date I've ever experienced and it made me appreciate my love so much more.,"Back in 2017 on valentines day, my ex and I had been trying to work on our relationship and had planned an awesome valentines day. I made her favorite dinner and bought her flowers and chocolates. I wore a killer suit, not too flashy, but I wore my red dress shirt cause that was her favorite. I shaved my face, got a hair cut, and even wrote her a hand made card. 


She never showed up. Her ex hit her up and asked if she wanted to have valentines day with him, she agreed, and ditched our plans...no word to me till the next day. Then she proceeded to give me some half ass excuse and said she was insistent that we at least sat and talked. So I told her I'd meet her at a restaurant that I liked, an expensive place, alllllll the way across town from where she lived and I proceeded to get high and hit up one of my booty calls. After the girl showed up I turned my phone off and we did our Thang. 


Around 1 a.m I get a really rude banging on my door and said girl and I answer the door together. In our underwear. To see my ex, raging, piss drunk, and scream crying that I was a POS. 


Moral of the story is, even when some one tears you down to your lowest point, things wi get better. I sit here and think about this and I truly realize how thankful I am that my girlfriend isn't like this. That I became better as a person for her and I to have a better life. I'm thankful that she doesn't cheat, and that she would never try to hurt me. I'm thankful that someone saw hope in me when no one else did and I would not be here without her.

74,q12rw5,1633343494,Anxiety and nervousness is holding me back from the relationships I want.,"30M. Had this for years. It's been like this for years and I'm at my wits end about how to deal with it. 
It's always the same cycle: I will meet a girl, either online or through some other means. We hit it off, and it's great. The conversation is flowing, natural, cheeky, and just super fun. We set up a date. The date goes great. Great chemistry, with my partner being super interested, super into it, and everything's great. then it ends and I get home. Realize I'm starting to care about the girl, about how things go, and I freeze up. Completely. 

The chemistry from before disappears because I'm overthinking everything. Conversation is stilted, unnatural, boring, and probably a bit creepy for them. The girl will then either disappear before the second date, or after because of how badly it goes. Because I've started to care about them and want to see them again, so I'm playing everything as safe as possible and desperately trying to recapture what was there before rather than just relaxing and being myself. When I start to get feelings for someone, I pretty much just become a nervous wreck, wasting everything. I'm fine once we're in a relationship, but the lead up to it cripples me. It's like I need constant reassurance from them that they're interested. I don't understand it.

This has happened more times than I can count. I have pushed more girls away like this than I even want to think about. There's only been two women in my life where for some reason I was able to at least keep it under control. The last being 3 years ago. I distinctly remember thinking ""I don't know why she likes me, I'm not doing anything. Oh well, enjoy it while it lasts"", but that's about it. 

The worst part: I do not have this issue with women I do not find particularly attractive or am not that interested in, as I don't particularly care whether they stay or go.
This means I have a string of relationships with women who have thrown themselves at at me, and I don't push them away because I don't care, so it lasts until I end it. Hurting them because I never should have got with them in the first place. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of hurting people and getting hurt. And it's happening again right now. I went on one of the best dates I've ever been on last week. It was fantastic. It felt like we'd known each other for years, we talked for hours, hugged and held hands on the way home. I care about how this goes. I miss her and want to see her again. But it's happening again and I can already feel her slipping away. The openness and lack of pressure and laughter is already gone. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know why I get this wierd performance anxiety and just stop being normal. Had anybody dealt with this? Is there anyway to get past this? I don't want to end up settling for someone I don't love because I can't keep my shit together.

She's funny, smart, kind, cute - I know I like her and I think it's reciprocated, but I can't be sure. Here are the facts:

1. Despite being incredibly witty and having great banter with everyone, me included, she can't take a genuine compliment. I once told her she looked like a female celebrity and all she could do was give an adorable smile and not even look me in the eye.

2. She's comfortable with and even smiles when I touch her or we're in close proximity. One night, we were watching a movie with a few friends and huddled up against each other with our shoulders touching. She didn't budge at all and seemed comfortable and relaxed.

3. She's an absolutely awful texter, but she keeps in pretty regular contact with me through texting despite telling me that she hates it.

4. Within days and at one point even BEFORE we became friends, she told me quite personal stuff about her life, like her relationship with her family, her home life and her past dating life. She even went on to tell me that she uses Tinder as a joke and what her past relationship was actually like. I'd consider her a fairly open person, but this seems a bit much for someone you've only become friends with recently.

5. She compliments me on my looks and personality - she's told me that she thinks I'm funny and that I have 'charm'. Another time, we were jokingly talking about what animals we would be and she said I'd be an otter because otters are 'cute'. 

She really is a 1/10000 type of girl; I'm not scared of getting rejected because I know we'll stay friends regardless of what happens, but I absolutely hate regretting shit.

But it‚Äôs become very obvious to me that he is quite insecure - from more tangible things including a self-admitted ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with gym and his appearance (incl. taking steroids), to constantly reassuring me and over-talking and over-correcting when he‚Äôs nervous or thinks I might not be perceiving what he‚Äôs saying in the correct way. He‚Äôs told me he used to be really insecure, was a huge nerd, and people treated him differently until he got big at the gym. I personally think he still is dealing with those feelings of insecurity. 

I‚Äôm quite confident in myself and I feel like I need a confident man in my life as well, but am I being too harsh on this guy?

I explain that it is rather confusing when she doesn't reply to my texts.  I can see the read receipts and know she got the message.  

I understand she is busy but she could easily take a few seconds to text.  I think she does it on purpose.  She wants to be pursued, but when we have been dating for several months.  When does this immature behavior stop?  

I tried to discuss this with her and she agreed that she is horrible about responding to texts.  I thought we had settled the matter but she continues with the same behavior.  Then she feels like I am the one being emotionally unavailable.  For example, I moved into a new apartment.  She asked why I hadn't told her about the move.

88,q14vyf,1633352196,Misread the whole situation,"I (37m) had a date yesterday with a (27f) we have been talking for about a week. We had a small lunch date on Friday. Yesterday I took her for an official date. We met on bumble. 

I did my best to be a gentleman, opening doors and being polite.  I got her flowers, her mom flowers and her daughter a pumpkin. 

I took her to dinner at Ruth Chris, we had great conversation  the entire time. With in the date we setup another date for tomorrow, where she was going to make me a dessert, (she volunteered). After dinner we went to the grocery store to buy the ingredients for the dessert. She found out a week ago that she has celiac, she can‚Äôt eat gluten so we spent about an hour at the store looking for these items. 

I thought we were connecting great. She was laughing and flirting the entire time. (That was my perception anyway) 

We leave the store to go drop her off at her house. We were sitting in my car chatting for a minute. She gives me a look, I thought she was hinting for me to kiss her. She was about to get out of the car, I ask her for a kiss. I didn‚Äôt just go in, I asked her. She covers her face in embarrassment and says she is not ready for that. I made her feel extremely awkward and embarrassed. 

I help her unload the groceries I just bought for her. I wish her well, she gives me a hug and she kisses on the cheek. I drove home in shame and embarrassment. 

For reference, I‚Äôm recently divorced in May of this year. I was married for 11 years and together with her for 15. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I‚Äôm doing. The dating landscape has changed drastically since I was dating. Last night feels like a good indication that I misread signs.

Anyhow I feel embarrassed for misreading the whole situation, especially for making her feel uncomfortable. She is supposed to come over to my place this afternoon, I‚Äôm supposed to be cooking her a gluten free meal and she is supposed make dessert. I feel like the best course of action is to cancel the date, count my losses and move on. 


I haven‚Äôt heard from her since yesterday and don‚Äôt expect to hear from her again. I feel like maybe she isn‚Äôt attracted to me and if that is the case I would rather just go separate ways. Is this worth salvaging? Did I move to quick and fuck it up? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q14vyf/misread_the_whole_situation/
89,q14ytb,1633352466,Does any other guy feel like they were born the wrong sexuality?,"24M kissless virgin here. When I tried dating apps I got zero matches with women, but when I switched to men just to see if I was truly ugly I got dozens of matches. I've been solicited for sex countless times by gay guys but never met a woman who was interested in even going out for a coffee with me. If I was gay I'd have a rich and fulfilling dating life and my chances to meet the love of my life would be multiplied ten fold! But because I'm straight I can't even get touched by the preferred sex.

I've been using an app to get advice on my appearance. I get told I'm a 7-8/10 by men and that they'd love to date me but I get 4/10 by women. Why is there such a massive discrepancy?

I honestly wish I was into men but just the thought of being sexual with another man makes me revolt. I don't understand this life. Feels like I'm being trolled by a higher power.

90,q14zc1,1633352513,On paper I should like her but in reality I don't,"So bit about me - Haven't been in a very long relationship since I was 22, I am now 27.

Between these ages, I've spent a significant time travelling and had many short-term partners. The longest being about 3 or 4 months. Most of them have ended because I find myself not attracted to them anymore and stop putting in any effort, this then obviously causes frustration, arguments and eventually it will just fizzle away. Small things about partners seem to put me off when they shouldn't, like I'm expecting things to always be perfect. At first I'm really into it but after a few weeks I seem to build up reasons in my head why it's not right (travelling distance, appearance, different interests, etc). If this was a one-off then I probably wouldn't have thought much of it but considering this has repeated lots of times I cant help but think there's something wrong with my attitude to relationships as a whole.

I've been in 2 long-term relationships in my life.

The first ended with her cheating on me after a good few months of her clearly losing interest when I was deeply in love. I was about 17/18 and it was all quite traumatic, resulting in me spiraling into a good 12 months or so of depression. I now recognize that it was that typical young love/first love heartbreak situation and now look at it as a sort of learning experience.

My second long-term relationship ended quite badly with a lot of resentment. I was struggling to find time to focus on the relationship whilst also juggling work/studies and training for sports, it got to a point where we didn't spend a lot of time together and the time we did spend together I would be very tired. She would expect me to make sacrifices to my other commitments in order to create more time for her, this wasn't something I was prepared to do and this resulted in a series of arguments and a bad break up. A few months afterward, she then got with a friend of mine which obviously didn't go down very well. They are however still together, so I don't hold any grudges toward them as they are clearly a better match than me and her ever were.

Recently I've met someone new, like the title of the post says, on paper we should be a great match. She has a great personality, many similar interests, similar past, we both have decent jobs/careers, there's good chemistry and there's no real reason why I should lose interest.

But this time around the interested to not interested cycle has repeated in as short as 2 weeks or so. Pretty much immediately after we had sex for the first time. I now find myself not physically attracted to her whatsoever and have no desire to put in any effort to keep it going.

I've thought of lots of reasons why this is happening:

\- Them not being physically attractive enough

\- Them being too nice to me, like I need someone to keep me at arms length to keep me interested? When dating, the times they are clearly not interested I seem to want them more.

\- This ""when I've met the one, I wont lose interest"" idea

\- Maybe I'm gay? Although I pretty confident I'm not.

\- I'm that classic fuck-boy douchebag?

**TL;DR**

**M27 Cant hold down a relationship for any longer than a few months. Loses interest for various reasons. Newest partner on paper seems a good match but I have lost interest very quickly for no good reason, likely due to her being too nice/not attractive enough. Unsure whether I should approach it as an issue with my attitude to relationships or whether I'm just being honest to myself.**

Any thoughts/comments/ideas would be very much appreciated.

have moved back to town? I've heard mixed ideas about this (my friend called a guy a creep, but he wouldn't stop trying to date her for like 2 months after she said no). I also don't want to come off as if I have been stalking them for 2+ years because I definitely have not been.

94,q15reg,1633355200,Can‚Äôt stop thinking of my ex and need to vent. Opinions are encouraged,"I am 29yrs old male, my ex girlfriend is 24. While we were together, her family would make rude/back handed comments to me, on more than on occasion comparing me to her sisters boyfriend, he was clearly their favorite.. these comments would hurt my feelings. When I would address it with my ex gf, she would somehow make it into my fault or tell me that I do not like her family. Her mom caused a lot of problems in our relationship. A few examples, when my ex gf moved in with me, her mom first tried getting me to take their family cat into my home, my mom is very allergic and told them this often (I want my mom to be comfortable visiting my home). After I said no, my girlfriend was very upset with me. A month later, her mom was requesting that we take in their family dog that is 14 years old. To this I said no, my girlfriend again was upset. I then told my girlfriend if she really wants to take in the dog that is her choice. She said no she does not want it, just wanted the option (so why get mad and cause a huge fight?). My grandmother, who was like a second mom to me past away, the weekend of her funeral her mom and boyfriend had a trip planned and requested we watch their two dogs (14 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; 15) years old. I had three relatives staying with me, I declined to watch the dogs under these circumstances, again, I was the bad guy. 

What caused the breakup: her grandma out of state had her 80th bday party. For months my gf and I believed I was invited, finally able to meet her entire family and see where she spent summers growing up, we were both very excited. A month prior to the trip, her grandma says no boyfriends. This greatly hurt me, my grandma had just passed and again, I felt belittled by her family. I was upset and we argued a bit but I let it go. The weekend of the trip, I wanted distance from my ex. She did not allow this, texting/calling all the time. We ended up getting an argument one of the nights (about me not being allowed on the trip), I regrettably said hurtful things and hung up the phone. She did not speak to me for days. She came back home, read a pre typed breakup message on her phone (majority of which was around me not liking her family/getting along with her family), which was clearly written with her mom and sister. She would not allow me to say my peace. 10 minutes later her family showed up to my home with a uhaul and let themselves into my home. When leaving her mom would not let her say bye to me. We have not had communication since that day, mid June. I wish that my ex could have seen my side and have had my back, or Atleast supported me. However, her and her family are perfect and do no wrong, so when I would say anything I was terrible, I could not have feelings. After a while, I stopped addressing the rude comments that were made to me with my girlfriend because it would only cause a fight. I kept them to myself and tried spending little time with her family the last few months of our relationship. This also got me in trouble.. I could not win.. ever. I renovated my kitchen for her (and me, but mainly her, she loved to cook), she would often complain it was taking to long, house was construction zone, not able to go out and have fun because I was working on the kitchen, would not come with me to pick things out for the kitchen. I could not win. I am curious of others perspective of the situation‚Ä¶ thank you for your time and support.

 Anyways, I think I'm moderately attractive. I'm thin but in decent shape and really tall. I'm at least smart enough to get through 100 credits of college and have a 3.5 gpa. I'm pretty introverted and kind of socially anxious so meeting people in group settings is difficult but if it means I don't have to be so lonely I'll do it üòÖ 

I've tried going to bars but I don't really see how you're supposed to start a conversation. Everyone there seems to be there with family or friends already. 

I've tried going to events I really enjoy but they tend to not have many females, and the ones that are there don't look like they want to be bothered by some random guy who's by himself.
