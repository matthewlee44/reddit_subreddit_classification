I’ve been doing online dating for a bit and I do this with every guy were I wonder if/why he’s talking to me. This is a little bit of our conversation.. 

Does anything think he might actually be interested? 
I’ve just been hurt a lot and even with a past guy who literally strung me along for months.. so embarrassed about that situation.. 

We haven’t gone on a date yet because of me and terrible timing.. 

Me: “ You are from SC?! And you Dj, are a doctor and mortgage lender.. anything else? Lol” 

Him: “ Yea I’ve been in Sc most of my life but everyone says I sound like I’m from the north lol.  Not sure how that happened but it’s just my normal voice 🤣. I was a chiropractor for about 10 years and then freaked out during the pandemic, sold my business and switched to the mortgage industry lol.  Been a whirlwind but it was the perfect change at the perfect time for me”

I skipped a bunch of the conversation.. 

Me: “wait, you snowboard? I snowboard as much as I can.. technically I’m not supposed to do that lol.”

Him: “Yes I love snowboarding.  Last trip was to Aspen and holy smokes that place is so amazing.  Why aren’t you supposed to snowboard?”

Me: “I’m sure it was beautiful. I’m pretty jealous! Have you ever been to Breckenridge?. I tore my meniscus. I’m pretty active and I was told to “chill all activities/workouts” so my knee can heal. I’m clearly not listening..”

Him: “Yea Breckinridge once and that was a pretty great trip as well.  I think I might have a meniscus issue too but I just push through it, semi-carefully.  I mean rest is good but the body needs movement too (that’s how I justify it to myself lol). The app says you’re in NY, how long till your back in SC?  And are you having fun up there?”


Me: “I’m back in 2 weeks. My family is here. It’s cold..so no lol. Yea it has! Snowboarded w/the nephews, saw friends and hit my favorite restaurant..can’t complain. What are you up to?’

Him:”I’ve been in Florida for a week with friends. It’s been an amazing trip but heading back home in a couple days.  West Palm is pretty sweet though I love it here.  Anyways definitely let me know when you get back in town we should try to get together ☺️”



Me: “I come back the 14th and I realized I never said that lol. Yes, I’ll definitely reach out to you once I’m back home. “

( I did comment on his trip) 

Him:”Yea I always get antsy to come back home after about a week so I get it.  Try to enjoy it though, charleston isn’t going anywhere”

Me: “Hey, sorry I haven’t reached out I’ve been stuck in NY. How have you been?”

Him: “Lol are you ever coming back!?  I’ve been good though.  Getting pretty busy with work but it’s all commission so I’m not really complaining about it.”

Me: “Lol yes I’m coming back in March! I’m just finishing February here. I deserved that 😆. I had a family emergency so I never thought I’d be here this long. And that’s good that work is going well! Is this a busy season for you?”

I've never had a boyfriend until I was 18 and it was a very dysfunctional relationship. There were good moments where I felt loved, but I ignored a lot of red flags because I was terrified of being alone again. I'm no longer with him, but my luck with dating hasn't gotten better since then.

 I somehow only have the ability to attract the same type of guy over and over; Either guys who are emotionally unavailable or guys who end up taking advantage of me. Besides the first guy, I've never been able to attract guys in real life. I've only been able to match with guys on dating apps, which I guess could explain why I attract those types of people.

 I don't know if I'm physically unattractive or if it's my personality but every time I even make eye contact with a guy, I get the sense that they aren't interested by their social cues. I don't know why I can match with some guys online, but pretty much never IRL. I just don't know how some girls have the confidence to walk up to guys and talk to them. I'm so terrified of rejection and whoever I'm approaching being repulsed by me, or finding out that they are already taken. I know I can't wait around for guys to approach me and I have to put in the effort, but every time I've tried I've just ended up coming off as a desperate loser. 

 I try to go to places where I would have a chance of meeting someone, but I haven't been able to find guys who are available. I can't even fathom any decent guy actually ever loving me. It's almost as if I'm a defective human being who will never be worthy of it. Sometimes I wonder if the reason I can't find a good partner is that I'm not good myself.

I met this guy who I’m actually starting to like .. 

This is a little bit of our conversation.. 

Does anything think he might actually be interested? 
I’ve just been hurt a lot and even with a past guy who literally strung me along for months.. so embarrassed about that situation.. 

We haven’t gone on a date yet because of me and terrible timing.. 

Me: “ You are from SC?! And you Dj, are a doctor and mortgage lender.. anything else? Lol” 

Him: “ Yea I’ve been in Sc most of my life but everyone says I sound like I’m from the north lol.  Not sure how that happened but it’s just my normal voice 🤣. I was a chiropractor for about 10 years and then freaked out during the pandemic, sold my business and switched to the mortgage industry lol.  Been a whirlwind but it was the perfect change at the perfect time for me”

I skipped a bunch of the conversation.. 

Me: “wait, you snowboard? I snowboard as much as I can.. technically I’m not supposed to do that lol.”

Him: “Yes I love snowboarding.  Last trip was to Aspen and holy smokes that place is so amazing.  Why aren’t you supposed to snowboard?”

Me: “I’m sure it was beautiful. I’m pretty jealous! Have you ever been to Breckenridge?. I tore my meniscus. I’m pretty active and I was told to “chill all activities/workouts” so my knee can heal. I’m clearly not listening..”

Him: “Yea Breckinridge once and that was a pretty great trip as well.  I think I might have a meniscus issue too but I just push through it, semi-carefully.  I mean rest is good but the body needs movement too (that’s how I justify it to myself lol). The app says you’re in NY, how long till your back in SC?  And are you having fun up there?”


Me: “I’m back in 2 weeks. My family is here. It’s cold..so no lol. Yea it has! Snowboarded w/the nephews, saw friends and hit my favorite restaurant..can’t complain. What are you up to?’

Him:”I’ve been in Florida for a week with friends. It’s been an amazing trip but heading back home in a couple days.  West Palm is pretty sweet though I love it here.  Anyways definitely let me know when you get back in town we should try to get together ☺️”



Me: “I come back the 14th and I realized I never said that lol. Yes, I’ll definitely reach out to you once I’m back home. “

( I did comment on his trip) 

Him:”Yea I always get antsy to come back home after about a week so I get it.  Try to enjoy it though, charleston isn’t going anywhere”

Me: “Hey, sorry I haven’t reached out I’ve been stuck in NY. How have you been?”

Him: “Lol are you ever coming back!?  I’ve been good though.  Getting pretty busy with work but it’s all commission so I’m not really complaining about it.”

Me: “Lol yes I’m coming back in March! I’m just finishing February here. I deserved that 😆. I had a family emergency so I never thought I’d be here this long. And that’s good that work is going well! Is this a busy season for you?”

I've(35) been chatting to this girl(34), a mother to a 8yr old daughter, for close to 6 months now. We both work at the same company, but in different departments and offices.

We text or call daily, and these usually consist of how's life, some friendly flirting and just the normal random conversation about anything and everything.

Every now and then, I work out of the same office she is in, and we chat and do the normal people interacting with other people thing.

Going back to last year, I was head hunted by another company, and I did what I always do. I called her, and told her that I'm seriously considering it, as it was a great offer (both salary and experience wise). She talked me out me out of it, so I called the company and declined their offer. She seemed  happy that I'm staying.

More forward to earlier this year, there was a job offering at our company for a management position in her department. She was on the fence about applying, but I encouraged her to do so, and even sent across a cover letter, to help her out.
Being close with the senior leaders at our company, I asked them what her chances are, and was told she's got the role, but they just need to ""interview"" her so it's formal. She's still freaking out at this point, but I reassured her, without telling her that she's got role, that it would be fine. Which worked!

Now we move forward to this week, a bunch of folks out her office organised a party for her, and they invited me to come out. Which I accepted.

Now, last night came around and we went out for her birthday, so knowing she's a fan of true crime novels and her daughter loves chocolate, I got her a hard to find book in Australia and a box of chocolates to enjoy with her daughter.
Up to the lead up of the party, we were texting each other, as we normally do everyday. But now this is where it got strange.
When we all met up for drinks, I gave her birthday present and got a thank you.
Now this was pretty much the last interaction she gave me for the night.
Everytime I spoke to her, I would only get a 1 word answer and that was it, but she was chatting with everyone else and giving me the cold shoulder, which is strange compared to all of our other interactions.

As I write this letter, I look back on the time I spent getting to know you. We met on eHarmony, and you seemed like someone who knew what you wanted. You're a career driven woman, you're positive, and you're beautiful. But your beauty wasn't what drove me to you, it was your good heart. You're family oriented, laid back, when you get deep in a conversation I can sense a fire burning inside of you. When you discuss your passions, I can just tell that you feel so alive.

You seemed genuinely interested in me as a person, you were one of the very few who didn't bring up sex hours after we started chatting. I was being treated like a human being instead of a human vibrator, and it warmed my soul. The conversation seemed to flow, and you gave off really good vibes. I was guarded, I had been hurt before and I lost count of how many times I have been lied to. I have been promised the world only to be abandoned shortly after. But I couldn't explain it, you seemed genuine. You asked me for my number before I could ask for yours, it caught me off guard but it was a welcome surprise. I still kept my guard up but I slowly started to let you in. We talked about work, family, our hopes, our dreams. We laughed about our dating failures, had deep talks about our intentions and hopes. We agreed chemistry was there through text, but we needed to meet in person to see if there was a spark in person.

We planned on grabbing coffee on a Thursday, but the weekend before you started to experience COVID symptoms. After feeling things out for a few days you decided to self quarantine and I understood. Better safe than sorry. We agreed to a rain check and you said you'd love to go out another time. The next week we didn't even try to go out because our city was hit by the worst winter storm in years. Two weeks after our original date was cancelled, we agreed to go out for real a few nights later.

Between the day we agreed to go out and the day of our date, your texts gradually became less and less. I figured maybe you were guarding yourself, maybe you wanted to keep the conversations simple until our date so we would have something to talk about. The voice in my head said you may be losing interest, but I figured if you were losing interest you would have said something. You told me how I seemed so awesome and joked I better not be a serial killer. When we talked in detail, you opened up and admitted all your exes cheated or ghosted, I said you didn't deserve any of that, that I would never do either of those things to you and assumed you felt the same. I tried to keep calm leading up to the day, I wanted to keep my feet on the ground while my head was in the clouds but I had...hope...

When the day came, I planned my day around our date: I worked out in the morning, grocery shopped in the afternoon and made sure to leave myself plenty of time to get ready. Just a few hours before, I was cleaning up. I shaved, put on some cologne, and even planned a change of clothes so I could look somewhat nice during our date. It was just coffee, sure, but I wanted to give it my all.

You cancelled about an hour before, said you were having a bad day at work. We're in the same line of work, so I understood. It's busy season, things get stressful. You never quite know what will happen on a given day. You apologized profusely and admitting to ""flaking"" but asked to reschedule for a few days later. I admitted I had to work late on the day you suggested but said if you wanted to talk about it more on that date we could try to work something out after I get off work. After you apologized for the third or fourth time, I reassured you and said I understood.

That was two weeks ago, the last I ever heard from you...

The day came and went, I never heard so much as a word from you. I saw it coming when you cancelled, and I really hoped I would be proven wrong. My friends told me I was overthinking it, that you were serious because you apologized and offered to reschedule. But alas, I was right. You cancelled and then never reached out again. As I write this, I begin to let go of all of the conversations that we had. We had inside jokes and we both opened up a lot about who we are...more than I may have ever opened up before physically meeting a person.

I don't regret meeting you, or messaging you. In fact, I'm glad I met you. Until right before you went MIA you were kind to me, you didn't treat me like a sex object but as a person with emotions, feelings and a life of his own. The only thing that distressed me was that you didn't tell me you lost interest. You didn't owe me a date, you didn't even owe me your time. You're not obligated to go out with me, or to even talk to me. But I deserved an explanation, I deserved to not be led on, I deserved closure. Yes it would have still hurt, it makes me sad when things don't work out the way I'd like...but I wouldn't go to bed feeling like I don't matter. I wouldn't go to bed wondering why I wasn't worth a single text message just to end it.

I'm sorry I wasn't the one for you. I hope you find your person, whoever it may be, and that you are truly happy. I'm going to take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and hope one day I will meet my person and one day this winding road begins to make sense.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159796,public,self,An unsent letter to the woman who flaked and disappeared,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sw172y/an_unsent_letter_to_the_woman_who_flaked_and/,no_ads,0,,,

Overall, went great and he verbalized how much fun he had multiple times. 

Sunday, after the Super Bowl he reached out and asked if I want to hangout and have a chill night. (Wow, only three days later and already wants to see me!! I was excited!) I said sure, grabbed a bottle of wine and went over. We ended up watching 2 new episodes of our favorite shows together and after splitting a decent amount of wine I fell asleep at his.

I left the next morning after some sleepy chitchat and cuddles. A few hours later he sent me a funny video related to one of the shows we watched. (Good sign I thought!) I texted back and suggested that maybe next Sunday we can do the same thing at my place this time. 

No response. Nothing. Nada. Zero. That was Monday morning, it’s Friday night now. What is happening?!

For those of you who don’t want to read the link….long story short, I had an emotionally abusive mother. She never made me feel beautiful, special, wanted, or like I was even a human being worthy of being treated with dignity. In fact, she treated me like the very opposite! And I guess, i am trying to compensate for the lack of maternal love with a loving partner. I try try and try everyday to see something good in myself but I simply can’t. There’s nothing about me that sets me apart from anyone else. I’m not strikingly beautiful, I have lesser than average intelligence due to my brain injury, I’m not very charming, and I have no exceptional talents to wow anybody with. Sooo I always thought that if I can’t see the good in me, maybe a boyfriend could help me see that. I know they say that’s the worst reason to look for love but that’s what my introspection has told me.

And it doesn’t help that the only friends I have are online friends, my dad, and a couple of girls I knew since high school who I hardly get to see or talk to since we’re all living adult lives.

And even if I found a close set of real life friends tomorrow …that would help my loneliness a little bit but I would still be eager for romance because I always found healthy and loving romances more intimate than friendships. And plus, I’ve always been a natural romantic. You can thank Disney for that, lol.

A couple of months ago I moved out of my home town, which was a dream of mine for years. I met this guy through a mutual friend and we instantly got along extremely well. I had never gotten along faster with someone in my life, everything felt so natural as if I had known him forever.

We ended up getting super close, kiss almost every time we see each other, talk on the phone every day, text all the time, and always wanna see each other. Also, he has been hinting that he wants to be in a serious relationship with me and wants me to be his girlfriend.

The problem is that I love him. I seriously love this boy he treats me SO well and makes me feel appreciated and loved. But the issue is he does not meet any of my expectations in a future partner.

He is procrastinating on his career, does nothing want to finish college, has no idea what he is doing with his life, hints that he wants a stay at home wife (but idk if he’s joking or not), and this is gonna sounds crazy but he is not my physical standard either. And I don’t think I’m his as well because one of his friends randomly mentions that he likes curvy women and I’m skinny.

ANYWAYS, I have no idea what to do and it’s scaring me. I’m falling in love more each day even though I know that this is not the type of man I was looking for. I want a smart successful man who I know can be a supportive dad in the future. He’s an amazing person and I’m highly attracted to him so I have no idea that to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27 and can't seem to even enter the dating market. I've done everything that the internet has told me to do. Keep in mind that I have done these things out of interest for them myself, and I continue to do them because I like doing them.

I've learned saxophone, guitar, and some music theory, took on photography with professional equipment (not just a cell phone). I've become a competent cook doing everything from to chicken Tiki Masala to sushi.

I've improved my body. I've got down to 13.5% body fat and put on a descent amount of muscle and visible abs with a full body routine. I'm now going up a bit in an effort to build more muscle.

I've completed my first master's in engineering and am working on a second paid for by my company in a highly technical and well-paying industry. I have my own paid off car, live on my own in a 2 bedroom, fully furnished apartment.

I put myself out there. I´ve used pretty much all of the dating apps. I match with women that I would say are attractive to me, but it seems very very few want to put any effort into a conversation or are interested in dating. I ask open ended questions and follow all the usual online dating guidelines. I´ve talked to people out in public, and most are either in a relationship already or clearly not interested in me romantically. Socially, I´m not bad; there was a time where I meet a group of guys and they paid to take me to the movie they were going to see and another time I met a couple while I was learning to ski and they offered to take me out to a bar and gave me their phone numbers. I have currently active friends that I made throughout my life that are close enough to want to come visit me even after I moved several states away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying that these are my only defining characteristics, but it should at least highlight my efforts and development.

My question is this: what could I be doing wrong? Is there anyone else that has escaped the black hole that is long term single-ness. I believe I've worked on myself physically, mentally, and financially no less than anyone else that has been able to find some romantic success.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159815,public,self,What do you do if you've exhausted everything?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sw3cid/what_do_you_do_if_youve_exhausted_everything/,no_ads,0,,,

My (F, 20s) standards for casual sex are basically someone who’s fit, good looking and a decent person. That’s purely cuz I can’t even get aroused without those things.

However; I’ve been unsure recently whether it’s really the sex I want or something more.

Last week I spent the night with one guy from Tinder. We had been texting for a month and have went on one date before this, and yesterday I went to his place to watch a movie and eventually we had sex. 

I stayed for the night, we cuddled, slept together and fucked in the morning again. 

It’s quite clear that he wants just casual stuff and me to go over to his place whenever we agree on it, and I thought I wanted casual too, until I started “missing” him last night.

I realized I’m definitely not missing the sex but more like the cuddles, sleeping with a muscular guy and the kisses. 

Of course these are not feelings, (because I don’t even know him that well), but it doesn’t sound like a good start to any casual sex situation if I miss the cuddles and sleeping together more than the sex itself? 

Also I’m not sure it I like **him** as a person or just the warm cuddles and someone to lay with. Could be both, but it still doesn’t sound like it could end well.

And if you take a look at my previous posts, you will see how happy I was when I met this girl because I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend for like three years now.
However just today she told me that although I was really kind and fun to talk to when I first messaged her here on Reddit, she also got hundreds of messages from other guys too and it was very overwhelming for her plus the majority of them were pretty nasty.
So today she sent out a text to me saying that she needs some time to herself until she is in a good mindset to talk to me again and that she also just wants to be friends for now until we meet up, I then respected her decision and told her that I will check in with her soon to see how she is feeling.
So yeah I’m definitely in the friend zone at the moment but to be honest I think I can break out of it as I continue being good to her as well as doing some fun things with her.
But feel free to give me advice on that though still.
Also she is definitely really anxious right now and I want to give her as much space as possible but I also want to check in with her often to see how she is doing and I told her I would do so in a couple of days but then I was thinking to myself “actually maybe I’ll do that tomorrow”. So should I?
Overall should I check in every day to see how she is doing?
I just want to know how often I should check.
Another thing that I should really state too is that I’m honestly afraid that she is going to ghost me.

I ask because the last girl I dated must have been with 30-40 people at least and she was a bucket of red flags. We talked about this several times, and, to be clear I didn’t have a problem with all the people she had sucked or fucked before me, it was the fact that all of this… contact with this types of people left her in quite the state. It was sad because she wasn’t even good at sex. She had just been used by so many people she was never in it for physical gratification until near the end. She just kinda laid there. 

For one, she was undiagnosed at the time but she had BPD. She was undeniably the common denominator in all of these relationships, including her prior marriage and she was an expert at playing the victim card at every opportunity. She generally had no idea what her various issues were which led her to blaming me for not only her emotional state when she was raging out but for all of her problems more generally. 

I stayed with her because she had quite a list of redeeming qualities but the anger and frustration she presented was too much. She projected negativity and all of her self confidence issues onto me and it was quite apparent when she was making rampant assumptions about the things I was thinking or going to say. 

For example, I went with her to buy the EV she bought back in 2019. Long story short, the rep quoted her a price incorrectly, she had a text to back up the discrepancy and showed it to me when the rep tried to charge her more when we went in to close the deal. She thought she was somehow in the wrong (no idea why), thought I was going to yell at her (like her father would have) and almost didn’t even show me because she didn’t want an altercation. I very obviously did not yell at her and even spoke to the GM who, through some conversation, eventually honored the price quoted to her. She even said that she thought I was going to yell at her. 

TLDR: Personally… I don’t feel a high body count comes without a certain level of… dysfunction. I’m happy to have this conversation without a barrage of downvotes so please spare us all and engage in a civil discussion.

A bit about me: I currently work full time as a nurse and as a TESOL teacher. I also run my own business (which just started this year).

2 years ago, I moved out but decided to move back with my parents because rent got too high in the city I live in and I got diagnosed with endometriosis (for those of  you who don't know, it is a chronic painful condition and can debilitate you if not detected early). Also, I moved back to look after my dad. 

Whilst living at home, I pay most of the bills &amp; I also save what I earn so I can move out again. I like helping out my parents because they have done so much for me but at the same time I still feel ashamed I live at home. 

On the other hand, my parents love having me back because we have a good relationship and it also means I get to keep an eye on my dad's health but at the same time they want me to find someone and be happy...I guess another thing that has put me off from dating is that I am scared whoever I date will not understand endometriosis.

Have any of you experienced this? What happened and how did it make you feel?

I'm 28M visiting my parents back home after flying in from CA. I'm not in the dating scene because I'm happily in a 3 year relationship with my lovely girlfriend.

Today we (mom, dad, and I), went to a food hall and bumped into a family friend. While making small talk I noticed a group sitting at a table in the distance. One of them caught my attention and on it totally blew me away... And not because of tits and ass or something more sexual but because of her smile and body language. Now, I am generally not a romantic person and I am VERY loyal to my SO.  Frankly I find it quite weird that I'm posting this but I cannot stop thinking about this person.

While grabbing a second beer from the self-serve station, I glanced at her on the way back to my seat and accidentally made eye contact... Again, I'm loyal so obviously the rest of the night I did nothing to engage. Eventually their group left and poof, I'll never know who this person is. She is part Asian, around my age with beautiful black hair. Something about her body language told me so much that I cannot explain without sounding like an idiot creep who simply saw someone who they found attractive. If I had to describe it with one word it would be genuine.

This story is kind of cringe but 🤷 This was very random and I have no idea why this happened. Also, there are probably more (quantity) beautiful half-asian women in CA but nothing like this has come remotely close to happening.
