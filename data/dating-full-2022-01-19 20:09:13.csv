Im feeling insecure because my bf (24m) follows ALOT of females on IG that have only fans and like to twerk all the time. The problem is I (26f) am not built like the women he fantasizes about and I cant dance at all and its an insecurity that has been weighing me down for 2 decades. When he looks at porn he searches for the only fans girls from his IG. Always the same 4 females. And its always videos of them being on top or twerking , basically all the things i cant do with all the women who are better built then me. They are curvy and well within their womanhood, i am not. It really has destroyed my confidence over the years. I cant even get on top anymore because the minute i do my mind run a million miles a minute like “he’s not enjoying it because I’m not doing it like them” or “i must look really stiff and stupid right now” and then i just get discouraged and give up which is crazy cause i never felt like this with any other partner. I use to be wild in bed, now I’m more so a shell of my former self. He is not a very reassuring partner so i definitely don’t want to tell him about my big secret because i know nothing good will come from it and it will be embarrassing. His responses will be something along the lines of “i never said that” or “if thats what u think then ok” or “thats not true” but never words thats really stick or uplift you. Ive tried to talk to him in the past about it but i think it just makes him feel weird and embarrassed. From his POV he says he is a grown man and can look at porn if he wants. He considers the girls on OF porn stars but they are not. They are regular people, some of them are from a city he use to live in. They take photos in regular bra and panties in they bedroom, nothing professional about it. They are the type of girls you can run into at the gas station if you in the right place at the right time. I will say that he did try to clean up his Ig some but doesn’t help much. 4k friends and 3.5k are twerking women, you would basically have to delete the whole page and start over which i will not ask that of him. He doesn’t cheat on me so it makes me feel like the bad guy for getting on him about women on the internet. Idk what to do but i cant stop thinking about. Makes me feel like I’m not really his type.

It's a little bit of a long one so hang in there, I was in a library and saw this pretty girl who I went upto, if I am being honest with you the main reason I went up to her was becouse I am a guy who struggles with confidence around woman(I am working on it) and the main reason I went up to her was to build my confidence. In my head I was gonna go up to her ask for her number and she's gonna say no and am gonna walk away causally (all this to just help build my confidence) but I wasn't prepared for what was gonna come.

 I picked up all the last bit of confidence I had and strolled over to her and I said ""hey sorry to interrupt, I think your Hella pretty any chance I can get your number"". For my shock she said ""aww yes"" and I lost everything, I was happy but wasn't prepared for it at all I gave her my phone ""told her it's nice to meet you and I will call her"" btw I was stuttering a bit because she caught me off guard so much and I walked of after I shook her hand. I though I lost her number when I got back home but managed to find it the next day (she saved her number without her name) I texted her and convo started each text had like a couple of ours in between. 

This is where I think I messed up she texts me ""how's you weekend going so far"" and my mate who's got a girlfriend told me to reply with something smooth so he told me to reply with this ""it was alright till I got your number"", she did not reply to that and she gosted that text so idk if it's what I said or she just didn't have any interest in me.

 But this is where it gets weird I have seen her twice, once in the library and ones in the café (uni library and cafe) both times I seen her glue her eyes on me, the first time in the library when I saw her looking at me I smiled at her and she didn't smile looked away and looked right back at me I just sat down on my chain and pretend to do something(coz I got nervous).

The second time in the café I see her waiting for her food me and my mate was walking towards her to the door, I knew she was looking at me but I was looked away and my mate told me she was staring right at me. So idk what to do at this point I know am gonna see her one day around uni and I can't get her out my head. 

 Also I don't think she smiles alot too which is okay with me it's just that I regret going upto her because that's all in my head at this point. Just for time frame I first takes to her last Dec and seen her through uni twice and that's it. I need some advice guy plz.

i've been trying to date recently. i was so so worried that no one would like me, and truly believed for my whole life that no one could ever be interested in me (this also delayed me quite a bit lol). but now i want to meet someone because i think i can do it and i have a lot to offer, and i want to have a family so the clock is ticking lol. now the problem is that i am so far behind everyone else and idk how to explain myself or even how to behave. i went on one date that my friend set me up on, the rest have been from apps. i can't date someone i'm already friends with (which would be my ideal situation) bc they're all in relationships. 

the issue is i only know how to make friends, nothing more. i don't know how to know if i like someone. guys can't tell that i'm so uncomfortable or that i have no experience because otherwise i have good social skills - i am a good conversationalist, i'm kind and i'm funny... but i just can't get to know someone deeply right from the start. even in friendships, i take a while to get close to people. 

i've been on 3 dates with a guy, over the past month or so. that's the most dates i've ever been on with 1 person. we text 1-2 times per day. i'm already taxed by this. i can't tell if i like him but so far he seems good. he said he wants to get to know me better but feels like we don't talk/see each other enough for a deeper connection and wants me to come to his house this weekend. even the thought of this makes me want to throw up. i'm so embarrassed about my lack of experience at my old age, i feel like if i go to his place it's going to be an issue i'll have to bring up, but i'm not comfortable enough with him to tell him this yet. i'm worried it's going to be a whole thing and i'll have to explain why or he'll think it's a red flag. but also i know i need to just hurry up and at least kiss someone just so i can get it over with and be normal, and this guy seems nice enough, but i'm so nervous that he'll know i've never done any of this before. 

i contemplated asking him to meet somewhere else more public but i think that's just me avoiding the problem. i don't think i'm worried about safety, it's just more discomfort. i think maybe i just need to do it so at least i am out of my comfort zone and if he is weirded out by me then that's his problem, i don't even know if i like him yet so i have nothing to lose. but i also don't know if i want to go over to a guy's house if i don't even like him and he might try to touch me and that thought makes me cringe??

I had been with her (24F) for 6 years, and slowly we were building up our lives to be properly connected. Covid hit, and we began to struggle. She broke things off with me... Well, not really. She was cheating on me, and I found out about it from her Facebook page. She forgot to edit the seeing preferences on a post about being engaged to another man. Turns out I had been her dark secret all these years. When I confronted her about it, she didn't give a damn. I like to think I've had a lucky escape.

Since this relationship was long-distance, and we only met up a few times, I have very rarely had the much-needed physical contact. A hug, holding somebody and knowing the loving feeling to be mutual. I've tried to meet people, but with the current state of the world, it isn't easy.

I befriended someone at work (27F) who was a new starter. She made me laugh, we shared similar interests - and I interpreted a lot of her mannerisms as flirting. Sadly after 6 weeks, she has quit the job due to indifference with the management. This happened on my week off, and she told me over text message. This all happened back in October. 

We lost touch and I hadn't really heard from her. Then suddenly at midnight on New Year's I got a text saying we should meet up for pizza in the new year. I was pretty quick to respond, which may have put her off? I didn't hear back for a couple of days, so I just sent her a message asking how she was etc. She replied saying things were good - I said the same in response and that I'd be free if she wanted to meet up. No response. 

Should I just ask her if she's free one weekend? We seemed to hit it off, and I just want to move on.

He asked me out and we had a very nice first date where there was a lot of spark, we got along really well and we kissed. Things have moved pretty quickly between us since then.

However, he told me that he is in an open relationship sort of arrangement. Moreover he just got out of a relationship a month before. I didn't feel great about it, but he also told me that he is looking for love and he is not really happy with the current situation. Because I really liked him, I ended up sleeping with him a few times.

I then started to feel bad about the situation, it was too complicated for me and it was stressing me out. I told him, and I said I don't want to sleep with him anymore in these circumstances. He was very understanding. Since we were both leaving for holidays we decided to cool it off and leave him to process his breakup, and everything else.

We didn't see each other for a month, while we were in different countries. In this time he was texting me often and we got to know each other much better. However, after everything that happened, I started to lose my feelings for him. I felt that my life is better without a complicated romantic situation, and a good relationship should start differently. I somehow just stopped thinking about him romantically after that, and I also started to see differences between us such as age and where we are at in life. But it took me some time to realise this, and in the meantime I kept talking with him about a lot of things (which I still enjoyed).

One day though, he invited me for drinks at his friends' house when we were to come back, and then I realised he sees me differently than how I see him and I told him I'm not romantically interested anymore. He was sad, because he thought we could grow together when we are back.

Back in town, we met again, this time just as friends. He told me he decided to break up the open relationship because it was not for him. He told me he still really likes me, and it's a shame life was like this, but he understands and wishes to remain in friendly terms. He also got me a very beautiful bracelet.

I like to stick to my decisions when I take them, but this one was hard. Why? Because I felt contradictory: I definitely felt a ""red flag"" that killed it for me, buy now the situation changed...

Was just thinking about my relationship and wanted to say thx for the advice I received on a deleted post around 6 months ago.

I (22M) posted here last summer about an issue with a younger girl (20F) from my club I was having which was about her body count.

I grew up in a more socially conservative environment so the idea of a girl just sleeping with like 10 guys already by 20 was sort of off putting and my friends also drilled that idea that I should avoid her also or just hook up with her for some quick sex.

So I decided to come to this sub for advice just to hear some opinions from an outside perspective.

I received some advice that her body count doesn’t matter since she’s with me at the end of the day and that I don’t know her backstory so I shouldn’t judge. So with these perspectives from my friends and this sub I decided to just trust my gut since I really liked her and ask her out.

Now 6 months later I’m in the best relationship I’ve ever been in. Just thinking back if I listened to my friends how I could have missed out on this relationship is crazy.

For some reason with her higher body count I thought she wouldn’t want a serious relationship.

She’s so smart, caring, beautiful and just everything I wanted in a partner to be in general. To see her improve every session that I attend with her therapist for her anxiety is such an amazing feeling. Just seeing her succeed in general in school and everything it makes to happy that we’re a part of each others lives.

I met this girl before Thanksgiving through another friend. The first time I ""hung out"" with her was when I first met her when I was with my friend and he was meeting up with another girl who the girl I'm currently with is friends with. Essentially, we met through mutual friends. We all had a good time that night, and I decided to ask her out on a date a couple days later. It was bad timing with the holiday, but we finally had a first date alone in December. We watched a movie and talked by the fire. She ended up getting sick and then having surgery, so it was over a month until we did something again. However, in that gap of time frame, her friend told me that the girl I'm with was still hanging out with an old guy. I don't have much information, but apparently the guy and her haven't been ""dating"" for 2 years, but they hangout alone together frequently. I was surprised to hear this, and the girl I'm with has yet to tell me about him I broke things off with her about a week later because I felt it was weird how long we hadn't seen each other. She apologized and sent long messages, so I decided to give her another chance. We finally were able to hang out together recently and both had a really good time. I haven't discussed this guy with her, and I don't think she knows that I know. My question is should I give her an ultimatum? I have been on 3 dates with her, only 2 with us alone. I get that people pursue other options in the early dating phase, but I feel this is different because she has been with this other guy (unclear if romatically?) for a couple of years now. Will I come off as pushy?

TL;DR: The girl I'm with is still with this guy she has been with for 2 years (however, friend claims that they are not romantically together...?). I see this scenario different from she seeing other guys at that same time in which they have just started going on dates. In that scenario, I wouldn't ask for exclusivity because this is a ""fresh"" relationship. However, I feel like this scenario is different because they should know by now if they were wanting to pursue a relationship. Would it be fair to ask her to not see this guy alone 1 on 1 anymore if she wanted to pursue a relationship with me?  Sorry for the long text.

I posted on here the other day about a girl I am seeing and asked if I should keep meeting her.

So I met her the 2nd time yesterday and we had a really really good time and we had a lot to talk about. We kissed like 30 times and held each other’s hand. Pretty romantic you know.

I know her friend and he’s like “She have never been so happy after a date” “She loves being with you she think you are attractive and kind” So like only positive stuff and she sends hearts etc. She asked me if I wanted to “Watch a movie at her place on Friday” Hahahhaha.


The dilemma as I’ve mentioned here before is that she had been dating a guy much longer than me but she says she likes me 100 times more to her friends.
She’s a bit weird there because she have said she hate him but like him in a way. So pretty unclear. I get that we have only met 2 times and I can’t just expect here to not talk to any guy.

I just feel it’s double signals because she says she love being with me and ask me out, She also told me she was going to talk to him and she was sure wanted to focus on me.

Miles is polyamorous (has other partners, I’m ambiguous i.e. I’m good with polyam or mono) and lives an hour away, coming to my town about twice or three times a month. Miles and I have been close friends for almost 3 years. Zander is monogamous and lives an 8 hour drive and 500 miles away. Both of them are exceptionally great people. Zander and I specifically brought up and agreed we’d love to get married, but he wasn’t interested in it if it wasn’t the two of us. He was open to the idea briefly but decided he couldn’t do polyam.

Long complicated story to the point, I held on too tight to the idea that maybe there would be a way to have an arrangement everybody’s happy with and I could be with both of them.  Zander and I both literally have post traumatic stress because things weren’t working despite how badly we wanted to be together. Zander ended up dating another girl about 3 months ago and is currently engaged to her. 

Once I processed the fact he’s monogamously with someone else, and therefore no real hope for us, I came to even stronger realization more than I had before that he’s the (or a) love of my life. It’s going to be hell watching him build a life with somebody else knowing he and I never will, but I’m grateful we are planning to remain in each others lives as friends. 

I’m currently dating Miles, but my relationship with Zander is haunting everything. Every time we do something couple-like, i’m immediately flooded with thoughts and feelings of the pain and trauma of knowing that relationship existing romantically ripped Zander away from me. To get personal, I hardly enjoy sex with Miles especially since Zander was clear about sleeping with other people wasn’t okay with him. I’ve unfortunately considered breaking up. That being said, it would make the trauma of the situation for not and I don’t know what to make of all of this with Miles. 

The part I’m trying to reconcile is I do love Miles, and I had considered marrying him at one time too, and it would be great if he and I can work. But how do I reconcile that with the pain and trauma I’m reminded of whenever we’re together and couple-y? I tried talking to my therapist about it and will bring it up again, but am I in the wrong? Anyone have similar experiences by chance?

I spoke of an instant connection with someone right as I was about to delete Hinge. I spoke of a week worth of FaceTimes and phone calls. I spoke of how gorgeous she is and how much we have in common. I flippantly ended the post with, “this might just be my last first date”.

It was hyperbolic but also I feel like if we’re not dating just to pass the time or have sex, that’s a healthy perspective. Why shouldn’t we get excited as long as we can keep that excitement in check?

Many jumped down my throat saying I was kidding myself, the date was going to be terrible, that I need to stop jumping ahead, etc. I made it clear that I was being realistic but very excited. 

No matter what I said, people said the date was gonna suck and that I already failed. Some were more conservative and some supported but many downright insulted me, which is fine. I’ve got Teflon skin. 

Well, we did the date and it was as great as both of us hoped it would be. We had talked about all the “good stuff” being closed due to C19 and then got onto the topic of how when kids want to do something they’re perfectly happy spending all day in the mall. Oh, simpler times. So that’s what we did. 

It started with a fantastic hug, great conversation, then we hit one of those mall photo booths and that led to a kiss. We went to a bookstore and bought a book for each other that impacted us in the past. Then we talked a lot more, kissed a lot more, and planned the next date for 2 nights from now. 

So why write this? Because sometimes people just want to spread some good vibes and help those who are frustrated with dating. I was ready to give up and then Jen happened. You don’t always need to give your advice based on your experiences. Sometimes you just want to spread the happiness and get people excited about the possibilities, which the minority were. A lot of people acted like I wasn’t adult enough to understand dating without knowing anything about me. 

My point is sometimes you can just say, “Good luck.” Don’t project your issues onto others. Every negative person on that thread was wrong. I deleted it last night because of how much negativity I was getting. It was one crappy comment after another. 

I don’t have a crystal ball but the journey is going to be interesting with this truly beautiful human. Maybe we make it, maybe we don’t. But, I’m gonna enjoy the ride no matter what. 

Say positive and healthy everyone. Good luck out there. If there were a Build-A-Babe store, I would have built her.

Now i am getting matched on the app like not that i have tons but we can say like maybe 5 or 6 a week, which is good enough for me. Now the part is how to start the convo, there are pickup lines, bio, and the compliments and normal “hey, how are you” stuff. I have tried each and everything with different type of people, but after having the first date, i text them, they seem to ignore it or i see they say i talk a lot ( which i do as i am a talkative person) i feel like i am ignored but when we have first talks or first dates they seem all interested and chatty and laughing and what not.Please suggest me that if i am doing anything wrong here or i am just overthinking.

Just wanted to ask for some advice about this situation.

At the start of last semester a friend (23M) of mine asked to be in a relationship with me but due to other circumstances like my family getting sick, school work, volunteering, and getting ready to start my nursing program I turned him down saying that I was too busy to date at the time.

We’ve kept in touch as we still play games along with other friends and sometimes hang out in our group discord chat, and I know that he hasn’t dated anyone else in the meantime.

So just wanted wondering whats the best way to get his attention that I’m available for a relationship now? Should I just drop some hints or directly ask him out?

If I do ask him out was considering taking him out for dinner for Korean BBQ which is his favorite, or maybe something more involved like mini golf/kart racing. Or maybe even just Legoland as I know he loves building/designing things which is why he graduated as a mechanical engineer.

I met someone on Bumble just before Christmas. We hit it off immediately and within a day we were messaging constantly, talking about our lives, our families, etc. He told me where he worked, and we have mutual friends, so I was able to check that he wasn't lying about anything. Over Christmas we became very flirtatious, exchanged numbers on WhatsApp and arranged to meet up in the week between Christmas and New Year.

When we met there was instant chemistry and we couldn't stop looking at each other and grinning. We met for tea, then we went to a soccer match (I was working and got him a free ticket, it's the team he has always supported) so after I finished work we went for a drink - he had to wait outside in the cold for over an hour for me but said he didn't mind. We then were going to go for a drive, but he offered to take me back to his for a cup of tea. We had tea, then things progressed and we were intimate. It seems quick when I say it, but actually when we met it was s though we had known each other for years, so easy and neither of us had any nerves meeting for the first time. We both fell asleep and when we woke up, he took me for breakfast then drove me home. 

Our second date was a sweet walk around castle ruins, a cup of tea in the cafe and then an afternoon in the pub. We held hands all day and he asked me if I would be his girlfriend. I said yes - at our age if you feel something why wait around? This was New Years Eve and I needed some bubbly for my family party, so he took me to the supermarket, we held hands there even, and then he took me home. We spoke in the phone for ages in the early hours after he had come home from the party he went to, and my family had all gone to bed. 

The third date was two days later, we went to a soccer game he was working at, then back to his where he was going to cook for me but passion overtook us. I stayed over and he took me to work the next day. At this point both of our families knew we were dating. We had seen many of my friends and his over the course of the dates, and we had introduced each other to our colleagues. We were peaceful together, and spent time just sitting on the sofa, my feet in his lap, drinking tea, and it felt normal. 

The next day, he texted me to say he was really sorry, he didn't want to hurt me,  but he didn't think he was ready for a relationship, he thought he had been but things moved so far so fast it freaked him out. After I sent him some very hurt texts he phoned me that night and we talked for hours, not just about why he was dumping me but about normal stuff like family, anecdotes about our past before we met, our childhoods. It was a really nice conversation apart from the painful bit, which took up a short part of the call. He said he thought we could still be really good friends because we had such a deep connection and so much in common (freaky coincidences as well like having met loads of times when we were younger without knowing, exact same medical complaints, same wedding anniversary albeit a few years apart, but both having had to postpone the original date of the wedding due to pregnancy) he wanted me in his life. He thought he could see us together in the future but couldn't say when which he didn't think was fair on me.

A couple of days later I ended up in hospital (with a blood clot on my lung) and texted him, asking him to keep me company via text as a friend, which he did. He phoned me when I came out of hospital to tell me off for discharging myself before I was better to go into work, we again spoke for hours. He didn't reply to any texts after that until 3 days later when he rang me, long call again at the end of which he said that he was open to us starting again, but much more slowly,  he fancies me, we have something there. Then I didn't hear anything for days, in which time I had sent him a small good luck gift for an interview he was having. The day the gift arrived he texted me to say it was a lovely touch and he was pleased, we texted all night, a bit flirty but not overly so given how full on we had been previously. 

He had the interview yesterday, I texted him good luck in the morning, he replied in the evening to thank me and say my message made him smile, he then phoned and we talked for hours, flirted a lot, I asked him if he wanted to stay with me in a hotel I am going to at the weekend, he declined because he has his son staying over but said he would have loved to otherwise. He said he couldn't see me until February, because he's busy with work (that's genuine, he works full time plus has his own business, I knew this right back in December that January was going to be very busy). But that next month we would go out and do things together, he was looking forward to it, we could go out for a meal or to a tea room.  He also talked about if he got his promotion we would go to Premier league soccer matches together, it felt like a chat you would have with someone you were dating. We even arranged to go to London for our birthdays in the summer, in some detail about what we would get up to. 

Today he texts me that he has got the promotion, we text back and forth for half an hour or so then I suggest I call him later when he's finished work - he says he's off to the pub with his friend and doesn't know what time he will be home. Seems like him saying don't call, without actually saying it. 

So I guess my question is - does this sound like he does want to date, or have I been friend zoned? I'm so confused. I'm 42, he's 48. I was widowed a few years ago, he separated from his wife 5 years ago. First attempt at dating for both of us. I feel tremendous guilt and anxiety because of my late husband, he's cool with that and has been very accepting that I wear my rings still and we talk about my late husband (and his wife) a lot, even discussing our wedding days last night. We are very compatible sexually. And in every other way, the only thing we disagree on is politics and we have agreed to disagree.

I don’t see any reason to date around anymore. I’m not ready to label our relationship, but I’m ready to give exclusivity a shot while we continue to get to know each other. We talked about it today and he admitted that he was still looking to meet other people. He said he has no desire to be intimate or physical with anyone else, but that he needs time to figure things out. We decided that this was okay as long as we both kept each other updated about where we are at and how we are feeling. I trust him to communicate what he’s feeling.

I still don’t want to see other people right now. Even if it doesn’t work out, I want to enjoy the time spent for what it is. It’s only been a couple of months, and I know there is no single timeline for how these things go.

It went something like  

""This Secret “Pillar of Power” Makes Attracting Beautiful, Submissive, and Feminine Women As Simple &amp; Easy As Drinking Water""

and then went on to talk about how you communicate a presence with everyone you meet in an instant and if you are naturally dominant then practically everybody will respect you and be subservient to you while also envying you

The guy also says that dominance is ""a way of being that can be learned as easily as developing a habit of consistent meditation""

I don't typically pay attention to stuff like this but I have to admit it sounds intriguing. I'm not super experienced and I only recently started meditating every now and then but I never thought it would make me ""dominant""

Also, what do you guys think of ""dominance""? Do girls actually like dominant guys or is that just some marketing stuff by all these dating gurus?

In my mind dominance means being controlling and like toxic - but I looked it up on google and it just means power and influence over others

And that attraction can/will eventually grow. I've tried to be open, it hasn't worked so far.

But literally all of the guys I know are dating women they were attracted to at initial meet. The women aren't perfect, of course, but they are gainfully employed, well rounded, &amp; attractive with good grooming/hygiene. These men aren't even going on dates with women they'd deem 'ugly' in their eyes. If they do, it's a quick hit and run situation. There are exceptions that I see online but as far as real life, I don't know a single guy who's girl had to physically grow in him. Nor are men encouraging other men to approach dating like this. 

I know different genders have different social expectations but why do ppl think women don't want to enjoy an attractive (to them) partner/date? Not talking Hollywood level 10 attractiveness either. Just cute for them. I think I'm just getting frustrated because I've been on some great dates with really cool guys but can't seem get past the physical. To the point where I have no desire to kiss them even. My brain automatically puts them in the friend/homie/nonsexual category. But I always hear ""give him another chance, he'll grow on you"".

I’ve recently been in a self improvement journey, started back in my sophomore year (20), lost body fat back in may, started hitting the gym religiously in August, stacked my resume for my future career, and now finding hobbies. I have 4 close friends, but I somewhat prefer this over having a clique like in hs. For financial reasons, I live at home with parents, visit campus friends every weekend or so, and I’m now trying to make time out of my busy schedule to join more clubs. I have a part time job, but it doesn’t pay as much and I get little hours.

I watch a lot of YouTubers who kinda talk about how mens peak attractiveness is like 10% body fat, and how you need to have all your shit together before you can have women in your life or a girlfriend. “Life setup” as they call it. However, it kinda has made me feel I’m not really “enough” for girls yet, or women in general. The whole manosphere on YouTube tries to say that men aren’t really all that enough for women until they are 24-25. And that up until that point you just self improve as a man. I guess that makes sense, and it serves as some motivation, but I can’t help but see other guys my age actually having women around them or dating. So it makes me feel that what I’m doing is wrong. 

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve placed my self worth as a man and my value completely contingent on if a girl likes me, or not. I want to really stop living like this, but idk what to do. It’s not affecting my mental health per say but it just sucks when I start thinking about it. Is it normal for me to feel this way at 21? How do I get over this?

Yes, Grindr. And no, we did not ask each other for sexual photos or ask any sexual questions. I started the conversation by commenting on one of his photos and asking him to tell me more about it (a photo from a music festival). After this the conversation was flowing naturally, and we had a lot to talk about and found out pretty quickly that we had a lot in common. I shot my shot and asked him out for coffee. He instantly agreed. We planned for coffee on Saturday, and the day was Tuesday. 

After the initial asking out, we continued to text a lot for the rest of the week... we found a lot more things that we had in common. 

Flash forward to the date. We met for coffee, everything was going great: we were making eye contact, there was no awkward silences, we were laughing at and with each other, and after coffee we went on a walk. We were already talking about lending each other books we want to read, and saying things like ""next time lets do this"" and making it clear that there would be a second time. I walked him to his car, and asked for his number, which he gave to me. He then asked to hug me, and we hugged each other. 

Maybe this was my mistake: I made it clear that I had a great time and would like to see him again over text a couple hours after the date. He replied quite fast and stated that he also had a great time. After this though, the texting started to slow down. 

Now we still have conversations, but they are dragged out over multiple days. I am just wondering why the communication pattern would change so suddenly and drastically? 

I know that maybe he realized he isn't as interested as he thought he was, or I came off too strong, or he is simply more busy this week than normal.

In need of sincere and honest advice!

I met a guy on Friday night, hit it off then went out again Saturday. He was super clingy and very persistent on going out but I said fuck it why not, he was hot AF, I was horny and I’m newly single and felt that it would be good for me. 

He’s from out of state so i took him to a nice local gastropub and we ended up ordering lots of drinks. We started making out and one thing led to another and we agreed on getting a hotel room for the night. We asked for the check and I decided to pick up the tab since he said he was going to book the hotel room. The check was at least $150 and the hotel room was as well so I felt like it was fair to go about splitting the costs of the night. 

We get to the hotel and then his credit card gets declined. I was a little confused (and tipsy) at this point because I thought we only needed a credit card for the security deposit. I thought he had already booked and paid for it on his phone. So I take out my credit card and put my card down for the security deposit. He felt embarrassed and told me that he would pay me  back if I was charged any fees  and was super confused as to why his card was declined. I told him not to worry since it’s only a security deposit and it would get removed from my account anyway. 
Anyways, we got to the room and spent an amazing hot night together which I don’t regret at all lol. I left early in the morning and let him know when I arrived home  and then he replies saying “yay thanks for texting me, thanks for letting me know blah blah emojis  ❤️ hope to see you soon when I come back blah blah “

Later that day, I checked my credit card statement and notice that I was charged for a higher amount than what I expected.   I texted him asking why that was if the security deposit was only a certain amount. No response. I was genuinely confused. So I call the hotel and was told that I was charged for the hotel security deposit and the hotels nightly stay. To my understanding, I thought I only put my card down for the security deposit which would get removed after a couple of days. Anyways I wanted to speak to him about this, to let him know what happened and let him know that he has to send me the money for the nights stay as we agreed.  No response. At this point I was getting a lil frustrated. I knew he had a flight going back home that night and I made up all sorts of excuses for him. But found it extremely weird since as soon as I started talking about money matters, he did not want to respond. 

I called him later that evening and the morning after and he did not respond. At this point I got the feeling “ ok , I’m definitely being played at this point”.  I just wanted to talk and get this shirt sorted out. So I search and find him on IG. While looking through his IG, i come to find out he’s in a relationship. A 5 year relationship…I messaged him asking if we can speak. Minutes after he blocks me on IG. So I texted him minutes after calling him a piece of shit and saying that I don’t give a shit if we don’t speak or see each other ever again, I just want my money and if not, I would blow up his spot (in regards to having a relationship) 
Seeing that disappointed me bc he was not being honest with me when we met. 
Minutes after I sent those texts, he writes me an essay stating a million different excuses on how he lost his gloves, his phone died on the way home and that his phone company turned off his data so he was unable to communicate. Excuse after excuse. When I asked him to explain why he blocked me he didn’t say why and just ignored me. He apologized and said how this entire trip was expensive and how he didn’t expect to spend so much while being in my state and that he didn’t know something was wrong with his debit card but he still wants to be friends as he wants to come back to my state and wants me to show him around.
I kept asking well if you had nothing to hide then why did you block me and he didn’t respond. 
Anyways, I asked my friends for advice and they said I should go to his girlfriend and let her know about everything since he is here trying to scam me.
He called me and left a voicemail saying he can TRY to get the $$ to me by the weekend but he can’t promise anything and that he still wants to be friends so I should be more understanding and he briefly explained his relationship status. 
Since I missed his phone call bc of the time difference, I responded via text hours later and realized that he blocked my number. Which to me just goes to show that he isn’t going to pay me. 
Yes, money is a concern for me bc I had a budget that night. Also if he didn’t have money to spend then why go out? 

But I come here to write this and ask: 
what should I do? 

Should I message his girlfriend and tell her about the night we had? 
Should I just let it be? 
Or Should I reach out to him again despite me already reaching out multiple times?

Recently, she openly shared (which I really appreciate) that she comes out of a sort of relationship which was “more friends than romantic”. However, sex was also part of it. 

How she described it: 

“We have know each other for about 4 years. Starting out as very good friends at first, it turned into a sexual relationship as well. We have never defined this as a “relationship” and both appreciated having the possibility / freedom to meet other people. In reality, neither of us explored anything like that. We enjoyed each other’s company, went on trips, had a strong connection, and we had sex. This has changed into a purely platonic friendship as I want to date and build a relationship with a long term partner”.

Because he’s been such an important friend in her life, she still sees him every now and then. 

She felt she needed to share this because other guys in the past have had issues with this. 

Obviously, this made me think. She comes across super trustworthy, and how she openly and out of her own initiative talks about this relationship tells me she’s conscious of what it means for a potential partner that they are still friends. 

I’m not sure what to think. I love how she’s proactive and open about it, but also have some worries if it’s really platonic - although I have no real reason to believe she’s lying.

What would you do? Is this reasonable? Should I accept this? Do I have the “right” to ask her not to see him anymore? Should I see this as her ex, or a friend?

That situation being where a girl gives me her number without me asking and asks me out instead of the other way around. 

I met this girl on Meetup last week. We didn't talk for long at the meet as the event was coming to an end, but we talked enough to add each other on Facebook before we left. The next day, the girl messages me on Facebook giving me her number and asking me if I would like to hang out some time. I said yes I would love to hang out and told her I'll text her later at her number.

I wait a day, greet her through text, and I get a response the next day. We start a small chat and she again asks me if I would be down for drinks or dinner sometime this week. I said yes, I asked her what time and dates works for her, and also said I have suggestions for places to go to. She said she'll get back to me once she figures out her work schedule. I wait a day again, she gives me a time and date that works for her, and that time and date also works for me. I gave her restaurant suggestions, she picked one of them, and now we have a date set up for Saturday evening.

When I first met her, she was quiet, reserved, and seem kinda shy, so that's why I decided to approach her. Me, as someone who has social anxiety and is trying to work on fixing it, I found those traits about her to be attractive and have developed a liking to her when we met, though I didn't show it to her. I was quite shocked when I saw she made the first moves.

I'll be honest, I don't really know for certain if this girl is romantically interested in me or just wants to be friends, but she seems to have some interest in getting to know me as she initiated the asking me out question both times and gave me her number when I didn't ask for it. So I'm excited to see her again and get to know her better and see where the date leads us.

In this situation, is there a proper way I should approach the date? I'm used to asking girls out and trying to put in the extra effort during a date, but this is actually the first ever time a girl has asked me out and I'm honestly not sure how I should approach it.

Basically saying that he decided to run back and catch me before I was gone because he would rather shoot his shot than be thinking about the ""cute girl he walked past"" all day. It totally took me by surprise and he was very cute so I didn't mind putting my number in his phone. This has never happened to me before so I really have no idea how long guys usually wait to text. This happened yesterday morning and I'm kinda losing hope that he will ever reach out. After doing some research I found out there is some kind of three day rule that guys have to not look desperate before they text a girl-- is that a real thing? how long should I wait before forgetting about this all together? I found his Instagram but def feel like its weird for me to reach out to him on there if he never texts me.
