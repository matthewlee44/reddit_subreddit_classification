0,n16d1w,1619708711,Would my question be generally interpreted as a sign of attraction or just chit chat?,"I've had a new coworker for the past few months who has been flirting with me. I was making small talk the other day with him and I asked him if he lived alone or with his girlfriend. I intentionally assumed he already had a girlfriend to avoid asking directly and embarrassing myself if he did have a girlfriend.

Well, turns out he does have a brand new girlfriend! I am so embarrassed and hope he didn't know that I asked because I was interested in him.

Do you think it's plain obvious from my Q that I was interested in him or is it open to interpretation?

4,n16v1q,1619710112,Kinda lost,"Hi,

So, I’ve met a guy on tinder. We got along very well and he asked for my number. He was texting me a lot, but I did reply quite late, still he would double text me. We went on a date on Sunday. It was very nice, we spent 6 hours together. We went to cafe, he asked me many questions about me, my family, life. We cuddled and talked. His male friend kept calling and he asked me if I was fine if his BFF would join, I said yes but he didn’t come. Then we went for a walk and he invited me over to his place. Well, we started making out.. I stopped in the middle and told him that I’m not looking for one night stand and that he would be a second guy I’d sleep with. He was shocked that I brought up a one night stand and kept saying that he wasn’t even thinking about that. We ended up having sex few times, then, even after sex, he kissed me still. He wasn’t distant. I wanted to leave while he was taking a shower but couldn’t find my phone. The guy straight up asked me “why would you even leave without me”? Then, we walked together, he would meet his friend, and I would go to my friends. He said he wants me to meet his friend. I met him, and my guy wanted us all go to meet my friend, but I knew my friend isn’t as social so it was no. I explained to him and he said it’s fine, he hugged and kissed me goodbye. I thought the date was awesome but didn’t hear back from him. On Wednesday, he “haha” reacted to my story on Instagram(not sure if it means anything). I thought maybe he got offended so I sent him a message on Wednesday saying “I’m sorry for not inviting you and your friend, but my friend had issues that she wanted to vent about”. 
I don’t think I did anything wrong, like it’s a date but I liked him maybe a bit too much so I thought I’ll show him that I’m interested. He replied and said “all right, don’t worry, my friend forgives you (in a sarcastic way)”, and I asked if he’s offended, he said “I don’t hold grudges against anyone”. I just said all right thanks for understanding. That was it. 
Should I expect him to ask me to hang out? What do you think? I’m sorry I tried to be as detailed as possible.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n16v1q/kinda_lost/

6,n178ks,1619711173,My love for her blinding out the red flags regarding her ex?,"Quick backstory: She ended her previous relationship about 6 months ago, and they broke it off due to her ex cheating on her, but they've stayed in contact as friends considering they found it super awkward to not talk to eachother at all when they share same classes in University (relative small classes) plus having mutual study-friends. They also tend to work out together, and they have been doing that even when I started seeing her. We've talked about him, and she has re-assured me that they are just friends, and that she could never fully trust/be with him again. Ive also accepted her being friends with him, and actually to some extent think its a quite a mature approach considering all the mutuals they have. Although things are starting to become iffy.

So I've (M/22) been been seeing this girl (G/23) for about 3-4 months now, and we've been exclusive for about 2. We have both been pretty vocal about how we wanted to keep things slow, get to know eachother fully. Things are great. We've been steadily hanging out 4-6 times a week, ive met her parents, she's met mine, everything is great. Fast forward, and her exam period hit 2 weeks ago. She's super stressed out, sits at the library for 8-10 hours a day, and generally doesnt have time to see me. Which is totally fine by me, I accept it, and also encourage her to focus on her exams instead of us. 

 Ever since the examperiod started she's been really distanced from me/lowkey dry. I understand that its hard to be positive/joyful when you have long days at the library, but its still bugging me. She doesnt have time for me, but I still see her working out with her ex, and thats where I react. How come she doesnt have time for me (lowkey bf/exclusive partner), but DOES have time to work out with her ex. And yes they also did work out together before the exams, but atleast then she would still see me basically every night, but now that she doesnt see me at all she still prioritizes to work out with him. Shit hurts. My brain tells me she could never get together with her ex again regarding how he hurt her, but my gut feeling also tells me that if she really didnt have feelings for him anymore then she wouldnt prioritize him like that when her time is limited. And the thought of that has been eating me up on the inside, and there is still two weeks left of the exam period. 

I've been planning to talk to her about it after her exams, but a part of me doesnt thing I can wait that long either. I also in general struggle to fathom how anyone could still be friends with someone who broke your heart in that way. There's just so many questions right now, and I could use some other experiences/thoughts. I'd be heartbroken if I found out after 4 months of dating that I was just a rebound.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n178ks/my_love_for_her_blinding_out_the_red_flags/
7,n179y5,1619711280,Need honest advice/opinions on establishing a boundary with my (22 F) boyfriend's (26 M) exes?,"My boyfriend and I met 5 months ago and have been together since. We both have friends of the opposite sex. I don't like staying in contact with exes after we break up (I block then quickly unblock them, that way they're not following me and I'm not following them). They were all casual exes, while my boyfriend's exes are both long-term relationships and hookups.

Since I don't stay in contact with my exes, I have no plans of ever seeing them or talking to them again. My boyfriend is friends with some and justifies it by saying that it was a long time ago or that some were relationships from high school or just didn't end badly.

At the very start of our relationship, we had an argument about me hiding the fact that I was still hanging out with my male friends alone, keeping Snapchat streaks, Facetiming, sending/receiving memes, DM's, etc. to my current male friends and acquaintances. I had the bad habit of hiding my phone, too. I was completely wrong in hiding all of that and I should've communicated it better. They're all platonic to me and I am not interested in them sexually or romantically, nor do we have a past of such nature. I made the changes and not only stopped hiding all of that, but also stopped remaining such close contact with my male friends and acquaintances. I never felt anything romantic or sexual towards them, but they would give me compliments, etc so I guess I felt like I did some of that out of need for male validation. My boyfriend said he felt uncomfortable with it also because he said he ""knows how guys are."" He was hurt also because when we started dating, he stopped talking to his female friends, so he had expected I do the same. I replied that it's unfair for him to assume that I'm going to know what his expectations are of me if he didn't communicate them. In the back of my mind, I just think, ""if you say you know how guys are, and you wanted me to stop talking to guys that had been attracted to me, and you stopped talking to your female friends when you started talking to me, that means you have some sort of attraction towards your female friends, as well..."" but I don't know. Maybe I'm crazy.

Our relationship has gotten a lot better ever since, but recently I've been feeling insecure about the fact that he still follows/has exes in his life. He's never mentioned or brought them up unless I bring it up, but I still feel insecure. We're long distance but we share locations with each other and talk all day every single day, and we both tell each other all our plans. We see each other once every 1-2 weeks, but other than that we both don't have that big of social lives. I know his exes live in his city, and are from his hometown/are friends since high school, so I don't expect them to leave his life anytime soon. As far as I know, he hasn't hung out with them or seen them ever since him and I have been together.

I'm thinking of having a conversation with him if this topic comes up and establishing a boundary of him having to introduce/invite me to meet his female friends/exes if he wishes to stay in contact with them/hang out with them by themselves. When we had our argument about my male friends/acquaintances, I told my boyfriend that he is more than welcome to meet them, so that he would see that there is absolutely nothing romantic/sexual between my friends and I. If there is any female friend or ex of his that he does not feel comfortable introducing me to, then I'm just going to take it as, he's hiding something or their relationship is too inappropriate for me to be around. And that will be a dealbreaker for me.

Is this unreasonable for me to ask of him? If I am please be brutally honest!!

TLDR: Is it crazy to ask for my boyfriend to introduce me/invite me to his hangouts if he ever sees his female friends or exes by himself? And if he doesn't, I'll probably assume he has an inappropriate relationship with them and it'll be a dealbreaker for me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n179y5/need_honest_adviceopinions_on_establishing_a/

10,n17joy,1619712027,A big thanks to all the guys who broke girls hearts and trust and now arent interested in finding a good partner,"Am I crazy or do lots of girls actually go for guys that are bad for them? Do they know that something is wrong with them and want to fix them or do they just dont care?

In my experience as a 23 year old male, I've met girls who vent to me about how awful and abusive their relationships have been in the past and listen about how they cant trust anyone anymore so I try and be there for them as someone to talk to. I feel really bad for the situations they were put into and try and be someone to talk to and help.This usually puts me in the friendzone.

I've met girls who actually know and admit they are looking for someone who is bad for them, as crazy as it sounds. 

My roomate in college had an awful relationship with his girlfriend and they fought, broke up, got back together all the time. He was a misogynist and not a good guy but because he had looks, charisma, and confidence, he had no problem meeting girls. 

I actually want to treat a partner right, be honest, open, fair, and loving but for whatever reason that just doesnt seem to get me anywhere because these kinds of asshole guys seem to be the ones to have more success dating and then once they move on to the next person, the girl he was with is less trusting and hurt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n17joy/a_big_thanks_to_all_the_guys_who_broke_girls/

Now I will say, that I do have a wild imagination and could really fit the archetype of the crazy woman if I wanted, but it's just not me.

31,n1addv,1619719758,I only saw her for a month. I just can’t get over her and miss her every minute of the day.,"In late February I [25] met a girl [25] online. We hit it off immediately. There was serious enthusiasm on both sides. We texted intensely and she asked me out on the first date surprisingly, even though I initiated.

Before I tell the rest of the story - I’m new to dating. I have bad social anxiety, have been depressed for nearly 10 years and am high functioning autistic. I’ve never been intimate with a woman.

The date was amazing. We ended up walking nearly 9 miles together, we had so much to say. She was beyond gorgeous, funny, kind, and emotionally intelligent. She basically checked every box. Waaaaaaaay out of my league. We didn’t even need to go over whether we wanted a second date, it was a foregone conclusion.

By this point we were texting no exaggeration, maybe 100 times a day. She’d send me dissertation length texts on certain things. She said good morning to me every day as she got up earlier, we exchanged selfies, and we shared every meal we had. We had about 200 different date ideas that obviously never materialized. Sounds dumb but we got to know each other so well over texts.

The second date was even better. Conversation got deeper. We kissed, and it was the first kiss of my life. Third date was virtual but just as smooth as the other two.

The fourth date was going extremely well for the first few hours. I even texted my friend from the bathroom about how great I thought this girl was. Until she totally blindsided me in the middle and said she wasn’t looking for anything serious and didn’t want to waste my time. Her last relationship ended very badly and she wasn’t ready was her explanation. There was absolutely no sign she was gonna say this. I didn’t know how to react; what came out was gibberish honestly. I got home and cried. She texted we should stop seeing each other the next day.

I texted her a week later saying I’d be fine seeing her casually. She said she’d be ok with texting and seeing each other sporadically as friends. I agreed. We texted a bit over the few weeks and she changed her mind and said we should stop talking. 

I don’t know what happened. I probably missed a few cues of her wanting to get physical but I wanted to respect her covid preferences. Or maybe her explanation really was true. Regardless there’s nothing I can do to go back and fix mistakes.

She’s just still constantly in my thoughts all the time. I deleted her on social media, our text convo, and her number. Has done nothing, she barely posts anyway. I’ve tried getting back on the apps but its no use. I’d do anything to receive a good morning text from her.

I’ve given it time, but I just haven’t experienced this before. I’ve talked about it in therapy and with my friends. I just can’t go again through this process of really opening myself up to someone and having it end; it’s just so painful. I guess I’m weak. I think I perhaps am meant to be alone. I just want to be liberated from thinking of her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n1addv/i_only_saw_her_for_a_month_i_just_cant_get_over/

I’m a male in my early 30s.  I’m fully vaccinated and I’d like to get back into dating. The problem is, I am out of ideas when it comes to meeting women.  What ideas and suggestions do you have Reddit? Where are people going to meet each other in the post COVID world that isn’t online?

Here is what has worked for me in the past, but doesn't work anymore:

· Online dating just isn’t fun anymore.  I deleted the apps and do not feel like going back. I’ve been online dating since I was 18 and had my fill.  

· I used to be able to meet people though friends of friends.  Now, most of my friends have settled down. No one’s thrown a party while now.

· I have hobbies and I’m a geek.  But all my hobbies are male dominated. The women who are there are wives and girlfriends of other men.  Picking up a new hobby for the sole purpose of trying to meet a woman seems creepy. I also travel extensively (airline employee perk) but its not a good way to meet people.

· I don’t try and strike up conversations with women in public anymore. I never pushed a conversation that someone didn’t want, but even trying is generally a bad idea.  

· I am not going to date someone at work. 

· Meeting people at bars/clubs is always a long shot. I quit smoking and that was always a great way to strike up a conversation with someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n1agk2/how_to_meet_people_after_covid/

36,n1b7my,1619722057,Struggling to date because I want a friendship before a relationship?,"I've never had a real boyfriend, but I've had a few crushes. I've also never been the type to crush on celebrities or random people at school (back when I was in school) which I always felt was kinda odd. However now that I'm older (26f) i'm realizing that I'm more attracted to people than appearances. Most of my crushes, if not all of them, were people who were nice to me, or my friends. 

Basically, I want someone who is going to be my best friend first, romance second. Someone I can feel like I can hang out with that doesn't just want to be around because I'm attractive/sexual reasons. 

I've started trying to get more serious about dating, but I'm really struggling with this. I am really bad at just...talking to people. I don't know how to hold a conversation, and I feel like I live a very boring lifestyle that doesn't lead to talking points. Because of this, I have very few friends (ie, none) so no mutual connections. I've tried online dating, but found that 99% of the people on those apps jump straight to the romantic stuff, or are interested in me for the entirely wrong reasons. The few people I have found I shared interests with, didn't actually want to talk about those interests even if I tried to actually hold a convo. Just straight to romance stuff, which isn't attractive to me. I find myself swiping past a lot of conventionally attractive people because i either dont feel like I've got a chance, or I just don't feel any attraction to since I 've never spoken to them.

I feel like I'm scaring everyone off with my inability to have a convo on top of my inability to feel attracted to someone I don't know. What can I do to get past this issue or become more comfortable either being in romantic situations, or even just holding a conversation?

42,n1c2nk,1619724393,Perhaps my insecurity overpowered my logic in my brain?,"I constantly emphasize how my brain focuses on logic, data and facts, I’m very analytical (which is perhaps very dangerous when mixed with insecurity).

I grew up bullied a lot, my dad abused me too, drinking a lot, and the worst part is, at 25, I’m still affected by these things to the point I have not moved on and still live in the past everyday. 

I’ve had so many girls back in school, and even more recently online when asking for rates on my pic, tell me “HOW UGLY I AM” (less vulgar way of saying it).

But, at 18, I had a female friend (we were both 18) who wanted to have sex with me, I chickened out.

I met some women online over the years, strictly long-distance. Just how it turned out. But the fact that even just a few have found me attractive, leads me to believe that I could attract more women, romantically and sexually, IN REAL LIFE, if I just improved myself and my life. MUCH easier said than done, of course.

For complicated reasons, not necessarily by choice, I’ve been mostly a shut-in since high school, and was never very much socially successful then. 

So I just took all of those negative judgements from all those women, from school, and strangers online, and assumed/concluded I was simply unattractive to the opposite sex. I’ve been hit on by guys, but then again, men still tend to be aggressors and women still tend to expect men to initiate.

It pains me that I haven’t figured my own shit out enough to the point I can move out and support myself at 25, having some decent job that isn’t for high school kids and contributes to advancing society. At the very least, is just work I can be competent enough in and pays well, then I could at least pursue my own things while being confident and secure that I can pay rent and bills, keep myself afloat. And keep having health insurance, since that is VERY expensive and NOT a legal human right in the US).

I don’t want to end up a 30 or 40 year old virgin who’s still never had a girlfriend. But at 25, I haven’t even progressed enough to take care of myself, so I’m not feeling the most optimistic, especially because I still feel so directionless.

I don’t know exactly why I’m in this position still, if I have some kind of disorder/disability not even diagnosed (it’s clear that even if I become more functional, I’m pretty sure I will continue to think differently than most people seem to) and/or fears/traumas just leading to making excuses without even realizing it?

The worst part of being a legitimate victim, is it leading to you victimizing yourself. Not just always feeling like the world is out to get you, but actually abusing yourself, treating yourself worse than anyone ever has.

And in combination of lacking a real life, I’ve absorbed too much information online. I do not think that a lot of the views represented online actually represent real life. Most people do not think “I’ll just completely focus on a career and choose celibacy and single until I become financially successful”.

No, the vast majority of people start dating, having relationships and having sex before they’re even old enough to get into a real career.

My problem is with falling so far behind, everything is now out of balance. The natural (or manmade?) order of things is, go to school for 4+ years, or even excluding that, work in a field for multiple years before making decent money. 

The older you start, the even older you’ll be to reap rewards. It’s not as if minimum wage is enough to live even a basic lifestyle.

I went over to this dude from tinders house and I told him beforehand I didn't want to have sex and I just wanted to get to know him. He was all over me. It was like dab-awkward touch - dab - kiss - dab... it was fucking weird. 

Voices are a dealbreaker for me and I HATED his voice. The more we smoked the more I wanted to punch him in the throat. Then he went on a fucking rant about the vaccine. So I left. 

Ended up going to a bar around the corner and meeting up with this guy S who I've been friends with a while. He's cool. I had a slight emotional breakdown but without the tears, so I didn't look too pathetic which was nice. 

After me ranting to S about everything we went outside to leave and he asked if he could go down on me in his back seat. I busted out laughing... I thought he was joking... he wasn't. Ugh.

After the bar I ended up meeting up with another guy off tinder who I've been talking to for a while that I had planned to meet up with anyways eventually so I said fuck it, it can't be worse than the rest of my day. 

* narrator*  She was wrong, it got worse.

So tinder # 2 lived in a fucking trailer. I felt so defeated by life at this point. We hung out for a little bit and smoked. I felt pretty comfortable, there were a lot of good vibes about him. He liked my feet. I let him fuck me. We didn't even kiss. It was so emotionless, quick, and sad. Then he got a text from his sister who lived a couple trailers down to let him know the cops were at his trailer. I didn't even freak out I just laid there naked like ""yep, that's the kind of day I'm having"" 

Turns out the cops were not there so I peaced the fuck out. He ended up finding out the cops were there before we got there but he's not sure why.

1. He told me that he works in medical analysis / drug testing. His LinkedIn profile says that he works for a medical company but in the recruitment department. This is very different from the role that he had described I.e he says that he tests vaccines and undertakes clinical research and is ‘in the lab most days’

2. He says that he has a assistant who organises his personal life. It appears from his online profile that he’s relatively junior at his company, so I can’t imagine that this is true (although I could be wrong).

4. He says that he’s close friends with various celebrities, but none of them follow him back on social media.

52,n1da58,1619727682,Am I in the wrong or did I get played?,"Female (25): I had previously started a new job in February and instantly found interest in a coworker (30). He made the move of asking to grab lunch together, dinner after work, and he asked to do a variety of other activities outside the house. While initially, he admitted to only being interested in hooking up with me, he stated that he has enjoyed getting to know me and spending time together. As time passed, we developed feelings for one another. Even took a mini trip together. He couldn't decide if he wanted a relationship or not but then finally stated he did. He asked me to be his girlfriend.

Meanwhile, I had broken up my previously relationship in December. My ex was still moving his stuff out of my place because it took awhile for him to find a place. A co-worker had told him this about me. I felt like I didn't owe him an explanation of my life because he couldn't decide if he wanted me or not. 

**Here's the catch:**

He had slept with 2 other co-workers and he claimed he didn't want his reputation ruined at work since people already know of that. We have to be secretive so only 2 people know of our situation. I have since left this job. There were some red flags that I decided to ignore. Like... 

1. After leaving his place, he calls me and asked me to come back because he found out his ex was getting married. 
2. I saw him texting a different ex one day while rubbing his back. 
3. He smokes weed every day and through out the day. Majority of the time consumes alcohol every day after work at a bar. Yes, the bartenders know him. 
4. He is moving into a new place and asked to borrow $800 from me. Got really defensive that I even hesitated on it. Yesterday, after telling him I wasn't giving him the money... that's when he decides he doesn't want to see me and blames it on the fact that he felt I lied to him about my situation with my ex and that he couldn't get over it. He never asked for one and I never lied. I was honest with him. 
5. He couldn't even have an in-person conversation to break it off.
6. Works at a dispensary and aspires to grow weed for his career.
7. Has 2 OVIs, multiple possession charges, and no driver's license. 
8. When we went out, I was the one opening up my wallet. 
9. I don't think I've heard a co-worker say anything positive about him.

Then today, I was looking on the app Untappd where you log the beers you drink. Turns out his friend (Anna) had been going out with him and he was commenting on pictures of the beer saying, ""did you like it babe?""

54,n1di4s,1619728308,Best friend flirting or not?,"This is a long one that spans the last couple days.  It was 2 separate posts originally in r/askgaybros but weren’t getting many serious answers.  Anyone who takes the time to read this will have my eternal gratitude.

So I’m (26m) gay and for the most part open about it with everyone in my life.  A friend (27m) of mine has been letting me use his weights while our gym is still closed.  Been going over to his flat most days and we work out together.  He’s openly bi and I had a crush on him a year or so ago, but never acted on it since I value his friendship too much.  Plus honestly I never got the vibe he was into me.  

Today at his place I was talking about this guy I’ve been messaging a lot who I’m really enjoying talking to.  Pretty suddenly, my friend started getting super flirty and touchy.  I was blushing like a fucking 12 year old and he just gave me this smug ass smirk.  I got flustered and left early.  He didn’t text me or anything and I haven’t texted him.  

I really don’t know what to think.  Is he into me or was that some way just to mess with me?  Did he not like that I was talking about another guy?


::Update from the next day::

This is a long ‘play by play’ because it was a very out of character interaction between us and I need help deciphering it.  I feel like I’m more confused than I was before.

So he showed up at my place an hour ago and asked if we could go for a run together.  Neither he nor I texted with each other in between the original incident and now.  I agreed and went to get changed.  He didn’t give me any privacy, not that it’s out of the ordinary for us, but I was feeling weird because of what happened before.  He started helping himself to my grapes and rambled about how I needed to eat more varied protein and how I can’t survive on just fish.  Just saying weird random stuff.  I just listened to him talk until I was ready and we went outside.  Our routine is to walk down to the promenade on the waterfront before we start running.  It was pretty silent most of the way there.  Finally he asked me how it was going with the guy I’ve been texting with.  I told him we don’t even live near each other, we’re just flirting and blowing off steam.  He got quiet again after that, but I kept catching him looking at me, so finally I asked him to say whatever he wants to say.  He told me he was sorry for making me angry before.  I explained to him it didn’t make me angry, it just made me confused.  He just nodded to himself and we kept walking.  Clearly he wasn’t gonna say more on his own, so I went on to explain that it was confusing because he’s never done that before and I had no idea what he meant by it.  He just nodded again and stayed silent while we walked.  We’d reached the waterfront by this point so I finally asked him to tell me what he meant by it.  He just shrugged, said “I don’t know” and started running.  

Fast forward to the end of our run.  We didn’t discuss anything else in the meantime, but the mood was better between us and we were both smiling.  We walk back to my building talking about our finals and upcoming internships and normal stuff.  Outside my apartment I asked “so we good?” and he said “we’re good.”  I assumed that was my answer to the dilemma, we were still just friends.  But when I told him I’d see him later, he gave me a quick kiss.  Then he said “see you later” and left.  Obviously I was speechless and embarrassed and again very confused.  

Fast forward to now as I write this.  I’m even more confused now because it seemed like he didn’t really have a reason for flirting and touching me yesterday, and that we “were good” and just pretending it didn’t happen, but then he goes and does that?  I truly don’t get what’s happening here.  He isn’t some closet case, he’s openly bisexual.  He’s always really honest with me, but is acting super weird right now.  I don’t wanna text him because he just ignores or changes the subject whenever it’s about something he’s avoiding.  Whatever this game is, I need to address it in person when I see him later.  If he is somehow actually into me, what is he looking for from me?  Does he want assurance that I’m also into him?  Is he just messing with me again like I initially thought?  If this is all just some game, I wanna make sure it all goes back to normal after.

57,n1duv2,1619729316,How to learn to not be all in during a relationship?,"The title sums it up pretty well, but I am genuinely hurt by my last relationship and honestly am scared to try again. It was 5 months ago and it still hurts like it was yesterday. I really cared for this guy and dived into the relationship head first and thought things would flow naturally since we were bestfriends for like 5+ years before, but I look back and I realize I was so much more invested into the relationship than he was and I was sacrificing much more of my time than he was. When things ended he said he lost interest in us being together and wanted a break, I suggested it because I didn't want him to be with someone he wasn't interested in being with. 

The thing with me is I go all out for the people I care about, i worked with his friends to throw him a birthday party, while when I wanted to hang out for mine he was with his friends instead ( mind you our birthdays are back to back).  I cant love under conditions, I don't care about doing things for people to get something in return because it just makes me happy seeing other people happy. It hurt when he said he lost interest because I thought that I was doing everything right only for it to fail. I miss him miserably, the friendship, everything but I know it can be no more. I am definitely not ready to try a relationship again, I thought I was, got on tinder, and realized how unready I was. I am trying to focus on myself but sometimes I lack the motivation to go to the gym etc and it's hard. I know he's not losing any sleep over this but why does it hurt me so much???  I know that I can't say never, I love love and giving love to others but it just hurts so much when its not reciprocated. Any advice? 

or should I just live a life of celibacy and love myself😭😭😭😭

58,n1dw8k,1619729425,Confused. :(,"This is starting to really bother me so maybe someone might have a perspective to add. 

So a month ago I met a guy on Bumble. He seemed really genuine and we had a lot of the same views on things. We live about an hour away from each other but he still wanted to meet up. At first it was kind of hard to meet up because he works a lot of hours(He's in law enforcement.) But we eventually met up. We hung out at a park. And it went pretty well. It was one of the happiest I felt in a long time and I told him that and he said that he wanted to see me happy. We also would talk about things like how in the past when we would date people they would give up too easily and that if you really care about someone it will work out,  and it was so nice to finally meet someone with this mindset. I even opened up to him about past traumas and he was really supportive. So he said he would keep me updated on the next time we would hang out. So a few days go by and he's really busy with work but he still texts me though. But then last Monday he said he was going to be away from his phone because the DA subpoena his phone for a court thing. So this was kind of a stressful week for me but I kept the faith that he was going to come back. 

So a week goes by and then I get a text from him saying that now things aren't going to work out because his parents decided to move out closer to where he is. (I live in California. He lives in a county an hour away from me and his parents. His parents and I live in the same county.) And that he sees no point to to driving where I am and that ""unfortunately"" he's going to make where he lives his new home. I haven't heard from him since. 

But I just don't get it why it made such a change. He's not the one moving. And also I can meet up where he is sometimes. It might be difficult at first but I think it could still work. I told him that as well but still no response. 

I thought he really cared about me and was different. 

Maybe I'm not worth it enough.

Maybe there's something he's not telling me. :( 

I'm really crushed now and trying so hard to not let the depression take over me.

I am falling in love with him and I can definitely see our relationship lasting for much, much longer. We had a discussion last night about how he thinks it’s going really well but he’s gotten his heart broken to many times and that he’s scared of it happening again. It was a really great discussion, but I’m not sure what to think of it. He told me he is just unsure of everything and that he is hesitant. 

He told me he was really just looking for a fling when we first met, but realized he liked me way more than for just a fling, so we became a couple.

The way we became a couple, was I asked him what we were doing and where we were headed, he told me he wasn’t wanting to jump into anything and that he had just gotten out of a relationship almost two months before. I told him I understood but that I was looking for something official, and not just a fling or something casual. This is when he decided he’d rather not lose me, so we became official that night. It has been going absolutely wonderful and great since then. I’ve met basically his entire family, he’s met mine, and we all get along really well. 

I really do think I am falling in love with him, possibly already have, but I don’t want to tell him out of fear that it will scare him off, as he’s already told me that he just doesn’t want to get his heart broken again, and doesn’t want to break my heart by allowing me to fall in love with him just for him to leave because he isn’t ready. I’m afraid now that I’ve fallen in love with him he’s going to leave if he realizes it.

Like, sometimes I match with people and we talk, sometimes we don’t. Sometimes the talking goes somewhere and we schedule a date, sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes the date turns into two, you get the gist. 

But never after it didn’t pan out have I ever been like “man, what a waste of time!” I’ve thought “wow that was a bad date!” But neither of us going into the date could’ve predicted that. And sometimes I think it went great but they don’t, but again, neither of us could’ve predicted that!

Are there just hoards of people out there that are lying about their intentions and leading people into monogamous relationships so they can dump them and waste their time? 

Who are these villains?!?!

I’m just so amazed at this concept that your time is wasted when the whole point of dating is that MOST PEOPLE WONT WORK OUT! That’s why you make that person a life partner when it does.

70,n1fjp9,1619734034,I'm so tired of guys starting to pull away as soon as I develop feelings for them,"I'm 25F and pretty inexperienced with dating--I've only been actively dating for about 6 months, never had an official relationship (though I allowed myself to get strung along for 3 months for what I thought was becoming a relationship). I'm reasonably attractive, and have plenty of matches on the apps I've been using. Guys seen generally pretty enthusiastic about me--Never been ghosted, and only one guy I went out with didn't ask for a second date. 

I connect with people and develop feelings pretty slowly in general--I'm typically ""meh"" about most guys until about the 5th date or so. I keep being pursued by guys who initially come on really strong that I'm ""meh"" about at first. They'll be the only one initiating texting conversations and dates for weeks at a time and are generally the first ones to declare feelings. After we keep hanging out, I start to develop feelings for these guys and become a lot more enthusiastic. I'll start initiating more conversations and dates, and then gradually, I become the one running things and seemingly the only one making an effort. Suddenly they become hesitant when I start asking them to hang out, or they start taking several hours to respond to texts where they responded instantly before. I'll tell them I really like them (which they've told me several times before by this point), and they get awkward about returning the sentiment. Soon enough, things end one way or another. 

I'm just so frustrated that this keeps happening. I try not to come off clingy or anything, and it's not like I'm demanding all of their attention... but that feeling of waning interest is the worst. Like as soon I'm finally getting fully comfortable with someone and reciprocating the feelings they claim to have, they change their mind and I end up hurt.

72,n1fmfb,1619734255,"I hate dating applications, it's mechanical"," Hi!

Let me introduce myself, I am a 22 year old man who is sociable, rather intelligent, curious, empathetic and passionate. Physically speaking I am handsome, people often tell me so, apparently I even look like Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders (I've never watched this show btw), at least more than a dozen girls told me so with a big smile. I also have an ease to speak and to captivate my interlocutor.

I have a lot of friends that we call ""real"" with whom I have very strong ties. Being sociable I have a lot of facility to meet people, to banter and more if affinities.

As far as my sex life is concerned, I'm not what you would call a Don Juan, I'm experienced but I've missed a lot of opportunities in my life because I'm very indecisive in my relationships. I was always interested too late. I could say that I was unconsciously reversing the roles: I was disposing as a girl would. And knowingly, sometimes (often?), when you reverse the roles, girls tend to be extremely confused because they (the beautiful ones anyway) are used to men chasing them.

The problem is that at the moment I'm doing a little bit less dating so I decided to register on Tinder but this kind of application frustrates me; I hate talking by message, I find it empty, boring, mechanical, the opposite of real dating. So I deign to talk one or two days with the girls but it takes too much energy. So I ask to meet in real life and have a drink somewhere but I have the impression that they find it strange that I ask this ""so fast"", which I find absurd.

I've just started, who knows, one will soon deign to get out of her comfort zone (Or it's me who has to get out of my comfort zone?).

On the other hand, a few days ago I went to a party in a public park with a thousand people and I lost my friends very early in the evening, in the end I ended my evening at 5 am with a lot of strangers. I had sex with a girl, had several numbers (although I was not really interested in them).

But now, on these applications I feel like I'm losing all my social skills, I hate to know that these so-called ""social"" applications make social interactions so mechanical. It's sad (to me anyway) to know that many people prefer to talk to each other virtually than to exchange moments of life in real life. It separates us more than it helps in my eyes. It annoys me deeply.

I think it's crazy that I have to talk about nothing and nothing in awkward and meaningless conversations in order to get a date after several weeks, just because it's ""the norm"" now.

This is just a rant but it almost makes me sad.

84,n1gst0,1619737681,Not compatible I think? Not fair to her to continue seeing each other,"So before I start off I want to make it clear that I am coming from a good place and my intentions are whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've\[23M\] have been seeing this girl\[20F\] for the past 3 months. We became official almost 3 weeks ago. We fell really hard for each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first relationship by the way so I'm new to all these feelings and emotions so please dont judge me too hard, I mean well. I grew up in a very traditional family, around people with similar viewpoints (when it comes to relationships), etc. The reason I bring this up is because me and my gf have had some issues in terms of our expecations/boundaries when it comes to being official. I've tried my best to put myself in her shoes and she has also tried to  see things from my point of view but we have still had moments where we feel tension because of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples of what I'm talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

We actually spoke about becoming official before I asked her to be official and we were both ecstatic and excited about it, we have both expressed that we are the happiest weve been in a long time. That weekend she mentioned to me that she would be going out with a male ex coworker for lunch on her day off (. (Like I said please dont judge me too hard, this is just the way I feel so I'm being completely truthful about it.) Anyway, I wasnt really comfortable with the situation and we had to talk about it but I made it clear that I wouldnt force her to do anything and that I would never ask anything unreasonable of her. I also made it clear that I understand that men and women can be completely platonic. Still I feel the way I feel because of the expectations I have from the people I have grown up with and have been exposed to. I just expressed to her how I felt. She ended up cancelling plans with her coworker.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards she and I talked about it a bit more and she explained thoroughly their relationship and how they are friends and have known each other for a long time and it is strictly platonic. At the time I still felt strange about it but tried to make myself be more open minded and trusting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently, she brought up that a new coworker personal trainer at the gym she works at had asked a couple of the girls if they wanted to workout with him but had declined him, she ended up taking him up on his offer and they exchanged numbers. She wanted to let me know about it to see how I felt and to be transparent. I appreciated the transparency and told her it was fine but I did ask some questions to get a better feel for the situation. I posted on reddit and asked for some advice on how I was feeling and the following day I let her know that I really valued her letting me know about these things and that I really valued her transparency. I was also given advice that I agree with a lot, and made it clear that I have no problem with it as long as it wasnt something non-work related like dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something about that conversation upset her and we ended up having a lot of tension throughout the rest of the day until we talked about it over the phone that night. She felt that I was telling her what to do and I explained to her that I would never tell her what to do, but that I would express what I would be okay with in terms of what I expect in a relationship. We ended up resolving that issue after speaking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today she texted me letting me know that she was at the gym with this guy working out, I had told her I saw no problem with it. She was super transparent with me and let me know when she finished and when she got home and we facetimed afterwards. Things are still a bit awkward but we are both trying to make this work. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my issue is this... I still dont feel comfortable with this situation of her accepting some guys invitation to workout together after work, just one on one. If I put myself in her shoes and some female coworker had asked me to workout together I would have found an excuse to not accept it because thats the way I feel about relationships.   


AGAIN, I want to make it clear that I dont think she is doing anything wrong. Shes being awesome and transparent with me and I value that so so much. I havent asked anything unreasonable of her and I never will. I just dont think I will ever get past this feeling and I dont think its fair for either of us to continue seeing each other if we are gonna have these differences in expectations when it comes to relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying I really am, but I dont want to continue this and have us get more invested in each other and have one of us/both of us end up getting hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not coming from a place of insecurity, I know I'm a decent guy with good values and I do care about this girl but I feel that it is unfair to both of us to continue when I feel we are incompatible.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n1gst0/not_compatible_i_think_not_fair_to_her_to/

My friends are all married and have kids already and I quite frankly, have never had a real girlfriend sadly. 

I’ve tried putting myself out there with dating apps including the premium ones like Match and it hasn’t yielded any results. Granted I do admit I’m picky when I do go out on dates they never really want anything serious. I want to be a dad one day so dating an older woman is out of the question since I assume most wouldn’t want to have kids in their late thirties or early forties. With all due respect I could be wrong about that? 

Either way I’m currently single and kinda giving up hope on meeting someone.

She seems to tease me a lot but most of the time she does it if there is one more person with us because maybe otherwise she gets nervous when we are alone???

92,n1i040,1619741478,"Really into girl I've been seeing, want to keep things alive romantically while we're gone for the summer","So I've had 4 dates with this girl over the past 2 ish months. All but the last were really long. I enjoyed them and I got the impression that she did as well.

Anyway, this semester of college is pretty much over. I saw her for the last time yesterday. When she left my place, I said to her ""stay in touch, alright?"" and she replied with a laugh saying ""obviously!"". I'll take that as a good sign.

My main issue is I'm afraid she'll friendzone me. We haven't done anything past hugging or cuddling. On our third date we cuddled for like 9 hours, and she was gently rubbing my arm for the longest time. I really regret not asking if I could kiss her then, or at least trying something. I don't regret not making a move yesterday though. She was here for about 3 hours (finals week, she's busy) and we cuddled while watching a movie but after that, we just continued to talk while she was sat up. Point is, it didn't feel right yesterday, but if definitely did the time before.

So now I'm kind of wanting to make my intentions really clear. So far the most I've done in this regard would be when we planned to hang out for the last time. I said ""I'd like to see you at least once more before we leave"". When we were deciding on the day, and she was the only one busy, I said ""whichever day gives us more time is the one im for"".

But I kind of want to be explicit. Im afraid she thinks I'm not very interested in her (tho I've made the plans for every date) because I haven't made a move. At some point I want to mention that I wanted to kiss her but I'm afraid this will drive her away. Not sure what to do as far as keeping this alive romantically for 3ish months over the summer.

I will say though, it may be a good thing that we haven't done much yet. I feel like it would be a lot harder/more straining to go a summer without seeing each other if we were both very into each other and had progressed sexually.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n1i040/really_into_girl_ive_been_seeing_want_to_keep/

No matter how shitty their shit is, you need to react to it the right way. You have to be over all of your shit basically. I have no idea how I’d react to kids. And I have no idea how I’d react to a relationship. Even though my friend tells me I’m nice and I’d make a good boyfriend for someone. I kinda think I maybe wouldn’t.

We've had our share of ups and downs, times when we are super affectionate, times when we are more distant but overall I love him, I know he loves me and it usually works. lately though I feel more like a roomate or friend than a gf. We dont have sex as often as before, but are still super affectionate. He kisses me, walks me to work, runs across the house without prompt to grab my food out of the oven because I fear getting burned. We talk, a lot. About our emotions, this problem and many other things.

The problem is we just dont spend much real time together. We are saving for a house so he upped his hours at work which means he now has long hours. I work and am in school which takes up most of my time. And we both have depression and anxiety.  I'm on stable meds and do relatively okay, he is just beginning to understand his depression. 
I know mental illness is a huge factor in this case. But at the same time I also want more. We used to cuddle and watch movies and go for walks and play games, now we come home, eat together usually while watching a show then do our own thing until bed because we need to decompress. 
Weve tried planning monthly date nights, weekly talking sessions, game nights, movie days etc but something always comes up or is forgotten. I know I play my part in it, we both act the same way towards each other.
