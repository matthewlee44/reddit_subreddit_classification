We got super comfortable with one another quick, and i personally felt like it was moving in a postive direction. It is winter so theres not much to do outside when its in the single digits, so most of the time we just hung out at eachothers respective places and would go out to dinner. One day he just stoped talking to me and then the next day he ended the relationship cuz he felt like we were getting in to a routine. Of course it stung, but i accepted it and tried to move on. Now reflecting on it im just a little confused, i feel like he should of said something if he felt like it was getting in a routine...

So the reason I’m writing is because I feel like I made a mistake that caused it to take a 180 in literally less than 12 hours. 

So first a little background about me. I from a relationship standpoint have no experience. Most my interactions are just typically all FWB. Most guys would be saying, “oh heck yeah!” As I have gotten older I realized I don’t want that anymore. This is where I think the first problem comes from. I’m use to escalating quickly and typically beingsexual almost immediately. 

Now to meat and potatoes. So we go on a date. We plan it almost two days in advance. We talk(text) everyday leading up to it almost all day. The date goes extraordinarily well. We talk from 5:30 till the place closes(9:30). I’m blown away personally. We leave, we hug and go our separate ways. 

As I sit in my car all I can think to myself is I want to go on another date. I drove off and as I am about to send her a text and say I had a great time and I’d like to see her again. I get one. We both expressed how we’d like to see each other again. We keep texting all the way till we go to sleep.

Following morning I wake up to good morning texts and I follow through with my own.  Same as the other days we talk all throughout the day at work. Things turn a little spicy against my better judgement. She’s into it and keeps it going. we get off work she can’t wait to get home to bring it up another notch(no explanation needed). 

Same thing happens Friday. We talked throughout the day and it turns spicy towards the end of the workday. She gets home we continue talking and this time it’s leads to me getting invited over(I also did the previous day but said I want her 100% sure and she wasn’t). It goes well for both that night. 

We go out Saturday as planned. The date didn’t go nearly as good as the first one, not terrible though. We had talked about going back to her place afterwards. So I walk her to her car. This is where I think everything fell apart. 

So because we had planned on going to her place, we got to her car and I mentioned it. Looking back at it she seemed a little on the fence but, she said okay. She wanted a drink from Starbucks first and I said I’d meet her there(her place).  

We end up at her place but she falls asleep immediately on me, literally. Not wanting to disturb her I sit tight. Eventually she wakes up and I asked if I can kiss her she said yes. She falls asleep again. I suggest that maybe she should go lay down in her bed and rest and that I could head out. She said the bed sounds nice but she gave me a non-answer on me leaving.

I stuck around for a bit laying with her. I escalated a bit she said she just wanted to sleep which is fine. Here at this point she’s still cuddling me, hands interlocked. She’s out for about an hour before I wake her up saying I need to leave. I hug and kiss her goodbye.

I shoot her a text that I got back about  6:30pm. I get I text the following morning about 7:30. She hits me a with a, “I don’t know what came over me last night.”. I just say it’s no big deal we should just rest up and enjoy the rest of our weekend. 

I shoot her a snap later and end up texting and ask how her day was. I asked if she’s open to another date later in the week maybe. She responds with and I’m paraphrasing , ”I don’t know that I am developing the connection that I’d like to. I just don’t get that spark.”

I guess my overall question is did she feel that the relationship that I was looking for was purely physical? That I had no interest in her as a person? I know I should’ve asked more about her. Is the situation able to be rectified? If so, how should I go about it? It’s been a week and we left each other on good terms. No one’s blocked or delete. 

For what it’s worth though. I would be OK with forfeiting the physical aspect until she’s ready. I definitely care more about her than sex. I know I have some issues to work on and how to convey feelings.

TLDR:  I think that the she thought I just wanted her for a physical relationship. In reality that’s not what I was pursuing even though in hindsight that is kind of how it presented itself. After a mediocre date we went back to her place and she fell asleep on me(literally). Next day she said she wasn’t developing the connection she wanted. Can I correct the situation? Part of me just wants to text or call her and say, “ I may have presented myself as just wanting a relationship physically but I wanted more than that.”

I’m also off my fucking rocker writing this probably. I typed all this out on mobile so I’m sending it anyway. If you made it this far you’re a G.

Usually it's me giving advice on this subforum but now it's me asking for advice. How the tables have turned. 🤣

I recently met a woman from my online community around two weeks ago. We talk everyday, voice chat most of the times, and sometimes play video games with each other. It has been the sweetest time hanging out with her online. She is seemingly so sweet, kind, and sincere and I can't wait to know her more.

She recently wanted to do a postcard exchange so we exchanged addresses and sent each other postcards. So, hence I got her address.

Valentine's Day is coming up and I'm tempted to send her flowers or at least some kind of gift to say thank you for our online time together.

The problem is I'm unsure if I should send her flowers.

First off, I'm over a decade younger than her. I don't think age is really a matter because I always date older women. The thing is, I'm scared I might freak her out if I send flowers to her. I'm not sure if she sees me as a little brother or not. I've made it clear with her that she has a crush on me and she kinda just smiles and chuckles a little.

Yesterday I asked her to let me know if she gets uncomfortable with me liking her and she said ""I don't know what to say honestly. But that's sweet of you -- thank you"". But my surprisement, she hasn't given me the ""friendzone talk"" like most girls have done to me.

Second, I'm scared that if I send her flowers she might get upset because I'm taking advantage for having her address. I'm tempted to sorta ask if it's okay for me to send flowers but that ruins the whole surprise for it.

Anyways, I really like her. It's okay if she doesn't feel the same way but I still really wanna send her flowers as a gesture for thank you.

Also, how do I send flowers when I'm in the US and she's in Canada? Haha

This event was organized by people in my industry for people in my industry, meaning old, current, &amp; potential future co-workers would be there. I made this clear to him. They all show up to the event, all is well. An hour goes by and in passing my guy informs me that he has had 6 beers. SIX. I am sitting behind my table of art, I can't monitor him. WTF. Anyway, at the end of the show I get up from my table to go buy art from someone else. When I get back I see him, sitting behind my table, with a crowd of former and current co-workers all standing around as he tells everyone that he is me, and proceeds to explain / try to sell my art. He's being loud and silly but not harmful or anything I guess...I proceed to pack up my art since the show is over. I thank the hosts of the event for having me, one of them says, 'you know, your friends drank ALL of the beer!...even the expired beer that was in the back of our fridge'...I apologize and get the fuck out. His friends were normal adults, bought some art and had a drink or 2 while he downed 6 beers in an hour. I'm embarrassed. Later, in private, I sent him home and let him know I was pissed. He thought he was just being funny but sincerely apologized. And the next day wrote me a long and thoughtful apology text.

I (30F) broke up with my ex (30M) about a month ago. I had just had an abortion and I wasn’t feeling very good emotionally, mentally and physically. He was there for me for the first and second day (Saturday and Sunday). He promised me he would come see me in the middle of the week to spend a night with me. He had mentioned it a few times. He worked about 45 min away with a friend of his and he would stay at his house during the week. The problem was, I barely spoke to him during the week when he was with this particular friend. He didn’t really check on me or call me. So when Wednesday came and he called me for a whole 2 minutes and he asked if he couldcome over and see me the next day, Thursday. I was so happy he was coming and I really needed him, I was sad and feeling down and he knew I was emotional after what I had just went through.

The thing is he was great when we were together, I adored him. He gave me his undecided attention but I had had issue in the past with him kinda forgetting about me when he was around this friend. Sometimes he even did it with some of his other friends and family. He was like a dog running to anyone who would feed him. I’m ashamed to admit I would  beg for his love at times. We would address the problem, argue about it and eventually he would promise me that he would work harder at not making me feel like I don’t matter and that he didn’t care. Because that is how he made me feel.

When Thursday came and he was suppose to come over after work he said he wasn’t going to come anymore and that he would just come on the weekend. That it didn’t make sense that he drove all that way to see me and leave again in the morning. Why did he keep promising me he would come?

I was upset that he had let me down and done this to me one too many times. So I told him that if he didn’t come it would just prove to me that I didn’t mean anything to him and that there would be no reason for us to stay together. He said that I was a moron for thinking that it was even a good idea and that he wasn’t coming and to just break up with him. So I did. We didn’t speak for the rest of the day. 

That evening he text me asking me what was the point in him coming. I ignored him. The next day he text me asking if we were really breaking up because he didn’t come over. I said yes and for multiple other reasons. He asked me if I was sure. I said yes. He said he was glad it was over and blocked me on everything.

I never asked him to come over. It was never my idea but I was happy he came up with it. It made me feel important. He always did things like that. Like he would just say things I wanted to hear to make me happy and then in the end I was left disappointed. He thought I would just keep forgiving him. 

The last couple of days I’ve been getting private calls. I picked up a couple but the rest I have ignored. I know it’s him. All he is doing is listening and not saying anything.

I would never want to be with him again, I was just hoping for some feedback on what you guys think. Why didn’t he fight to be with me? He said he loved me and I know he did so why did he treat me like this? Should I have handled this differently? I would love all your raw and honest replys!

I knew her a bit before we started to have active contact last autumn. One thing I noticed right at the beginning was that she really takes a lot of time to answer texts, which made keeping up a conversation via text very difficult. Don't get me wrong, I know that some girls, especially my age **(M19)** tend to leave messages unanswered for a couple of hours or maybe a day. But with her, I'm easily waiting 1-2 weeks or so - I can for sure say that she's quite ""known"" for not responding early to anybody tho. I might also add that we didn't do a casual small-talk via chat, we still had some deeper topics and all. Anyways, because I realized that texting wouldn't work out in long term, I decided to ask her if we'd do smth together. My intention was and is to date her and approach/get closer with her. Throughout the first 2 months, we went to a restaurant twice and visited an art gallery once. There we had interesting and even deep talks. Sadly I got ill pretty badly throughout the winter and I didn't come up with any ideas for a possible meeting or anything + our chat hit a dead end too. Surprisingly (after I forgot to respond for a while) she texted me and asked if everything was fine and all. I replied and I'm still waiting (even longer than usual this time) for a reply from her. Now I'm at a point where I'm wondering about several questions:

\- Does it make sense to continue chatting, when waiting for a reply becomes incredibly tedious

\- The 1-2 months of lost communication and not doing something together -&gt; Is it too late to try again?

\- How do I know if she's really into dating? As I said, we've known each other before (more as acquaintances you don't often talk to), and idk if she understood my intentions before.

i started a new wfh job around this time last year. its a small team and even though weve never seen each other in person, we do group videocalls often.

a couple of weeks later one of the girls asked me for my phone number so she could call me over work related stuff because there was something wrong with her internet connection. then she started texting me and asking personal questions and then sending me selfies, saying stuff like ""wow look at my eyebags! i'm so tired today"" and so on. I did what any other guy would do (i'm not a teenager btw, we're both in our 30s) I asked her if she wanted to go get a beer or something sometime. she instantly did a 180º and said she wasn't interested in me. I didn't take an issue with that, i'm an adult and can take a rejection just fine, I figured maybe I just misunderstood her messages.

sometime later she started sending me more selfies saying she bought new makeup and asking me if it looked good on her. this included some really dark red lipstick and in nearly all of them she was puffing her lips too, I thought maybe she changed her mind. so I asked her out again and got the same response and she stopped texting me for a while.

then later she started texting me again but. I decided I wasn't going to ask her out a 3rd time and seem desperate and possibly even get in trouble at work. then she started sending me really risky pictures, saying she bought new lacy underwear (like a red corset and stuff) sending me pictures and asking me if it suited her figure and so on. well I asked her out again and got rejected.

I could keep going but you get the idea. this has happened more than 10+ times so far. couple of weeks ago she sent me pictures of herself at the gym and before that wearing a bikini at a pool. keep in mind I never initiated any of these exchanges, nope, this is all her. what is going on here? i talked about this with a friend and he told me that maybe she is sending me those pictures to get a reaction then she is screencapping my messages and sharing them with a bf or a group chat for laughs. what would you do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157455,public,self,coworker sends risky pictures but refuses to meet up with me...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sllwd9/coworker_sends_risky_pictures_but_refuses_to_meet/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,,,

This date was planned about 2 weeks ago almost immediately after our first date, but unfortunately couldn’t happen until supposedly this weekend since I was out of town the last two weeks. 

We were talking pretty much every day. However, yesterday and today, I found it odd that he hadn’t confirmed our plans for this evening even though he was the one who initiated it. 

I asked him if we were still meeting up later and he said it slipped his mind, his parents made plans for tonight and asked for a rain check. I told him I understood since it was planned pretty far out. He replied saying he felt super bad for forgetting and he was really looking forward to tonight but it just slipped his mind. 

I try to be a very understanding person. I get things come up and again this was planned two weeks ago. But something about the whole thing just didn’t sit right with me. If it’s something that he was looking forward to, I don’t get how people just forget about it.

Obviously, I'm gonna battle to prove them wrong, I read people who manage a 5 day on, 5 off, once they get the condition more stable, which would work for me actually, I'd make what 'sick pay' is a year in the UK, in two months, but that shows you just how bad it is if I can't work.

My son is now almost 15 months old. His father is not in the picture at all. I know I should focus on my son, and not stress about dating. But it's been two years since I've even had a date. People say don't look and love will come. But I can't help feeling so lonely. I am a mother now, but I am still a person, with my own needs.

All my close friends are either in long term relationships, or married. Although I would like to find love and be blissfully happy, I know that I don't really have the time, compare to other women with no kids.

Balancing work with my baby has been difficult, and my parents are still working, so I can't just ask them to babysit every weekend, because I want to have a social life. But every night, I feel this unbearable loneliness. Like I am missing out and everyone is having a blast.

Last september we were drunk and i kissed her, she kiss me back but a week later she told me she did not wanted me to do it again, and i agreed, the friendship changed a bit but we still hanged out and face time and talk almost everyday, in november we went to a trip and we were sharing the same bedroom, we were kinda drunk, she went to bed with me because i was a bit jealous of a guy and started to tell me to don’t be mad and she started to bite me, i ignored her and she just was there in the bed, i tried to kiss her and she said no, later that day when we arrived back home she sent me a text message telling me that we needed boundaries, i told her that she was right and we needed boundaries, i did not knew how to talk her so we did not talked for about 3 days, until we talk about in person and i said that i was sorry and that it will never happen again, during the holidays we did not talked that much, probably twice during december.

January arrived and we started to talk again on a daily basis, i knew i screwed everything by trying to kiss her again so i was just offering her my friendship, i swear i never tried anything again, we went out with a group of friends and we were together, we were drinking alcohol her grabbed each other hand to walk her to the restroom or to grab a drink but that was eat, i have done that with other female friends and this was no exception, we were dancing with the group and then she randomly told me that if i tried to kiss her she will punch me, we just laughed and told her that i will not do it, i was kind of drunk and i told her that i was sorry about the past and that i love her as a friend and i really appreciate her friendship and that i don’t want to screw it again and that i want to fix my mistakes from the past, she told me that it was fine and that she loved me back and that everything was cool between us.

At the end of the night we were going to sleep together but just as friends, i was not thinking about trying to make a move with her because of everything that happened in the past, she started seducing me while we were on the bed and it happen, before everything started she told me that it was just a one night stand and that it will never happen again, i did oral sex to her and she gave me oral sex back too, and we slept together cuddling, today i don’t know what to think about that since i don’t know if it was a mistake and everything will go to shit between us.

I will appreciate if you guys can give me some advice on what to do and tell me what you think about the situation.

I'm 22(F) and so is the guy I'm interested in. We're both part of a society so we meet on a weekly basis at least once but recently multiple times a week (not always alone -&gt; society). Long story short, I like him and I think he likes me too but I don't know how to initiate that conversation, we have moments alone but I feel like it's never the right time to just say something. What's worse is he's friends are now picking up on the fact that I may like him and are teasing me about it both in his presence and out. I've spoken to some of my closer friends who know me well but aren't in the society and they've all pretty much said that I have a flirty personality and I flirt unintentionally with almost everyone, and so for him it may get confusing to know if I'm actually interested or just going about my usual day. The issue is I'd say I'll stop flirting with people but I genuinely don't know how I'm unintentionally flirting. I have a very giddy personality and quite sociable so I make good conversations with anyone in a short space of time. Maybe this looks like I'm flirting because I know many girls are reserved, but I tend to get reserved when I'm really nervous around someone. And that just happens to be around him, til I get drunk or have a random burst of confidence to just talk to him normally. I don't want to adjust my entire personality just to let someone get the hint I like them. There's already been a handful of people in the society that have shown me interest and I've respectfully turned down. 

Anyway beyond just catching glimpses and glares at each other whether we're hanging out together or on the opposite sides of the room, there's been other things that have happened to suggest he might like me. I really don't want to read into it, but if I don't I'm not going to have the confidence to say anything about it ever. We usually go and do activities as a society which he gets to choose who gets a lift from who as the organizer. He's said to me multiple times, he choses who he wants in his car and who he feels closest to (not in distance as in friendship). And multiple times he's given me lifts everywhere, he often invites me to his house before hand instead of picking me up from my house (we live 5 mins apart) so we can hangout for a bit before we head off and usually get to wherever earlier so we've got alone time again. If I get cold he'll offer me one of his ""favourite"" hats or something. I've hung out with him and his mates at their house once or twice and at this point I'm a regular guest and quite a familiar face with his housemates. He's also a very slow replier to a lot of people in the society and before we were friends of sort he'd take days to reply to me but now his replies are pretty instant and keeps me up to date. If we're doing a certain activity he'll find a way to hover around me but sometimes shies away from actually talking to me. We often play fight a little only if we're having an alone moment in a crowded space. There was a time when something didn't fit me right for the activity we were doing and several people tried to help me but after them all trying to help me for a second they just let him help me by himself. They all kind of felt uncomfortable touching me in certain places as it was quite an intimate gesture (btw it was only my legs so not that intimate for other ppl to leave him to it). But this was happening when the speculations of me liking him were out so they all basically knew I'd feel more comfortable if he helped me. He made sure I was comfortable with him touching me but seemed very relaxed when helping me. Idk how to explain it, he wasn't being weird and awkward about it. It just felt relaxed and normal, just made me feel special that he took care of me like that. It really wasn't a bit deal- he could have easily shrugged it off and say it'll do. But he made sure he kept adjusting it til I was fully comfortable. 

With all that being said, I heavily rely on verbal communication to know if someone actually likes me and really don't want to read into something and look stupid for even thinking he might even like me. He personally hasn't said anything about liking me or perhaps even hinting at it (unless he has and I've completely missed the bullet). Random addition, we were at a party once and I was genuinely out of it, I happened to walk past him and his friend rushed passed us, and yelled as he walked by ""xxxx Loves you!!! He loves you!!"". I was too drunk to respond so I carried on walking as I saw him just looking shocked and yelling over the person to cancel out the noise. I was so drunk, I don't even remember who told me, I think, not sure. 

I've been single for almost two years and decided to be out of the dating scene completely til I felt comfortable to trust someone again. And was in a relationship for the past 5 years before that. And now I have forgotten the game apart from flirting like a little school girl again. So it really has been a while. 

So long story really short. What do I do? How do I admit that I like him even though his friends are saying it out loud left right and center. Or how do I get him to ask me out? Idk just how? Somehow I can pull all the guys I don't want, even ones with gfs but not the one I actually want.

I went through my bfs phone.. I hate doing it but we are recently getting over infidelity and it was through his phone. (I didn’t find him cheating) 
He has deleted instagram due to infidelity (it was on dating sites) and also due to me being extremely uncomfortable about him looking at those anime cosplay girls and lots of girls who only post sexual content. He chose to do it, not me. I told him he didn’t have to. The looking at girls on instagram has been a problem our entire relationship. (Again, not girls he knows in real life) I thought he finally understood how I felt. 
Turns out he made a fake account and follows them all. The main problem is that they’re almost all asians with big boobs and it seems that it’s an extreme fetish of his. It’s not just the anime cosplay girls it’s a clear obsession asian women…. Well… I’m caucasian as it gets. Big nose like the rest of us white people and i have small boobs (barely a b cup) I’m not super conceded or anything but i’m definitely in my boyfriends league. I have a nice shape and consider myself attractive just no boobs. Of course I still feel self conscious at sometimes but I feel like people know when they are somewhat conventionally attractive. (still can’t stand comparing myself to instagram or tiktok girls..) But the point is… I am not what he wants. How can he fetishize asian girls so much but yet be with me? It’s not as simple as him dating a brunette but also liking blondes… It’s something i physically can never attain. I feel happy he’s not cheating but I just feel so damn defeated. Every time I convince myself i’m enough for him he goes behind my back to look at the girls again. And it’s like if he’s hiding this then what else is he hiding? I don’t know what my question is exactly but if someone wants to give me some advice i’d appreciate it… also, i am not against p*rn. I don’t particularly like if he watches it but I do too so how could I ever create that double standard? I just feel like instagram is so much more personal.

I am twenty-five I have been single for more than ten years, the occasional fling has come my way but do to the insulation of my community taking so long to fade off I have really only been exposed to Caucasian women and Latin women, now I am chicano but my father is a guero and I look Caucasian (I believe I have more sallow complexion than average,higher cheekbones and wavier hair but I digress) every since I was small I have been attracted to either latin women or black women/WOCs. I can clearly remember watching the Nickelodeon programme hey arnold when I was n o older than two or three years of age when I saw Gerald's sister Timberly come into frame-an animated character of course but even at that tender impressionable age I thought oh my goodness what a precious loveable adorable little girl, i would love to be her daddy and be able tolove her and do for her and shower her with praise and affection.  As I grew up gradually I noticed I viewed blonde haired white women more as objects to be possessed and fought over than real approach able people the female counterpart to historical oppressors and colonizers and figures of authority rather than women to be approached. I can understand with self awareness and wanting to have daughters in the future that bigoted thinking is wrong as far as objectifing any women. I Still saw public figures of colour-women especially as more attractive physically and emtionally,a black women deals with some much (once again antiquated thinking putting people in boxes and marginalizing experience by lumping all women together by looks) black women face the same plights as their lighter counterparts and still have to deal with both subverted and overted racism on a daily basis black women can be made to feel to foreign,exotic,masculine,aggressive,dominant,promiscuous,militant,exclusive ect meanwhile trying to protect themselves and their sanity. As a culture we have made it acceptable for others to freely appropriate \\emulate black feminine culture in the form of music,preforming arts,visual arts,nail culture (pre Hellenistic Egyptians actually had both hair extensions,dyes,ivory and bone nail press ons and nail lacquer often of a reddish hue and were peopled by groups whom today and a t the time would be viewed as black) so I guess I am curious does this have an origin? Why do i think this way? I can see I am bigoted but am I fetishizing or does my belief of black women being the most beautiful,strong,kind,copied,oppressed and chased women have merit. I have dated in and around my own ethnic background and have pretty much just dated women who look like me do to social climates and restraints ie its hard for me to get out of my small town and meet the women I genuinely want to and when I do meet women I like(in high school I met a beautiful girl o f Ethiopian extraction whom I sort of flirted on and off with but nothing came of it) we never click.

(Got mad if I talked about my favorite football team, or if I played my DnD character in a manner she didn't like and things like that) this doesn't mean it was all on her though but she ended up in an emotional relationship with 1 of our friends and now we are here...

But now I have the issue of I have never dated before. I' e only ever been in a relationship 2 times, once in 3rd or 4th grade and then with her since sophomore year. I have no clue how to start. I've looked at the dating apps and I'm pretty awkward in communications. People in the real world like my weirdness but it doesn't come across in text, and I've never had confidence in myself until recently (I apparently choose horrible friend groups) after I started actively working out/losing weight and helping build a business.

I (23F) have lost all interest in dating and sex. I’ve been in a couple relationship and several situationships and I just have no interest anymore. I meet someone I like and immediately just play out every scenario in my head, and even in the best case scenario I am not satisfied.

I have men reaching out to me and I feel horrible for saying I’m not interested because it is usually taken wrong. I want to be interested. 

For example, a man I was interested in for years, and is literally everything I want in a partner asked me on a date next weekend.

I said yes, and plan on going, but I have zero sex drive and as much as I want to want it, I just can’t bring myself to want a relationship. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe I just need to be alone for a while, I prefer to be alone actually, but I feel like this isn’t normal. It’s weird because I want to be married with kids at some point but my mind and body are telling me no.

I just need to know if anyone else goes through this…I feel crazy.

Let me start from the beginning. A couple of years ago I went on a community bike ride and there was this very cute guy who was one of the ones leading the ride. I met him briefly during the ride and then ran into him a time or two later, but didn’t end up hanging out with him directly. Then I moved out of town and that was that. Fast forward to a few years later, I was swiping through Bumble and saw a familiar face. We matched and it took me a minute, but I realized it was this guy from the bike ride where I used to live. It turns out that he was in my new city on a work assignment. Once we met up in person, for some reason I wasn’t feeling as attracted this time around, but he was persistent and I developed more attraction over time. Interestingly, a lot of people assume he is gay through his mannerisms, however, he has denied any attraction to men, and he’s consistently shown much enthusiasm for being sexual with me and other women he’s dated I would imagine. But I digress... Eventually his job assignment ended and we were separated by distance, but we’ve always kept in touch, although not so much when he was dating a woman in our hometown for a bit. I moved back to town during the pandemic and we started hanging out recently. I like his company a lot and he’s really smart and funny. But there are a few issues. He’s always kind of had bad breath but sometimes it’s not as bad and or I block it out somehow. I have walked away from guys in the past because of the bad breath issue, but with this guy I can’t seem to reject him now because of our friendship and history. Also, his house stinks. He has 3 cats and when I left his house yesterday I noticed that my jacket smelled like cat scat and kitty litter. I really do like and appreciate this guy and am wondering if there could be a way to share these issues I have described without offending him or wrecking our connection. Also, he once mentioned something about having a BO issue, but I’ve never noticed armpit odor but rather the bad breath issue I’ve described. At that the time he mentioned this, I could not bring myself to bring it up with him from my end and perhaps it was the perfect opportunity. However, I was not ready. Could he even fix the breath issue I wonder?
