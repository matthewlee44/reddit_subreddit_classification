Shortly after having sex, she told me it was the best sex she’d had in her life, and I should feel special. While this grabbed my attention, I was more interested in how intimate we were after. I know that intimacy is expected in a hookup, but it felt real and not forced. Not only that but she kept bringing up stuff that we could do in the future (i.e. going to a drive in movie some day, me teaching her how to play guitar, etc…). After we watched a movie, we went for a walk and she really started to open up to me, telling me about her friendships and how she feels about certain friends. All of that being said, I felt like we shared a real connection and not something manifested purely off of sexual desire. She decided to sleep at my house, and in the morning we had sex again and shared more equally intimate moments.

I probably go on at least one date a week, which is only limited by my odd schedule as an airline pilot. On apps, or in person I am pretty honest, I am just looking to have really fun dates. I enjoy dinning at fine restaurants, going on outdoor adventures, drinking at high end bars, going sporting events, seeing shows, ballets, or concerts; not necessarily “normal” first date activities.

 I am extremely extroverted, I can carry a conversation and talk about nearly anything. My dates tend to open up quickly, as I am not judgmental, I am empathetic and a good listener. I also share an equal amount about myself.  I think a lot of it comes from my job, sitting next to a complete stranger on a trip, trapped in a flight deck; I get lots of practice talking. 

Typically the date ends with a friendly hug or maybe a kiss on the cheek. I very rarely hook up with the lady, if I do it is typically because she initiated it. From there, I usually just slowly let texting conversations die out. 

I know most of my dates want a relationship or something more than just one date. But I honestly don’t. I am pretty content with my lifestyle. I like being able to do exactly what I want to do, when I want to do it. I am gone 15-18 days a month. Sometimes I am beat after a trip and just want chill. I don’t feel like I am in a place where I would make a good partner; I don’t think it would be fair to them. However, I still feel guilty slowly killing each relationship. There is nothing apparently wrong with any of the ladies I have dated and I was very upfront in what I was looking for from the start. 

I am not going to stop dating, but is there a way I can be more gentle? I really don’t want to hurt anyone, but I am sure I have in the past.

I’m wondering if anyone has had experience moving past sexual trauma. I guess you can call my trauma serious. I won’t minimize it, but I only go into it during therapy. I’ve heard some individuals become more promiscuous when they deal with their trauma. I was the opposite and became avoidant of any potential sexual encounter. As a result, I’m extremely inexperienced and it weighs heavily on me. I don't fear judgment from women, but the loss is what bothers me.

I coped throughout my 20s by building myself. It’s curious how the mind defends itself but I somehow decided this was a way forward for me because I was scared and had no clue how to handle what I was going through. I was also raised in a way that discouraged asking for help or having flaws. It has been worthwhile for my superficial qualities. I’ve maxed my looks, body, career ( as I’m really up in the top of my field), and everything else I could have measured. I obsessively pursued it all to a high level, but deep within myself I knew there was something still wrong with me. I sought therapy because no amount of self-awareness was uncovering the core problem.

I often feel unusual and like I’m living a lie because it feels like I developed normally otherwise. I know I have no way of proving to strangers on the internet, but I was kind of the class clown. I’ve always been witty and often told how funny I am. I seriously have never struggled socially, despite dealing with a normal level of shyness when I was a bit younger. However, when it comes to my sexuality I’m completely stunted. It’s distinctly that and since that is usually a private matter no one is aware of it. Supposedly because of my looks and that I never talk about it, people assume I fuck around. In actuality, my formative experiences were mired in suppressing my sexuality, not expressing it. I know why I did it, but it reached such a deep part of my inner self that it’s been a challenge to change it.

I’ve known people close to me getting married and it feels like they’ve lived a life I haven’t even started. Many of them have had several relationships before they reached that point. I know it would be a mistake to get married given where I am. I put no pressure on myself there, but it does signify how much time has passed. I’m also aware that I need to keep progressing with therapy because it is helping me. But I’m struggling with acceptance of losing my 20s to this. I’ve forgiven myself in that this was out of my control. I didn’t ask for this, but I have this nagging feeling that when I can be expressive enough to have sex, it won’t ever remove this pain.

""a feeling or belief that you can do something well or succeed at something"" - Merriam-Webster


I'm a very risk averse individual. I hate unknowns, uncertain outcomes and the prospect of failure. This applies to all areas of my life. I'm also a very anxious and sensitive person. My emotions usually win in the internal ""logic vs emotion"" decision making process.. 

Society seems to view self-confidence as an all-conquering essential ingredient to a prosperous life. It's importance is constantly pandered via film, TV and social media.
The acceptable line between confidence and arrogance is so murky, only continuing to further blend.

The more importance placed on self-confidence the more 'insecurity' gets ridiculed. ""Insecurities"" has become the end-all, final boss of negative justification for other people's problems...with seemingly no retort.

""Oh they have X problem, they are so insecure"" 
""They didn't agree with you on a personal subject, they must be insecure"" 
""They didn't feel comfortable doing something, probably insecure"" 

Yeah I'm insecure, SO FUCKING WHAT. 
Why does that matter?? When did we decide that the lack of self-confidence is such a terrible thing. Why?? I genuinely don't understand. 

At this point I'm insecure about being insecure lmao.

I hate disappointing people, especially once I've made any form of social or interactional commitment to them. I underpromises, overdeliver in everything. I don't want to seem arrogant or cocky.. 

I guess my point is, from all the data I have access to (personal experience, friends, media portrayals etc) 
People seem substantially less attracted to others who aren't super confident. Why?

I'm still unsure whether that's the hormones talking or my brain just wanting to see what all the relationship hype is about XD

The main problem I'm having is not meeting enough new people, amongst other things. I guess a good first step is asking you guys where I should start off first, where are good locations to meet people and get to know them? I've tried to steer clear of dating apps simply because I wouldn't rate myself anything higher than a 4/5 in looks so I figured there's not much point. I tried a little on tinder and bumble only to get one or two swipes at most. 

Also, since I'm so new to the dating scene, I only fully realised a few days ago that people mostly don't go from close friends to a relationship (as I always saw it) but from strangers/acquaintances to dating to relationship. Yeah... I'm not the brightest individual at times LOL

Imho my college seems like it would be perfect to meet new people except there's new lockdown restrictions and I'm by far not the best at getting myself out there. I'm pretty introverted but that does depend, I do tend to be energetic/excitable especially around friends - and for reasons probably linked to my somewhat low self-esteem, I've fallen for mainly introverted girls (it somehow got into my head that I had less of a chance with extroverted girls) - however, it has taken me an embarassingly long amount of time to put the jigsaw together and realise that all the girls that were interested in me were at least somewhat extroverted (opposites might attract after all!)

Anyway, if you guys have any advice either on how to get myself out there or on just in general about dating that would be appreciated!

I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued spending time and effort  investing in him. I wasn't invested initially and was seeing multiple people. 

He did his best to convince me eventually that he wanted me exclusively and was meeting my needs post which we both decided we wanted to talk to each other exclusively.

We haven't met mind you because he's in the navy and is on a ship. I had my doubts and insecurities but since we were talking everyday over video calls and text I started to get close to him. 

Now that I start falling for him, he suddenly pulls away and becomes aloof. When I ask him what's up with his behavior, he says nothing changed. However I see a start difference in his actions and what he says. The effort has diminished. I noticed this a week before his contract with the navy ended and he has to come back home for the holidays. 

I am taking this as a cue for his disinterest and assuming that perhaps he saw me as a filler for the time he had when he was on ship. It is incredibly hurtful and disrespectful and I can't help but be mad at myself for not trusting my judgement with men like this. I knew he wasn't right yet I chose to pursue him or trust him.

I am trying to come to terms with his change of behavior and wondering what I can do to stop hurting over this faster. How can I avoid situations like this in dating?

Because for a longer chunk of the time we spent talking he was meeting my/needs emotionally and this behavior is only recent. How do I avoid investing in people who pretend and lie and then eventually show you their true colors?

But the thing is everytime I ask her if we're dating she tells me that she has commitment issues , I mean fine for the beginning months that sounded like aight, like Iove her so I don't mind giving her time , but she'd posts shit like she's single and yada yada and if I accidentally make jokes about us being in a relationship then they're not harmless jokes but when she makes jokes on us about being single apparently that's humour 
Kinda confused on how to take this further , firstly I love her alot and secondly we're going great rn but I just don't get the commitment issues without having any past relationships or literally nothing.


( , I met a girl online , we fell for each other , finally we met once on a date 2 months ago kissed and that resulted in her having existential crisis since she's bi but ye after that she had my bestfriend think that she had a shot with her after having all that ' I can't date I hate labels , I've commitment issues' I'm confused now and idk what to do )",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153935,public,self,"Me (straight) With a girl (bi) for 8 months , romantically, but she refuses to date",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s95yvz/me_straight_with_a_girl_bi_for_8_months/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

Let me explain: I had my past relationships during my teenage/college years and I can't say that money was an issue. We made it work either way, even a lil more than that, but they didn't last partly because I couldn't offer emotional stability. I was young, wanted to try different stuff, move countries, you get the idea. And luckily I did them all.

Now I'm settled emotionally, but with no financial security. In fairness, it doesn't bother me that much. I know I'll get past. I know I'll get better. I'm 28M, with a bachelor's degree, and I'm working hard to get somewhere. It just takes time. Unfortunately, a long time. And sometimes all I need at the end of the day is a warm hug before going to bed

There are different factors in creating a strong bonding with someone, working together and making sacrafices. And sure, I might compensate by being (and I can say with confidence) charming, intelligent, good looking and funny. Offering all the attention and support. Whenever needed, I can surprise her by making a diy gift. But in the long term, all these things might slowly fade away when I barely make it to the end of the month and inadvertently putting pressure on myself/us.

I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) are in a LDR relationship since last 4 years. He grew up in a very toxic environment where there was no communication between anyone, neither his parents, nor his siblings. This has deeply impacted his communication skills as he is very hesitant in sharing emotional stuff. Since a couple of months, i have been noticing that he keeps a lot of stuff hidden from me that he knows might make me mad. The stuff is really miniscule in nature like, i am a vegan but he loves non vegetarian food so he used to eat meat but he never told me because he knew that I'd be hurt and angry. Another instance was, there is this toxic guy I asked him not to talk to but I saw that he is in touch with him, not very regular but once a month. They are not even good friends. But i don't like that guy because he has caused a number of problems in our relationship. 

So when I confronted him about him  hiding these tiny things, he said that he lied because he didn't wanted to hurt me. 

I understand the emotion behind these lies but now my mind is racing about other things that he might have kept hidden. How do I handle these thoughts and how can I help him communicate better?

the men i date have a lifestyle that is very different from mine: they usually don't sleep at night, smoke, don't do much sports. they get very immersed in their creative activity where they seem to forget about the outside worlds for days or weeks at a time. they typically don't have a stable income or earn less than me.  


i have flexible working hours, i'm an early bird, like to start my day with yoga. i lift weights regularly, go to the sauna and cold dipping in a river. i try to eat well. on the weekends i like to go hiking and bouldering.  


of course this is wildly incompatible with the lifestyle of my lovers. even they will tell me i should date someone who is more like me and who has more resources to spend quality time with me.however, anytime i get asked out by someone who is similar to me, i will immediately turn down the offer. i have friendzoned software devs, guys who were into biomedicine, anyone fitness-oriented.

I was very overweight so dating was kinda hard.

Now that I'm older though, and I really started taking care of myself, I get a lot more dates than I could ask for, and it's something that made me pretty happy. I enjoy getting to know people and hearing their stories. Gives me more perspective on life.

However keeping them after is something I keep failing at. I've been getting told that I'm needy or that they weren't looking for anything too serious and it's been making me paranoid that I'm suffocating dates with attention. 

Some of the things I do, that I'd need perspective on is...


1. Most of the time I'll offer other dates if I find something interesting for us to do,

""Hey this ---- movie came out and I remember you said you wanted to watch it, wanna go, on me?""

That kind of thing. Sometimes theirs lots to do, sometimes there's not a ton of opportunities. 


2. I like to text dates, probably like once every other day. Just to keep in touch. Check up on them, make sure they're okay. Often offer lunch if they haven't had any. Compliment them if we're more intimate. 

3. I often tag along or invite them when there's menial stuff to do. Like go grocery shopping.

I don't know why, I just find it peaceful being able to casual things with them. It's like taking a walk together to the park. Just spending time together without a big objective or preparation.

4. I really enjoy physical attention (Not specifically in the NSFW way.) I mean, like hand holding. Hugging. Kissing their foreheads when they get sleepy. Carrying them around like a princess. I love cuddling, except I usually try to be small spoon because sometimes my heart beats really fast because I'm excited to be with them.

5. I like to listen, offer advice, and try to fix problems of theirs if I can. I know sometimes it gets annoying when you're venting to someone and they keep trying to fix stuff instead of listening, but I can't help it.

When I see dates having a rough time over something I can help with, I try and try to fix it because I'd like to make them feel happier?

I'm not a perfectionist or anything, but when there's a simple problem like ""I left my stuff at home and I can't leave work so I'm starving""

I will 110% of the time be like, ""OH, no worries I'm coming to bring you food.""

Some appreciate it, some really don't.

Eventually I moved to Spain, where I had been as a child because my country didn't offer many opportunities to further my studies after a certain point.

I have never stayed in a city for more than 4 years in a row and my family was constantly moving, even when I was a child. My father's career put a strain on my mother even though he usually found jobs for her too because they were in the same field. I am afraid this has 'messed me up' in a sense because I don't seem to be able to commit to a place and constantly think of moving somewhere better. I think of moving somewhere and my instant thought is that I might want to leave after a year. I just can't make the decision of moving somewhere my whole life. I know that when working in the animation industry relocation is very common unless you live in California which is basically the hub of  the industry but very hard to get into for a foreigner, which means I probably can't make it any time soon. I have until now put my studies above a relationships even though I wanted one because I figured I was young and all but I will be 25 by August and it's getting a bit tiring, honestly. I see friends that have settled into a long term relationship and others that change partners before I can even realize it and I've been here this whole time, doing nothing. 

Of course the obvious answer is to just move somewhere and see how it goes but that's exactly what is causing me anxiety. Basically there is no solution other than going somewhere and looking for a relationship even if I'm not sure I'll stay and hope that the relationship is enough to take my thoughts off wanting to leave. Of course I'll be extremely picky and ruin my chances because I'll be thinking that I might have to stay there for that person. Only casual relationships would be compatible with my lifestyle but I really don't want that. Maybe I should just get over myself lol.

Anyway I'm aware that I need to find a solution myself but I was wondering if anyone else went through this what their experiences were!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153950,public,self,Is my constant relocating ruining my chances of getting into a relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s98g5t/is_my_constant_relocating_ruining_my_chances_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I asked her out for a drink and she said she'd be more comfortable getting coffee. I thought, ""that's fine, first Tinder date you can never be too safe."" So I suggested a couple places and we decided on a Starbucks. 

Date went great and shortly after we parted ways I asked if she'd like to go out again. She said yes and then specified that she's not trying to rush things and doesn't want to have sex right away. I said that's fine and I asked her if she was free this weekend. Again she said yes, so I suggested going to fun bar in town. She said she still wasn't comfortable doing that...I asked her what part of it she was uncomfortable about, the unfamilar bar, the alcohol, or the evening, and she said all three. So now I'm starting to think maybe there's a problem. I suggest getting a pizza instead and she seems happy with that suggestion and agrees to get a pizza Friday (today). 

Late last night she writes me saying she'd be more comfortable going for a walk or for coffee again. I'm a bit annoyed, but I agree again. I say that it's too cold for a walk but suggest another coffee shop we could meet at. She says that finding parking is hard and asks if we can go to the same Starbucks we went to last time... 

This is weird because the two coffee shops are close to each other and I  don't want to go to the same Starbucks again for a second date.... (Also the Starbucks is loud, busy, has horrible lighting, has worse coffee, is more expensive, and is altogether not as nice as the place I suggested). I tell her that the coffee shop is less than a ten minutes walk from where she parked for Starbucks and it would be nice to walk together there, etc. The last thing she wrote is ""Is there any chance to convince you to go to Starbucks?"" with about twenty of the cringe emojis after it.

She had given it a few weeks for them to come back but they didn’t. She said it’s a mental illness and I’m too nice for her to emotionally abuse in case the feelings came back so it’s better if we broke up.
This literally destroyed me. I haven’t gotten out of bed in 4 days and took a 5th day off of work tomorrow because I’m so broken. I just drink all day and randomly burst into an ugly cry, mind you I haven’t shed a tear in over a decade. I just don’t want to exist or be alive.
During the relationship I immediately fell for her and hard. She told me not to suppress feelings and be open with myself so I literally let down my guard, and went all in emotionally. The highs I would feel when I was with her was unreal and I was obsessed and addicted to her. I only cared about making her happy, and would’ve done anything for her, and made sure she knew it. 
I’m just an emotional wreck right now and don’t know how to get past this. Before this relationship, I had gotten out of a 7 year partnership and it ended when I found out she cheated on me. However this breakup feels a million times worse than that. This girl for some reason I thought was the one. I saw her red flags but thought they made her unique. I’m just so disappointed I couldn’t be the person she wanted but I’m not one to force love from someone who doesn’t want to give it. All I know is this pain is unreal and even drinking doesn’t get rid of it all the way. 
I can’t stop wishing that she just texts me back and says “I realized I have feelings for you” but I know that’ll never happen. I just fantasized about having a house with her, a kid, getting married, growing old together. Everything just seemed like it would be too good to be true and it definitely was. 

My relationship history isn’t long but it’s definitely a tough track record:
My first actual girlfriend wasn’t until I was 21. We met online and I took her out to dinner. We went back to her place that same night and started drinking heavily. She literally dragged me upstairs to her bedroom and wanted me to have sex with her. I got scared because this isn’t how I wanted my first time to be so I’m pretty sure I fingered her but I don’t really remember.
My second girlfriend was someone I met online when I was 22, and I thought she was great but she was in an open relationship. She would invite me over to give her massages and would talk to me on the phone for hours but it didn’t feel right. I wanted to take her out and do nice things for her but it had to be so secretive. Since it was an open relationship I started looking around too. Eventually I found someone who wanted a serious relationship and broke this off. She was furious I broke up with her and wished me dead, which I kinda wish I was too at this point.
This ended up being my 7 year relationship. We were very close and moved in together right away. We became best friends. However after a few months when I started trying to be intimate with her and it was fine but I felt like I just wasn’t attracted to her. I literally friend zoned her and we had a great relationship but it wasn’t a partnership. She eventually cheated on me 7 years in and I decided to break things off. We started talking again recently because we realized we were good friends but we know we can never have an actual relationship. 
After the breakup I met someone 6 months later for a one night stand and didn’t enjoy it at all. I realized I needed an emotional connection to enjoy it.
3 months later brings me to my most recent and most devastating loss. We started out what I thought was great. We talked all the time (1-5 hours a night), texted all day to each other, had an overall great relationship. During our relationship we had 0 fights. I would always make myself available for her, and she got intimate with me fairly quickly and for the first time in my life I actually enjoyed the intimacy. I felt like she was perfect and I really really wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. We looked at houses together and even talked about possibility of a kid. She had a lot of baggage and a lot of issues but I literally did not care because my emotions were so attached. She literally could’ve asked me to do anything and I would have for her, and she knew that. But my whole relationship with her I was anxious because I got a sense that she didn’t love me. She would be happy and loving one minute and the cold the next. But I would stick around and do anything to see that happy side of her. I literally can’t stop thinking about her and keep hoping it was a bad dream, but she’s really gone and I just don’t know how I’m going to move on. I invested everything I had emotionally and have nothing left. I don’t even want to date again because I don’t wanna ever feel this way. I know I probably sound like a whiner and immature, and I probably am.

We’re both on uni vacation right now and won’t see each other for a month. He was planning to ask me out when we meet in person. 

When I first ever saw him (around 7 months ago) I was really awe struck by his luscious hair. I’m not exaggerating here. His hair was gorgeous and long ahhh. And I’ve told him this. 

He hasn’t cut his hair since then and so it started getting a bit too long. 

Last month he wanted to shave all his hair off and I was like “woah woah hold up!!” 😳🤚 
Don’t get me wrong but his long hair makes quite a difference to his appearance. And I kind of said that even if I vibe well with someone, I wouldn’t date them if I don’t find them attractive but I am more than happy to be good friends with them. 

He was obviously quite upset by this and I asked him if I shaved my head if he’d still date me and he said no. Soo 🤷🏽‍♀️

Anyway, this conversation came up again recently because he really wants to cut his hair since it’s getting super long (like past his shoulders). And over the month my feelings for him have grown and I no longer care about his hair as much as I did before but he’s still super self conscious about cutting his hair because he thinks that it would risk losing me. 

I tried to reassure him that I like him a lot and I’m not just going to lose feelings over hair but he says that his heart still feels heavy just to even think about it. He says that he doesn’t want to make the wrong move and lose me.

How can I reassure him that it’s going to be ok and that I love him no matter what.

My name is Michael Stahl and I'm a journalist in New York City, who writes often about dating and relationships. I'm looking to speak to a woman who, over the course of the pandemic, decided to seek a long-term partner in the dating scene, on apps or ""in real life."" Perhaps something about these pandemic times inspired the change? How's the experience been so far?

Some background to understand the situation: guys in the military are very onerous with girls, like horny teenagers (not everyone, but a lot). Girls who have relationship with someone in regiment are frowned upon, even if they are very close with someone people start talking about them, spreading rumours and bad shit. So it's not that easy for a relationship to grow.

So, here's my problem ...

I met this girl (20) few months ago during the formation. She has been in the army for one year and change regiment recently. She had a lot of trouble with guys been interested by her and is very upset by that.

We didn't talk to each other that much at the beginning but at the last weeks we started getting very close. I had a crush for her and she seems to like me but I can really tell if it was just friendship or love. We talk a lot and eat together every time until the end of the formation. 

During the holidays we continued texting a lot. But I didn't manage to tell her my feelings because I'm to scared of her reaction and I feel like it would sound like all the guys she's been dealing in the army.

Back from holidays, we were dispatch in different company but we continued eating with each other. The problem is i can't get a date because many people are around and there's always a friend or someone we know next to us. So discussion are very ""boring"" and I can't figured out how to speak to her seriously or so. 

Everytime it started to get to something, one of us had contingency or something is happening and killing the vibe. On top of that she has a deployment soon, so there's not that much time left.
