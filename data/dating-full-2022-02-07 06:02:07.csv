So i started texting this girl over break. She was in my class and I always thought she was cute. We chatted a little bit and she seemed pretty cool so I asked her if she would want to hangout sometime and she said she was down. She lived far away so I wouldn't be able to see her until school started. We were in the same class so we ended up making plans to go to DQ after class so we talked for about 2 hours and both of us had fun and vibed together. The next day I told her I really enjoyed spending time with her and she told me 'she had fun :)'. I started to really like her but I kept things casual until I got to know her more and be more comfortable with me. She was always avaliable whenever I suggested a time time hangout, unless she was actually busy, and I left like things just flowed when I talked to her. We texted a little bit throughout the week and made plans to hangout and smoke in her dorm. We hung out for several house and just talked and watched TV. I got to know her a little better and I really felt like she was comfortable around me. She ends her sentences with a smiley faces sometimes like I was gonna hang out with her I told her I'll see her there and she said 'okay see you :)'. It could be her being friendly or she could be flirting. She tells me a lot about herself and doesn't really hold back. We made plans to hangout again in her dorm on Wednesday which was when I decided to bring her a hoodie when I was cleaning out my closet. I gave it to her and she really liked it so we talked a lot, didn't seem to have problem making conversation and we sat down on her bed and watched a movie. I felt like we built up a connection so I asked her confidently if I could put my arm around her. I ask instead of just doing it because I want her to feel comfortable and I don't feel comfortable touching someone for the first time without verbal consent. Which is when she told me she was already talking to someone which I totally respect. Not gonna lie I was really dissapointed but I played it cool. She told me she started talking to him in November. I didn't expect it to change anything but I told her how I felt about her telling her I really like her and I genuinely enjoy spending time with her and honestly that she's really pretty. I could tell by the look on her face that it made her happy and she told me she enjoyed spending time with me too and felt that we vibed. It wasn't awkward at all and we continued to watch a movie for a couple more hours and just chilled. I left after the movie was over and told her I thought she was a really cool person and I like hanging out with her. I haven't been texting her as much but the way she acts towards me hasnt really changed. She still uses smiley faces whenever we talk about making plans. I made plans to hangout with her last Saturday which she was open to but had stuff going on that day. We made plans to hangout tomorrow on Monday so she is still open to hangout with me, and we chatted for a bit on text. The thing I'm wondering is does she like me but she can't do anything cause she's already talking to somebody? Did I get led on? She never made any mention of talking to somebody before.

I‚Äôm 6,4 in height, lean/thin, brown messy wavy sort of curly hair, blue eyes, nice jawline, big feet(size 17 as a matter of fact, no joke), big hands, long arms and legs, and a deep voice(but not super deep though, it‚Äôs probably just as deep as one of the Spider-Man actor‚Äôs. But maybe not like Kuanu Reeves or Dwayne Johnson for that matter, but I also don‚Äôt sound like a 12 year old either. Trust me, you can tell that my voice is deep enough to know that I have hit puberty a while back). Anyways I don‚Äôt mean to sound inappropriate or anything lol but I also have a big D too.

But yeah with looks aside, I have a very introverted personality and I‚Äôm also into things including video games, movies(especially super heroes, sci fi, war, historical, fantasy and some others), and is obsessed with writing stories for video games at the moment.
Oh yeah and about that, for my dream job, I actually really want to be a game developer and game enterpenuer who comes up with ideas and puts them into action with a team.
So yeah game making is one of my goals. Some of my other ones is to get a Drivers license soon, learn to program(because you know, I want to be a game dev), get some kind of job soon, and some other things as well.
So yeah for all of you women out there, would you actually date someone just like me?üòÅ
I‚Äôm also really kind, introverted(like I stated before), empathetic, and possibly some others too.

So yeah as someone who is 19, I just thought I‚Äôd ask that just out of curiosity.
I‚Äôve never really had luck with girls in the past because I was kind of obsessive, clingy, and probably even a number of other things too.
And so I just said you know what, I‚Äôm just going to obsess over my goals instead of girls because you know what they say ‚Äúwhen you focus on your self, your one will appear unexpectedly‚Äù or Atleast something like that.
So yeah.
Also I‚Äôm not necessarily going to ask this because of the subreddit rules but if you find me attractive feel free to dm me, but just keep in mind that I‚Äôm 19 and prefer women close to my age but yeah.
And again I‚Äôm not asking anyone to dm me, I‚Äôm just saying feel free because I want to follow the rules and not get this post removed.

Completely out of the blue but something I felt coming for a week after we had our first ever boundary crossing/argument.

We met and connected through Reddit. Initially a relationship wasn‚Äôt what was planned but that is what happened. She was my first partner, first lover and best friend at 24 years of age. We had great chemistry, great intimacy, similar interests and a good connection. Or so I thought 

A week before the breakup I was cleaning up my Reddit account/messages and found what I thought was our original conversation again. Clicked on the other profile to verify and saw that she had posted a nude to a NSFW sub. We had agreed on exclusivity, monogamy and had never had another conversation on it to warrant anything different.

When I brought it up and simply asked why and that I wanted to hear her out, she said that it I mean ‚ÄúShe just liked sharing nudes and it wasn‚Äôt about the relationship or being tied to one and was sorry if It didn‚Äôt make sense to me‚Äù. Also that she hadn‚Äôt messaged or replied to any comments because that wasn‚Äôt the point. 

I let her know how uncomfortable I was of her doing that without even considering me first. She apologized, took it down without me asking and we reconciled. So I thought. 

The week that followed just felt tense. Affection wasn‚Äôt reciprocated, ‚ÄúI love yous‚Äù weren‚Äôt said back and her answers just got shorter and shorter.

Eventually I brought up the change and asked if there was anything I can do or anything she‚Äôd like to discuss. 

I was then blindsided with a breakup with the reasoning being that she felt under equipped emotionally to provide a healthy relationship and was neglecting my wants/needs.

No discussion, no communication, apparently had been finalized for a few days after dwelling on it for a few weeks. 

Said she just didn‚Äôt desire any romantic relationship and wasn‚Äôt because she wanted/needed anyone else. Also that i did NOTHING wrong 

Yet 2 weeks later a friend of mine sends me a message saying she‚Äôs on Tinder and also on Reddit NSFW subs. 

This is a woman who in the weeks leading up to the breakup was talking about how worthy I am, how much of a good partner/Lover I was and how amazing all around I was as a person. 

And now looking back with glasses off I recognize a LOT of red flags I missed. 

Silent/Stonewall treatment, VERY Hot/Cold, Rarely initates a hangout, Keeps conversations at a surface level, Breadcrumbing, Actions rarely matched with words and also wasn‚Äôt always a priority.

I definitely had faults as well with anxiety, tugging too hard at times and not snipping issues in the butt when they arose.  looking back, I don‚Äôt feel like I was treated well at all. 

She said she wanted to remain friends because she ‚ÄúCared about me, had fun with me and loved being around me‚Äù. Yet how can I support her as a friend when the same actions continue and I don‚Äôt feel like i exist at all?

This is someone upon myself the last 6+ months to support, love unconditionally, be there when needed and share her interests while exploring new possibilities together. Also was always there to comfort, reassure insecurities and listen. Never raised my voice, never raised a hand, always understood if she needed a schedule change or wasn‚Äôt up for intimacy. Was I perfect, no, but she said I was :( 

Instead I‚Äôve never felt more disposable.

I broke my own heart again tonight and told her tonight I‚Äôm moving on and if she wishes to reconnect, she knows where to find me. I was honest how I felt and it was really the first timeEVER i was anything but a doormat. 

Felt wrong but I‚Äôm glad I spoke out. Wished her well the best i could and that she could heal.

You can be true to yourself, even if directly asked just diverting the convo or straight up saying I‚Äôd rather talk about something else for now, without lying or having to share more than you‚Äôre comfortable with. 

And if someone has a big bad reaction when they find out, that‚Äôs theirs to handle. I am someone who can empathize with someone else who wanted upfront honesty, and hope I end up with someone who can understand my reasons for waiting to share. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be like ‚ÄúI can see forever in your eyes‚Äù then 6 months later oh I‚Äôm a mom, it‚Äôs all within reason. But my ‚Äúwithin reason‚Äù is probably not going to align with everyone else‚Äôs, and if someone makes me feel like shit for being a mama bear by instinct, then that gives me a lot of necessary information on how to move forward.

In the phonecall she kinda slipped it in the convo that she had only ever been in one relationship from 15-22 (she's 22 now!) and has a kid to this dude AND had only broken up with said dude 2 months ago.

My spidey senses were tingling.

So she asked me to ring again last night. I accepted. But about 10 mins I the convo she literally dropped all vibe at that moment to say 'my ex is stranded and can't get a taxi home (lives in a village), he's gonna have to stop here.. ill message you tomorrow'

And just like that she hung up.

This prompted me to say 'This ain't what I want' and as I started to initiate this conversation and distance myself, she THEN did the whole 'well, what are you actually looking for? It's complex, I have a kid to this guy etc blah blah blah'

I came away feeling pissed off. Why would you wait until you're 4-5 conversations into it with another guy, being on a dating site and the minute your ex comes round. Boom. Dropped.

Just a rant I guess. It's obvious she ain't over her ex fella. I just feel a little played.

I know this is long, but I tried to get to the point lol (this is a repost).

I met this guy in an online friend group a few years ago. Even though he had gfs in the time we were friends, he was known to be flirty and tended to make a lot of sexual jokes with our other friends. It was just kind of accepted and almost expected that you played along. Eventually, I stopped talking to him because I developed feelings for him. His flirting became excessive and had gotten to the point where it made me uncomfortable. It was confusing, I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it, and I figured I would never talk to him,so I ghosted him. I was 13, so I try not to be too hard on myself lol.

During the quarantine, I came across our old messages on my computer. They kind of rekindled my old feelings for him, so I decided to snap him. He was excited to talk to me so we snapped for a few weeks before I asked if he wanted to move our convo to text (I kind of thought I was dropping a hint there), so we exchanged numbers. 

We live in the same state so one day he tells me he‚Äôs gonna be in my area for the weekend. I tell him I was gonna be on vacation so I let him know but also because I didn‚Äôt really know how to respond. I thought he was hinting at hanging out, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. I ask him why he‚Äôs here (because he lives on the other side of the state), and he replies a few days later (when he came home) that he came to see his ex. He decided to try to explain it a bit to me, but either way, I didn‚Äôt really know what to say. Definitely hurt, but I kind of just thought it would be best to let it go. One of my in-person friends I told about the situation encouraged me to say my feelings anyway since that‚Äôs what I came to do. So I did. Definitely a very stupid decision. 

He replies a few days later saying he did reciprocate my feelings, but he wasn‚Äôt good at communicating them. Then he tells me I‚Äôm ‚Äúone of the smartest people he‚Äôs ever met‚Äù and something along the lines that he ‚Äúalways hoped we‚Äôd find each other again.‚Äù  He told me he had learned from his past behavior and he wasn‚Äôt that type of person anymore. I believed him. Then he started flirting and saying cutesy shit to me that felt out of place. Kind of felt/figured I was the rebound girl. 

We talked on-and-off for about a year. Every time it ended, he would come back and check up on me/say something along the lines of hoping I was doing okay. His words never really lined up with his actions. He would mirror me, whether it was texting styles or positive emotions, but was never the first to be vulnerable about anything. I always had to give to receive, if that makes sense, and that ate away at me over time.

He would tell me he was ‚Äúinterested in me‚Äù and was sorry ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt make it more obvious he reciprocated my feelings‚Äù, but was hot and cold and later flat out told me he was a ‚Äúbad texter‚Äù even though he never suggested anything else. He told me two more times he was in my area when he visited his other friends that lived near me, but then when I asked him to hang out (since I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs hinting at) he ghosts me and later tells me he has issues, his behavior was due to the fact that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel he deserved feelings and they conflicted with his feelings of genuine connection with me‚Äù, but would be open to dating me when he got over them. When I became frustrated with him, he told me he was really busy. But he was never too busy to tell me what he was doing with his life. So I would leave. And like I said, he would come back. Again. To repeatedly tell me he would ‚Äúbe here‚Äù if I ‚Äúneeded a friend or anything.‚Äù When he‚Äôs never really *here.* 

I feel hurt and angry because he kept coming back to lie and manipulate me. I gave some examples, but he gave me a lot of compliments and a lot of unnecessary flattery, which definitely sting because they didn‚Äôt mean anything. They kind of fucked with my head and self-image. And what hurts the most is I genuinely considered him a friend at some point. I thought he was my friend. That‚Äôs why I opened up to him in the first place. I thought he cared about me and I could trust him, and I shared a lot with him that I didn‚Äôt share with our other online friends because I thought he earned it in the past. I thought he had proven it. But he kept hurting me. And calling us ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. And that‚Äôs another thing that really messes me up. Why did he treat me this way? And why did he think he could keep treating me this way? I guess I‚Äôm just struggling with healing and not allowing this to kind of impact my self-worth.

You only date one race because that's your ""preference"" but still log into Reddit to complain about your lack of options. ""I only date white guys with green eyes, 6ft 6, dark hair,  straight nose..."" You start with race but continue down the rabbit hole with a list of standards that might not contribute to your overall happiness. 

Some of you are entering your late twenties/early thirties holding onto these race requirements with little to no luck finding a partner in diverse/multi cultural cities. I used to be one of these people but I was forced to look in the mirror. 

 Is every racial group monolithic? People can be a part of the same racial group and look vastly different across the board. Do all Black people look the same? No. Do all White people look the same? No. Do all Asian people look the same? No. Phenotypes can vary depending on the region. 

How do you decide that you don't find a single person from this racial group attractive? Have you met them all? Traveled to every country? You go out of your way to avoid certain races (like a phobia) but still claim that its a ""preference"".

When I hit 26, still single, I was forced to analyze what I found important. I decided I would rather be happy with a family vs holding on to requirements that have kept me single. Therapy made me realize that I was valuing the superficial because I was superficial. 

Please don't make my mistakes. All the guys that I turned down who didn't meet my physical requirements? One of them could have been my partner. I'm really disappointed in myself. If your racial preferences work for you, keep them. But don't be surprised if you severely limit your options. If you're okay with that, great!

You start with race but continue down the rabbit hole with a list of standards that might not contribute to your overall happiness. 

Some of you are entering your late twenties/early thirties holding onto these race requirements with little to no luck finding a partner in diverse/multi cultural cities. I used to be one of these people but I was forced to look in the mirror. 

 Is every racial group monolithic? People can be a part of the same racial group and look vastly different across the board. Do all Black people look the same? No. Do all White people look the same? No. Do all Asian people look the same? No. Phenotypes can vary depending on the region. 

How do you decide that you don't find a single person from this racial group attractive? Have you met them all? Traveled to every country? You go out of your way to avoid certain races (like a phobia) but still claim that its a ""preference"".

When I hit 26, still single, I was forced to analyze what I found important. I decided I would rather be happy with a family vs holding on to requirements that have kept me single. Therapy made me realize that I was valuing the superficial because I was superficial. 

Please don't make my mistakes. All the guys that I turned down who didn't meet my physical requirements? One of them could have been my partner. I'm really disappointed in myself. If your racial preferences work for you, keep them. But don't be surprised if you severely limit your options/remain single. If you're okay with that, great!

I was a huge flirt and romancer over my long term relationship, very confident, but that‚Äôs easy when you feel comfortable and secure with someone (although I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have felt that way, but that‚Äôs another story). Now that I have to start all over again, it feels like I‚Äôve completely forgotten how. And my confidence was destroyed by that relationship ending too, which doesn‚Äôt help.

On top of that, I have some female friends who will talk about how they hate when a guy is shy and want him to be confident and initiate things, then the next second talk about how uncomfortable guys make them feel sometimes when they‚Äôre too initiative and the vibe isn‚Äôt right. How do I walk this fine line in between? I don‚Äôt want to seem like some shy guy who needs her to kiss me first, I know confidence is attractive, however at the same time I‚Äôd hate to accidentally misread things and make an unwanted advance.

I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole who makes unwanted advances, I don‚Äôt want to be a shy guy who can‚Äôt make wanted advances, but I don‚Äôt trust my ability read the vibe well enough to know which way to go. I‚Äôd be afraid of mistakenly going the wrong way.

Plus it‚Äôs been over a year since I‚Äôve missed someone so now I almost feel like I‚Äôve forgotten how to even kiss anyways. Probably overthinking it.

Started talking to a guy at the end of December on Bumble. 

He ticks a lot of boxes and something seemed quite proper and very respectful about him. 

First date and second dates were great. He even threw out the idea of meeting his friends and has opened up about some personal things he's got going on at the moment. We've kissed but that's it. 

It's actually the slowest I've ever gone with a guy, but I was taking that as a good thing. 

Third date, we went for a day out. He dropped me home, quick kiss goodbye after mentioning seeing each other the next week for dinner then another day out the week after. He said he'd check his work calendar and let me know a date. He also told me he had  really busy week coming up. 

I didn't hear from him on the next day which was a bit odd as we've talked most days and he usually initiates, so I reached out the day after that. He said he was out. Didn't hear from him the day after so I messaged the day after that and he says he didn't like how our day out preciously ended. It was rushed and he didn't feel very special and left feeling deflated. Which is horrible. I hate that I made him feel like that which is the exact opposite of how I feel towards him. 

I'd have thought I'd been so obvious with him previously that he would have at least been able to check in like ""hey babe, we good?"" Rather than assume I didn't want to see him again. Seemingly not. I said to him how sorry I was and that it was completely unintentional. And explained I thought he'd gone off me as he didn't tell me his availability and he told me that he had a really busy week so I didn't want to bug him. 

He said he was surprised I'd think that would bug him, appreciated the apology and said he was concerned that I didn't feel comfortable with him yet and he didn't see a way forward if I don't and also said he's worried I'm so organised and independent could I be spontaneous, which is what he wants. 

I said I do feel comfortable, but I have a past that means I can be a little guarded. Also, making plans was about building trust but now we have that we can chill and do things more on the fly. He didn't reply. (I'm also confused because he's previously complimented me being driven, having a 5 year plan, being a together individual)

I sent a voice note and elaborated a little that I want to focus on the future as he said he does, but I have trauma in my past that means I can be guarded at the start. (It's been a month!!) But I was sorry for being so guarded he evidently didn't know I do want him. I said it's with him and I'm here when he wants to talk. 

He said he'd listened to it and would get back to me the next day. It's been 3 days... 

Am I not ready to date? How's he changed so quickly? Is he sensitive?

Yesterday he posted on his Instagram along the lines of ""happy morning"".
He is acting like I never even existed. How can someone turn from so sweet to so cold?? ü•∫

Today he posted something like ""never get into a haram relationship because it will make it hard to fall in love again in a halal relationship"" with a broken heart emoji.

So, he's talking about falling in love again....what...like 4 days after we have broke up!!?

I was pissed off so I messaged him he was the one who broke my heart. Was it me or him who cried?! Etc
He responded that the post wasn't about me but just a ""general post"" about haram relationships.

I feel so upset at how cold he is being about all this.
He is acting like he doesn't even care, like he never had feelings for me. I might as well have never existed etc....


Do you really think that he is this cold about me?
Like I'm nothing to him?

Me (26M) and GF (24F) have been dating for just over 6 months in a relationship that I now consider to be abusive and manipulative. The relationship has really gone downhill since November/December and it has started to take a toll on my health in general, with her being overly jealous, selfish, untrusting, showing signs of being abusive and manipulative.

We've had some pretty big fights in November and December last year that had me wanting to break up, with her causing a bit of a scene at my job, saying she's supportive of my job (I'm a musician) but acting the other way around and even trying to hint that my recent (relative) success is due to her coming into my life, etc. However, since we had a trip paid for NYE, I decided to wait a bit to start having conversations like that. During the trip, we had some pretty big fights, with her going through my phone without my permission (pretty big deal for me, and she knew it), her costing me a hefty traffic ticket because she refused to wear a helmet on a motorcycle I rented, fighting with me whenever we went to clubs because I looked at the dancers onstage and some other petty stuff like her acting as being there was doing me a favor, even though I fully paid for everything. 

Once we returned, however, she has started to act completely opposite to how she had before, making me think that she has somehow accessed my phone and read my chats with my best friend or therapist, since we didn't have any meaningful discussions about her behavior for it to change so drastically out of nowhere. This has me a bit worried because I feel like she's trying to manipulate me into thinking she's changed because I provide way too much for her to just let this relationship and she knows I'm on my breaking point, but she‚Äôll turn back to her older self once she fells like I'm more under control.

Finally, she has started to downplay our previous fights whenever we talk about them, saying that I'm trying to dramatize them to make her look bad or the fights worse then they really were. I remember every single big fight we've had and she acts like I'm crazy for remembering them. Is she gaslighting me?

I really want to get out of this relationship, as I know it's not doing me much good but, for some reason, I can't bring myself to do it as I keep feeling like I owe her something or that the explanation I choose to give will never be enough.

I've gotten a lot of matches across a variety of apps but none of them have lead to anything. The reason I'm on dating apps is because I'm looking for a relationship but it seems that majority if not all of the people that I'm matching with aren't looking for the same.

I don't know if it's just my age group but none of my matches have actually wanted to go on a date and majority of them don't even respond at all. Either that or they'll respond a few times and then disappear. Like the other day, I matched with this one girl and it turns out we're into the same sport and we were really going into detail talking about it. She really knew what she was talking about too so it wasn't just me going on and on about it. Then we start talking about what college she's at and when I ask what her major is she unmatched me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am a 30yo male living in a large Eastern Canadian city and I've been browsing a few different dating apps lately (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge) and one of the things that is getting increasingly apparent to me is that I simply cannot find anyone who seems to share ANYTHING in common with me.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't think my hobbies are particularly weird or niche (Reading, singing, writing, video games, exercising and learning languages) and yet I never see ANYTHING about any of those on anyone's profiles. It's always about tv shows and series or ""adventure"" (whatever that means).

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the fact that I'm a rather (very) introverted person (not shy) who doesn't drink or smoke (cig nor weed) and there are LOTS of references to that on dating profiles. The issue there is that from experience people really tend to struggle around someone who doesn't consume the same substances they do, which can make things awkward. Being introverted and not into drinking also means that prompts like ""I can beat you at beerpong"" doesn't really mean anything to me because 1) of course I'd lose, I never played and 2) I don't even know what beerpong is and can only assume this is something played in bars or parties, both things I have never experienced. 

&amp;#x200B;

And finally there is the almost suffocating amount of glam on dating profiles (of women, can't speak for men since I don't see those), no many nice dresses, makeup and fancy looking venues. It gets tiring just looking at it because I simply know that even if I were to match with such a woman I'd either become very unhappy trying to keep up with such a lifestyle, or make her unhappy by refusing to. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I am sure that there are TONS of women on these apps that share many of my traits and hobbies like introversion and liking to read, but apparently few if not none of them choose to broadcast it? I suppose they feel these things are not attractive or something?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to believe that I am a boring person, because I really don't think I am. I have a wide array of interests, can talk about almost anything, I speak 4 languages, I'm relatively fit, I do like going out and being spontaneous sometimes (usually traveling) and while my profile does disclose all that I just can't seem to get anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyone can relate?

For context I'm a 29¬†year old female, well educated, good job, well traveled and have been on the dating scene for two years just trying to find the right one. Back in December (2021) I matched with a guy who is a Marine Engineer on Hinge, he's 28 years old and we exchanged numbers quickly and then he followed up to set up a date for drinks. I liked his straight forward attitude as I would prefer to get to know someone in person. First date was unexpectedly fun, my first impression of him was that he was a great listener and I hadn't laughed that hard in awhile (I'm not an easy laugh). We had a ton in common, even down to the book we were both reading (A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn). He has a very interesting job where he is home for a month at a time and then works on an oil rig in the gulf for a month, which has made it difficult for him¬†to find a relationship. His last serious relationship was about three years ago. He currently is¬†in between jobs and has been home since November. After a few dates he asked me how I would feel if he left for a month at a time and I was open to that situation because it¬†allowed me to have some time to myself and I felt like it would always keep the¬†relationship fresh (distance makes the heart grow fonder). To be honest I was surprised he asked me that quickly how I felt about him going away, but he made it clear that he would still want to date me even if he was away and he had dated people before long distance. He was interviewing for a few jobs,¬†but didn't have one lined up yet so¬†for further¬†notice he was home and available to take me on dates.¬†

For the next month he was very consistent in always setting up fun dates, making a plan and even drove about 25 minutes out of the city (which is out of his way) to pick me up at my apartment for our dates. If I texted him he would text me back right away and truly was a gentleman. We both agreed that we we were not big texters and do not want a virtual relationship so we would text to make plans and touch base, but we were never texting all the time or even everyday which was honestly perfect for me. We had so much fun together, inside jokes and nicknames for each other,¬†he remembered little details about my life, practically everything I ever said and I really felt like this was something special. He was very complimentary and I honestly felt like we were both on the same page about how great our chemistry was every time we were together. When things started getting physical (we had instant physical chemistry and very hot make outs) I let him know that I wanted to wait to have sex until we were more serious and in an exclusive relationship because I was worried about getting hurt by a casual hookup and I wanted to wait until we had a deeper connection. He told me numerous times that although in the past he had been looking for something casual he said it was obvious that things were different between us and he wasn't looking for anything casual with me. He told me he wasn't seeing anyone else a few times. He shared very intimate¬†details of his life and even¬†invited me on a trip to Colorado skiing at the end of February with his friends, a concert in March and to meet his friends at a birthday party in two weeks.¬†

A blizzard hits town, and we ended up getting snowed in (his idea) and spent the entire weekend Friday - Sunday together in his apartment watching movies, cuddling and cooking, and by the end of it he asked me to be exclusive and told me he deleted all of the dating apps. After becoming exclusive that weekend we had sex. I thought the sex was good, it kind of ended quickly but there had been a lot of pent of tension so I wasn't surprised.¬†

I end up hanging out with him on Thursday a few days after becoming exclusive, and we had a great time. He reminded me about how happy he was that we were exclusive and it felt right, and how he was looking forward to introducing me to all his friends next Saturday (Feb 12th). He had said that even before he asked me to be exclusive he felt like we were. We went to my place and slept together again after dinner except this time he had trouble getting hard. I told him it was not a big deal (he seemed embarrassed and honestly he had never had an issue any of the other times we were making out) and he said sometimes it was difficult for him if he felt like there was pressure to get hard. We did eventually end up having sex but just took a bit longer than usual. I only mention this because otherwise I didn't think there was anything off about our date.¬†We kissed goodbye and I gave him a bag of this coffee he had tried and really liked when he slept over my place before because the company had accidentally sent me an extra.

A few days later I'm on the phone with him, talking normally and figuring out what our plans were for tomorrow (we had talked about hanging on Sunday and playing darts). First he said he wanted to do darts during the week, but I reminded him that I was going on a ski trip Monday-Friday and wouldn't be able to, but in the middle of this he says ""you know what, I was thinking of sending you message but since we are on the phone now I want you to know that I've been thinking about this exclusive thing and I am really not ready for a relationship and I need space. I'm sorry if you feel like I have misled you or blindsided you."" I was honestly floored, I mean we were just talking about meeting his friends and going to darts tomorrow? The last time we hung out we talked about what restaurant we would go to on Valentine's Day, I couldn't make sense of it. I think he knew that this would take me completely by surprise because there was no indication that anything was wrong before this besides the slow to start in bed the other night.

I asked him if I did something wrong, he said no.¬†

I asked him if there was someone else, he said no.¬†

I asked him if he thought that we could take things a little slower and back it up, and he said no. He didn't think it made sense to go back to non-exclusive when we had already gone down the road of a relationship which I do agree with.¬†

By the end of the 10 minute call he sounded annoyed that I had asked so many questions. He was cold and gave me no explanation except that he needed space and was not ready for a relationship which was pretty contradictory to his actions and words leading up to this moment. It honestly just felt so impulsive and like he was cutting things off for no reason at all. I blacked out the end of the call, because the only thing I really remember saying was how disappointed I was, that I understood he changed his mind, but that this felt really shitty and I didn't see this coming at all. He said he thought it was best we didn't talk anymore, but that we could be ""Friends"" which just felt like a sad consolation prize. I don't want to be friends with someone who could treat¬†me like this.

If I'm being honest initially what it felt like to me is that I was a ""challenge"" and he didn't realize until after we had sex that the only thing keeping him interested¬†was the conquest. I know that makes me sound jaded, but I sincerely cannot think of another reason why he would have made a complete 180 mid conversation, unless this man is really good at hiding his feelings and was never that into me. Maybe it was malicious, but with everything I know about him my mind still holds on to the hope that it was not malicious and that he really just bit off more than he could chew. Or maybe he was just impulsively getting himself into a relationship he thought he wanted - until he didn't. 

I honestly have felt shaken since this happened and if anyone can provide insight or advice as to how to deal with this it would be appreciated. Maybe you've been this person who ""just needs space"" and can help me understand where the hell this came from.

He had traveled to a new company's HQ's to interview and was possibly going away starting in March, but he didn't have a date set in stone with his new job or a contract yet, but it's possible that could have influenced his decision.

Hi,

So I met someone on Reddit. He was looking for show recommendations and I messaged him and we hit it off just chatting about similar interests.

We have been messaging every day for a little over 2 and a half months. He sends me Good Morning and Good Night messages and has not missed a day of communication.  We both have admitted we like each other but early in our talking state I asked what was his red flags were he said he had commitment issues.  Our conversations have turned sexual and we both have openly admitted we would like to explore one another sexually in explicit detail and agreed not to sleep with other people at this time. Other than that no commitment talk.

He lives 5 hours away but is in the military and was prepping for a deployment when we first started talking (he is currently deployed). He has told me is super excited for his deployment to end so we can meet and has been craving me so badly....but that is sexual in nature.  

It‚Äôs confusing if I‚Äôm a placeholder gf or something more. He‚Äôs attentive in texting calls me sweetheart, baby, etc. 7 months seems like a-lot of maintenance to just sleep with someone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157758,public,self,Could he be interested in making me his gf,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sms5xm/could_he_be_interested_in_making_me_his_gf/,no_ads,0.0,,,

According to my experience with men and the experience of a lot of my girl friends it is extremely common for their partner to cheat at the beginning of a new relationship. 

I'm not talking only about physical cheating but also chatting, casually going on dates etc. I think most men do this and they don't even think it's wrong. 

I'm trying to understand this from a men's perspective and I need honest reasons why is it so. Do you need time to adapt and to fully commit or is it something about proving their masculinity?

I've got a lot ahead of me and dating isn't exactly at the top of my priority list, especially after four years at university and finally landing a great job. 

However, in the last couple of years, I have desired something proper in terms of a relationship. Three or four years ago, I was basically obsessed with finding someone. To the point where it became a bit unhealthy. I'd let it dictate my mood and I spent a long period of time only being happy when drunk at parties. 

But the more I've tried dating the more numb to rejection and things not working out I have become. I can move so easily now and not take it personally. But I still feel disappointment and frustration when things don't work out. 

I've never wanted a casual hook-up or fling, ever since I was 19 I've always wanted a real relationship. I'm still a virgin out of choice, none religious whatsoever. I've often been told that's my problem, that I want something people don't. 

Those people are wrong and I'll always tell them that. Romance isn't dead, but maybe generations have neglected it causing it to change. But I'm adamant that romance will never die. 

I'm 25 this year and I look around at family and friends, seeing them so happy with their partners. I'm happy for them, I always am and I've found a lot of joy being happy for others. 

However, I do feel a lot of envy and sometimes jealousy. I often wonder when is it my turn?

I'm no stud. I'm 5ft7 and mixed race, I don't expect to be at the top of people's lists half of the time. But I am me and I have a lot of love to give to a woman one day.

Obviously through our phones but he was really bad at it, didn‚Äôt text first at all and I was the one to always carry the conversations throughout the day and end the conversation at night. It seems like he wasn‚Äôt interested in talking to me at all. 

So being me I communicated to him that I didn‚Äôt think he was putting as much effort into talking to me as I did with him. I also said that I know that texting wasn‚Äôt ideal but I was wondering what we can do to make this work better for us and that I would love to continue talking and seeing each other and I hoped he wasn‚Äôt going to take this the wrong way because I liked him. Obviously he did because he didn‚Äôt respond and left me on read and then the next day unfollowed me on social media. 

If I fucked up by asking him please let me know, I don‚Äôt think I said anything bad and not in a way that made it seem like I was trying to be pushy.

I was seeing this girl for around 3 months and everything was going great. Amazing dates, good sex, getting along super well... Until January when it was what would have been the anniversary of her and her ex and she started having wobbles...after 2 weeks of this she told me that she's not over her breakup and so not ready to date me or anyone at the moment.

I told her I understood and gave her space. I haven't spoken to her in over a week until yesterday when she initiated contact and asked how I'd been. I replied after a couple hours and we exchanged a few messages, I made her laugh and then told her I had to go as I was out with friends. 

I do like this girl but wondering whether I ruined it with her by purposely taking my time to reply and then ending the conversation as it was getting good...have I done the right thing here or ruined it? She finally initiated and I fobbed her off...

TL;DR Girl I was dating for a few months told me she didn't want to date me atm due to not being over her breakup.

She (25F) isn't the first girl I dated, but she's the first girl I've been able to get physically intimate with and to feel my feelings for her being reciprocated back to me.

On Saturday, we had our fourth date together, first we went out to watch a movie, where towards the end I summoned up the courage to put my hand on top of hers (on our previous dates we hugged a lot but that was it) and we interlocked our fingers together after a couple of minutes and stayed that way until the movie was over; then walking out the theater I put my arm around her shoulder and she put hers around my lower back as we walked back to my car. Then we went to my place, had some light drinks and played some games, then watched a movie and she curled herself up into me and I held her like that for the whole movie. Then when I dropped her off at her place at the end of the night, we hugged goodbye and she surprised me with a quick peck on the side of my neck.

Then Sunday (yesterday), we went out on an afternoon hike and holding hands where the trail was wide enough, and we watched the sunset from the top of some cliffs. I had my arm around her shoulders and she then hugged me real close and we held each other like that for a minute, then I let go but held on to her hands to keep her close, told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her, she was looking at me and I just knew that she was waiting for me to kiss her, and so we did!

I had always hoped that my very first kiss would be romantic and I think that is exactly what happened! Then afterwards, when I dropped her off back at her place, got another kiss for goodbye.

Then later last night, she asked me out to get dinner during the week. I know that she wants to keep seeing me and I'm excited about spending more time with her. And this feels so incredible to like someone and to be liked back, and that she's also putting in the effort too :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157768,public,self,My first kiss!

She was very petite and had a nice figure and also had a very pretty face. After passing by her a couple times and checking her out I went on about my day. 

As I transitioned from cleaning cat cages to doing laundry I had a couple of run ins with her. The first she just popped into the laundry room and very bashfully looked at the floor and said excuse me in a soft spoken voice before grabbing a towel and leaving. 

The second time I stepped out of the laundry room to put a dog toy away and we bumped into each other. She  bashfully smiled at me and broke eye contact choosing to look at the floor instead. I could she was uncomfortable so I just said excuse me and slipped around her. 

However I have been thinking about our brief interactions all weekend and want to eventually ask her out for lunch (not too quickly since she's so shy) but I'm a bit concerned about what people may think of the age gap. She looks to be anywhere from 18-20 up to maybe about 22 years old. 

A couple of people I've talked to about this thinks she's too young while the rest are like hey she's legal go for it.
