But the 4th meeting 3 days ago on Sunday she seemed distant, only held her hand briefly on the night. She messaged me afterwards apologising for being out of it because she was thinking of packing for surgery on Monday. She then went into hospital on Monday, had ACL surgery on Tuesday and will go home today on Wednesday.

I sent her a message yesterday asking how the surgery went and I got short dead responses, so I quickly ended it and said ""Do get some good rest tonight and I’m sure you’ll be back to ur amazing self in no time!"" to which she read and had no reply. I suppose she's in a lot of pain and needs to recover?

She hasn't contacted me since and I feel she's being cold and distant with me cuz she usually messages me at least once per day and I know she's online as I can see her last active time on WhatsApp. She invited me to her birthday party with her uni friends on the 23rd during our second date so at this point next time I see her should be then.

She matches my level of goofiness and is as eccentric as me, and most of our dates are 6-8 hours.

I could tell she was a little closed off but once we kissed while we were sober it seems like she started to like me now. 

On that date she kind of said that she was scared of commitment, we talked about it and we kind of settled on seeing where things go. Since then we go out every weekend and it’s nice bc she told me that I check all her boxes physically and she just pounces on me. The last date we cuddled and she said she was tired since I guess she had a morning shift so she slept in my arms while she was topless, which was cute and she said she felt comfortable around me. 

Anyways, I’m starting to get anxious, it seems like with most girls I talk to the 3 month mark is where things seem to go south and I start to just overthink things, and I feel like I just sabotage myself and don’t enjoy things.

-It's her first experience she hasn't been in such a situation before (she's 18 I'm 20)

-she got caught of guard when I asked her out (she said yes twice (cause I wanted her to be sure) but then only answered my text once and then didn't answer at all.

-my best friend (her cousin) talked with her and she didn't say neither a yes nor a no

-i know she's very introverted and also shy , when we hang out though she opens up smiles to me and says jokes also she laughs with my jokes. We have our flirty moments too.

-she didn't answer my text and Instagram message , of course I didn't send more I'm not gonna push her.


I can't pick her brain, since she hasn't been through situations in life yet she doesn't seem to give me clues. You can't really know her way of thinking.
Maybe she even brushed it off her mind, that I like her. I'm saying this because she told my best friend: Why would he like me?

So not to be a prick the few times she mentioned them I never argued with her about it. I was just really disappointed.

So I said to her; I'm not interested in talking about ex's. 

She could of said ""I seen that lamp before"" or ""an old friend had this"" 

I've had multiple relationships, generally when you get the ex talk out of the way you don't open that topic with your new partner unless necessary. My friends tell me to start a new chapter in life you must close the old one and this woman clearly is dragging history into the present.

When we met he was very unconnected to emotions and has been learning to deal with his own and other peoples since. Sometimes he’s a very sweet amazing man who shows a lot of care. 
But for the last year every time we spend time together for the weekend he needs “space” to himself witch can last up to a week/10 days. In this time I feel neglected and taken for granted as we will barely be speaking except a good-morning and goodnight. 
I end up feeling like my emotional needs aren’t met until he’s ready.
When I speak to him about it he’s apologetic and says he feels guilty but he can’t deal with emotions all the time and that I’m quite an emotional person so that can be draining for him. So I’ve been dealing with not meeting my emotional needs so that I can give him what he needs. (all I’m really asking for is for a 10 minute phone call every couple days or for him to say he loves or misses me) 
However now he’s told me he’s been battling depression for the last month (something I’ve had for years), so I’m trying to be as supportive as possible- however he’s pushing me away and asking for space for weeks on end to the point I feel it’s unfair to me.

I'm both excited and a nervous wreck, and admittedly haven't sleep very well for a few days since scenarios keep playing around in my head.

My other colleagues have been teasing us to get together so he's aware that there's something that might be going on between us cause he's also starting to approach me at work; before the teasing, we were rarely 1-1 together.

I want to get to know him more. I'm very conscious speaking in a space that I know anyone can pass by and eardrops us hence, I want to talk with him outside of our workplace. However, we are both very shy and quiet so I don't think he's going to initiate anything. I want to try initiating a beach hangout for the two of us.

The problem is, public transport is basically nonexistent in my country so if I'm going somewhere, I have to drive myself - I'm really bad at directions and driving. The thing is he knows I have a car and can drive cause I drive to work (it's just nearby, so I'm able to). 

I wanna get advice to create a script on how can I ask him if he wanna go to the beach together but for him to drive us there? 

It would be easier to play this out if it's on text but another problem is we haven't exchanged numbers despite its been 2 months since the teasing has been going on. If I'm initiating I can just say "" Hey, do you wanna go out together during your off day? Lets exchange numbers so we can discuss it.

\- He secretly hopes one of his hookups/exes show up with a kid that's his.  
\- He is heavily into BDSM and sexualizes women ('would I sleep with this woman if I had the chance or not?')

 I hadn't dated for awhile so it took me awhile to just stop giving an F if I get ghosted on an app or if a first date goes no where. It's just part of the dumb process. 

And you don't have to do expensive first dates. Take a walk.. go grab coffee. I don't normally think of nicer dinners for a first date. So the complaint about it draining money seems like a person choice in the type of first dates. 

When meeting a women in real life you chat for a bit and then ask for their number right? Like hey let's continue this over coffee or whatever. OLD you chat for a bit to see what you have in common and basically say the same thing.. 

So in the end how is the outcome of the first date any different? Both IRL and OLD can get you first dates and I don't necessarily see how it impacts how successful that date will go.

There just seems a stigmatism to OLD. You have to just get your expectations right with these apps because others wise you'll get really worked up over all the ghosting and weird bios out there. 

I guess my an honest question is why should I focus more on IRL? I'm a 28m and stay busy enough it can be hard to meet people.

this is my first post on reddit ever and english isn't my first language, so sorry in advance for bad english.

21yo (M) 
Living with parents
Trainee at a wholesale company
1,66 m tall
a little chubby
Hobbies: Gaming, Netflix, Anime

First of all I'm a very shy person maybe even introverted idk, never been in a relationship before. Never been intimate with someone and never dated someone.
I'm from Germany and I live quite far away from big cities. I've tried Tinder, Bumble and Lovoo before, but I mostly found girls like 50km or more away from me. And I saw many girls below 18yo on there too.  I've tried it for a few days and even uploaded pictures of me, but I'm not a very photogenic person, so I don't even liked this pictures. Didn't get any matches and uninstalled again. In my area there are many villages and most of the girls living in and near my area probably don't use dating apps. 

And I actually don't have friends, since I graduated school I never socialized with someone, since 2019.
I don't know how to talk to people, how to make conversation, I am very awkward around new people and need like a very long time till I can talk comfortable with them. When I'm online with friends or even randoms I am the most extroverted person I know, but in Real Life I'm either shy or introverted.

I don't even know where to go to a date...just dinner?
What would we talk about, I'm very anxious about something like this, because I feel like I would be absolutely awkward...

And one important question, should I go on first dates with girls when I have to drive an hour to get there? 

Should I take selfies for a dating profile or let my sister take some photos of me? And I don't have pictures with friends, because I never go out...

Please give me some good advice! 🙏

Dear, Billy 

I know you're in a relationship right now, but when you're single, maybe see how things are between us. I've been in a relationship for a while now, but at times it's difficult because I think about you. Regardless of whom I'm with at some point I think of you. I could have any guy that I want and they still wouldn’t compare to you. I love the way you touch me and how your body feels you’re so gentle it makes me feel safe. But it’s not just about the physical and sex, it's so much deeper than that. You opened up my whole world because of you I got to experience something so profound. I know we were only together once but the time we spent together I felt so free and alive. Nothing else mattered it was just us in our **own** world. I feel like I can talk to you about things that I don't feel comfortable sharing with others.  **Whenever I'm upset or having a rough day, seeing you make things so much better**. I appreciate and **value** you so much, I'm so thankful for your kindness and support. You acknowledge the things that I've accomplished, and it honestly means so much to me. You’re a hard worker and I love your work ethic. You have many qualities that are similar to my parents, which is why they like you. I regret not meeting up with you when you asked to see me again. Sometimes I wonder what may have happened if I would have and this is when I miss you the most. I wish I would have got the chance to date you, even if it didn't result in us actually being together. For me, it's not so much about being in a relationship, it's about enjoying life and spending time getting to know each other. I'd never ask you for more than you're willing to give. I know how much you love your freedom and I love how carefree you are. I love that no matter how long we go without seeing or talking to each other it’s like we pick up where we left off. I just felt the need to finally tell you how I really feel after keeping this all inside for so long. I only wish that I would have told you sooner.

Te Amo, Mi Amor,

Judy

Only to find out she was lying to me about some pretty fundamental stuff the entire time and ghosted our entire friend group because of it.

I'll admit.  After a couple decades of this kind of treatment by every woman I've interacted romantically with, regardless of who she is, how she looks, her status in life, etc, I'm finally allowing myself to be a little bitter.  I'm not taking any pills, don't worry about that...but from my specific experience trying to find someone to spend my life with, an uncomfortable idea begins to form in my head: I, as well as many other men I know, work tirelessly to be good men, who hold themselves to strong principles and conduct themselves with integrity.  We do this because it is how we get to find success in our lives while still feeling enriched and fulfilled.  In 2021, it honestly feels like there is no social imperative for most women to conduct themselves in the same way.  4th wave feminism dictates that women can conduct themselves as they see fit, and should be celebrated and protected for it, no matter how detrimental it is for themselves or others.  This is not an anti-feminist notion - I'm 100% on board with waves 1-3 of feminism.  The general message that women are fed these days, however, is ""live your best life, do what you want, there will always be someone to forgive your bad behavior"".  I cannot get behind that.  It's no longer about equality.  I treat a woman as an equal in 2021, and she spits in my face for it.

I'm sorry if this upsets some people...but imagine, if I am saying all this in earnest, how upset I must be.  Our reality is molded by our experience, and this is my experience.  I don't know how to escape it.  I don't know if I can escape it.  So instead, I'm refusing to participate in this particular aspect any further, for the foreseeable future.  Which hurts me to my core - I want to have a family one day.  I've always said my singular purpose in life is to someday be a good father, and everything else I do is secondary to that end.  So imagine how much it hurts that this is my reality.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137657,public,self,"I am not a low quality man, why do I only find low quality girls?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh1paq/i_am_not_a_low_quality_man_why_do_i_only_find_low/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,

We actually have long conversations and share a lot in common. I don't really know where it's going and I try not to have many expectations, but she seems to like me and I like her too. 

She introduced me to a fairly large group chat with some people she knows, and there's this other guy who seems to get jealous whenever I'm talking to her in the group chat. Whenever I'm talking to her in the group, he constantly has to interject as much as possible. He'll ignore me and talk to her only, and tries really hard to divert the focus away from me and onto him. I can't have a conversation with her in this group chat without him butting in and trying to take over the conversation, spamming her with compliments and trying to make dumb jokes. 

He'll also put me down a lot. The other day I was talking about how I was nervous for a job interview, and the girl I'm interested in said ""you got this dude"". Right then though, the guy had to interject and started saying stuff like ""you just have no confidence"" and ""it's easy, you're just scared for no reason"".

We had really good chemistry over text. He told me that I was really hot, and the cutest guy in town, and he was very attractive too, being a former model.

 We went on a first date after a week or so of texting, going out for lunch, and it went well. He lived an hour away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd consider dating someone so soon after he got out of a two year relationship a few months before, but that there was something about me. We made out and he held my hand for a bit as he drove me home.

 We made a plan for a second date and kept texting each other. He started going through some stuff, him and his family having to move unexpectedly and him trying to take out a loan to get a new house for his family, and I'd be there for him, sending encouraging texts. He told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that no one else is as smart as me except for him, and that he might be my perfect match. I have difficulty socializing, so I've never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. No one's ever said stuff like that to me, and I was so happy to hear that this guy really likes me. 

He said that he wanted to have sex on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. He said it had to be in his car, since his family was having to leave their house and I lived at home too and wasn't allowed to have potential romantic partners stay the night . And it also had to be unprotected. I told him that I was nervous to be penetrated since I'm a virgin, and I wasn't sure how I felt about my first time being in a car, and he said that I just had to get over it. He eventually said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that is being in a relationship would be delayed until we had sex, because he wanted to know how good it would be. I was going to go through with it, but a few days later I thought that we wouldn't be sexually compatible, and we went our separate ways.

 I've been having trouble moving on from him since it happened, going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who saw a future with me. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked if he really did like me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he said that he did really like me at first but that I ruined it.

 I've been thinking about it recently and did I ruin it or did he? He liked me enough to see himself spending his life with me but was very insistent on having unprotected sex in his car on the second date, even though I was uncomfortable with that. And we'd only be boyfriends of the sex was good enough. That's a lot of pressure to put on a virgin, and he knew that I was one.

One ended in disaster, the next ended quite well; but I would consider both to have been worthwhile and transformative experiences. I would not say that either partner was truly compatible with me, all said and done.

I don't struggle to attract interest in general—I'm not the most popular, but it seems there are some ""types"" for whom I fill a niche. I just don't seem to attract any interest from people who share my values or interests.

To my great regret, I have exactly zero ""dating"" experience, and I have extremely limited experience with casual sex. Both of my relationships began because the other person pursued me, and I said yes to both enthusiastically because I was genuinely interested. I have pursued more than my share of people, and literally every one has rejected me; but I also am frequently chased-after by people who I am not interested in and frequently am afraid of hurting due to incompatibility in values. I am not insecure about my worth, but I feel as if I don't have any agency in my love life.

I am not just repeatedly going after the same type of ""conventionally attractive"" person, to be clear; I'm talking about a pretty wide cross-section of people that have told me, verbatim, ""if you were cuter, I would date you,"" among other things. The only reason this hasn't completely destroyed my self-esteem is because there are clearly a number of other people who think I am, at first glance, perfectly attractive as a potential partner—it just seems like it's always people with whom I don't share very much in common and are often looking for something other than what I have to offer.

I'm not sure what to do in this position because it seems like every option essentially requires me to lie about myself to potential partners. I am not doing that a second time, to anyone. I would like to meet and date people fairly casually, find people within that pool that I share chemistry with, and enter a relationship with one of them. No matter what I have done, the exact opposite has happened—I quickly enter a relationship with someone I happen to know who is vocally interested in me, and when that relationship ends, I have scant few friends, even, to start over with because in the meantime, most of my social circle was woven with the fabric of that relationship (precisely not doing this is one of those values of mine that keeps getting pushed aside for the sake of whoever I'm with).

Should I try and change myself to just be what people who like me seem to want? Should I just remain single and bitter unless I meet a ""The One?"" Or should I basically just accept that I am a round peg who needs a square hole and that I will probably never be satisfied?

He responded by saying “You’re probably just coming to your senses about me” (I guess because we are seeing each other despite pretty irregular circumstances) 

I didn’t consider this over sharing because both of our fathers passed away last year, it’s something we talked about and bonded about a lot and it’s something that helped me feel a connection to this man so I thought he would be understanding. 

But his response to that just really doesn’t sit right with me. It feels like he’s trying to downplay my emotions by saying “oh it’s probably actually just THIS” it also feels self centered. Like I couldn’t possibly be upset about something else, it MUST be him.

Talked to parents yesterday. Basically told me the only reason I disappoint them is because I can't get a girlfriend.

I'm sucessful in almost every other way. Physically fit, I go on tinder and get decent amount of likes, finished college, looking for career now, I work out every other day, I train BJJ, I had some cool friends when I was in college, I could go on.


But in this lull of looking for my career my parents see me go workout and play games and watch TV all day.  And see me when they get home and are visibly disappointed.


I'm afraid I'm gonna be even more alone after I find my career. It scares me. I'm tall, decent looking. But I can also understand maybe the way I talk just isn't it for women.

We matched on Bumble, and our bios both said ""looking for a relationship."" We have been on three official dates and have hung out a few times after running into each other on campus, so I'll say we have been on six dates. On the second date, she denied my kiss, but she still invited me on a third date. I get the feeling we are both inexperienced with dating, with her being a bit prude seemingly. We are so emotionally congruent and share a lot of values, which is a major plus! We always had a blast on our dates.

On the third date, she tells me her grandfather had just died, so I did not try to take advantage of the situation to further my cause so to speak. I was just there for her. We made plans to get lunch the next week, but she canceled the night prior due to making an appointment to see her professor and the week being hectic overall. I ran into her later that day unexpectedly, and we grabbed dinner. She texted me right after that she loved seeing me and that it lifted her spirits/put her in a good mood due to everything being so difficult lately.

I get anxious easily, but I have definitely sensed a vibe shift since she canceled the lunch to meet with her professor; however, I do not want to mistake her being a little aloof lately as disinterest when she is likely still grieving her grandfather. She is still being relatively social, though, just not with me. We do leave for winter break in a week or so, and I want to convey to her that I still want to pursue this further. What would be the right thing to say? Where do we even stand? I don't want to be put in the friend zone or for what we have to die out during the break. We do live a little far from each other (about a 2-hour drive), but I am okay to meet up once or twice in addition to FaceTime.

TLDR: The girl I have been seeing lost her grandfather, and things sort of went a little cold. Contact is still there but not as much as usual. I am not sure if she is disinterested now or just sad. We leave for winter break soon, and I want to define what we are to avoid it fizzling out over break. Is this even an appropriate time given her recent loss? If so, what do I say? How do I say it?

I go out to restock on cigarettes to celebrate a successful week financially and another friend called to remind me about the party and that I should be at his house in a bit so we can go together..Dressed like a fucking clown with sweatpants and a sweatshirt with a big cigarette hole on it from another party I said whatever and decide to go at the party as is since I was already pretty far from home.
Arrived at party looking like I don't give a fuck and I crushed at the  couch with my friends and we talked about our days like we normally do..while I was talking I noticed  a girl looking at me and tried to avoid eye contact since I was not in the mood for trouble (had met a pretty toxic girl not a while ago and had decided to take a rest from dating and enjoy being absolutely single)..Anyway the night unfolds and as I am chatting with a friend I see this girl dancing awkwardly then looking at me and laughing in shame..Once again I didnt want troubles so I smiled at her and continued my conversation..On my way to refill my whiskey this girl stops me and chats me up 
Being the retarted social butterfly that I am I engage the conversation and we get to know each other a bit Turns out she was quite an interesting girl and she manages to break my guard.We exchange Instagram accounts since she left early and I still wasn't sure I wanted to escalate things that night tho I suggested we should go out the next day and she agreed
We casually flirted for a bit on the DMs  until we fell asleep 
The next morning disaster strikes
I received a message of remorse about what a clown she was and what kind of a bad impression she had left
Surprised and confused I explained her that the opposite has happed and that I can't understand why the fuck is she telling me this 
She explains me that she had a really bad day that day and that she broke up with her boyfriend before the party 
Seeing the red flag from a mile away I suggest we ditch the plans we had made since she must obviously was confused about her break up 
She ensures me that she isnt and I had nothing to worry about( I had)
I said fuck it and decided to go since I was pretty curious and she had given a very nice impression about herself the night before
We go out and we started talking about ourselves(had to admit I was impressed by her she had class she seemed serious career driven and a bit of a nerd) and the conversation steers towards the previous night and how we met she talks about how big of an impression I made on her by the minute I stepped in with my zero fucks attitude and we were kinda complimenting each other building some kind of sexual tension(or not)
Suddenly the remorse hits again and she starts telling me about how bad of a day she had and started describing what happened with her ex.After some explaining she starts crying  telling me how she has given everything into the relationship and how she had been mistreated..I should had ran away but it's not my type to leave a confused crying girl in a middle of a park so I stayed and gave her some advice since I had obviously been in a lot more relationships than her while also trying to steer the conversation away from all that madness in a desperate attempt to save the day 
Things calm down a little so she suggests we ditch the spot and go somewhere else (the whole park was looking at us due to her crying but I didn't really care) 
While walking she sees her cousin apologizes tells me that she has to tell him what has happend with her ex and that she wants to see me again
I returned home confused as shit and chilled on the tv for a bit before going out with boys not really thinking about what the fuck had actually happened on that weird date
While I was out she sent a big apologize letter about her leaving so early (whole ""date"" lasted hardly 2 hours) and that she is really sorry about the situation and she would make up for it 
Having gone the extra mile already with my diamond patience I decided to give this girl a chance since she looked like a pure emotional soul and that she actually liked me alot 
We spent 2 days being busy with our careers  exchanging messages when we could and it looked like there was still some chemistry in the air so I suggested we go out again but since her routine was a mess I told her she decides the day and time since becides mornings I am always available..She ensures me she will let me know 
Next day i told her I was going in a pretty famous place in our city were we both hang for a beer with the boys..She tells me she also has suggestions from her friends and might be there too. Later in the day she tells me that she will be there earlier than her friends and she will come and sit with me while waiting for them..wasn't really into the idea of introducing my friends to a girl I have gone on one date with but decided to compromise and told her she was welcome
She came we chatted up I was colder due to my friends presence  she was being very flirty  and when her friends arrived she left and joined them 
After about an hour she comes outside says goodbye and stroms off before I could even suggest we could return together since we lived close and I was on my way out 
We continued talking and after a few days she goes off the grid for a while and comes back telling me she finished work and is going to a place and will be picked up from a city were her ex lives I get kinda mad but decide to keep my cool and that it might be a coincidence..The next day I suggest we plan something for the day after and she agrees but she has to attend some family party (not a lie) and that she is not sure about when she will be available..The day passes and when she returns home she claims she is too tired to do anything...at this point my expectations from this person had dismissed so I didn't really cared and kinda joked about it and let it be
Once again about 2 days later or so while we are talking she seems a bit different i ask her whats up having a bad feeling and she tells me she has been really busy and pressured by her workload and that she might go out when she finishes
She goes off the grid for a few hours and at midnight or so I hear back from her telling me she is sorry she didn't have data and that she is in that city that her ex is living at and that she will sleep there...being done with her already l jokingly ask her if she owns a house in the city which she replies no she will sleep at a friend I sent a laughing emoji and let it be 
 We haven't talked again after that and I haven't seen her out in the wild again and to be honest I don't want to 
Kinda expect that to happen from the whole crying part but I guess I can be an idiot sometimes and ignore my inner voice 
Still don't understand why she referred to her ex as a ""friend"" and didn't come foward with it Really childish but I guess that's how people are 
At the end a big ass mindfuck from something so uncomplicated like a random party encounter 
Definitely my worst so far
I guess I was blinded by the good girl appearance after my last experiences had been with girls that resembled prostitutes
