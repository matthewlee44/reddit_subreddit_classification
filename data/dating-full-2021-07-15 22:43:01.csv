He ordered four drinks and a steak, and his bill was $77.

I got a small pasta and water, and my bill was $22.

The waiter came with a chip card and asked how we should pay. Before I could offer to pay for myself, he said “separate” and then the waitress asked if we should split it down the middle. Before I could say I just wanted to pay for my items, he said “yes.”

So I ended up paying over $50 for a dinner I did not really enjoy. He immediately paid on the chip card so going back to just pay for my items would have been long and awkward.

He walks me to my car and tries to kiss me. I politely decline. He’s blown up my phone for dates since, like to go on walks and see movies and go biking together. I just blocked.

The career field I'm in has a very low number of women so most of them are smothered by horny simps. I knew that wasn't what I wanted so to avoid it all together I chose to throw the notion of me having a romantic encounter out the window while in training. This soon changed however when classes started. There was one female in our class and at first she got on my nerves extremely bad but soon began to seem like a potential friend to me. She was loud and brash but could also be extremely attentive and caring when she needed to be. We soon began to hang out and I met all of her friends. I would like to add that I saw her exclusively as a friend, I was very happy to have someone to spend time with and have fun during my usually boring evenings. As the weeks went on I began to have this subconscious attraction building. I didn't admit it to myself but I found myself wanting to sit next to her and wanting to just be in her presence more every day. It reached a boiling point when we went skating and held hands so she wouldn't fall. As we skated she looked at me and admitted that she wanted to kiss me. Up to this point I hadn't made a single romantic move and was floored that she was the one laying out how she felt. I felt the same way and we began to kiss. After we got done she began to cry, I asked her what was wrong and she told me she had a boyfriend and had cheated on him by kissing me. I told her not to worry about it and we went our separate ways. Over the next few weeks we spent almost every afternoon together skating. Our friendship soon turned intimate and we made love multiple times. She would reference the bridges of Madison County movie frequently , a movie where two soulmates meet to late. I soon began to catch this unshakeable undeniable thing...... feelings... ughh. She's now gone and on to her next training phase while I'm stuck here seeing all of our old haunts. I'm not sad but I want to find a way to move on. We still keep in touch and I can tell she enjoys us talking, but what do I do to console this lonesomeness that I sometimes get?

I’ve been asking people I know for some advice about this and I keep getting mixed answers and opinions so now I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated!! 

So I’m in my 20s(and female) and for the last month I’ve been “dating” this guy who I met through a friend and the first two dates went well and we actually kissed on the 2nd date(it was my first kiss too, I’ve never even been in a relationship before him, please don’t judge !). I had a good time on those dates, but I don’t actually know if I like him or not. Like yeah I had a good time hanging out with him, but I also have a good time hanging out with a lot of people you know? I can’t figure out my feelings and it’s frustrating!

So like I said we did kiss on the 2nd date and it was nice, and we also talked about things like dealbreakers and where we want this relationship to go. We also talked about how we didn’t want to waste each other’s time and that this wouldn’t just be a fling. 
In hindsight I don’t think we were moving a bit too fast,  but I wish I thought about things more. Like on those dates where I did have a good time we still clashed on some things that may be important in the future. Like lifestyle choices for example or the fact that we don’t have anything in common really besides the fact that we like animals. I know people can be different from each other and still have a good relationship but in my mind idk if we’d be a good fit. 

Also, it’s important to note that between the three dates we’ve had we didn’t really talk much. We texted back and forth the usual “what’s up” “nothing much you” and shared a few photos of our pets and of our day a few times but that’s it really. 95% of our communication has been on those dates. And we’ve only seen each other 3 times since our friend introduced us cause he lives almost an hour away and we’re both busy on weekdays.

So, the third date is when things got weird. Idk what it was but the whole time I just felt like something was off. We didn’t kiss again at first, which kinda surprised me because on the 2nd date he was eager to kiss me. 
So we went to a museum, and it was nice but felt a bit more boring than it probably should’ve been. After that, we went to eat and he got a bit frustrated at my indecisiveness to chose a restaurant(but he wouldn’t chose he wanted me to do it). After that, we went to the park to walk around and then went back in his car because he wanted to talk about us “us”. First he kissed me though finally.

After we kissed, he asked me how I’ve felt about all 3 dates we’ve been on. I said I think they’ve been great but I was honest and said that on this particular date I feel like something was off. I think it was kinda because of my indecisiveness a bit and I even asked him and he said it was frustrating but that’s not why he’s asking or wants to talk. He said he wanted to talk because he’s been thinking about our 2nd date and how he thinks he shouldn’t have kissed me so soon cause he didn’t want to “lead me on” or “move too fast” but he really wanted to be my first kiss because I deserve a good first kiss. And he’s worried that he might’ve scared me a little by doing it. I told him he didn’t, I didn’t think we were moving too fast at all. Like I said before, we barely talked outside of our three dates, and yeah we kissed and maybe that is moving too fast but I didn’t think we were doing that. Like I genuinely thought we were moving slow?? I may be wrong though. 

But I also do think he led me on at least about having a serious relationship because of what he started saying next. 

I think when he realized that I didn’t feel like we were moving too fast he put it on himself, because then he said he wants a more casual relationship. I’m new to dating so maybe I just don’t get it cause I never experienced it but I thought we were more on the casual side but also seeing where this goes too? Like we talked about this on the second date that we would just see where this goes but we also didn’t wanna waste each other’s time !! 

And then he asks if I still have any dating apps open, I said no cause why would I?? If I’m seeing someone else and want to work on that relationship why would I talk with anyone else?? And he said he does have bumble open and that we should talk to other people, like a no strings attached relationship basically. And that really surprised me tbh cause that was not something we talked about when we talked about what we wanted on the 2nd date ?? Like he just sprung that on me out of nowhere?? 

And I immediately said; “if I’m gonna end up liking another guy then and you’re gonna end up liking someone else why should we continue this???” And maybe I’m a bit naive, I’m new to dating so idk how these things work but to me it just made no sense especially because again I don’t even know if I like the guy!! 

And I even asked if he saw a future for us and he said he doesn’t know he has to see how this goes and he wants to take it slow and maybe it could become serious, but if he’s going to be talking to other people then so am I and I know that I’ll probably find someone I like better that I’m more compatible with. We went back and forth for like 10 minutes and he was being a bit confusing because he started saying that he’d be sad if I found someone else but that I still should if I wanted to.. which is weird to me because isn’t that his choice to talk to other people like he should know?? And then somehow we got to talking about our friend introducing us and he said he liked me since the first time he met me so that made me even more confused as to why he wants us to also talk to other people??? 

And btw it’s fine if people aren’t exclusive in a casual relationship!! It’s whatever people feel comfortable with you know, I don’t think it’s wrong to do at all!! But I don’t want to get my hopes up with this relationship working just to get hurt, and I don’t even know if I like him like that and I don’t want him to get hurt either. And for me, I wanna work towards a serious relationship with someone and idk how that can happen with us if we’re talking to other people and I don’t even know if I like him or not.. 

So he did ask me if I was ok with being causal and if not we can just be friends, but I felt kind of bad saying I’m not ok with it so I said I am. I didn’t wanna hurt him and I was scared I would if I say no. In general, I think the whole time I’ve been kinda trying to figure out my feelings FOR HIM like I wanted to like him because I thought he liked me and I wanted it to work out because of that. I don’t really know? Oh and we also agreed to tell each other if and when we’d be talking to other people 

And I actually asked him what does “casual” mean to him like how does he want to continue this and he said basically what we’re doing now, and we can also kiss if I’m ok with that, which I thought was normal for going slow???? 
And then we also can talk to other people, which I understand is normal for casual relationships but for me I don’t know if I want that. 

So, after that awkward convo he asked if we could kiss some more, which I said yes to(and I did want to kiss don’t worry I didn’t feel pressured) and we just made out for a few minutes in his car, and then he drove me home.  The end. We’ve texted once since and that was when he texted me two days later asking how my week is doing and we just had a short convo.  

So the date was Sunday, I’ve had about 4 days to think about it and I still don’t know what my feelings are. I did start going on bumble again, but I do feel bad in a way even though he said that’s what we should do. I do kind of want to tell him that I don’t want either of us to get hurt and that we should just be friends. I wish I could figure out my feelings about him, but I really don’t know. I’ve had crushes before obviously but I don’t think that’s the same as going out with someone and dating them. I also might be on the asexual spectrum so I don’t really feel sexual attraction much. I did feel something when we were kissing though, but that’s not enough to date him you know? There has to be chemistry and a connection and idk if we have it. And tbh that third date just left a bad taste in my mouth.

And you’d think it’d be an easy answer; just end it if you don’t feel comfortable. But I keep being pressured by a couple of people in my life to keep seeing him and to “give him a chance maybe you’ll figure your feelings out and like him after a few more dates” or ”what if you don’t find anyone you have things in common with then what?” But I really don’t know if I want to see him again. But when I say “I don’t know if I like him or wanna see him again” I just get “why don’t you?” And I don’t know how to answer that like how do I explain my feelings to people who just ask “why?” every time I try to??

I’m physically fit and workout 5 days a week, family oriented, financial independent, I cool, clean and love a mixture of being spontaneous and cuddling in front of a movie. I guess the catch is I’m 5’8 and black so I get I’m not going to be a lot of peoples type but common…my luck can’t be this bad. 

I guess for me it’s usually all the women I’m interested in are never interested back and all the women who shows interest in me I’m not interested in back. I don’t consider myself picky at all; I’m just looking for someone cute who likes to go hiking or just do fun things together; you’d think I was asking for a million dollars.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,900254,public,self,Dating seems like a statistical impossibly yet somehow so many people are making it work.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ol4t94/dating_seems_like_a_statistical_impossibly_yet/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I have been dating this girl for about a year now. She is my first official gf and there are a lot of things I like about this relationship and her as a person. However, some stuff just signal me red flags and I wanted to see what is the general opinion here. 

Red flag 1: Once at a party at my flat we all got drunk and my Gf in front of everyone decided it would be appropriate to ask my friend to rate her ass ?? 

Red flag 2 : Again it was night out and I was in MacDonald's while her and her sister were outside. A guy approaches them and starts talking to them, they start laughing and as clear as they were to the least enjoying the interaction. I did not understand that as I would have assumed she would have said I have a bf and ended it here. 

Red flag 3: She speaks a lot with her friends and tells them everything. She was telling me once that they asked her how big I am and she replied ""nicely average"". I didn't think anything of it at the time and didn't care but now that I look at it, that was extremely disrespectful especially seeing as I never said anything explicit about her to any of my friends.  

In addition, I am from a very religious background and hence was a virgin until 24 ( 26 currently). I only had 2 partners including her. She claims to have 3 partners and have messed around with 5 guys total again including me. What's bothering me here is the fact that she started messing around at 17. That to me is incredibly young to even have a bf much mess around at that age. This is not a red flag to me but kind of keeps me up at night.

For he past few months R(30F) and I (30F) shared a client and we've gotten along really well, conversation is great and we've gotten into a habit of bragging about the other person when we're around other colleagues. About a month ago she had to drop the client due to really terrible circumstances and while consoling her she hugged me and said she'd really miss sharing a client with me and working together so closely. A few minutes later she said ""Oh didn't you mention you lived in [different city] I've dated a few girls there. Do you know what the queer scene is like?"" I'd been talking about how different some work related programs were in other cities I've lived in so I guess the question wasn't completely out of the blue but it seemed like the question you ask to figure out if someone is gay or not.

But after I confirmed I knew the scene I changed the topic to places to check out while she was there and then we had to part ways. We both joined the LGBT+ work council so she definitely knows I'm Bi at this point.

That takes us up to today, we finished the transition paperwork and she said that'd she miss working with me and we sort of went back and forth with how much respect there was then she asked if I'd want to hang out outside of work and gave me her number. After making plans(picnic at a local park- her idea)she said that she was glad I said yes and had actually wanted to ask me to hang out outside of work for a while. When I asked why she waited long she said because I was really sweet and she was just nervous.

Does anyone else feel like love is a game that they just aren't interested in playing? 

I don't have a competitive bone in my body. I was never the kid who was upset when they got out in dodgeball because the concept of competition has never made that much sense to me. When I'm dating I feel like you just have to have an unspoken acceptance that a guy is probably going to be dating/talking to/hooking up with multiple different women. Once I discover that I am in competition I simply no longer wish to participate. 

I have never thought the concept of the bachelor was healthy or even interesting. She's so excited at the end because she got the final rose but everything he said to make her fall in love he also said to all those other women. She fought, tried her hardest, cried herself to sleep and he went on multiple dates and had fun knowing that there's no competition for him. I know this is a show and mostly staged but honestly...dating in real life isn't that far off. 

You could be seeing someone for months and if you never had a talk about being exclusive he's probably still on tinder which suggests that he's looking for someone who isn't me/you. Why would I want to be exclusive with someone who can't focus on building something valuable with just 1 woman at a time? Do we really want to tell our future children that we met mommy/daddy through an app and then stuck around for months as they filtered through all the women/men in their lineup and finally picked you? Is that romantic? 

I get not wanting to put all your eggs in one basket but if one isn't willing to be all in with me then why should I compete in this little show? What happened to dating one person and taking a chance? We never know if it's going to work out until we do but because I feel like I'm constantly in competition with the women who live in some dude's phone, I rarely ever make it to that point. 

I'm a hopeless romantic but the past few guys I have dated (all really different guys...I did that on purpose to try to avoid this) have made me think ""if this is romance maybe I am okay on my own"" 

I know my value. I know my worth. Is the last woman standing the better woman or the dumber woman? 

It might all seem so negative but I really am just realizing that it's not romantic to be the pony he bet the most money on when he also bet on all the other horses in hopes that he wins SOMETHING. Is this meant to make me run faster to win this race? It makes me want to lie down and not race at all. 

Does anyone else feel like this? Or even some ""you're dumb and here's why"" might be helpful. I am almost ready to drop out of the race before the next one even begins.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,900335,public,self,Does anyone else feel like love is a game that they aren't willing to play?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ol5x5r/does_anyone_else_feel_like_love_is_a_game_that/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Let's set aside for this post the modern concept of the Nice Guy (TM), and just use the phrase ""nice guy"" to mean what it traditionally meant: a man who's not an asshole, who cares about and respects the people around him, and is willing to some degree to inconvenience himself for them. 

For a long time I thought the idea that women don't like nice guys was mostly nonsense. Like, maybe there's a grain of truth in there somewhere, but I'm a nice guy and women seem to like me pretty well. 

But over time I started to feel a little bitterness towards women about my niceness. I honestly started wondering whether women are capable of feeling gratitude like men are. A small example of this is the fact that women almost never thank me when I pay for a date. They also seem pretty oblivious or entitled if I make a larger gesture. For instance, let's say a woman I've been dating for a little while asks me to help her move. Okay, seems like kind of a big job considering we haven't known each other *that* long, but sure, you know what, I'd be happy to help you move. But then it doesn't seem like she appreciates it in the slightest; it's like she just feels entitled to my time and labor.

And here's a pattern I've noticed on multiple occasions: I meet a woman. She seems pretty intimidated by me and flattered that I'm interested in her. Like at first she literally apologizes when she texts me because she thinks she's bothering me. But I reassure her and make clear that I enjoy hearing from her, that I'm attracted to her, and so on. And she gets more comfortable... and then before long it's like she's completely taking me for granted, making me feel completely unappreciated. And sometimes I honestly feel, ""Maybe I should have just treated you like you were beneath me, the way you seemed to think I would.""

So I kind of stopped being nice for a while, partly as a deliberate decision and partly because I just got bitter and ran out of energy to care. I can't completely become an outright asshole, that's not in my nature. But I just stopped particularly caring about the feelings of the women I date. I haven't been polite, I don't really ask them much what they're thinking or feeling or about their lives in general, I refuse to go out of my way in the slightest for them. 

And good good God they're all over me. I thought I did fine with women before, but wow it's so much better when you just don't give a shit about them. 

But I have to be honest... I'm really struggling with my opinion about women in general now. How do you respect someone who prefers the company of people who treat her like shit? It's really hard to sympathize with them. 

Anyway, I'm just throwing this out there. I wonder if anyone here has any thoughts.

Another woman that I am dating is great and we have great chemistry, great sex and really click but she is just hard to nail down.

The next few times after that I invited him over to my place. He even told me he liked me and wanted to keep getting to know me after the 3rd. I didn’t say it back but I continued to meet him. 

We were messaging Saturday night about something casual like midnight snacks. I fell asleep but messaged him back Sunday morning and he sent me a picture of his dog. I replied something back and then silence out of nowhere. No answer all Sunday. I thought to myself maybe he was at work. I sent another message on Monday. Still no answer. He didn’t even open it. 

It’s so strange. I’ve been ghosted before but never after multiple dates. The annoying part about it is that he isn’t usually the type of guy I go for attraction wise. But I thought he was nice and a good kisser so I went with it. He seemed really into me and paid for all the dates and replied to me frequently before the ghost.

I’m just so confused. Everything was going so well and I thought I had a chance to finally start dating someone and then this happened. 

My plan was to wait a week and then delete him off my snap. But it was driving me crazy waiting on a reply so I just deleted him. The way I see it is if something bad happened or if he wasn’t into me he would’ve reached out to me. The fact that he didn’t just proves it wasn’t meant to be. Also he has my number and we’re still matched on the app so he can easily contact me if he wanted. 

Honestly a few days before the ghost he was replying slower to the point where I was gonna ask him if he was ok. But we had met up that night before he started acting weird and everything felt normal between us. I keep thinking back if I missed any red flags that I would’ve gotten ghosted and it’s so hard to tell. It’s sucks that even “nice guys” can do you dirty.

I've had three personal experiences in my life that have left me baffled. It doesn't help that I'm already a bit underdeveloped on the whole ""social skills"" thing.

One time i was chatting with a girl at a party, just chatting, not flirting, but we were having a good time talking. As she was leaving later that night, i thought to myself ""heck, why not ask for her number or something. It's the ideal time to because she's already on the way out so it's not like I'd be making the rest of the night awkward"". She shyly said yes, we exchanged digits, either the next day or so (don't remember, long time ago) i ask if she wants to go out, and she says yes, but shoots down every single day i suggest, without EVER offering a day she's free. After this goes back and forth a few times i figure, ""oh, this is her trying to politely tell me to go away"" so i go away and stop bothering her. But then, like, a YEAR later, some of my friends bumped into her, and apparently she was super disappointed that we never met up after the party!

??? THEN WHY--- but this is nothing compared to my other data points, if you will.

On TWO separate occasions, two different women unrelated to the prior story, the following scenario has played out:

Meet girl through friends. Girl VERY explicitly flirts with me, making overtly sexual statements. I try to do some light flirting back. She says something more or less to the effective of ""lol ur thirsty, go away"". I go away. The next day she confronts me about how annoyed she is that i didn't chase her.

???????????

I thought maybe i was hallucinating or misremembering or something, but then i recently saw one of those youtube tiktoks where the woman who was the subject of the video talked about deliberately killing conversations with guys to see if they still chase you, as an expression of interest in said guy? And she somehow wasn't being thumbed down to oblivion???

I don't understand. This is a frightening frequency with which it seems women are implicitly requesting guys to act like stalkers. I know it's only four data points, but it's four more than it should be, with evidence that it's much more pervasive than that.

Hello users! I will jump straight into the story. So we had a friend circle 8 boys and 3 girls. I like one of the girls (i do not know if she likes me too she is kinda back and forth), so we started snapping, texting. At first it was going VERY well, but i did not make any moves, because at that time i liked her on a friend level. 
Three months as we gotten closer i started to like her. So i made a move: me, her, her girlfriend and on of the boy from our company were sitting on a long bench. I was on the edge and she was next to me. So i said go for it and i put my arm around her and she reacted possitive. After that we went back to the remainder of our friends. Then ( my dumb brain) decided i should WAIT and not do any move on her like, invite her out. 
So it is 2 months ago we have kind of distenced each other. One night she was laughing at what i said, looking at me, smiling at me. And when i got home she sent me a funny post, we started texting and out of nowhere she started sending a lot of emojis. The next day she was travelling somewhere and she sent me some photos  of her, she was smiling just being happy ( i did not ask her out again and this was the perfect moment). 
Our friend group hosted a party and i got drunk and was arogant with her and the next day she left me on seen. I apologized later. 
We get to the present time, the girls left out friend group (they got bored so they left) and it has been month or more since she had gone out with us. I realised my mistake i should have been more confident and should have talked with her more. I was obssesed with the pull method so she could chase me, but i did not give her anything to chase. 
So my problem is how do I start to text with her again. And how do I re-attract her ( there is some mystery since we have not seen each other for a long time)?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,900657,public,self,"Girl leaves me on seen after messing up things with her, but i have changed and i want to try again with her.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ol9fqy/girl_leaves_me_on_seen_after_messing_up_things/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Sure enough I add her on snap and she’s posting a bunch of suggestive pictures and a price list for her onlyfans which is a shame because she’s a really sweet girl to me.

 I seriously can’t imagine being romantically involved with someone who sells their body for money because a romantic relationship is supposed to be special to me, if I pursue her and we start dating, she’s going to be sharing sexual energy with me and the other old ass horny men on her onlyfans and that just feels wrong to me. 

To me, it used to seem easy to pick out those kind of girls who were the porn star type or the stripper type but with the girls who use onlyfans, like they could be the cashier that’s scanning your groceries or the girl at the bar who’s checking you out because all you need is a smartphone to sign up. So it’s hard for me to find my type, it seems extremely common for young girls to have onlyfans accounts and I just can’t see myself dating someone like that.

Alright here's a lil back story : so during 2016, there was a get together (college pals reunion kinda thing) at my dad's friends place which consisted of 5 families.

He was also present there (this party was organized at his place) and was the quietest one in the lot. Back then i had a huge crush on him and whenever i tried speaking to him he would walk away, so i thought that maybe he wasn't comfortable talking to me or just not interested.

we kept in touch over social media but that didn't last for long either cause sooner or later he wasn't that active on it as he used to be, due to excessive college work and all that stuff.

yesterday i got to know he had joined as an intern in the same company that i am currently working in (as an intern itself) both of us are 21 y/o, just that we have a 5 months age gap is all. i couldn't recognize him initially because he looked so different from how he used to look back then, but he recognized me immediately once he saw me. he told me that he had recognised me the very day when i was late to work. i had gone to the HR dept to give my signature and write down the time that i had reached. he was seated on the waiting couch in the same dept and he heard my voice. he checked the attendance sheet and  he knew it was me. he wanted to say hi but he didn't because i was in a rush.

yesterday, we spoke about our internships, our families and our future dream jobs and all the general stuff. Also, he is a big time extrovert and im an introvert. 

He remembered about the get together that we had 5 years back was actually pretty shocked when i told him that he wasn't the only one who remembers it.

at times i keep having this feeling of whether to pursue him or not cause of many reasons. He might have a gf already or maybe he was being open because he is an extrovert like i said earlier or maybe because i am family friend to him.

When I asked my friends for advice they told me to get to know him more and speak to him during our off work hours and  know his secrets and stuff like that. they also stated that the way things are going on as of now is still a good start and ofc im not jumping to conclusions, just putting my thoughts out is all. 

i dont mind having him as a friend either because he is just an awesome guy, but i'm just kinda confused about the whole situation. i can be completely myself when i am around him which again is a positive thing.

So am I right about this or is it just a thought?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,900837,public,self,Is he interested or am I just overthinking?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/olbetg/is_he_interested_or_am_i_just_overthinking/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I tottaly inderstand that and the problem isn't that I want him to pay. I want to pay myself, but he doesn't want me to pay for the both of us.

The thing is, if we are always just going to pay for ourselves I do have a problem with that, because I honestly do think it is kinda selfish and cheap. I rather pay every single time we are going to do something for both of us the split the bill.


The reason is mainly because if you are so busy with paying just for yourself the stuff we are doing becomes about that instead of enjoying spending time togheter. I rather pay so that we can both relax and have a good time then to calculate if we both payed for only our own stuff. 

For example we bought snacks yesterday and we didn't finish all of them. I was planning on just leaving them at his place (because we were are his place and then he can finish them later) but he told me I could keep the once I payed for. He also while shopping took his things out of my cart so we could pay for our own stuff (I was planning to just pay for everything myself. It wasn't a lot and I'd like to pay, especially when on a first date).

He is really sweet, but it just bothers me. It feels like the money is more important this way then having fun togheter and tbh I don consider it as a deal breaker especially since he told me that it isn't because it is the first date (which as a women I can understand that a men would be afraid to be taken advatage of if he pays the first date and splitting is more polite, so I'd get that), but he said that he is always like this and I just don't see myself enjoying a relationshil with someone who wants to always only pays for their own stuff.

He is only 18 and I am 29 and we had a really nice time together and I really liked him a lot to my surprise as I would not normally go for younger men. I wanted to take things slow but he wanted to rush straight into a relationship. Is this a red flag or just down to his age? As the night progressed, we didn't have sex but made out and touched each other a bit. I was getting overwhelmed and headache so I lay down in my bed for a few minutes he was in the living room. Then he goes and just leaves and later says it upset him I just went to bed without saying bye to him. He's open to communication and I did call him afterwards to explain I was just overwhelmed but he didn't understand. It felt like there was something there between us like something real so it be a shame if we never get to explore that together but I also scared and don't wanna be mislead or hurt as I have by many men in the past but I want to believe there good men out there.

Next Weekend me and my boyfriend are one year together , so I wanted to give him a gift.
The Problem is that I have no idea what I could make him for a gift .
It shouldnt be something too Cheesy ,but something Personal and at least a little bit selfmade.
I cant afford smth like a vacation or Else because I am too young and I want something were you can See that I put some efford in it.
I thought of making a hoodie were I embroider Our Initials into at the end of the sleeve. I also Would write him a love Letter and put some Photos to it. But I dont know if This is Not Personal and Special enough. 
So I just wanted to ask what you guys Gifted your girlfriends / boyfriends in your relationships or if you have any good ideas of a present :) 
Thanks in advance ♡

This has left him with short term memory loss and some facial ticks (plus I'm sure there are a few other things that he didn't share). Okay, I wasn't expecting it, but I rolled with it and asked lots of questions about his life etc. He had a lovely smile and seemed happy chatting with me. His facial ticks were really noticeable but I ignored them. Conversation flowed well despite him not asking me anything about myself which is always a little red flag. He started talking about how he was a ""high functioning drug addict"" prior to his heart attack. He said he doesn't do hard drugs anymore but he smokes weed everyday and drinks almost daily. Up to this point, I was happy giving him a chance and interested in getting to know him better. But there were too many red flags. We said our farewells and he hugged me goodbye.
