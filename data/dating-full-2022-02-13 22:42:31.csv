I arrive at the date and she doesn't look like her profile pic. Same basic features but I can tell the profile pics were taken with heavy filtering and from the best angle possible. I'm thinking yeah whatever, this is catfishing but I'll be nice and talk for 1 hour then leave.

Towards the end of the date the woman says to me ""By the way, how come you didn't follow up after our earlier date?"" - I had a shocked look on my face.

I also know his family (albeit, only for a year or so - they moved to where i live), I'm okay with everyone and the dad acted like a second dad to me.. until he got a little overfriendly at one point after enquiring about why my ex and I split up, and asked me if I was interested to meet at some point (and yes, I rejected him - even told him he was too old for me and would never happen). We were always friendly and frank with each other, I knew the dad first due to projects we worked on. He did apologise (I do feel like I need another one though), but I need some time to get over the discomfort. 

*The only thing I can think of that may have been a tad ""flirty"" was I mentioned he looked younger when he shaved..*

My crush believes that he did say these things and agrees they're inappropriate, but doesn't believe his dad will follow through (in his words, his dads personality is naturally flirty). Did apologise for my uncomfortableness,  and with that being said, I don't know if its worth bringing up again unless we start dating.

Is it worth asking the crush to reiteratemy discomfort to this man when I'm able to see him? Or Should I explain how I feel about his son?

We had an argument which caused us not to talk for a few weeks in january but then he hit me up again and we started talking again.
It's clear that we're both interested in each other, not madly in love but the interest is there. The only problem is is that he's taking things too slow. I'd like to face time or meet up and go to the city or something but he hasn't asked me or anything even though he's had many chances to.

We were going to meet up in december and I initiated it, but then we got into that argument and it didn't go through. We were also going to FaceTime once in december and I initiated it again, but he canceled at last.

Do you guys think that I should give it up and not waste energy on it? Or should I be more patient and see how things go.

It's my birthday next week and I've told him multiple times that I don't have any plans yet and I thought maybe he'd propose to go do something but he hasn't... :(
That makes me think he just wants to talk to me cause he's bored but then he does things like regularly check up on me, talk to his friends about me, call me nicknames etc..

But yeah ever since yesterday we started texting eachother saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù back and forth and such, and today I decided okay I think this just needs to end because I‚Äôm not really attracted to her.
And here is how our text conversation went:

Me: Hey ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù I hate to break it to you but there is something that I really need to tell you.
And that is after texting you for a while, I‚Äôve found out I‚Äôm not really attracted to you.
I don‚Äôt think your ugly or anything but your  just not my type.
But please don‚Äôt get upset though because there are tons of other guys like me that you can find.
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm just not attracted to you at all.
Please don‚Äôt get upset

The girl: üíî

Me: Yeah, I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt mean to break your heart like thatü•∫.

Alright !
It‚Äôs pretty straight forward. I‚Äôm a 20 F in a large city. So there are no shortage of options, right? Not quite. I have a slight problem. I‚Äôm kind of ugly. Not unsightly. Just as some have put it‚Ä¶ funny looking. I‚Äôm pretty hygienic and fit, but I am definitely a butterface. I think so far I‚Äôve been doing what I can and I‚Äôll say I dress better than most people on campus.

I don‚Äôt wanna ramble on this post but I would appreciate advice. I have tried dating apps but I don‚Äôt get many matches and the few I do just want sex. Nothing else ever. I‚Äôm the girl that is only called at night. 
Should I start approaching guys? How would men feel about being flirted with someone not so pretty? Should I lower my standards? I‚Äôm not desperate for a relationship but it would nice to have. I honestly have no problem being single as long as I have good friends. I just kinda wanna know what it‚Äôs like.

So I have a hang up about a woman‚Äôs sexual past when they have had a large amount of sexual partners.  I have had a decent amount of sexual partners and I would not want someone I enter into relationship to have had even that amount.  

And it‚Äôs not like I want to feel shitty about someone‚Äôs past and it‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt get over the thoughts of her being sexual with other people. 

It‚Äôs more that, generally and oftentimes, women are hurt, used, told what they want to hear, to get them into bed and then, once they‚Äôve been used up sexually for a time/week/month, are left. And that takes it toll on a persons self image/worth/outlook etc. That‚Äôs my real hang up.

I cancelled on him once last week due to work, but we were finally able to meet up yesterday. Our texts have been great, and he had been texting me throughout the day and even said  good morning everyday. I postponed our date by  couple of hours yesterday because I was a bit hungover. He was very understanding and didn't complain, saying he totally understood. We also had never actually had agreed on a time, just had planned to do ""something Saturday."" We ended up meeting in the early evening at a cafe for coffee between our apartments. It had a huge line out front, and he got visibly angry saying ""We should've gone earlier, I kind of want to just go home. I hate lines and this just put me in a really bad mood."" He then pulled out a cigarette and smoked right next to me. This was just minutes after first meeting him... I told him I was so sorry, that I think the line will go by fast and he insisted on doing something else or heading back home. I suggested we go walking in the park and go to the market and that I think we'll have fun anyway. We ended up having a pretty good time and stayed for a few hours. I didn't buy anything, but he bought quite a bit. He kept saying ""I'm so sorry, I should've planned this better, I feel like this whole date has been you walking and me shopping. Hope I didn't bore you out of your mind your first time meeting me. But I appreciate you thinking of other things for us to do. I'm so glad I didn't go home."" I insisted I still had a great time and that I love going to the market, and that I was glad he didn't go home either.. 

A couple hours later he told me he was ready to go, and that he had lost his appetite other wise he would stop and get food. I told him no worries and that I was going to stop to eat and he was welcomed to join. He ended up going home saying he wished he didn't eat before going, that he was only planning on getting a coffee at the cafe. I told him no worries. He apologized for having lost his temper in line earlier today, and gave me a hug and told me to text when I got home. I did. He once again texted me apologizing, saying he won't do that again. I told him no worries and that I would love to try going to the cafe again this week, and maybe we can make reservations this time. He responded saying he'd ""absolutely love to!"" and I told him to let me know when he is free. He said ""ok perfect, will do! Have a great night."" I responded and he hearted the message. Now, I haven't heard from him all day! I know it's only been 24 hours, but I'm a little worried because we usually text everyday. And he's always asking me questions and trying to get to know me better. Would he have agrees to meet me later this week and say ""he'd love to"" if he wasn't interested? 

I saw he was getting notifications from the app we met on so I know he's talking to other women, I'm still talking to other men but I do like him. If I don't hear from him. in a couple days, should I reach out about meeting again, or let him be the one to initiate?

Since then and during lockdown, I haven't thought about any kind of romantic relationships, choosing to focus on my studies, my career, and my friends instead. 

But now that universities are reopening, I notice that everyone around me has a girlfriend or a boyfriend. People manage to plug their S/Os in literally every conversation. Friends are starting to become unavailable to hang out because they have dates. I realize that I'm missing out a lot by not dating or trying to date at this point in my life. Besides, it won't be that long before I graduate and I know I'll regret not dating at 22. 

**Here's the issue. I want to get back to dating but I have no idea where to start**. Definitely not on dating apps because as an East Asian male of average height in N-A, I know it'll probably harm my self-esteem more than anything and I don't have time to sacrifice my mental health for that. I also tried to get involved in my university's student activities, but almost all the girls I got to know at school are not single (smh -\_-). At the very few parties that were allowed before Omicron, I always got ""friendzoned"" because while I do not consider myself particularly unattractive nor a bad communicator, I totally forgot how to flirt and I'm not sure what are the right circumstances/flags to ask a girl out. 

But what I DO know is that if I don't do something about it now, I could very well wake up at 40, single with no dating experience while everyone I know is already married with kids. And I don't believe all that talk about ""the right person will come eventually"".

FaceTimed her for a total of around 9 hours in a 3 day span before she was comfortable meeting. The first date was magical, I could tell there was a connection. Second, third, and now fourth, also went great. We‚Äôre very likeminded people and have genuine conversations, not just on some fwb shit. We‚Äôve gotten real sexy a few times now. I saw her last night, and planned with her for Valentine‚Äôs Day. She was totally down at first, planned to see a movie, which we talked about today. I was also going to casually discuss the future of our relationship tomorrow, ‚Äúhey i really like you where do you see this going?‚Äù etc. Now she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs having a small depressive episode and would rather be alone tomorrow. Of course I understand, I‚Äôm giving her space, told her she can confide in me if she wants to talk. I have a bad knack for self sabotage, so I can‚Äôt help but question if I‚Äôm the only guy she‚Äôs seeing? I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking to hear from y‚Äôall, maybe experience with this sort of thing? This is the first girl in 4 years I‚Äôve developed a genuine l*ve for, and she seems almost too good to be true based on the things my sabotaged mind tells itself, but at the same time I feel respect and genuine interest from her.

So my friend moved to another city but we stayed in touch a bit, and after being single for a while I kind of thought about him and how amazing he is in many aspects (also feeling of regret that I didn't try to flirt/make a move back then). One night i decided to confess that many years ago I kinda had a tiny crush on him, and he told me that he also had a crush on me but was also afraid to make a move back then.

We began flirting over text and send risky photos. We talked about what we wanted (relationship and move in together in a year) if things go well when we meet again after years apart. After few months flirting, talking and all that I bought planetickets and lived with him for two weeks. We were very affectionate, physical and overall had a great time.. Even met his family. Kinda got strong feelings for him now. 

Problem is we're talking everyday and he's very good at initiating the conversation, but we're not really flirting on messages anymore. We didn't talk about what we want out of this and regret not asking when I left his place. It's only two weeks ago I got back, but lately i'm not sure if he wants to be romantic level with me. He sent me snap a week ago that a girl bought a beer to him and gave her number, which made me feel kinda shit. 

What should I do next? Is it bad idea to back a bit off and see if he's interested? I kinda don't want to be the one to talk about about this relation...

So to begin, I was in an 3 years relationship and broke up with her. At that time I came really close, in a just friendly way,  with my neighbour. We were in same class for all the years but never shared any deep connection. 

Her and me broke up with our partners nearly around the same time. We helped each other a lot before and through the process. I never had the feeling that she influenced me to break up with my old gf, just to be clear.

Btw that were our first relationships and break ups, so having a different and an opposite gender view was great 

So after some weeks being single, we talked about sex and she asked if I would sleep with her, just in a friends way. So the first partner would be familiar, after only having sex with that partner before. I answered yes. But we made the rule, no feeling and friendship comes first, so we would stop if anything weird would have happened. 

So that went for a month or two, still just friends no feelings, and I‚Äôm sure she saw that the same way. 
Then she went on vacation and met a guy she liked and asked me, what she didn‚Äôt had to, if it was okay that she would sleep with him. I didn‚Äôt care and told her ‚Äúof course you can‚Äù. In the long time she was gone I met a new girl. That was the unsaid stop of our friends with benefits. I told my best friend everything about the new girl like best friends do. And she was completely cool with it. 

So even tho we had sex, our friendship was still to the best as before. 

Some months later I met my new ex girlfriend. It was perfect. But one day she dreamed about me having sex with neighbour, she knew we were close. And asked if we had something. I told her yes and everything she wanted to know. But she was very angry, I understood her feelings, because I wouldn‚Äôt know how I would feel about it, if I was in her position. She wanted a break and I gave her time. In the end she was fine with me having something with my neighbour but was mad about me not telling her, we met for like 1 month and weren‚Äôt together yet. 

I told her, that that is a very complicated topic and was comfortable with telling her so ‚Äúearly‚Äù in our relation. And I was kinda scared tbh, because I know how weird it sounds from outstanding view and she already ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt asked her about being together after 3 week of meeting.

We just instantly got along so well. It was an instant connection. For reference, i'm 25, and she's 26. We started dating knowing it would be a long distance relationship. I'm 3 hours away, one way. That hasn't been a problem at all yet, and we both enjoy visting the two cities.

However, before going out with her for the first time, I was skeptical there was any chance I would be attracted to her because she didn't have a college degree &amp; the incompatibilities this would bring. After going out the first time though, I was seriously attracted. She was a hoot. We kissed on the first date.

Fast forward almost 4 months, she's my girlfriend, and we've been seeing each other seriously for awhile. ***She makes me feel absolutely amazing.*** I've been single &amp; dating around for the past two years, but I came out of a 4 year relationship before that, and she makes me feel a way the other girl never did. She's super loving &amp; caring.

On paper, I feel like we really aren't that compatible with interests &amp; what not, but in reality, we get along really, really well.

***However, that being said, I have a few reservations / red flags about her that stop me from feeling like I have an absolute catch.*** I guess i'm looking for input on these to think about it more myself.

1) She doesn't really have any hobbies or interests of her own. She just likes being a girly girl &amp; going out drinking with me or her friends. But that being said, she's a people pleaser and wants to try any or all of my hobbies. We have an absolute great time doing almost nothing or anything.

2) I feel like she isn't as motivated or disciplined as me, but I don't really think we have that different of life plans. I'm getting go back for my master's while working full-time now. Money really isn't a big motivator for me, but I make more than double her already. It's more just the disparity that bothers me. I'm an intellectual, and I want my significant other to be too. I kind of feel like I can't bring her home to my parents because they will really think I'm dating down because of this. She went to school for two years and dropped out, even though she had decent grades. It was in-part because she was in an abusive relationship at the time, but she has no intent of advancing her career path now.

3) She got out of a very long relationship a few months before we started dating. In the past, I find that girls just try to please the guy or deflect on things if they find the guy attractive. I kind of feel like this could be happening here. We get along so well, but we don't necessarily have that many interests in common, on paper. Is this a red flag? She seems so interested in pleasing me, but I want someone that enjoys mutual things with me. Am I just skeptical about relationships based on past experience?

4) Should it be a red flag that she's been on anti-depressants for a few years? This one was originally a non-issue for me, but i'm not entirely convinced she's trying to make the changes to break this. She was going through a stressful time, and that's when she first got on them. I feel like some of her issues do stem from her lifestyle, and personality. She very often puts other people before herself.

ill try to make this short and concise. i met her around december where we went on a coffee date. we talked on the phone a few times after meeting and next time we met in her car at the end i asked if i could kiss her, and she said she would rather be friends. At this point i gave up but were still friends, later on she came over one night to watch a movie where she made moves on me and we hooked up while i literally did not attempt a single thing. After the hook up we talked about it slightly and she said to forget it and this wont happen again.

Skip forward to today, where i am not sure if i still have feelings or if I don't really care about her. I just got back from us hanging out at a bar and we grabbed a bite to eat. For some reason while we were hanging out at the bar she pointed at two girls, and was telling me to hit on them which I really wasn't interested to do but i thought was really weird. I think I actually like her, but from our various hangouts it seems she was hurt in the past from her last relationship. She even said she hates valentines day because of love which is tomorrow, and multiple times revealed that she's not sure if she wants hook ups or relationships.

Should i confess my feelings? She leaves in a few days and gets back from her trip about 2 weeks from now. I want to hangout 1 more time with her to see if my feelings are valid or if im just emotionally attached, and then I want to express my feelings. If something comes out of it that's good, if not then I will try to kill those feelings.

Any opinions or maybe some advice? I feel conflicted and not sure what I want to do if anyone can offer me some advice i would really appreciate it. Let me know if i can answer any questions.

My issue is that each time I do meet a decent guy ... he's already taken. Be it already married, seriously dating someone or starting a new relationship. They're already taken. I do meet other single guys, but they're single for a specific reason: they're pining after someone else, recently divorced, just wanting NSA sex, questioning their sexuality, getting over a breakup, etc.
