I texted him one last time to apologize after self reflecting to let him know how much I still want to be around him and see if we could give it another shot. He didn’t reply, ouch. I know deep inside that if he ever reach out in the future again, I’d still take my chances with him. But I know based on my experience, he’d never reach out. He probably thinks I’m some crazy chick. Well, I know it’s time to move on but it’s gonna be hard and probably gonna sting a little.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qknhru/pushed_a_guy_away_what_are_the_chances_hed_reach/
2,qknk77,1635800074,Is she into me or she just enjoys the attention?,"So, obviously I'd wanna detail every moment but I'll try to keep it short and brief and you guys let me know what you think. Specially women! Please come forth and let me know what the scene is here.
Lastly, let me know if I should try anymore AT ALL post this.

1. I share music with her and so does she, I'm the little idiot that keeps on sending more music than she does. On days I've gone quiet on chat she sends me something. (I'm guessing she's just tryna string along cause she knows I'm gonna text?) She's quite complimentary about my music taste tho, says stuff like ""This might just become my favourite genre."" (but that doesn't mean shit I guess)
She sends me songs by Cigarettes After Sex and other emotional-esque bands and also some dance songs.
2. When I invited her for a few gigs and etc she makes some kind of excuse. (Basically politely says that she ain't into me - - is what I read about this)
3. She randomly texts me at times about some dress or shoes shes gonna cop and yeah.
4. Sometimes she leaves really long texts about something we spoke about but is otherwise a little close to mum on most things.
5. Tells me that she likes my sense of humour.
6. Calls me ""Dude"".
7. I'd asked her out twice - - once she said yes and once she said she wasn't looking for anyone.  
(This was a year or more ago though)  


So I guess she just likes the attention?  
I mean I've tried.

13,qkonij,1635803139,Pro tip for dating that I never really considered before,"I think most of us could agree that the majority of dating these days is done online and through social media/apps. With that being said, recently it never once occurred to me that most of life is about **’networking’**, especially when it comes to dating. 

So many of us are just trying to get strictly to the end game, which is usually a happy relationship and being comfortable. I think this is the wrong way to go about things. 

Lately I’ve been going to a lot of meetups, bars and joining clubs. What an absolutely breath of fresh air it is to actually go out and meet new people regardless of intentions. When you put yourself in the company of others you’re constantly making new connections which could lead to something else down the road. 

The more people you know, the more likely you are to be invited out to parties, social events and potentially meet the love of your life naturally. Trying to force conversations on dating apps and hope they stay interested long enough just for someone else better to come along is so dreadful. People you would of probably swiped left on the app, found me quite charming and easy to talk to in person. 

You’d be surprised at how easy it was this past weekend to talk to total strangers and have meaningful conversations. I made 3 or 4 new friends in the span of 2 days. Imagine how many more connections I would of made over the years if I had been going outside 😂

I also got laid this last weekend and ended a 2 year dry spell…my goodness lol fuck the apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkonij/pro_tip_for_dating_that_i_never_really_considered/

I really do like him. I think his personality is amazing, and I absolutely love his style. I think he's very handsome too. We went out again and actually initiated touch this time. Usually, with people I'm attracted to, I feel so tense and shaky. But with him, I just feel so relaxed and just lean into him xD. He's very warm (which is a plus!)

When we hugged at the end, instead of feeling butterflies, I literally slumped into the hug and closed my eyes because it literally felt so nice and comforting. Why am I reacting so differently with him compared to everyone else I found attractive? No nervousness whatsoever, but just feel at peace? I'm wondering if I actually like him or just like him a lot platonically haha.

We have feelings for each other and there's chemistry every time we see each other but we are at different stages in life. We have been exclusively dating but not in a relationship because he just graduated from college and having a girlfriend wasn't a priority to him. He was unemployed and living back with his alcoholic dad. So he's been focused on his career/getting out of that living situation. We stopped talking because I have strong feelings and didn't like that I was being left on the back burner. He was also becoming distant too and never had an urge to see me (he saw me at his own convenience/i never really knew the next time i was going to see him)

Now, he reached out and shared how he was moving in two weeks. He is going to live 1.5 hours away from me in his own place. We started talking again and hung out but it's been kinda platonic in a sense. He came over and brought me breakfast and we went out to the beach together. We would talk and share stuff about each other but we didn't kiss/have sex. I've had sex with him before multiple times so IDK I felt like at least we would have kissed each other. I met his mom accidentally and he told me he was happy I liked her. His parents know of me, but as ""his friend.""

I'm not sure if it's a good sign or not because we haven't talked about how he moves away and what that means with us.

So I told my female friend about this and she said I should have just gone for it and double texted anyways and she went on a rant about how guys are too prideful to even if something small like that and whatnot. Like guys are too prideful to double text and that she'd expect or appreciate a double text even though she didn't reply. 
So naturally I told her she was full of crap and how I, at the very least, deserved someone who is interested enough to hold a conversation and much more interested enough to be considerate to at least cancel a date or say they aren't interested. 

I left that girl alone and she never bothered messaging me back she ghosted me, whatever. She didn't seem all that interesting or interested anyways so I didn't fight it.

23,qkpck0,1635805103,Met Someone I Really Like But I Want To Move On,"Hey All,

M24 here. I recently met a girl I really like (F24). We get along well and we've been exclusive for a few months now. Everything is going really well. I can really see something long term with her, and I can tell she feels the same.

Recently though, something started bugging me. It's my body count. Covid really ruined my dating life the past few years. I really wanted to go through a party phase and just sleep around for a bit, but Covid put a stop to that. I met her really quickly after I started dating again after I got back into the dating scene.

What's bugging me is that if I stay with her, I probably won't get to do the things that I wanted to do like picking girls up at clubs. Her body count is about double mine (in the 30s), which doesn't bug me in the slightest. But it makes me wonder if we're on the same page. I feel like she's had her fun and wants to settle down, but I'm starting to think I might not have had my fun.

TLDR: I feel like I've met someone who's great for me, but that I met her too early. I don't want to break it off with her, but at the same time I feel like I'm missing out on all the fun of being single.

He messaged me first an hour or so after the meet up saying thanks, was fun etc and he said he will next come to my hometown (as I had mentioned).. 

Anyway, he is pretty awful at texting, there is no ongoing conversation, he has tended to leave things unless a direct question..

I'm struggling to know how far to push it.. is he a bad texter or just not interested... My inclination is that if he was interested, I would know about it. 

Should I just leave it and risk missing an opportunity or in the next week or so suggest getting a date booked in for him to come to me? 

I don't want to be too pushy or too keen..! Are men just a bit more shit at texting? (Fyi I don't think he is much of a phone guy.. he didn't check it at all during our date/meet up).

26,qkpf2v,1635805292,Is 6 weeks of dating too soon to ask them whether they could potentially see this becoming something serious?,"I’ve been seeing this dude for 5/6 weeks, altogether we’ve been on 8 dates, averaging about 1 to 2 dates a week. Every time we spend time together we either get drinks/food or do an activity, and only 3 out of the dates did I go back to his place. About 2/3 weeks in he did mention how he wasn’t actively dating other people but we also didn’t discuss being exclusive as it was so early on, and it would be silly. I know that it’s still early, however I do fancy this dude, but I’m worried he is after a more casual relationship. While I understand that some people enjoy these kinds of mostly physical relationships, it is not something I would like to get involved in as the one time I did it really affected my self esteem. Thing is I would like to know if he does fancy me, as I would like to know sooner rather than later so that I do not get too emotionally attached. However, do you think asking 5/6 weeks in would be much too soon? 

I feel like I kind of know the answer anyway, seeing as over the last couple of weeks his reply times to texts have been getting longer and longer but I am worried it might be too soon and I could potentially leave it for a couple of weeks. I don’t want to spook him in case he could potentially like me, but then if he does like me then realistically he wouldn’t find it off putting right? 

I don’t want him to be my boyfriend yet or anything like that but it would be nice to know he wasn’t dating other people, and didn’t just see me as a casual fling just so he can get some while he continues to date to find someone he actually likes.

I would like to also say that I am 25 and I’ve never had a boyfriend, and I’ve had some not so great experiences with guys just wanting sex, so I may be a bit overly sensitive about these things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkpf2v/is_6_weeks_of_dating_too_soon_to_ask_them_whether/

Ever since she broke up with her boyfriend (less than a week ago) she has gone out of her way trying to get me to introduce her to them and overly stating her interest (almost seems fake).

I mean, wading through a guy who lead me on for 6 months, ghosters, guys who only cared about hooking up, and guys who just stopped replying.

I feel lucky to have found this guy, but my head is filled with doubts. While I like this guy and I am attracted to him, he's not my usual type. I typically go for white collared guys built like soccer/tennis players while this guy is more blue collared and built like a football/baseball player. Still good looking, but not the guy I'd usually look at twice if I were just out and about. There are other little things about him that make me question things, but not enough to stop seeing him.

I don't know. I think it's because I have so little experience dating (let alone being with someone seriously) that I am questioning why I'm not feeling as strongly about this guy as I usually did about my crushes and that guy who lead me on for like 6 months. I was seriously like obsessed over that guy. Felt giddy over-the-moon getting a message from him, was heartbroken when he would leave me on read, and like cried when I thought things were over and we weren't even dating!! Like, I am so used to being goo goo gaga over guys that I was never even with that I feel weird not having that intense feeling of infatuation and pining over this incredibly sweet guy I am dating. Like, I'm attracted to him, I feel like I can 100% be myself around him which I have never really felt with a guy before, I think about him all the time when he's away, and I get excited to see him when we have plans. But, when I think about how I would feel if things were to end now, I can 100% say that I wouldn't be heartbroken. Like, I can see myself moving on relatively quickly, which scares and confuses me.

We both still have the dating app we met on, but he's made it clear that he's only seeing me, which I believe. And, I am only seeing him too. I do occasionally look at the pool of guys who have liked me on the dating app, but I never match with anyone. I am planning to bring up the exclusivity talk pretty soon, which would lead to us (hopefully) removing those accounts, but before that, I want to figure out my hesitation here.

Is it because of my inexperience with dating? Like, since I never really had anything serious with a guy who completely falls in line with what I typically gravitate to in a man, my mind is stuck in a what-if scenario and hesitant to commit due to FOMO?

Or, is it my lack of really getting to know any of the men I dated, which means I fell for the idealistic version of them and what things would be like in my head? And now, that I have something real, it can't live up to that imaginary perfect relationship, and so I am seeking something that does not exist?

It can be either of those two things or anything really. But, it could also be that in real life, it actually takes me longer to attach to a partner than I originally anticipated. I am so used to attaching to my imagination of things, that the real thing feels weird maybe lol? That's something for me to figure out myself, but that's not really what I'm here for. 

So, that brings me to my question. How long does it usually take you to feel that feeling of attachment to a new partner that goes beyond just missing them but actually feeling like you really want them in your life and you want to work hard as hell to make sure that happens? I'm sure it's different for different people, and it probably differs even amongst the same person with different partners. I just want examples of how long it  has taken you either currently or in the past?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkqgr3/how_long_does_it_take_you_to_become_attached_to_a/
36,qkqkus,1635808635,"Guys always lose interest or ghost me after the first or second date, but before that things are generally good. What gives?","First of all, I'm 26 years old and I’m pretty new to online dating in the year of 2021. I’ve noticed there’s always a trend; consistent texting and interest shown prior to date 1, then after date 1, I either get ghosted or softly rejected. It makes me question what I’m doing wrong. First of all, I’m a pretty big introvert and have mild social anxiety while meeting new people, but not to the extent that I remain overly quiet and detached during dates. I usually try to show interest by asking questions and making some light hearted jokes. Unfortunately, I’m also not the life of the party. I’m still reserved and I suck at small talk, but I always end up opening up more after some time passes. I like deep conversations and can get pretty immersed in them. Sometimes the topic of mental health can come up in conversations and in these circumstances, I have the habit of revealing too much about my struggle with anxiety. I don’t go too far into detail and I make sure I don’t talk about it too much, yet I still can’t help but wonder if it’s the reason people lose interest after meeting me in person. Other than that, I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I avoid touchy subjects like politics and religion and if I ever ask a personal question, I always preface it by saying things like “you don’t have to answer if you don’t feel comfortable with it.” I also make it clear to these people that I’m not looking for hookups or casual FWB situations. I don’t think I’m unattractive and I doubt my hygiene is the problem. I’ve been told I look pretty much the same in my photos as I do in person. Only thing I’m slightly insecure about is not having super white teeth, but again, my teeth are pretty average (not overly yellow or crooked). I don't play any texting games (i.e. waiting a certain period of time before responding to someone) even though I find that most people do. And in case anyone asks, this happens on places like Tinder and Bumble.

38,qkqmh9,1635808768,My partner doesn't call me as often as he used to,"I have a partner and we became friends almost immediately, there were some details of our relationship that brought us closer to seeing each other more through the long distance. The main contributing part of our relationship was the time we spent studying together. He gave me the impression he was interested in getting together and often said he had plans after graduation that could see our relationship continuing. I was unsure at the time because I didn't know what the future held and we most likely were going in different directions. Still we maintained contact. Recently he started to reach out more often saying he thought we had a good schedule and saw our relationship as a positive within both of our lives. I agreed. It could have to do with holding each other to some kind of schedule or plan that ended up converting into successful plans, or it could be the fact that we got along very often and maintained enough of a distance that each other moved forward perfectly fine in our endeavors. 

I can't help but notice that he has not called me as often as he used to. I think this could have to do with either of us being at a busy time in our lives with lots of decisions to make. For this reason I haven't asked him about our relationship or where it could possibly go as I know he will get back to me when he feels comfortable and this can happen at any time. 

I wish he gave more information on what he was doing more often. It doesn't seem like there is enough time to cover all the details and we are reaching for a patch of possible outcomes from our relationship, so we have streamlined our topics these past few weeks. Is this a sign our relationship is changing as we are moving into the new year? 

The only concern I have is if this rate continues, is it possible that our conversations will become less frequent or should we make a consious effort to prioritize each other?

Considering the fact that we are Nigerian, and we run in circles with a lot of other Nigerian people, I can’t help but feeling his choices are subconsciously intentful. I am embarrassed to say that it is making me feel insecure about myself and to doubt whether he is even capable of being attracted to me. This doesn’t often happen as I am attractive in the face, slim thick and tend to appeal and get a lot of attention from a very diverse group of men. He continues to tell me how attractive I am to him but his past won’t allow me to believe it, to the point where I cancelled our first date and made up a random excuse for it.

61,qkrr9j,1635812180,Emotional Void in the Relationship,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a couple of months now. It started off in the workplace. She had a crush on me. She asked me out. We went on a few dates and eventually got into a relationship. We're pretty attached now.

While things are decent, I have started noticing an emotional void and wonder whether it's because we're incompatible or I have unrealistic expectations.

To give you a context, it's her first relationship. She just had distant crushes before, Everything, right from our kiss was the first kiss of her life. I've been in serious as well as casual relationships before. Right after we kissed, she said she loves me. I realized it must be due to the excitement of first kiss, and lack of maturity when it comes to relationships. I told her ""we don't know each other pretty well, specially not the bad sides, so we shouldn't rush"".

Anyway, her being extremely open and vulnerable with her feelings made me open up and fall in love eventually. However, these days, the roles seemed to have reversed. I tell her things like ""I miss you"", ""I feel like meeting"". She does it too, but mostly as a response. Never initiated. I flirt with her and still act as if I'm trying to woo her. Whereas, she somewhere indirectly mentioned, ""Now that we're dating, I don't need to do it anymore.""

So she stays at home with sort of conservative parents. Dad is strict. Mom is somewhat chill. We haven't been able to meet in a week since she doesn't go out of home (and her parents somewhat want us to ""keep a balance"" and meet less. Her dad and mom weren't there and we decided to meet. Even then, I had to ask her ""Should we meet"". She never went outrightly and said ""I want to meet you.""

Anyway, when I'm going upstairs to her place, I realize her mom returned. I heard my girlfriend saying ""He asked me to meet so I couldn't say no."" Her mom said something along the lines of ""Why do you have to meet etc"". More things were said (a bit ruder) so I heard it and left immediately. My girlfriend heard my footsteps and came downstairs. 

She called me up. Her mom and I spoke and eventually, things were sorta fine. I was still upset and left pretty early. My girlfriend said she told her mom ""He wants to meet"" to make an excuse. I got a little annoyed that she's making me out to be the bad person. That it's just ""me"" who wants to meet.

Anyway, while going back, we did kiss but I had to initiate it. Somewhere, I hoped she realized her family and even her spoke things to make me upset (I was pretty straightforward on how bad I felt), and thought maybe she'll hug me or do something sweet. Even after I left, I expected something as simple as ""Did you reach home"". Instead, it was just some random texts.

She did eventually say ""she's sorry"" with many crying emojis but it was hours later. Am I wrong in expecting her to put in efforts to cheer me up considering she was the whole reason I got upset. When I told her this, she said ""Ohh I didn't know you had to do these things in a relationship."" I convinced myself maybe it's not bad intentions but just a lack of experience.

She still does things that make me think she has feelings. She talks about me to her friends and family. Constantly keeps looking at my photos and thinks about me, but the actions somehow don't always match the words.

It sucks more because part of me becoming vulnerable was because of how open she was with her feelings. Now it's become that I'm the ""boring serious talk guy"" whereas she's always ""chill"" even if there are legit issues we need to communicate.

Somehow, it has made me start to lose feelings for her. Is there a way to resolve it?  


tl';dr:- First relationship of my girlfriend. She went from being super vulnerable about her feelings to becoming ""lack of expressiveness"" and cites her lack of experience as the reason.

He’s my bestfriend. 

But today- I am truely heartbroken. My boyfriend took his dad for a ride somewhere- and I looked on the bed to see my boyfriends extra cell phone- unlocked and opened. (It was also his dads extra phone, for everyone in emergencies). It was honestly a sign to just go for it. 

I opened Facebook messenger and it was signed into his dads account. So I went through the messages between him and his dad. And it was filled with messages about me. And honestly- my money. 

I stated earlier I was almost homeless- I work my ass off every single day. I work Instacart after my job. 

His dad was telling my boyfriend to “steal from her” - my boyfriend was telling his dad when I was asleep to go do whatever they wanted to do. 

My boyfriend even once asked “do you want me to get $80 for “rent”” - i was completely broken. 

I put my shit together , and took a shower to wait for him to come back. When he came back- i told him I was lied to, and used. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. He needed everything explained out one-by-one and didn’t fess to anything. 

He gave me the stupid “I’ll change - i need you speech” told me he loved me for the first time. Told me the only reason he got this new job was to take us away from it.

But there's still one major issue: I've never approached anyone myself. So what happened? My first girlfriend was the one who started talking to me. Everything that came after this were just some casual things. Friends with benefits or just Sex with some people I met over Tinder or Grindr. Made it really easy and not looking for anything serious. Since my last relationship I didn't feel like wanting anything (it's been 2 years). Nobody seemed to appeal to me, nobody sparked that amount of joy that it made me crush on them. But now this changed. Last weekend an extrovert put me to my limits. 3 parties, 3 evenings. On the third one we went with a gay group to visit a club. Waiting in line a friend was welcoming two guys who would come with us. Unfortunately we didn't make it into the club, because there were too much people. So we went to an apartment of us and spend the evening there. One of the two guys that came later Was... wow. We talked a lot while in the queue. Also a lot of talking the rest of the evening. He initiated a lot of stuff as well. We've got a lot of the same interests (which is kinda rare in my case), same humor... He's well-spoken, intelligent. He's artistic. He has a nice voice. He's really cute, got a great smile. I literally didn't crush on a person this hard in a lot of years. I'm really sitting here and can only think of this cute guy I've only known for a few hours. And I don't know what to do know. We follow each other on Instagram. I know he said he's dating someone, but like only meeting and spending time together, but he doesn't really now if this will lead anywhere. The friend who invited me said that he definitely always tried to be by my side and looked at me. When our group parted between the ones who went to the apartment and the ones who wanted to get some more alcohol he first chose to go to the apartment. When I redecided, he did as well. When my friend and I wanted to go, he suddenly jumped up and said he will come with us. At the end he gave me a long hug. He also made some compliments. Like when I was talking about my ex-gf he asked ""YOU'RE STRAIGHT!?!"" to which I replied ""Nah, I'm bi, no worries"". He answered ""oh god thank you, I was almost disappointed"". When a cat stuck her butt in my direction he said ""I can understand her tho"", or when we talked about both of our Reddit obsession and me stating that I've got a Reddit account for porn he asked if I'm uploading anything and if I would give him my username. I also checked his Instagram and it's the perfect Mix of aesthetic and humor + he seems to have lots of interesting hobbies.

So... How would you approach this? Literally every friend says I should text him. The friend who was with me said that he was definitely interested. But still I'm not sure. If I should do it and even then: HOW!?! I don't wanna make anything awkward and for some reason I'm still unsure if he actually cares (maybe because I'm a really unconfident creature) or if it's just how he is. Maybe I'm tone-deaf to what signals he might have given idk

I was there with a buddy and I was getting hit on by a girl who was obviously much younger than me.

74,qksv2s,1635815681,What is a FWB relationship to you?,"I’m having trouble figuring out what to label this relationship just for my own sanity lol. I (19f) met this guy (21m) on tinder. Usually I would never meet up with anyone from there but he is a special case. We dated traditionally, it wasn’t a hang and bang sort of thing. We went out to movies, hiked, had dinner, etc. it’s all very wholesome and we click really super well. He’s the type of person you’d miss if you never met them. 

He’s in his last year at an extremely rigorous school up north (800 miles away). When we talked about the terms of our relationship, I told him that I wasn’t a fling type of girl and that when he was away at school I wanted to hear from him. He agreed and has kept up his end because we plan to see each other during winter break in December.

We both really do care about each other but I feel like I haven’t been honest enough with him about how I feel. We waited 2 months to have sex because he was my first. He never *ever* pressured me and told me that he couldn’t guarantee me a relationship (he’s in a very hard major, studying for the mcat, and applying to med schools). He never led me on about where the relationship may or may not go, resulting in a bit of a gray area right now. A commitment isn’t really that important to me atm but I want to know that he sees a potential relationship when he graduates and comes home for his gap year. 
 
I know I should just talk to him about it, as I’m flying up Saturday to stay with a family friend for a week so we’re planning to hang out when we have time. I don’t want to lose him but I also don’t want to waste my time if there’s no potential relationship.

77,qkti9p,1635817732,Can someone explain this odd behavior of 26/m? I asked him and he can't. Avoidant?,"Hey friends  


I know I'll get roasted for this but I've been into this guy who I went on a date with back in June. Awesome date, he kissed me at the end. We talked sparingly on insta since. Complimenting eachother and whatnot but he was really muted about it, like he was almost afraid to compliment me. He would send me selfies and I would gas him up, but he wouldn't really do the same for me. I even sent him spicy stuff and he said I ""didn't have to do all that"" ??  


So, I got mixed signals. Breadcrumbing was what he was doing but it seemed super unintentional and like he was just afraid of me almost. I'm a decent looking girl and we have an insane crossover with interests and background. we clicked super well, but after the first date he seemed to fall into depression and honestly going on benders every weekend. he invited me to a show last weekend and when I drove all the way to pick him up, he didn't answer the door even though his roommate's dog was going crazy. It was hard to believe he slept through it all. He didn't text me until I was walking to leave, and I think he saw me walking away and felt safe enough to text as I was leaving. He apologized but I kind of saw it coming.   


He is most likely emotionally unavailable. He would watch all of my stories, and one night early on he wanted to come over and talk all night and not even bang. I lived with my ex (then separated) at the time so it was too awkward to oblige. I stayed in his room the night he bailed on the show. When we hung out he could barely look at me, the avoidance was strong. I never saw anything like it. I felt bad honestly because I felt like I understood it, but he slammed three beers back and went to bed only 3 and a half hours after I arrived, he had just woken up from sleeping 12 hours or so. I was so confused.  


I still am. I am not going to pursue him, but I just wonder if anyone has ever been on his side of things. I just can't comprehend it. I was so supportive, encouraging him, trying to be a good friend. I was honest about what I felt. He would change the subject though. It would be too much for him. I am hoping one day he will work through this dark stuff. He even said ""when I actually try, then you'll really like me"" -- so I think he just doesn't feel good enough, and that's where the avoidance comes from.   


I blocked him and then unblocked him because he wasn't really a bad friend, but I expected a lot out of someone who I never even talked about expectations with, or I really unfairly placed expectations on him when he said previously he was going through a lot. He was extremely intelligent, hermit-y, and had such a widely curated close knit world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkti9p/can_someone_explain_this_odd_behavior_of_26m_i/

then he would call me randomly all the time, and talk about random stuff ((usually himself lmao)), and whenever i would call him, he would never pick up..he would also ask me to hang out like all the time but it was always sudden and i live kinda far so i would decline. he would get really in his feelings about it and say stuff like “nobody ever rejected me like this, why are you doing this??” but i knew it was just for a hook up so .. yeah i played hard to get. 

anyways he eventually gave up .. and we speak sporadically now and i don’t mind bc i just lost interest in dating all together tbh.. but now: he’s the first to watch my story, he responds to my stories and talks to me for like five mins before leaving me on read??? and sometimes he hides his story from me💀 i guess bc he’s with other girls but i’m like??? i don’t care lmao!! do your thing and live your life king🥳😌 ! has anyone experienced this?

84,qktqi0,1635818458,To what extent is looking your ex up on social media (while in a relationship) normal?,"I [24F] started dating my SO [M25] about three months ago. It’s not the smartest thing but I ended up moving in with him after like a month and a half of dating because we both got really attached to each other fast but living together has surprisingly been going well.

My problem is just being concerned that maybe my SO isn’t 100% over his ex. They broke up in August of last year but stayed in contact until May 2021 which is only a couple months before we got together (didn’t know that part until recently). I ended up finding out that he searches his ex up on social media still. I’m almost always home and we are always together yet the few times a week I have to go into the office he apparently was checking up on his ex girlfriends accounts??? I could understand if he only searched her up one time out of curiosity but like it was every week? So when I’m at work missing him and thinking about him he’s thinking of his ex??? 

I found this out a couple weeks ago and we’ve talked about it a lot. I still feel concerned though even with his reassurances. I worry that he’s not over her and I’m just a replacement. I know people look up their exes from time to time even when you’re in a relationship but how normal is this really? When does it become not normal? His psychiatrist suggested deleting all of his social media after this happened to help I guess so he did delete everything but even if he’s not searching anymore does that make it less concerning that my partner *was* thinking about and searching his ex almost everytime I was away from him? I mean we’ve only been dating for 3 months isn’t this supposed to be the honeymoon phase when everything is perfect and great, shouldn’t I be concerned he’s thinking of her that often now at the beginning of our relationship?

TL;DR I’m concerned my partner isn’t over his ex after searching her on social media multiple times in our only 3 month long relationship.

97,qkud0g,1635820419,Would you date someone if their shower was in the living room?,"Would you date someone if their shower was in the living room? 

I live in New York City, and where I'm from, the neighborhood has a lot of tenements. Homes that were given and provided to those coming from immigrants who emigrated to America, settling in the poor towns. Although we've since moved out of that apartment, we've continued to pay rent on it. For a while, we've been subletting the place, but at some point, I'm 27 years ago, and thinking of moving out. 

My mother now lives in a coop, but our childhood apartment and where I grew up, is called a tenement. In the apartment, it's small, the layout is terrible, the rent is cheap, but the only downside is the shower and bathroom are separate. The bathroom is literally a toilet in the closet, with no faucet for washing your hands. It sits behind the kitchen, or right beside it. To wash your hands, you'd have to go cross the living room, where the faucet is located next to the bathroom, or the shower, which is open in the living room. Homes were built this way, many, many years ago, so the plumbing was set so that both the shower water and the faucet would go down the same tubing. It's an outdated and old model for sure.

As mentioned, I'm approaching the age where I should be independent, but I'm not sure if I should live in that apartment. For what it's worth, it is my childhood apartment, and all I've ever known. For the first 25 years of my life, I've showered in the living room, and dealt with my life this way. Now that I've lived with a full bathroom, I'd have to go back to that. And yes, I did brush my teeth in the kitchen sink.

The question is would you rather live with a roommate, in a full bathroom, or alone, but have to deal with a separate bathroom and shower? Also, would a dating partner judge you for that, or care? I'm worried partners might. I'm in New York City, so life is difficult here as it is. And I'm studying to be a teacher, so I'm heavily underpaid relative to most other professions.
