0,ob7wvh,1625091226,How do you compete when there are so many options out there?,"For context let me just say I turn 30 in two months and have never had a girlfriend. I feel as if I’m in the prime of my life and honestly the best version of myself I’ve ever been mentally, physically and emotionally. 

The problem I’ve always faced in the dating world is that no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to meet anyone who wants to give me 5 minutes of their time; in person or on dating apps. 

I work full-time, have a nice car, hit the gym 5 days a week, love to go on spontaneous adventures, hike, do amateur modeling, I cook, do yoga, so on and so forth. But at the end of the day I can’t but feel average, I’m 5’8 and half black. I’m confident and love who I am as a person but again, no one takes any time to get to know me. 

Is it my area? 
Is it me? 
Is it just my luck? 

All I’m looking for is someone cute who wants to do fun things together. Out of 8 billion people on the planet I can’t find a single connection?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob7wvh/how_do_you_compete_when_there_are_so_many_options/

The day we all went out, she talked about what a great guy he is. Needless to say, I was interested. We had a great time and we exchanged numbers. We texted a bit and decided to go out for drinks last Wednesday (in hindsight that might have been my first mistake). We split the bill. When he dropped me off we were talking and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. The sex was ok at best, there was no foreplay for me but he also didn’t finish. It was very weird. He texted me saying he had a great time and I did the same. After that he didn’t say anything and neither did I until Monday. He asked how I was doing and then replied saying he wanted to see me. I didn’t reply until the following morning because that sounds like a booty call. The friend who introduced us knows that I am looking for a serious relationship and she said this guy is too. We even talked about how OLD has been during our date. But after what happened it doesn’t seem to be ? I don’t care to hook up with him again but I don’t know how I should tell him ? Maybe I’m misreading all this together and I don’t want to assume his intentions but I also don’t know how to bring it up.

2,ob7x14,1625091241,"I finally have my first crush in over two years, and whether it works out or not, I am SO excited!","So I was with a guy for four years, living together for the last year and a half of it. We broke up over two years ago and since then, for some reason I have not been even remotely interested in anyone else.


The weird thing is, it’s not that I’m not over him, by any means. I broke up with him, for one- he was very immature and our goals just weren’t aligning; nothing abusive or anything like that. And for two, I probably think about him maybe once a week, if that! And it’s been like this since about the first six months.


I gave myself some time after the breakup to put myself out there. But when I did... I just couldn’t find myself interested in *anyone*. I went on dates with probably 4-5 guys, guys that I know intellectually I SHOULD be attracted to, guys that are totally my type but... nothing. Of course after about the second date, after really giving it the college try I would be honest with them and move on, not wanting to string anyone along.


This even applied to random people on the street. There was no one I found *truly* attractive, who I could even for a second imagine enjoying going out with.


I felt broken. What was wrong with me? I wasn’t torn up about my ex, there was no trauma or anything there... I just couldn’t figure it out. And then, finally... it happened.


This guy was helping out our branch of the company for a few days and I finally felt it- those butterflies, getting flustered talking to him... daydreaming about our lives together haha. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Was I... flirting?? I almost forgot what that felt like... it’s so much fun! This guy objectively may not even be the most amazing to anyone else, but there’s just something about him; I’m totally head over heels!


Sadly and realistically, I’m not sure it will ever work out. He’s done his time with us, and I’m not sure when he’ll be back, if ever. I was hoping he might ask for my number, but he didn’t. And that could be for a plethora of reasons. And you know what? 

That’s completely okay. Because now I finally feel awakened; I feel alive again. And that fact means more to me than a crush itself ever could. And I’m just so *excited* for the future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob7x14/i_finally_have_my_first_crush_in_over_two_years/
3,ob88cq,1625092249,This generation’s stigma with online dating and finding love: Am I doomed?,"I’m a 25F and I just absolutely HATE my generations approach to dating. A lot of people these days (and don’t blame COVID, because this was happening long before) have a tinder, bumble, hinge and sometimes all three! There is this stigma that has been putting doubt in my mind about finding a relationship: the only way or best chance at love/relationship is through online dating. In my opinion it’s a giant cesspool of people ranging from yes wanting true love to “something casual” (wtf even is that, because anything that involves being physical is NOT casual), to hookups. 

Yes, I have friends and know of people who are in healthy relationship (even married) but it’s rare and I myself do not know if I want to put myself through that emotional toll of dealing with online.

Back in our parents generations dating wasn’t centered on all this online crap and you could still find a meaningful connection. I wish it was like that today, but like I said this stigma is really putting serious fear in my mind when it comes to dating.

13,ob8wme,1625094484,BIG confusion please help...,"So. I am (18F) and I am with this guy that is (19M), and I am actually in a big deal. I am just so confused whether I should stay or not with him even if I love him... We've been together for 5 months almost 6 now, and everyday I keep questioning myself about this relationship. 

First, there was one thing that happened.We were 2 months into our relationship, and he kept telling me that he loves me, he would never hurt me, hell never cheat on me etc and he seemed to be serious about that and told it to me every day. Until one day I found on his phone a conversation with his ex. This day he was really  trying to hide his phone from me so I wondered why and we kept arguing for him to give me his phone four about 2hours.... he finally gave it to me while saying please why did you take it etc... so I read conversations and first of all he was complimenting girls in a weird way it was too familiar and it hurted me... then I saw the one with his ex I literally cried. She was saying yeah I miss you and his said that even if she was joking he takes it... and that he wants to see her,  he was talking about his life and all, and he said that she was the one that made him believe in love.... and he said that to me everyday... he said things that he says to me every day... He speaks to so many girls... he said then when he saw me crying that he was sorry and that he loved me but he was laughing a bit...


Then after a bit I moved on and forgave him. And a month ago I found a conversation in his phone once again it was like this: The girl said I love you he said even if it's a joke I'll take it but then the girl said that I am joking were just friends but that hurted me.... And then she sended her a video and he said ""Oh, god gave you so much..."" with a moan at the beginning.
I was disappointed but not surprised. And he talks to others girls and all but some are just his friends. Since that I didn't check his phone again. But he puts heart on the name of girls in his phone too... but he removed them now I think... And he often lies to me too... these days not really but he often does it...

Then now it's just to hard to trust him like I feel he is going to do it again... He is in general really sweet with me so maybe he really loves me and there are signs that show me that. But it's just hard for me, and he is a guy who were in a lot of relationships that didn't last he was like just playing, and he has a group of friends wich is like that who just count the number of girls they went out with etc...

And now were gonna go into a distance relationship that may last 5 years... Even if since a bit everything is going super alright between us, I just dont know what to do, even if love him... like I am gonna move in a another country start a new life etc... and he is going to be miles away from me...

Me (22f) and him (22m) are recent college graduates who met 2 years ago. I always thought he was cute but never figured he felt the same in return because he never showed any signs, at least until recently. Since the beginning of this semester he seemed to make it really clear that he was into me. Whenever we would have parties he would be glued to me all night, no matter what. He seems to get jealous when I meet new guys at bars/hang out with guy friends he doesn’t know (One night while playing pool with random guys at a bar he came up to me and straight up said ‘I don’t like them’). He always seemed to drop whatever he was doing to help me with my homework (even let me borrow his laptop when mine broke during finals week). I always catch him looking at me when Im not paying attention, there was a period of time where he would say I love you way more than I feel a platonic friend would, whenever he gets really drunk he seems to gain a lot more confidence and is all over me, the list goes on. 

My friends are even convinced that he is very in love with me, but sometimes I get mixed signals from him. Sometimes it’s very hard to get him to agree to hang out one on one, and when we do it’s always a little awkward. I even asked one of my friends (who is super close to him) if she knew about his feelings for me and she had no idea what I was talking about.

34,obaf97,1625099786,"The cold truth about why men don't really approach women, the smart/good ones at least.","OK, so this kinda thing is beaten like a dead horse on TikTok but I've yet to find anything that really explains just how bad it can be for men, and that's what your boy here is gonna do for you, most men will already know the struggles but my brothers, feel free to add something if I missed something as for women, get ya popcorn and listen up.

  • Men legitimately cannot approach women anymore 

We can thank society and feminism for this one, among other things, women have beaten us over the head that they don't want us anymore and that they can handle things on their own and that's perfectly ok... but there's a difference between being independent, and just being standoffish, which a lot of women do nowadays. 

Men don't approach women anymore cause of fear. Now I hear: ""what do men have to fear by approaching women"" well, aside from being immediately shut down with ""uhh I have a boyfriend"" there's a good amount of women out there that are just messed up.. accusing men of false rape allegations generally for a really petty reason or cause they are just that oblivious to how terrible of a person they are. Let's not forget that women are way more likely to cheat than men, justify it and try to play victim with it. 

Honestly? Approaching women in this Era is high risk with little to no reward despite how hard the man tries.

   • Women are way more concerned about themselves 

This is really the funniest part about all this, women wanna be a 1960s wife but they don't actually wanna be a 1960s wife, they want their man to treat them like a queen but they shouldn't be expected to pull their own weight in the relationship and treat their man like the king he is. 

If you wanna know just how shallow and self concerned women can be, go onto tinder and other dating apps, you Lotta women have their standards so far up their ass it comes outta their mouth. Are all women like this? Thankfully no, but oh my lord a huge chunk of them are, the more pretty they are the more they are to be what I described, at least in my personal experience.

   • ""where did all the good men go?""

Oh, They are there, always have been... but never seen or heard cause they are busy working on themselves and doing their passions silently. They aren't coming to women cause lot of them don't need you or alot of have gotten sick and tired of being betrayed by you cause it's just never enough for you. They are tired of trying to show you that they are good for you only for you to go to a guy that'll treat you like a used flesh light.

You call a lot of them ""nice guys"" but in reality when push comes to shove I guarantee that he would defend you better than any other pretty boy fuckboy that likely already has another girl lined up but your the one that chose to not take your time with a quality guy, but hey at least we know you'll inevitably pay the price for your choice. We tried, and y'all convinced us that we aren't good enough and we should just stop trying.

   • Conclusion 

Boy.. this was a mouthful.. but I hope I've helped explain why men don't really get out there.. at least the main reasons I can think of. Men, got anything you think I've missed? Let's help our girls understand why things are the way they are.

This guy and I have been hanging out for the past few weeks, from what I can tell, he is definitely into me. He also mentioned that he’s not looking for just a sexual thing and asked me if I’m looking for a relationship. Now, this last time we hung out on Monday, we watched a movie in theatres. He was v cuddly and afterwards he told me he didn’t want to take me home yet so we watched the sunset. He got out of the car and walked me to my house. Usually I kiss him a lot before I leave, but for some reason I got nervous and gave him one peck and said bye. He texted me later saying he just got home. 

I didn’t answer his text bc I didn’t know what to say to that? We have a convo on another platform (tiktok) where he sent me a few videos a few days ago, so that night, I replied to the vids he sent a few days ago instead. He replied right away sent me another of a movie we both like and I replied to it as well.. but he didn’t answer me.

Instead, the next day he took it to snapchat to send me a pic, I replied with a pic back and he said “hey cutie” I started replying a bit later than usual, thinking he was distancing himself. He asked me questions like how’s work, etc over the past few days. 

I asked him on Friday what he’s up to and he said “I was actually going to ask you to go to the beach tomorrow” I told him I was working so I couldn’t, but next week works. I told him I’ll think of something for us to do and mentioned mini golf and he said he was totally up for it and said Tues or Weds. So I agreed Weds works... He asked me on Tuesday what I’m up to, I answered a few hours later at 6 and said I had work but we closed early and asked him about what he did. He responded with what he did, but nothing else. I responded the next day and asked what time he wanted to meet today. He told me he’s so so sorry but he has an assignment dude Friday and asked me to schedule for next week. I replied with no worries, yeah we can” and all he said was “thank youuu”. He knows I have the whole weekend off. So why next week?

39,obaznw,1625101862,What should a man do if he isn't getting dates?,"I read a study from the UK that found 55% of male university students wanted to be sexually active but hadn't had sex even once in university.

This is a struggle I have been dealing with for many years, long before it was so common. 

Most of the advice I have seen seems insanely simplistic now in the context of recognizing 55% of guys are now in the same position.

- Take a shower - I shower twice daily on weekdays - once at bed and a quick rinse before work in morning.
- Groom yourself - I've been plucking my unibrow since I was 15. I use a body hair trimmer. I used to shave constantly pre-COVID, but now I allow myself some stubble.
- Get a haircut - I've paid $15 for a haircut and $60 for a haircut with every style and it never made any difference.
- Work out - I've been working out since I was 15. My BMI is 21 and I keep my body fat down. I presume what people mean is: ""Have top 1% athletic genetics and/or use steroids"" since this has done nothing as well except keep me physically healthy (which is great but not helpful for dating).
- Have female friends - I have several who invite me to events and do nice things for me. This has never got me a date.
- Volunteer - I volunteered for years in my 20s and never got a date from it. There are usually at most 1-2 single women your age there and they are there to volunteer too, not be hit on, though I still tried.
- Go to meetups - I went to a few and they were 90% male dominated and hopeless.
- Go to bars/clubs - I have spent hundreds/thousands of hours in bars/clubs when I was younger mostly getting ignored, told ""I have a boyfriend"" or getting one word replies. If you watch the crowd you will see this is what happens to most other guys too.
- Get an education - I got a graduate degree and I have less dating prospects now than when I was younger since I'm older now meaning there are fewer people available to date.

I have seen more posts lately from guys talking about extreme measures like dating overseas or getting leg lengthening surgeries. One guy said he was getting suicidal because he even tried steroids, got ripped, and still couldn't get a date. It seems like so many guys are struggling no matter what.

I sometimes see people claim ""dating it easy for men"" or ""standards are low for men"" and I will challenge them: Make a profile with a normal 5'8"" Indian guy and tell me if you can set up any dates at all.

At this point, I'm just tired. I imagine a lot of other men are too.

My happiness is higher since I started working 7 days a week at my job. I don't need the money but being busy 24/7 and working with people keeps me away from loneliness or despair, so I may just keep doing that. Perhaps I will just work like this forever until I die.

40,obbe67,1625103344,Should my boyfriend get help,"So my boyfriend and I are into some really kinky stuff. Bondage, roleplay, rape fantasies, knives and guns, punishments, stuff like that. We’ve been together for 2 1/2 years. He recently started talking about how he’s always had really dark fantasies, ever since he was about 12-13. He’s 19 now. He told me how he was always very aroused by rape (which I already knew) but also the thought of actually murdering someone while fucking them turned him on. He would go on gore sites where you can find reallllllllllllly disturbing videos and images of decapitations and stuff (I don’t know if the posts were real or not) and he’d look up rape stuff and find the aftermath pictures extremely arousing. Where the victims are literally mutilated and murdered. He watched a video of a girl slitting her own throat and he got turned on. I looked it up and it’s called erotophonophilia (lust murder) and it’s considered a very dangerous kink that should be seriously managed by a psychologist. He is disgusted by the fact that it turns him on, and he hates himself for it, which is why it took him so long to talk about it with me. The first time he brought it up I was drunk and he made a joke about how slitting my throat while fucking me and continuing to fuck me as I died/was dead turned him on. It disturbs me very deeply and I don’t know what to do about it. He knows it’s wrong. He said he never ever ever do that, he doesn’t want to it’s just a thought. He says (jokingly serious) that if he wanted to he would’ve by now. I just don’t know what to do. I’m into rape fantasies and kidnapping, but real stories and images or videos are absolutely repulsive and I feel anger and empathy in cases of real life sexual assault, they don’t turn me on. Should I talk to a therapist about it or try to get him to go to therapy? I don’t know how to handle this situation. Right now im just talking about it with him and practicing my best possible poker face.

I (F21) went on my first date with a guy (M24). For context purposes, I met him in public, he thought I looked pretty and wanted my number. I know nothing about him other than his social media. I’ve been on very few dates before, but most guys had major red flags that any sort of intimacy was off the table, and I usually left before anything happened. Because of this, I’ve never had a first kiss. I told him that I have “dated casually” but never had a bf, which I realize now is probably bad phrasing. It went pretty well in the beginning, up until when we talked about relationships, he asked me if we could kiss. Me being super shy, said that I never kissed anyone before. He seemed really surprised, but mellowed out after I just told him I never had any intimacy and the guys I met were dicks. Though the date seemed off in the end, and now I’m pretty sure he’s ghosting me. So I guess I’m here to ask, is it normal for guys to wanna kiss on the first date? Was my phrasing that bad?

I (23F) met an amazing guy (27M) that works across the street from me….He’s so sweet, has the cutest tattoos, treated me well and *actually* wants to talk to me constantly. We completely adored each other from the moment we met. We went on our second date this morning and we talked about a lot, but I’m sick to my stomach about some of the things he told me about and I just..can’t process. Some of the stuff he told me was about abuse, neglect, him being a male prostitute, some things that completely shattered my heart for him. I want to hold him and never let go but he doesn’t trust doctors and I don’t think I can be with him for my own mental health (I have pretty bad self harm issues and depression, it would be nearly impossible for me to be a healthy support system). 

I thought he was the one, I thought he was perfect. Now, I just feel like a piece of shit for letting his past dictate the way I feel now. It hurts me so bad hearing that someone I truly care about had horrible things happen to them…it hurts even more knowing that I can’t help.

So there’s this girl that I’ve been chatting with for about 2 months now, and it’s always great fun. I decided that I might as well ask her out and sent her a random meme to keep it casual. Her only responds to it with “them talking about soup was unsettling”. 

I’m not really sure how to follow this up. I’m pretty sure she’s just politely telling me that she’s not interested, since we do get along great. I could just brush it off as a joke and go on like nothing happened. 

I could also double down, but since she brushed me off, I feel like that would be too aggressive. I’m not really sure because I feel like we have a really good thing on, and ending this potential friend over me being too aggressive doesn’t seem ideal.

But I feel interactions over text just give me mixed messages. He’s always had this flirty air with me, a year ago I started becoming sexually attracted to him but he had this like long distance girlfriend so I left it alone. Fast forward they broke up (he didn’t seem to have any chemistry with her when they met in person at all) and a few months ago those feelings resurfaced into more. 

I feel he generally has a flirty personality in general but on the flip side he’s like really shy too so idek. Plus I’m close friends with him and haven’t really seen any signs of fuckboy with him. 

Last week I subtly shoot my shot and offer to see a movie with him, but he had to cancel the night before because he had a film shoot. We’re both film people, it happens, no biggie we were just gonna do it another time. So I hit him up like an hour ago asking if he wants to go again, he hits me back right away with a day and everything and I start to look for showtimes (not available yet for that day I’ll just wait a couple days). 

But then he suddenly is like “Do you wanna see if anyone else in the group wants to come?” (We have a large group chat with friends for certain hangouts). This is where I get a little thrown off because it was always gonna be a one on one thing whether platonic or not. And now he’s like wanting to bring people? 

I shrug it off and say people probably already saw it and won’t be available on a weekday cuz everyone had already established that they work during the week and it’s on a Tuesday. He’s still like insisting that I mention it and whoever can make it makes it. I just didn’t respond cuz I really don’t want to coordinate a simple movie hangout with 13 people, AND I just want to hangout just the two of us like initially planned. He didn’t take to the chat himself or anything he just asked me if I wanted to bring more people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/obdfmk/i_had_a_friend_date_with_a_guy_friend_i_like_but/

-Her voice would get higher pitch when she started talking to me. 
-Laughed a lot when I said something 
-Raved about how smart and funny I am frequently 
-Called me sir a lot
-Would talk a lot really fast about some off topic stuff smiled when I listened. 
-She said she liked when I would make decisions on what projects to do. 
-When giving an analogy in a financial literacy project, she use her, her kids, and I. 
-On the last day of school we were talking on some benches. She said she wished we could sit next to eachother (no bc of Covid) and asked if she could take a picture of me, then started at it for a long moment after.

74,obek40,1625115242,Overthinking everything after going out with someone I've had a crush on for years,"I apologize in advance because this is a long-ass story. I just graduated from college this past May. My freshman year I met this guy, ""J"", who was friends with a boy I was already hooking up with. Things didn’t work out between that guy and me but J and I remained acquaintances. We even got coffee as friends one time and started snap chatting. The snap chatting turned somewhat flirtatious and we ended up kissing on more than one occasion but never anything beyond a dance floor make out. However, I always retained a little crush on him that always on the back burner of my mind.

As time went on, J and I stayed friends, we both had other significant relationships so we didn’t talk very much anymore but would maybe speak to each other on social media every once in a while. J was also older than me so he graduated before me and moved back to his hometown. I found out, upon my graduation that I would be going to grad school in that same town so I set my tinder location to there. Lo and behold I matched with J but I wasn’t sure if it was a “funny seeing you here” or a “here’s our chance to actually confirm that we’re interested in each other” kind of swipe right. I also hadn’t even moved yet so he said “I’ll text you when you move here.” I eventually moved there and about a month passed and I never heard from him. I was still thinking about it- so I did a scary thing and basically asked him to ask me out. I messaged him saying “hey- do you still wanna go out for a coffee” (because I still couldn’t tell if he was interested in me romantically or as friends). He responded, and told me he has a busy week and gets off of work late so it was better for him to hang out late and we could hit a bar. I agreed to the plan and we met up at a bar, actually walked to a few of them, and were genuinely having a good time. But no hand-holding, bodily contact, anything. It was getting late. When the bars were closing he asked me what we should do next, like if we wanted to hang out in the park or in one of our houses. I wasn’t keen to hang out in a park so I said that but also that I couldn’t bring him to my place because my roommate and I share a studio. He invited me over to his and at that point, I figured we were gonna hook up. We get to his place and we’re hanging out, and of course we ended up having sex.

The next day he texted me, saying he had a good time. I was happy he did because I had a great time with him and I’ve always had a little crush on him for all the years that I’ve known him. However- for that same reason, I was mad at myself for having sex with him the first time we went out. I had wanted to for so long to, so I did it- but I can’t kick the patriarchal thought that I “gave it up too easy”.So in my response to J’s text, I said that I had a great time too, but that I hope my actions didn’t change his opinion of me. He said it wasn’t a big deal. It’s now been 4 days since when we went out. Should I expect to hear from him again? And if so, when? Or is the ball equally in my court as it is his? I feel like I asked him to ask me out the first time, essentially. So I don’t wanna ask him for the second date lest I come off really pushy/obsessive.

I am a 25 year old guy who want to know everyones brutal and honest opinion. So I am a virgin but I want to know what sex is like. I never had a girlfriend and only been on one date in my life. I dont think I am a loser with no game, I make friends well a d never had problems talking to women. Many of my friends often go to me for relationship advice because apparently I helped them out many times with advice and how to deal with women. People and even my girlfriends (not actual girlfriends, just friends that happen to be girls) think I date around a lot. All that makes me feel more depressed, because in reality I never felt loved, and never had a women be interested in me. I recently got out of a 1 year hiatus of not pursuing women because I been rejected too many times (probably over 40 or 50) and I began to get very depressed and hurt myself. This past month I tried everything, dating apps, going to bars, social events, etc. And despite multiple girls saying they want to remain friends with me, none want to be in a relationship. So I am now at a point where if I cannot be in a romantic relationship, I might as well get something that I can obtain easy, sex through a prostitute. I dont want people to get confused now thinking that I think meeting women is all for sex, no. I never think about sex really when meeting a women as my goal is to be in a relationship with them, not fwb. But like any human, I have sexual desires, as a 25 year old man, I feel like its not wrong for me to think I should know what sex is like by now so if I have to pay then so be it.

90,obf9vw,1625118288,Help/Support,"Hi there, just joined the group and this is my first post. *THIS POST CONTAINS SENSITIVE MATERIAL

I’m looking for support, advice, recommendations or just simply wondering if anyone has been through anything similar. 

So I was seeing a girl for about 6 weeks. Everything was going well, until I received a call from her 2 weeks ago telling me she was pregnant. 
We talked it over on the phone and in person over the next week, and from here both decided that the pregnancy would be terminated for many legitimately good reasons. 

She had the procedure last week (wouldn’t let me take her. Got a friend to take her) and there were no complications. 

We both took it all a little hard, but her more so for obvious reasons. 
I offered her my support through the whole process and told her no matter what happened I wanted to keep seeing her, which she seemed happy with. 

Then last night I received a text message from her stating ‘Hey Ben I’m sorry I don’t know how else to do this, but I don’t think we should see each other any more. I’m really sorry, I just need to be alone for a while.’ 
To which I responded with a message saying I’m surprised she would do this by text. 
She agreed and decided to call because I said I just wanted to know the truth about why she didn’t want to see me anymore. 

From here she told me over the phone that she couldn’t imagine being with me now after what we’d been through. She wanted to pretend like it never happened, which unfortunately meant not seeing me too. 

I said I felt the opposite way. That we could support each other through a difficult experience. 

I then offered my support if she ever wanted to talk about things and then goodbyes were said. 

I just thought that the only positive coming from a bad experience like this would be that at least you have the other person there to help you, listen to you, support you and be there for you. 
But now I just feel abandoned. 

To be told by her that she can’t imagine being with me after that experience after we had both agreed to it via a text and call with no warning, just after the procedure happened is very hard to take. 

I just though if it were the other way around, and I told her via text a week after the procedure that I couldn’t imagine being with her now and I didn’t want to see her anymore that I would be deemed by society as the worst person in the world. 

Im not saying it’s exactly the same, but it’s a really horrible thing to have happen and I’m struggling to cope a little bit. 

Oh and it’s my birthday in 3 days. So Happy Birthday to me… haha

I’m looking for support, advice, recommendations or just simply wondering if anyone has been through anything similar.

91,obfb5e,1625118449,"confessed to him, got hurt, but got already over it","Soooo, I've finally confessed my love to my fwb/ situationship and we were able to clear some things. 

As I expected it was really one sided, althpugh he said that i mean a lot to him, but no in a romantic way.

He reasoned it with 1. his past relationship, he got cheated on in his last 3 relationships, which led him to an eating disorder, and he told me he's empty - he can't show me any love because there isn't any he could give.

As a second reason he told me because of these failed relationships he decided to find/ look for someone who has the same cultural background, which doesn't garantee a safe relationship and he knows that. But that's what he wants.

It hurt him, he was sorry for not giving me the answer I hoped for. He asked me how he could help me process this, he asked if he should block me on all social media, if he should just stop texting me, if we should stop being fwb and just hang out as friends.

He really wanted to help me, and make all of this easier. 

It hurt, it hurt so much and I was vrying for the whole night. However, it is what it is and you can't force someone's love and i for sure don't want to do that.

I told him now that I have this clarity we can continue. There's no ""what if"" possibility because I know that there won't be any romantic feelings involved.

I'll definitely be open towards new love, and meeting the right person for me while having fun with him. If there's one thing he takes with him from our time together it should be that it's okay to let your guard down. I want him to know that not everyone has bad intentions.


I feel good now, and I'm certain that I will find my soulmate soon🤞🏻Even though I got rejected I feel like I've found closure. To me it's a succes, I know that it won't take long for me to stop loving him in a romantic way.

For everyone who's going through something similar: Even if it hurts, you should always remember that if they were the right person, they would feel the same. Be open for new love, and let it come to you. Don't go out there and look for it yourself because love comes when it's unexpected.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/obfb5e/confessed_to_him_got_hurt_but_got_already_over_it/
92,obfdgx,1625118745,I simply can’t approach,"Ik the same thing “failure is success” but failing is terrible. Mentally if I fail I’m the worse and there wasn’t even a point in trying. So because of that I’m in constant fear and I don’t want to tell friends and family abt it because they will just say “ I never had that problem before” and their right. My parents never had any problems so why do I?

The other Reddit posts aren’t helping either because it’s “ approach girls/us but at the same time don’t because your weird. But if you do call girls/us pretty but don’t because now your objectifying” it’s like it’s a lose lose situation.

93,obfhb4,1625119229,Is there a hack to Bumble 2021?,"Hi everyone,

I have been using Bumble for a little bit and I am getting super frustrated with the way they make it nearly impossible for you to match with the people that like you. I will basically memorize the pixelated pictures but always end up swiping on the people that I think are in the pictures but aren’t or swipe left on accident and unmatch which bring a lot of my matches down. Is there a way to bring matches to the top of the deck or somehow hack Bumble where you’d be able to tell who your matches are?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/obfhb4/is_there_a_hack_to_bumble_2021/
94,obfhp9,1625119273,How to let go and let someone in?,"I'm not certain anymore how so many people seem to do it.  
To let go of the past and let someone in.  
I spent my youth, my boyhood, dreaming of someone to hold and by held by.  
Someone to love and to love me.  


I always dreamed of being able to lie next to someone and tell them everything.  
To look in their eyes and see them looking in mine and know they see me.  
They really see me.  
But that can't happen anymore.  


Because like all the ones I've fell for before.  
I'm just a ghost now.  
And when I needed someone the most, they weren't there.  
Why?  


I was a sweet kid. I was kind and I was perfectly nice.  
So many abusers and cheaters who ended up with the ones I fell for.  
While I was passed over and rejected and left behind.  
And I've never felt someone's warm embrace.  


What was so wrong with me?  
And now I find myself with my instruments playing on solemn nights.  
Showing talents and with modelling as a new professional delight.  
And glares and touches come my way.  


And I just brush them off and let them slip away.  
They come up to me and touch me, unsolicited and try to take something.  
Not noticing, or caring, about how I wear a special ring.  
My promise to one day give someone special, devotion and everything.  


But I don't think there is someone anymore.  
Because she'll never know and she'll never really see the true me.  
She wasn't there when I was a boy, when I was a loser, no one wanted me.  
And she'll never be able to see all I endured.  


She'll have been someone who was wanted and desired and had people.  
While I never was and won't know how to deal with it.  
Won't know how to stop the envy and the jealousy and the resentment.  
Unfair and unreasonable but there nonetheless.  


I won't know how to trust her and how to let her in.  
My only company is myself and I don't know how to change it.  
All I ever wanted was someone who sees me.  
Not everyone seeing my shadow.  


How do others deal with it? What changed?  
The schoolmates I grew up with have grown and matured.  
In the mental place that I was when I was half their age.  
And finding the empathy I had back then when they were kicking me to the dirt.  


And I had no one to care for me but my slowly building rage.  
I don't want it.  
But I don't know how to let go.  
I don't know how to stop the fear and the resentment and the envy.  


I don't know how to let someone in again.  
I don't know how to stop asking the questions of why I was always passed up.  
Why I was always hurt and unnoticed at best and rejected.  
And why I was always left behind, why I didn't deserve someone before.  


I don't know how to respond to someone's question of what they could do to convince me.  
Besides build a time machine and find me as a boy and tell me someone cares.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/obfhp9/how_to_let_go_and_let_someone_in/
95,obfk65,1625119583,Scared to fully commit,After almost a year of splitting up with my ex fiancé I started dating again about five months ago. I’ve been on a couple dates and No one really caught my eye until recently. I went on a trip and I sort of got feelings for a family friend. Ever since the trip we been talking a lot and we obviously have chemistry. We even planned a trip for next month and I know he’s gonna want to make it official but a part of me is just so scared because of my past. Could it be that I’m not ready to fully commit or could it be just plain anxiety and scared of getting heartbroken again? The thought Of me not talking to him every day makes me upset. I know if I don’t give him a chance I would regret it because he’s genuinely a nice guy and we have so much in common and we have fun and I know I could trust them but at the same time it scares me.
