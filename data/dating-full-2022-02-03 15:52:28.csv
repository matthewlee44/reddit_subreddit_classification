It shouldn’t be entirely discounted, either.

With a relatively minimal amount of effort, you have opportunities to meet new people. Think of it somewhat as a an additional means passive income, while your primary job is out in the world.

- First, understand online dating for what it is. Online dating is fickle. Women are inundated with opportunities. Even handsome guys get ghosted. Some women simply want some temporary attention without any intention to really date anyone. 

- Don’t get discouraged. A lot of guys take it personally because they aren’t getting matches, and believe that it’s because they’re inherently unattractive. False. Think of it like a resume. Sometimes there are great candidates, but people don’t know how to play the game and sell themselves.

- The majority of women don’t take online dating seriously, it’s a joke to them. Some hate the fact that they’re even resorting to online dating. You need to take the same approach. Put some effort into your profile, but don’t take it seriously. It is ridiculous and superficial, but can also be fun.

- View online dating simply as a way to have fun, get social practice, and hook up. If something more serious develops, then great. I met my current long term girlfriend on Bumble, but it definitely wasn’t the intention. The more you try for a relationship sometimes the less results you get.

- You also want to give the impression that you’re not taking online dating too seriously either. Don’t give too many long winded answers in your prompts. This gives the impression that you have options with women and aren’t relying solely on online dating to meet people.

- 90% of your issues getting matches are related to your pictures. Here are some common errors:

1. Too many selfies. If all of your photos are selfies, it gives the impression that you are by yourself and aren’t social. It doesn’t give a great idea of what you look like. Avoid selfies, or use sparingly, especially no selfies in the gym, bathroom, or with fish (yes it’s a thing)

2. Pictures are low quality, unclear, at strange angles. Most smart phones nowadays have decent cameras. If your photos look low quality, it’s an automatic red flag for women. You want your pictures to be high resolution, that give a clear view of what your face looks like.

3. Not enough full body pictures. If your pictures only focus on your face, many will believe that you’re hiding something, even if that’s not not your intention. Try to include pictures that show your entire body.

4. Your pictures look too similar, not enough variety. A lot of guys will have pictures at the same angle, with the same facial expression. If you saw a woman with these type of photos, would you be suspicious?

5. You’re not smiling enough or making weird faces. Women want a guy who is fun and positive. A picture with a GENUINE smile goes a long way. Additionally, some guys will have pictures with a funny expression, but it makes them look sinister or creepy. If making a funny face, make sure it makes you look fun, and not like a creep.

- Some quick suggestions:

- Always include a picture with an animal if possible, preferably a dog. Even if it’s not yours, take a picture with a friend’s animal. If you match, be truthful and say you’re considering getting a pet.

- Include a high status pick. If you have a picture dressed up or in a suit, include it

- If you have a picture dressed up, or at a Halloween party, definitely include that. You want to show you have a sense of humor, don’t take yourself seriously, and are social.

- Include one picture with your friends or in a social setting if possible. You want to demonstrate social value.

- Make sure your answer prompts aren’t too serious or contains rants. Be positive, fun, witty.

We have always been very happy and supportive of each-other and I have always been very head over heals for him. 

However just recently my feelings for him seem to have declined somewhat. Sometimes I look at him and love him to pieces and other times ( particularly the last week or so) I look at him and can’t feel anything which is a really scary prospect for me as I really value our relationship and would hate to loose what we have! 

When starting university in September I had developed a very strong anxiety due to the change and going away from home which is now all a lot better but I just recently have seemed to have anxiety over other things. I have questioned my sexuality, even though I know I am straight. I have never been attracted to another female whether that be physically or sexually and I could not imagine ever being with another woman, it just doesn’t appeal to me( although I am not homophobic and am supporting of others who are). It was just this obsession in my head that everyday for weeks kept making me question myself for absolutely not explainable reason, however I am thinking a large amount of this is down to anxiety and potentially intrusive thoughts and a bit of OCD. 

So then as soon as I managed to get rid of that intrusive and worrying thought it then moved onto this whole thing about my boyfriend which totally and utterly terrifies me as I don’t won’t to loose him or what we’ve got, just I seem to feel very numb towards him at the moment. 

Over the past few weeks when I’ve seen him and when we’ve been apart, some times and look him in the eyes and wonder how I got so lucky and other times I worry I don’t love him anymore. 

On the whole all of the distress and worry over the past 6 months is causing me some depression and extreme upset. 

Anyone got any take or advice or experienced this before?

I’ve been on exactly 1 date in my life (bumble meetup during this past summer). To give a little context, I’m introverted. on the autism spectrum. I have a few close and casual friends and have been working on widening my social circle since I started college 2 years ago.

I feel like I’m fairly attractive. I’ve never been insecure about my appearance sans a period in high school where I gained some weight that I have since lost. I do go through periods of being desperate to be seen as good looking (freaking out if I don’t have time to put on a full face of makeup before I leave the house, etc.), largely fueled by the sense that I’m not actually attracting anyone. That’s another frustrating thing - whenever I vent to friends or family about my nonexistent love life they always ask “is there anyone on campus that m you’ve been flirtatious with/seems to like you?” I’ve pretty much never gotten the sense that anyone has been interested in me in my day to day life. It doesn’t help that I’m shy an unlikely to make the first move.

I’ve signed up for several dating apps, but I go to a small college in a remote area so there aren’t a ton of locals to connect with. My family has never been encouraging of online dating apps, and I’m honestly not a fan of it either, but at this point making a natural connection with a guy that eventually becomes romantic seems impossible. For years I’ve gone by the “it’ll happen, don’t rush it” philosophy. It’s not happening.

It’s gotten to the point where it pains me to see my friends and peers in relationships. Seeing it come so easily to other people has become maddening. I’m tearing up just thinking about it all now.

She sent me a message anyway thanking me for the swipe I thanked her for the message and that was that until a few days later I decided to message her again thinking I'd give her a chance and if we did happen hit it off I'd figure out travel later.

We hit it off, we really hit it off she was smart, funny, creative and I was....to shy for her actually. Our phone calls were to awkward for her, the conversation needed to flow well or it became to much effort for her so she called it off. 
She took the time tell me on the phone which I appreciated but it still hurt. 

We said are goodbyes and keept on swiping, I built up my confidence with outhers, hoping to find love but a part of me new we weren't done and I was right we started chatting again, face timed and then planned a date to a museum near her. 

It was great we walked around the museum occasionally stopping for her to rest which gave us a chance to talk, then got some tea and coffee in the cafe. The date lasted about two hours, I made her laugh she made me smile and I felt like we had a real connection. 

After I massage her, 
I really enjoyed today and I'd love to see you again.😍

I'm sure you're resting but maybe we could plan something next chat?

She got back to me the next day,

I believe I have met such guys, and it feels like they are more like a therapist or a friend. I want to know if it is normal to like the kind of guy I like, and if that kind of guy even exists. I want to know if there’s anything wrong with me, if I need to adjust my expectations, or if I’m just not meant to date people, and if I should just give up. I cobbled together the following statements that kinda explain what I’m looking for in a guy. Some of it is verbatim what I saw other people wrote, some of it is adding on to that, and most of it I wrote:

“I really like someone who will push back - will argue with me/challenge me about things, make me think, plays devils advocate, etc. With this guy it seemed like he was always trying too hard to say what he thought I wanted to hear about things. I’d like guys to just say what’s on their mind, even if they think it could be hurtful (reddit comment).” It is weird when they hesitate for so long just to say something that they were so obviously thinking about. It plays up my expectations and curiosity just to let me down with something ordinary that I already knew they were thinking.

I like to feel a little jealous of the guy - as in, I want to see him smiling and talking to other people, and not just fully focusing on me. But if the conversation involves me, I want him to take my side, or maybe take a third viewpoint - in other words, I don’t want him to side with someone else against me.

I like talking with guys, but a lot of the small talk doesn’t lead to great conversation. I don’t like it when the conversation tends towards me kinda venting about insecurities, and the guy saying that I don’t have those traits, like if I say I’d like to lose some weight, but the guy says I look great just how I am.

I like when guys are a little bit mean sometimes, like negging. 

If it gets to a certain point in the relationship, I don’t want the guy to ask before kissing. It gets tedious and kinda ruins the moment for me. I also would probably like surprise kisses (haven’t had any unfortunately) and you can’t do that if you’re asking. If the date is going well, I would want the guy to initiate a kiss (maybe the sort where you both get kinda closer first, like in the movies) without having to ask. Although sometimes a guy asking to kiss can be a turn-on, if we’re like laughing and he just interrupts it by asking ‘Can I kiss you?’ and then that just explodes into a passionate kiss.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156934,public,self,I can't seem to find guys that I like,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sjt7qr/i_cant_seem_to_find_guys_that_i_like/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I’ve never been in a relationship but I guess I developed some insecurities. 

I’d stop seeing them once I realised, we talk and go on dates but never got to a point where I feel comfortable enough to get intimate with them. Eventually I’d block or deleted them or stop responding.

When I’d meet these guys they’d be so sweet and say they want something serious with me. At some point they’d get horrible and somehow end up saying they’re not looking for anything serious.

I’ve never had a positive experience so now, when I’ve met this amazing guy who’s caring, sweet and makes me feel so safe; I feel like I’m pushing him away or trying to put myself off.

He took me out a few times and paid for everything. He got me a cab home and I saw myself saying you don’t have to pay for anything. I think I was testing him. I liked that he paid and wanted to treat me.

2days ago he invited me over. We got intimate and he said he noticed that I make bad comments about myself and pass them off as jokes. He reassured me (even though I didn’t ask and I’m clearly not self aware). 

He put his phone on the side table and didn’t check it all night. He said he likes to be present and wants me to have all of his attention while I’m talking to him or with him. 

I’m exactly the same, I literally put my phone away and on silent so he could have my full focus. I said he could check his phone and that I don’t mind. I have no idea why I said that. Why am I trying to put myself off?

We both check off the boxes for each other, have identical opinions and values, and are each other's first relationship. We're also long distance which of course makes abstaining much easier. Personally, since we both want sex, I don't see much point in doing the whole dating song and dance for a couple years before tying the knot. Would rather just get it done with quickly so we don't risk slipping up in the meantime. So I guess we aren't looking to get married *just* for sex, but it's certainly the main reason. I have heard nothing but bad things from family and friends regarding this approach but I honestly don't see what the big deal is and really think this may be the best option (short of just sleeping together now obviously, but like I said, that's off the table).

I have been though a lot in my 25 years of life. And while I've had some amazing experiances, lived in 3 countries, travelled through most of Europe and I am very lucky in a lot of ways I also have had some pretty big losses, hurts, and devestations over the years. 

I don't talk about any of this outside therapy the only people who know about it currently are my therapist and my mother (mainly because she was there) and because it was her father that abused me- we don't talk about it. 

My parents divorced when I was young, my Dad married my step mother, the woman my mom hired when I was 11. My step mother was 21. We moved to England. Few months after moving my grandmother died. The night before her funeral my grandfather started s×xually abusing me. This lasted for years though thankfully it only happened during visits thanks to living abroad. I was 10 when that started and shortly after that started my mom was diagnosed with cancer. She nearly died, first through chemo stopping her heart, then a suicide attempt that I dealt with because my step father (1st one) went to watch TV while she overdosed. 

I struggled in school I was bullied to the point of being chased off school property with bruises several times.

My mom got better and met my 2nd stepfather. He was really nice. At first. Then he revealed himself to be a narcissist, cheating with not 1, but 3 other women. We tried to leave, but he would follow us. He would manage to convince my mom it would change, rinse, repeat. Evertime we left or moved out he would find us he would stalk me at school, and if it wasn't him he managed to convince his affair partner to follow me and harass my mom at work. 

We finally moved back to the US to stop worrying about it. That's when I met my partner and... He passed away. We were planning on moving in together and talking about starting a family when he died. 

I don't tell people my story. Partially because so many bad things have happened, not only that so many things have happened period and this is the cliffnotes version, I don't think people would believe me. 

I also realize that people don't want to know anything depressing about you. They have their own stuff. So I keep my mouth shut. I am thankfully a strong person who prefers mainly being alone anyways so it's never mattered. 

I've done all the work in therapy I can do and my therapist encourages me to put myself out there but I am scared to, to be honest. 

I want to find someone, but because of my past, I am slow to trust people, and I am also quite slow to open up sexually. I enjoy sex. That's not a problem. I just have to know someone a bit.

I also worry about my personality. I used to get compared to Kat Stratford (10 things I hate about you) a lot and... yeah. I've really worked on trying to be more ""bubbly"". 

I start wondering if it's even worth it to put myself out there in hopes of finding someone who would understand or if I am basically going to be glossing over my past, pretending it didn't happen I order to be happy.

I adore animals and have many pictures that I think are pretty good on my profile with them. I am certainly not picky at all either, my standards are basically whether or not the girl seems nice/understanding, if shes not morbidly obese (chubby is fine), and has a relatively cute face. (also an animal lover/tolerater as well). I would consider myself fairly witty/humourous to be around too. I have a wide variety of hobbies and activities I enjoy, from nerdy to outdoor and active, and I make these known on my profile. No red flags that I recognize on my profile too. I am open to Relationships primarily, but am also open to hookups too. These are stated on my profile.

I have had a decent amount of matches, I think about 20 in total over all the sites I have been on, but they have all come out to nothing. Out of those 20 I have actually talked with 2 extensively. These convos are fun and they seemed to be genuinely interested, but I was ghosted both times before I could actually go on a date. I am not going to lie, I am very lonely. I am 21 and have never been in a relationship before due to crippling social anxiety/low self esteem all throughout high school and the gap year I took before college. Having worked my ass off to seriously get past the majority of these issues, I am honestly a bit frustrated. (also an important thing to note is that I have made sure to not come off as clingy or desperate in the aforementioned convos. )

Some flaws that have are that I probably do not exude confidence very well, but I try to offset this without being an asshole. I am more shy by nature too, so this definetly not help my case. I would also say that I lean towards being the too apologetic type, but I try my best to mitigate this. Obviously theres a lot more, but I feel like these would be the most apparent to a match.

I really dont know what to do. Any advice from those who have found success dating online? Should I shorten my bio? Put a shirtless picture up?

I went to dating sites in the first place because being there under the context of already looking for a partner eliminates doubt.) Perhaps join other sites? Should I ask to meet up sooner rather than later after striking up good conversation? Is Tinder Gold a good investment?

he also was super engaged in convos, was respectful of not ordering foods i can’t eat for personal reasons, and just saying he enjoyed hanging out with me. he also opened up a lot to me and i was also doing it with him. just talking about we want out of relationships and such. 

when we said bye he said that he had a great time and that he’ll be back at campus but he’s always down to talk and such. i also texted him last night bc he wanted song recommendations for his playlist so i said it was great getting to know him and that is still interested in doing so if he is too. and he said he definitely is and that he’s down to chat anytime.

So, I'm dating this guy (we've had 5 dates) and he's always been so vulnerable (it seems). Even though it's been less than a month. We have these intimate talks that he initiates. He's told me things like he made a choice to open up to me, that he likes me a lot, that he feels close to me and much more specific things. 

It's hard to summarize, so I'll just say I feel a connection and he's the most apparently open and vulnerable person I've dated.

Tonight, he told me he was thinking about a date last week when we had an amazing make out session. I asked what moments did he think about. He told me and then asked if I ever thought about it.

I said something like:
 ""I think about how your body felt against mine, when you were kissing me from behind and the way you looked at me.""

His reply: 

"":)""

That's it.

I felt bad. So anxious. It felt like such a dismissive reply, especially when he initiated this disclosure. I was telling him something that made me feel vulnerable.

I sent a reply but deleted it. He got the ""This message has been deleted"" message on Whatsapp.

He went back online but did not say anything. Which is unusual.

Then I sent a new message:

""This is a disappointing reply""

He hasn't read that one or gone back online. He has always said goodnight or something, never abandoned a conversation like this.

 Is this a red flag? If so, what should I do?

So yeah, up until today I wanted to get back with my ex. I believe it could work again as we’d talk next week and I hoped that we’d rebuild a connection


But she messaged me tonight and said “if I’m going to be honest, I think I need more time”

I asked why, she said she needed to move on. I told her I was under the impression she wanted to maybe try again as she said she didn’t want to break up with me

But she said no. She doesn’t want to get back together ever again and that “I’m not repeating myself again”

And this is the part that really opened my eyes. I told her that I would do anything for her and then the next day I suddenly get my heart shattered into 1000 pieces, and then I get treated like a stranger after the breakup. It has destroyed my sense of trust and I feel that the way she’s treated me after the breakup is extremely cold and cruel (which it has been). I also feel she doesn’t care at all about how I currently feel

I told her how much she’s ruined my life and in response she said “yeah well I guess I don’t understand then, sorry”

That right there told me for 7 months, I was deeply in love with a fake version of someone, and the real version has come to the surface 

I then sent her a ton of videos explaining how I feel and with the last message she ever sent me, she was complaining that I sent too many videos (which were me being vulnerable with her)

So that shows me it was all lies, and now I have to move on even if I’m not ready

It was amazing. Things got a little … freaky and he wanted to know about my favorite sexual experience with another guy….we were talking about threesomes.

So, to give some background. My favorite sexual experience was in another country with a guy I rebounded with the night I broke up with my ex. This is all I told him. 

Today, I realized that this probably sounded really bad without context. 

Here is the context:
My relationship with my ex ended horribly. During the last 2 months of our relationship, he ignored me every day, made fun of me, made me feel terrible about myself, and told me he no longer loved me and was only with  me because he felt sorry for me. Those 2 months were devastating for me. I cried every single day and I tried so hard to fix the relationship while he preferred to play video games and ignore me. I thought I deserved to be treated that way until I met the other guy, who was actually interested in me and *wanted* me. 

Once I felt that, I realized I deserved better. I dumped my ex, moved out, and immediately slept with the other guy. Was it the healthiest way to heal? No. Do I regret it? No. It was some of the greatest sex I’ve ever had. Besides the sex with my new flame.

Cheating is not something I would ever ever do. And technically, I didn’t cheat, but I feel that this is somewhat cheating-adjacent and I feel like I need to now explain the whole situation. Normally, this is not something I would do, but I was in so much pain at the time and had already mourned before it was technically over. 

I got fully lost in the moment last night talking about sexual fantasies and I wanted to answer his question honestly. I wish I hadn’t though, now I’m in a little bit of a mess. 

My question is…. Should I give him the full story? Or should I let it go and hope he hasn’t judged me for it?

He was so interesting to converse with and we ended up having dinner and then moved on to dessert. So much taking and laughing. I found him very interesting and easy to talk to/down to earth/chill (I hate pretentious men). I struggle with a lot of anxiety, specifically social anxiety and didn’t think the date was going to go as fire as it did. To be honest, I haven’t been on a date in 1+ years and it’s been hard for me to even keep a freaking conversation going with a dude. Anyway, I have PTSD from my long term toxic relationship of 5 years and don’t really know how to behave with this new dude. Like am I just supposed to be myself and show emotion and that I’m eager to see him/hang again. Or should I act hard to get damn. This is hard. Ok now I feel dumb for even writing this. Idk… is the game still a thing or should I just embrace this experience and show my true self/feelings. I have been known to be very clingy/strong feeling-y.
