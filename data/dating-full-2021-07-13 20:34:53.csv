You've probably ghosted them already. 

We aren't home every night, every week or every month. 

We have tons of resources and expendable income but no one to share any of our achievements with. 

We keep the lights on, we keep supplies moving, without us you'd freeze to death, starve, die of untreated illnesses, etc. 

Texting like this can be a burden. Most people can't be bothered to talk on the phone anymore so there's a lack of connection. We can't be bothered with people like that. 

We've all risked our lives to have the things we have some of us have almost died more than a few times, some of us have seen friends and coworkers die lives ultimately changed by severe injury. 

In a modern dating world it seems nobody understands that these kind of people still exist. 

We don't get to go out, we don't get to just make plans to see each other next week. 

When someone asks me where I live and I try to explain to them that I live everywhere they don't get it. 

I've long forgone a home base because I have nothing to go home to anyway. I have nobody. So I just stay out here and continue to generate an income. 

And what's worse is when I have someone in my life for a little while and I show them what I'm able to do and I offered to teach them and allow them to be part of it so we can more than double our productivity and have something and keep her from having to work at waffle House or IHOP, they'd rather sit at home and hunt for a boyfriend that's home every night even if it means he's jobless or a dead end. 

I've had potential S/O one after the other no that they could come out here with me and travel and see the country, get nice cabins or hotel rooms in our off time or hold down the fort and help me build things up there while I'm gone, and have no interest in any of it. 

I don't know what it is you ladies want, but I've got news for you... There's almost no future in jobs that have you home every night. 

You expect your man to get you that big house, the swimming pool, the big Christmas every year, a new car, brand new appliances and extra spending money? 

This is what it takes. 

That little boyfriend barista you have that works at Starbucks and is still going to college in his late twenties to mid 30s is not going to provide you with any of that. 

That guy you've been seeing off and on the last few months that works in IT probably makes closer to 12 to $15 an hour... 

But I often wonder if this is  a codependent personality type... 

I have various women tell me very often that I'm ""looking in the wrong places"" or I need to be ""content alone before I can be with anybody""

These people have no idea what goes on in this world or what it takes to keep the ball rolling. 

I don't know what places they assume I'm looking in and they have no idea what it's like to be this alone for this long. 

Modern dating leaves no room for sacrifices. Going places I've never been before and making the impossible happen everyday is in my blood. 

That's not what modern dating expectations want. 

It's preferable to struggle in poverty together so at least you guys get to see each other every night and hold hands on the hand-me-down couch you got at the yard sale while you stay stressed with one another and your current situation because neither of you can make the rent. 

The last man on the wall gets no consideration. To be clear I am not even remotely talking about military men. I never was part of that fraternity on government assistance. 

There are tons of us that are everywhere and nowhere everyday. And we stay that way because we have no one to go to. 

I get ghosted a lot and I believe it's partially due to the fact that they can't understand where I'm coming from. No I don't live anywhere in particular, but if it was worth it if there was a connection I could come to you or bring you to me. 

Too many people are brainwashed into the 9 to 5 house with a picket fence or an apartment and home every night all the time. 

And in their mind if they can't have that with you you are less than. 

I know a lot of you are lonely, but until you eat sleep work and enjoy off time completely in seclusion, with no friends or family or acquaintances to share anything with for months and years at a time then you can't understand. 

I don't don't understand how everyone's first go to is ""you're looking in the wrong places""

I don't get that if every place I've tried every avenue I've experimented with I get zero response nine times out of 10 and when I do get a response I get ghosted. I even get ghosted by people I wouldn't settle for. 

I see men like myself often get dropped for obvious red flag no future deadbeats. 

If you still have to rub shoulders with people at work, would you at least see your neighbors as you head home, you've got no clue what it's like to be this forgotten. 

That's what we truly are. My lack of friends and relationships isn't because I'm a nasty or cruel person, it's because people move on and I've been forgotten.

When I made eye contact with the girl she was on the ground picking something up and her face mask was off. She smiled at me and it was one of those teeth displaying smiles. 

Later that day she randomly just sat on the ground and said something about being tired. I wasn't paying too much attention but then she said she needed my help. She wanted me to take her hand and help her get up. She wasn't injured or anything and could have easily gotten up on her own. I took her hand and she kind of stayed on the ground..Kind of like she wanted to make it harder for me to get her up off the ground. This led to me holding her hand a bit longer than usual. 

Another time she was walking past me and she kind of rubbed her hands against me as I was walking by. Then a couple of time when we made eye contact she held her gaze and continued to look me in the eyes.  I am talking longer than a few seconds and I looked down everytime. 

I am sorry if I sound stupid guys but I was hoping these were cues. Girls have flirted with me and asked me out a lot before and told me they liked me.

&gt; Hey, thanks for visiting my profile.  Let me show you around …   
&gt;  
&gt; Ah, here we have my “about me” section:  I have a great sense of humor.  I’ve been told I should be a stand up comedian.  I’m fairly educated.  Intelligent.  A generous lover.  Athletic.  Romantic.  Goofy.  Caring. Honest.  Affectionate.  Hard working.  Creative.  Loyal.  And several other adjectives that are mainly positive.  I enjoy playing sports (volleyball, tennis), kayaking, biking (both mountain and non-mountain types), skiing (on both forms of water), hiking, walking my dogs, photography, motorcycling, and auto racing.  
&gt;   
&gt; If you glance this way, you’ll find my “what I’m looking for in a woman” section:  You like men -- that seems pertinent.  Intelligent with a broad sense of humor (eg:  you found the previous joke funny).  Very affectionate.  Relatively fit.  Honest. Kind.  You love kids and animals.  You’re outgoing but enjoy the occasional lazy day on the couch.  Enjoy cooking together.  You’re very caring, and also possess several other positive traits that I’m unable to think of at this precise moment.  You like physical activities (both sexual and non-sexual).  
&gt;   
&gt; I call this section my “current situation”:  I’m a professional software engineer.  I have two children, ages 14 and 9, that I share 50-50 custody with my ex, swapping every other week.  I also love animals and currently have two dogs.  I’m a semi-responsible homeowner (look, I’ll get to it eventually, I swear).   
&gt;  
&gt; So that’s it.  I hope you enjoyed the tour.  If you feel this is something you enjoyed, please feel free to submit a “Like” to me and I’ll do my best to get back to you asap.

I ""dated"" a guy (27M) for nearly a year. We texted every single day and had a really good bond. We got along well, were compatible in multiple ways, and we both agreed that we would take things slow since we both had gotten out of relationships a few months prior, but were building up to something official once things with the universe calmed down (aka when we could comfortably go out without the fear of catching a potentiallydeadly virus).

 We met up at restaurants when possible or did some sort of other socially distanced activity. We went on day trips together to the beach and the mountains. We also talked on the phone every couple of weeks or so or played games online. I would bring up the topic of DTR and he insisted it would happen once the pandemic was at least over-ish. 

During this time, he claimed his roommate did NOT want people over. Not as suspicious because again, pandemic. But once their weekly game nights were back in person, guess who still claimed his roommate didn't like random people over?

Basically lines were blurred and I think the excuses he gave for me not meeting his friends seemed a lot more valid because we were in a padenmic. I brought the topic up again of DTR, and he said ""what does official even mean anymore"" and claimed that maybe in the future and more time, this would become something. 

Well by that time I saw red and told him if he wanted a friends with benefits situation then he should have said so from the beginning. He claims he never thought it was and didn't know how to describe this. I told him bluntly that if he didn't know by now if he thought I was worth it to have me in his life, then it was over and to not reach out unless he wanted something beyond a convenient way to pass time. As others have said before me, it's tempting to want him back in my life, but realistically, I'm just anticipating the more likely scenario of him just never responding again. 

When we were together he DID make me happy and comfortable. But I know that ultimately doesn't mean shit in regards to long-term potential. What are some things I should strongly consider or look put for if he claims he does want a relationship with me after some time?

We met on Hinge, but he liked me before I moved about a 5 hour drive away. When we matched, we decided to do a FaceTime date anyway and really hit it off, and continued to FaceTime for hours multiple times per week. We’ve shared a lot with each other and gotten really close.

I started to have some doubts that he was maybe a little phony, but it’s really hard to tell over FT. He also reminds me of an ex of mine and I worry that maybe I’m just projecting. My best friend joined a FT with us to say hi and said the same thing upon first impression. I’m still trying to feel that out.

I frequent the city he lives in even though I moved, and I also don’t feel like driving is such a big deal, especially given the time we have dedicated to talking and how I thought we both were feeling, but he’s been really dodgy about meeting up. The first time, he was busy moving and “adjusting” to post covid responsibilities with work and extra curriculars. I told him I felt very weird about him making it so difficult, but we ended up talking it out. Basically, he was hesitant to initiate a long distance relationship.

I took a 2 week vacation and was flying back into his city to meet some friends, so he suggested we meet up. I tried texting him a few times while I was on vacation to give him updates, and he seemed a bit like he was withdrawing. I have an anxious attachment style, so this kind of made me spiral. We’ve discussed extensively being open and honest if anything changes, and I could tell he wasn’t being honest. I tried to confirm our meeting, and he said “after giving it some thought, I don’t think it’s the best idea for us to meet this weekend. It’s not the right time” and made a bunch of excuses for his lack of communication, like that he’s trying to focus on “being present in the lives of the people around him”.

This made me really upset and again given the time we’ve offered to each other, I don’t really understand the issue with meeting up. Catfish is out of the question - we’ve done full body FTs and he frequently posts on Instagram so I know he looks exactly how I think he does. 

In my dating history, I’ve had many long drawn out situationship “breakups” when someone’s feelings changed and I just had a feeling that was coming on, so my knee jerk reaction was to break it off.

My insecurity and anxious attachment style is what brought this on. After the first time when he was weird about making the effort to meet up, I was anxious he would bail, so I asked if he still wanted to. When he started withdrawing communication and not engaging when I reached out for support, my anxious attachment style kicked in. I felt like we have a well established friendship at this point and his behavior was a complete 180.

I think it’s too late to convince him to still meet up this week, but I regret cutting it off completely without communicating what was bothering me and opening up about some other factors in my life that were causing that. We’ve both communicated how much we care about each other, so it really hurt my feelings when he started withdrawing communication and affection. Even as just a friendship, I think this is a relationship I really wanted to foster and continue, but I’m really hurt by his change in communication style and BS excuses about that.

I asked her on Sunday that we could meet Tuesday (today) and she says ""nah"". I told her to lmk when she's free.

Yesterday all she said to me was ""wow"" to which I replied ""wow?"" And was left on read.

I feel like this isn’t enough communication for a relationship to work out. I want more time with him. He works full time and has his kid over sometimes, but even on his days off he will not respond to messages for 12+ hours at a time.

I mentioned to him that I’m feeling neglected and would like more attention from him, but it’s like he doesn’t care and just tells me he’s emotionally drained. I’m not trying to make his life more difficult by just asking for attention, but I feel I deserve at least a bit of undivided attention..

Am I asking too much? Should I just drop it and accept my measly 20 random minutes a day of communication? (Never consecutive, this is 20 minutes total over the course of a day, a message here and a message there)

I invited her to hang out twice and she unfortunately couldn’t and had legit reasons which I understood. Second time she said she’s usually more available fri-sun hinting that she would like to hang out as she’s giving me her free days.

I tried inviting her to a group gathering and she didn’t show up despite saying she would. I ignored her for a few days beftI asked what happand her excuse was she felt she didn’t know anyone there well enough and didn’t know where it was (I gave her the address). She says she’s got a lot to deal with as a single mom, helping a friend with school, helping another friend with a family members death and helping an elderly neighbor (guess I rank below all them). I said it’s fine and she said please don’t take it personally and I said I get it life sucks.

About a week later i tried again and asked if she wanted to watch some Netflix (legit just watch Netflix not ‘watch netflix’ as she mentioned she barely had time to watch a single episode) she said she can’t and is dealing with a neighbor dying at the moment.

At this point I’m starting to even wonder if she’s interested in a damn friendship because that’s all I really want right now.

Being Asian, specifically being an Asian woman with stereotypical Asian features (im small/short, thin, dark hair, dark almond shaped eyes) has definitely affected the way some men perceive me.

I've had my fair share of uncomfortable comments from men, but the ones regarding my race weird me out the most, regardless of whether they were meant to be harmful or they were innocent. I don't think there is anything wrong with racial or physical preferences, I can't control what I'm attracted to and don't expect anyone else to. But whenever I hear a guy tell me he likes Asian girls, there's always a part of me that wonders if its purely because of the way they look (which is fine) or if it's because the stereotypes revolving Asian women (think that one scene in Full Metal Jacket lol)

Then Sunday came around and she haven't read my message yet. She seems to be offline in all social media. She doesn't use social media that much but this time she is just gone.

Starting junior year of college, I started having drunk hookups, but never dating. Senior year, I gained a lot weight due to personal problems and lost confidence. I started grad school right after I finished undergrad, lost all the weight, and became more confident. 

In grad school, I started talking to someone I knew from undergrad who I had a crush on, but then the pandemic happened and we became friends instead. I then finished grad school in late 2020.

Now that the pandemic is somewhat calming down, I'm deciding to put myself out there on dating apps. I matched with someone I found really attractive, but I can't help but be terrified. Every time I text him, I get scared and mute the entire tinder app before I work up the courage to text him again 💀

If I'm this terrified on Tinder, I can only imagine what I'd be like on a date. How do y'all work through these anxieties? What do you even talk about on Tinder? How do you flirt?

Despite all of my attempts to keep things in the ""get-to-know-you"" &amp; slow intro stages of courtship it always becomes intimate within the first 1-5 dates even when I attempt to set expectations and be upfront with my intentions. 

Not against intercourse or affection at all, I just feel like the dating scene has been on fast forward for years. I've lived in big cities like DC, NYC, Orlando over the years so it could just be the culture associated with metropolitan areas that I've been experiencing.

Hello all! I recently got out of a year-long relationship [17F and 18M]. Towards the end he really just didn’t seem to care about me much anymore, and I experienced so much emotional turmoil staying in the relationship. I called it off about three weeks ago, and it was very difficult for me for the first week or so, because it happened right as I was moving out on my own. However, once I got accommodated in my new space and saw my friends more often, I felt much, much better, very quickly. Quite honestly I think I got most of my tears out during the relationship, and didn’t have very many left once it was over. He was my first love, and will always be special to me, but I don’t miss being with him anymore. 

With that being said: I recently went out to dinner with two friends, one of which I had only known through social media. After dinner we all went to my apartment as the weather got bad. We really hit it off, he (from social media) and I, and my other friend ended up leaving early, so we got to spend the evening getting to know each other better. It was almost electric. He was interesting, fun, and extremely respectful. We ended up hanging out several more times, and we really do “click” in a special way. We are both musicians so we have connected through playing together, and we have both met the other’s parents, which went well. We have kissed, and told one another that the feelings are mutual, but have not rushed into putting a label on anything. I really, really like him, and I can definitely envision myself being with him in the future. We have had similar experiences with ex-lovers, and it was strangely comforting to open up to him, and to have him open up to me. 

So, my question is: Is it really so bad to just move on? I know it has not been long since my breakup, and I certainly don’t want to “rebound”, but it seems this incredible person has just fallen into my lap, with no effort on my end. The people around me are at odds about me staying single for longer versus not lingering and just moving on.

TL;DR: got out of a year-long relationship with my first love about three weeks ago, only to find my dream guy shortly after.

I added Tupac because even to this day, in death, he's still the man when it comes to the ladies, when he was alive he  was that guy, and even now he's still considered a fantasy for a ton of women.

I asked my friends just from these names if they were regular guys in their twenties today on dating apps, would they have the same success with women, they said yes, without the fame, money, status and popularity, I told them i don't think so, what do you guys think?

Because my argument is that success and status raises a man's value to women, let's take every woman dating apps that said 6ft and up, and if you're short don't swipe, and put them in a room with the weeknd, they would not have the same attitude.

I have a trauma I’ve worked through from my childhood and even from a few years ago. I also struggle with body dysmorphia. I’ve avoided dating and relationships because of my mental health, and how I look. I tried losing weight in the past and despite having success with it it did nothing for me mentally. I learned that I must work through my trauma and mental health first before fixing how I look. 

This aside I do wish to be in a safe, secure relationship with a partner that accepts all of me and never gets tired of me. I’ve struggled through a lot but I think it would be incredible and grounding to have a partner who cares about me, and for me to have someone to care about in a special way.
