0,pky9qb,1631195689,How common is it to not date in high school or university?,"18m i've never dated before. I'm socially awkward and in recent years i've been slightly overweight and breifly obese so I never bothered even trying as I assume no girl would be interested in me. I saw 3 of my cousins yesterday, 2 of which are a year younger than me and I found out they are all in relationships. Including my almost 300ibs school dropout cousin who is younger than me, he somehow got a normal GF. Also it feels like everyone else my age apart from a few acquintances has been in multiple relationships. Seriously I swear all of a sudden no one is single and i'm noticing there are lots of people that have already been in 2-3 years relationships at 18! 

I had no intention of dating at all in high school and i'm starting uni in few weeks. I wasn't planning on dating there either since I thought it would be best to wait until my mid 20's but now i'm starting to change my mind. I feel left behind and that I missed out on lots of stuff people experienced as a teenager such as having a high school sweetheart. Also I think having 0 dating or sexual experience in my mid 20's would make me undateable so I think I might just date in uni just to get experience even if I don't want to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pky9qb/how_common_is_it_to_not_date_in_high_school_or/
1,pkyf6t,1631196168,Hard time being alone (25f),"Hi guys, it's been years since I last had a LTR. I was forced to move to a small small small town where knowing people my age is almost impossible so here not only I don't have friends but of course also dating is impossible. After one year of loneliness I've tried online dating but only had bad experiences (and moreover the people I find on the apps are usually at least 1h by train far from me, so they don't even want to consider committing due to the distance). I don't know what kind of support I exactly need but I feel a lot frustrated. My therapist told me that it is normal to want love and friends at my age, but when I talk to other people (like my mother, sister or friends on the phone) about the way I am feeling, they always answer me things like ""but you have to learn to be happy by yourself, you don't really need love to be happy, etc."". I've been alone for months so it's not like I cannot do it. And I hate the fact that the same people that tell me these things are the first ones who not only have boyfriends/girlfriends, but when they are single they try everything to get into new relationships, so it seems kind of incoherent advice honestly. Every person I know has a partner and I can't help but feeling alone most of the times...
I'm trying to fill my life with stuff, I'm focusing on my studies, reading, hearing from friends by phone/videocall, etc., but for now I have to endure it, there is no other solution apparently. Due to many circumstances I cannot even consider doing activities like hobbies with other people, so I don't know what to do to feel better. Do you know any tips to feel satisfied with your life?
And do you think it is really possible to be happy without love? I don't think so but really hope I'm wrong",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pkyf6t/hard_time_being_alone_25f/

So in the few dates I been in the past 6 years, I stopped paying for the girls meal, event ticket, etc. in fact, they few times I would offer to pay the women would refuse and insist she pay for herself. All these women were great working women that do not need dependance on a man (which is hot and desirable). I recently went on two dates this week with the same girl. Now this one is different, I would never go for this type of girl but I thought id give it a shot. I am 25 working professional and the girl is 19. She does not go to school or work. The past two dates I paid for everything which only totaled to about $100. The first date I was understanding that she was looking for a job and probably not in the position to pay for her own pricy meal. The second date however, I paid for her tickets to enter a botanical garden because she did not have a bank account to purchase a ticket online. She told me she can pay me back when we see each other but I told her to just spot me with my icecream because we had plans on getting some later that night, and she agreed to it. Well, when the time came, she was not making any indication of pulling money out of her bag. So i ended up paying for it. 

This really turned me off. I dont think I want to go on another date with her because I should not have to pay every time. Is this normal? I know she is not broke despite having no job. I also wont go out with her simply because I need a women who has her stuff together but thats not the point. The point is, do women in 2021 still expect the guy to pay for everything?

8,pkz5r3,1631198547,Dating an older woman,"Hi,

I need help with this amazing girl that I really like.

I'm M 30, had a date with this 36 year old woman. Never dated anyone older and she never anyone younger.

We had a date over 3 hours. Sat with drinks and went for a stroll after. However, she wanted to pay for the drinks which I found a bit... unconfortable. I didn't let her pay.

She was very friendly and interested. She askmed me many questions and told a lot about herself, too. I noticed she talked a bit more than I did, though.

I gave her the opportunity to wrap up the date by asking whether she had to catch the train or be back home but she wanted to stay.

Eventually we headed to the station, I said I had a great time with her and that I want to meet her again, she said she thought we had good conversations and that we 'can plan something'. She then wanted to give me a hug - I hugged her.

I asked her to text me when she got home. She did and wrote:

**I got back home! Ready to go to bed! Thanks so much for a lovely evening! I really had great time! Hope you'll arrive home soon too.**

Then I wrote her I'm happy she enjoyed and that I hope to meet her again and wished her good night.

She then replied by just wishing me good night. Maybe because it was very late at night.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she already said she willng to 'plan something' but she didn't reply by repeating that again on text. This makes me insecure.

That she wanted to pay for the drinks and hug me, make me feel friendzoned. Yet, her text was quite positive.

I'm having trouble finding the right approach now. Should I wait for a day or 2? Or propose the 2nd date very soon? Or wait for her to text me again?

9,pkzd8h,1631199232,How do I make myself accept the fact that I will never find someone who loves me back?,"I am in my late twenties. All I've ever wanted was a boyfriend and a stable friend group of people who actually cared about me. You know, because I never really had a family. At my age it's not going to happen. Everyone's already taken it or paired off. That's just how it is. I also got out of a relationship with a very abusive individual decided to destroy my reputation because they were confused that I was trying to cheat on them. I wasn't, I didn't even know anyone in the area. I'm not the kind of person to cheat anyway. But they decided to ruin my reputation out of spite and now everybody hates me. And because of that I don't think that I'm ever going to have the opportunity to date or have friends again. Everybody left. That relationship also really screwed me up because it turned out the other person was just scamming me basically. I was used financially. And they told me that when we met online that they never liked me.

 I am irreparably screwed up because this person pretended to be my best friend for years in order to get my guard down. Pretended to like everything I like. All the while secretly resenting me because they thought that I was popular. They said I reminded them of the popular artsy kids that used to bully them in high school and tgat was how they came to hate me. I'm not popular by the way, I never was. And then they pretended to fall in love with me, support me, helped her me away from my abusive family....all so they could destroy my reputation, isolate me,use me financially, gaslight me so hard I don't know my ass from a hole in the ground anymore, all throughout the first and insult every aspect of my existence all throughout pretty much the first half of quarantine. 

I have fully isolated myself from everyone since they moved out and I broke it off with them. I have stayed away from Humanity for about 6 months now and I've only just started going outside again. You know,, because before this person destroyed my reputation so bad I couldn't bear to show my face outside. Just hiding away in my apartment.  People ironically say I should try explaining the situation to my old friends,  make new ones, find someone new and stop moping around. And I'd love to. I really would. 

As a matter of fact I made 3 new friends,  one if whom I really like who seems to be attracted to me. Who I also really attracted to. If not romantically at least in a platonic fwb type way which also sounds nice. After all the controlling behavior and paranoia from my ex, if thats what a longterm committed relationship means (constant accusations of cheating, going through my phone, controlling what i do and how I dress, demanding I don't talk to any of my friends) I don't think I can handle something like that even though sometimes I think that if a committed relationship didn't involve controlling behavior like that that it would be nice. But...a FWB type thing where neither of us try to control the other and we both like each other platonically but we also fuck and there's no strings attached so no one tries to control what the other does or who the other talks to? That sounds pretty nice.

 I am not still in love with my ex. I fell out of love with them the moment they started being controlling and guilt tripping and insulting me constantly. But was too scared of them to leave. I'm not attracted to them, but I am bitter at them for the damage they caused to my reputation and the friends I lost from my involvement with them. And I have been away from other people for so long that I no longer feel like I can relate to anyone adequately. Which is not good grounds for any sort of relationship be it platonic or otherwise.

24,pl0pxd,1631203401,Another Dating Success Story," I am a 46F. My boyfriend is 45M. My marriage ended in May 2018 because of his severe chronic alcoholism. Exh moved an hour away shortly after he moved out.

I did not date anyone or do any dating for a year after that because i knew i had nothing to offer. I had to heal. So i stayed single and worked on getting divorced.

After my one year was up in May 2019, i started online dating for the first time in my life. What an eye opener. I'd rate the whole experience about 6/10. The only benefit to OLD is access. I am a busy professional in a rural area. So yeah.

I went on about 10 dates with different people. Of hat 10, i dated one for 6 weeks, another for 3 weeks, and then one for 4 months. One ended up annoying me and was too intense, one wasn't over his ex, and the 4 month one, he simply didn't have the time for a relationship and I ended it because 1) he wouldn't and 2) i didn't care about him because of the lack of time investment.

So a year of online dating was up in May 2020. I reflected and decided that it was more toxic than healthy and adjusted accordingly. I got rid of all my profiles and started using ONLY Zoosk at the suggestion of colleague. It's not free so people have skin in the game, and it skews older. I got far less matches, but the ones i got were decent.

so in May 2020, my only profile was on zoosk. The summer of 2020 i became disillusioned with it all and by September i was ready to delete that one remaining profile and cancel. I was just done with it all and decided that anyone i met, it would be organically IRL.  If that never happened, I was 100% content regardless. The reason was that i created a fake profile to see how people lied about their intentions. And gosh, do people lie about their intentions.  That was the final straw for me. The abyss looked back at me. My Zoosk membership was up at the End of September and i decided i wasn't going to renew.  

During this time, a few people had messaged me. I did not reply because i was DONE with it after looking into the abyss. One night i was in bed on Sept 25 2020, and this voice popped into my head. It said ""You aren't being fair"".

 So i logged back in and looked at the messages 2 men sent me. They were decent messages and they had clearly looked at my profile. I messaged both back. After talking to J for about a week, he took me out to nice restaurant and had a great time.

That was a year ago come October 1,and we have been happily together ever since.

The lesson i learned is that you and them, have to want the SAME thing, at the SAME time and WITH each other. Wow, talk about the star having to align. but that is exactly what has to happen.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl0pxd/another_dating_success_story/

Hello everyone! Tomorrow, me (21m) and a girl I’ve been dating (19f) will be going on our fourth date. Our previous dates were an arcade, bowling, and a movie. So this will be our first romantic date. On our movie date she put her head on my shoulder, so I put my arm around her. And we stayed like that for the last 20ish minutes of the movie. 

After the date we were texting about the “touch barrier”. She said that she is very touchy feely with people she “really likes”, but she’s been hesitant because she didn’t know if I was comfortable with it. She said that she wanted to more of that with me, but “just the little things”. Of course I told her I was and I told her that I appreciated that she asked me first.

We agree to go on a picnic date tomorrow so I’m super excited. We’re gonna get sandwiches and then we’re going to a park with a great view of the city. I’m gonna pick up her favorite cookies also. Does anyone have any tips? I was gonna bring a speaker for music, but I’m not sure what else. I was thinking I could bring drawing tools cause she’s artsy and I like to draw (badly lol) in my free time. I’m also gonna bring my film camera to take photos of our surroundings (I’m a photographer). Anything else? Also, how should I plan on being more touchy feely?

28,pl15m7,1631204738,My friends were skeptical about this guy I was gonna hook up with. Any advice?,"Pls bear with any grammatical errors (english isn’t mt first language) and the long post lol

So here’s the whole story. I met this guy 2 years ago. We chatted and got to hung out twice within those 3 weeks that I’ve known him. He seemed really decent and not push/creepy at all. There was a time he hinted that he wants to sleep with me, but I wasn’t ready so we just kind of mutually faded one another. 

Fast forward to winter of this year, I was looking for a hookup/ fwb. He was the first guy that came to mind to ask because I was really attacted to him. I didn’t wanna go back on the apps anymore since I felt lazy doing so. I don’t have a lot of friends to meet someone through friends. Anyway, I asked him but he turned me down because he said he was in a relationship. But then a week later, he asked me if I was still down to hookup because he’s “single now.” By that time I didn’t think too much about it so I told him “I’m still down.” But then the next day, he apologized, telling me he didn’t wanna do it anymore because he was worried about covid. 

A week ago, he texted to ask me if I was still down to hook up to which I had said yes. We had a plan to meet up tonight- he was supposed to pick me up and do it in his car. I gave my friends all the details about this guy. One of my friends said something along the lines of “he had turned you down a long time ago but when he texted you recently, you immediately said yes?? Why did you do that? He’s gonna think you’re easy. He’s gonna tell his friends about it and they’re gonna make fun of you. I feel like the covid thing was just a bs excuse. And why did he only text you now?” I told my friend that it’s because he was in another state for a few months during the summer. I feel like by the time he got vaccinated (idk when exactly, but it was probably around April-May?), he already had plans for a summer internship and he just recently got back last month that’s why it took him this long to text me. I was also telling my friends that I was the first to turned him down 2 years ago, so I guess we’re even now (?) LOL.

34,pl1koi,1631206061,"Ghosted after a great first date, but I'm OK","I'm a 25 y/o guy, and she is a 23 y/o girl. We matched on Tinder last week and quickly hit it off, so we made plans to go out for lunch together last Saturday. Before our date, she would call me ""handsome"" over text and showed really strong signs of interest before we even met, so I was very excited to meet her. During our lunch date, we were very flirty and playful with each other; she asked to sit next to me instead of across from me, and was very touchy, which I didn't mind at all, as I found her very attractive as well. After lunch I asked if she wanted to come back to my place to watch TV, and she agreed to. When we got into my car, we started making out, and it became very clear that we were both really into each other. We had sex at my place, and afterwards, she spent the entire rest of the day with me. We went grocery shopping and cooked dinner together, and she decided to spend the night. We had long conversations about life while cuddling in bed, and it seemed like we had a great physical and emotional connection as well. She told me that she ""really liked me"" and I told her I liked her as well. 

In the morning, we had sex again, and I offered to cook her breakfast, but she said that she had to leave. I walked her back to the bus stop, and we made out again before she went back home. I got a text from her an hour later saying that she was home safe and wanted to see me again, and I told her I felt the same. On Tuesday, I sent her a message telling her that I really enjoyed hanging out with her and I wanted to know if she was available on Friday. And... no response whatsoever. I also noticed on Tinder that she had unmatched with me. While there are definitely explanations as to why she unmatched with me (she could have deleted her account), the fact that she has failed to respond to me over the course of 2 days and I'm unmatched from her on Tinder tells me that it's highly likely she will not be responding to me anymore. I could be wrong and she might still respond, but I'm not holding my breath for it.

In the past, I might have gotten desperate and started blowing up her phone, but I'm not going to do that. I've tried to reach out once, and the ball is in her court. Whatever her reason for ghosting me is irrelevant; all that matters is moving forward. All I have to do at this point is put my energy towards worthwhile investments; working out, eating right, seeing other girls, and not giving her any more of my attention or time unless I have a VERY compelling reason to. For those who have been ghosted as well, just know that the best thing you can do is to not consider being ghosted a reflection of your own self, but rather a reflection of the person who is ghosting you. Someone who completely disappears on you does not deserve your precious time, and in fact, the ghost will most likely end up fading out or getting faded out by others as well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl1koi/ghosted_after_a_great_first_date_but_im_ok/

41,pl2i6w,1631208836,My friends were skeptical about this guy I was gonna hook up with. Any advice?,"Pls bear with any grammatical errors (english isn’t my first language) and the long post lol

So here’s the whole story. I met this guy 2 years ago. We chatted and got to hung out twice within those 3 weeks that I’ve known him. He seemed really decent and not push/creepy at all. There was a time he hinted that he wants to sleep with me, but I wasn’t ready so we just kind of mutually faded on one another. 

Fast forward to winter of this year, I was looking for a hookup/ fwb. He was the first guy that came to mind to ask because I was really attacted to him. I didn’t wanna go back on the apps anymore since I felt lazy doing so. I don’t have a lot of friends to meet someone through friends. Anyway, I asked him but he turned me down because he said he was in a relationship. But then a week later, he asked me if I was still down to hookup because he’s “single now.” By that time I didn’t think too much about it so I told him “I’m still down.” But then the next day, he apologized, telling me he didn’t wanna do it anymore because he was worried about covid. 

A week ago, he texted to ask me if I was still down to hook up to which I had said yes. We had a plan to meet up tonight- he was supposed to pick me up and do it in his car. I gave my friends all the details about this guy. One of my friends said something along the lines of “he had turned you down a long time ago but when he texted you recently, you immediately said yes?? Why did you do that? He’s gonna think you’re easy. He’s gonna tell his friends about it and they’re gonna make fun of you. I feel like the covid thing was just a bs excuse. And why did he only text you now?” I told my friend that it’s because he was in another state for a few months during the summer. I feel like by the time he got vaccinated (idk when exactly, but it was probably around April-May?), he already had plans for a summer internship and he just recently got back last month that’s why it took him this long to text me. I was also telling my friends that I was the first to turned him down 2 years ago, so I guess we’re even now (?) LOL. They’re also worried about the fact that he turned me down bc he was seeing someone else then suddenly he’s single a week later. “He’s untrustworthy and who knows?

This has been confirmed by multiple people who like to tell me unprovoked as if I’m not already aware lol. It’s not my body by the way, just my face (most people would guess I’m 17 or 18).

I’m interested to hear men’s views on this when it comes to dating. Guys have liked me in the past but on the whole I feel like many of them write me off immediately and don’t even consider me as possibly being an option (even though we’re the same age!) and lean towards my more mature looking peers. It’s a very predictable pattern at this point.

Luckily I don’t measure my worth in relation to male validation so it doesn’t really get me down, it’s just a little frustrating sometimes. So I guess my question is does a ‘baby face’ put you off?

The girl I like (or close enough to love) said that she glows up whenever I talk to her and was so happy talking about me for five minutes straight. I can tell too because she’s finally getting to that stage where we always look at each other when we’re far away. I’m shy, so I look away but smile back. She’s probably the second girl I have felt this strongly for. But as soon as I came to walking distance of her finishing what she had to say, she said she wouldn’t leave her boyfriend. Found out that too, she has a boyfriend. Might call me a fool, but I’ve been so depressed since. I haven’t eaten much because I haven’t been hungry, and all I think about is her.

66,pl49er,1631214218,Should I tell her I'm a virgin?,"So I M(22), am a virgin. I have kissed a few girls before, but never really more than that. I met a girl and we sort of hit it off. I wouldn't say we have an amazing connection, but I find her very attractive, and I can tell she likes me, so I'll gladly see where it goes. We're in class together so we actually see each other almost every weekday, which I think helps and hurts a little. I took her on one date, and I think it went pretty well. Once again, I don't think there's an amazing connection, but it wasn't super awkward either. The date didn't get physical at all, so at the end when I dropped her off, I just went for it. I think she thought I was going in for a hug, but I just kissed her. It wasn't awkward though, and she reciprocated it. We kissed more for a bit, and I will say I felt more chemistry then. She said next time maybe I could come up to her place and ""play mario kart"". I'm not stupid so I knew what she was getting at. 

Anyway, I'm taking her bowling tn, and hopefully if everything goes well, we'll either end up at her place or mine. I'm not sure if she actually wants to go all the way yet or not, but if she does, I'm not sure if I should tell her. I wouldn't lie if she asked, but I also think saying it right before would probably be kind of a turn off. The one thing is that I am kind of anxious about it, because it's been built up for so long. I'm anxious about it for many reasons, one being that I don't want to do bad, or be too quick, etc. I figure the best way to alleviate my nerves may be to just be up front about it, that way she knows why I'm nervous about maybe not so confident, and don't know what I'm doing. I think I appear confident to her, but of course when it comes to something I've never done before I'm not. I figure if she knows, then I've got nothing to hide really. I'm also worried like I may not be able to even get it up if I'm too nervous. These worries make me even more nervous and it's like a vicious cycle lol.

TL;DR - Started dating a girl who pretty clearly wants to get intimate. I'm a virgin and pretty nervous about it. Not sure if I should tell her before hand to alleviate my nerves or not.

68,pl4nuq,1631215453,Looking for people's opinion on a few things bothering me,"Hey Guys. As the  title says, I'm looking for some people's perspective on a few things that are bothering me about my relationship to see if I'm just overthinking things

I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl I really like, when things are great, there great. However I find myself in a situation where she refuses to tell any of her family we're in a relationship (we've been together for 5 months). This really limits our ability to communicate, as I work full time, she studies full time and is always around her family, whether at her house with her parents or going around to her brothers house most evenings. Due to this we can't facetime or talk on the phone in case someone hears us. she claims it's because they will all judge her, but I can't help this feeling that I'm some sort of secret.

The other thing bothering me is that she never defends me to her best friend (the only person who does know I exist), Her best friend 'hates me' because me and my girlfriend once had a chat, very early days, about whether or not she would be better off with someone local, as she really values physically intimacy. This means that whenever she is with her best friend, which is basically all the time she isn't with her family, he best friend is constantly criticising me, we can't talk as her friend takes her phone away from her because 'she doesn't need someone like me who doesn't want to be with her' (which obviously isn't true). She says there's no point defending me because 'she won't listen anyway' which again just feels like an excuse.

In your guys opinion, am I right to be letting these things bother me? or do you think i'm just overthinking everything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl4nuq/looking_for_peoples_opinion_on_a_few_things/

He seemed a bit weird since his responded were mostly short and blunt like ""No."" ""OK."" ""I am OK."" ""Good."" Overall I just assumed that's how he texts or something...

He found out my number since we have a mutual friend and messaged me on WhatsApp. This is how the last few message went:

""Can ask a question?""
Me: Go ahead
""Can we go out on a friendly drink?""
Me: idk I'm pretty busy with work this week
""I am a very nice and normal guy.""
Me: okay 
""I look dangerous but am not.""

I didn't respond to that...anyways he said on multiple occasions before the same sentence""I am a very nice and normal guy"" like who says that???

He gives me bad vibes and when we spoke seems to have no empathy towards anyone, psychopath? Innocent until proven otherwise but still I feel like something is off about him.

70,pl4z54,1631216411,What are the chances that this girl F(23) will say yes if I M(23) ask her out based on these signals she has given,"There’s this girl F(22) that I M(23) hang out with regularly during last semester. It’s been a while now and I’ve been scared to ask her out but I promise next week I will ask her out when I see her when we are both alone. This is my first time ever asking a girl out which is why it’s taken a while to build up my confidence, and she’s also my first crush. This girl has been sending mixed signals and I can’t tell if she’s into me or not so I want to hear you guys opinions on Reddit I know you can’t read minds but reading opinions on reddit helps me calm down as right now I’m so nervous to ask her out. 

Good signals: 

1. Firstly we were in a group watching friends. The theme song comes on and she starts singing it and pointing at me. I’m so confused and then she saids this song has the potential to describe us. I couldn’t even response because I was so in shock plus I didn’t know the lyrics. Went home and I searched the lyrics and the lyrics seem very romantic it’s talking about always being there for each other etc. After reading the lyrics I think she was hinting at romantic future between us. 

2.  I was in a room with the girl I like and 2 other people. I was talking to these two people and the girl was cleaning. I then tell a story about how this girl approached me and complimented my hoodie and asked for my snap. This girl completely stops cleaning and I see her watching me as I’m telling this story and she frowns her face so she’s obviously Interested  in my other interactions with other girls otherwise she would have kept cleaning as for the previous topics she never showed any interest till I brought up another girl. 

3. She also told me we have never been on a date when I asked her a question about the date (day month) which she misunderstood for a Romantic date and she really seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one she didn’t even seem in disgust.

  Some bad signals 

1. We are in a room full of all her girlfriends and I’m sitting by myself chilling on my phone as they are talking about dating guys (not my type of convo obviously 🤣)  and she saids she could never date Mediterranean people and I’m from the Mediterranean she was obviously sneak dissing me. 

2. Then as the conversation continued she saids some crazy stuff like I don’t remember where I spelt last Tuesday but I know it wasn’t in my room sounds like she was implying she had sex. I’ve never in my life seen a girl admit to having sex especially in a group setting normally girls are very lowkey  about there sexual life’s since girls are judged more harshly for having sex etc. I truly believe she was bluffing and trying to get my reaction like how do you even forgot where you sleep in the first place. I even asked her how do you not remember and she give a cheeky smile and said I don’t know. 

3. Then she said she wants a boyfriend that has a black car which is obviously hinting at a specific guy in the collage that she occasionally hangs out with and he drives her. I hang out with this girl way more then this guy does. This guy still scares me because he’s Pakistan and she always looks at Pakistan models on Instagram so she clearly has a preference for Pakistan boys. She also said I bet my Bluetooth is already connected to my future boyfriend car. I don’t know if she’s saying this stuff to see my reaction or she if actually likes that guy with the car. I feel like she might be using this guy name to let me know time is running out and is challenging me to ask her out

71,pl56iu,1631217015,Connecting with girl at school over email- good idea or weird?,"So earlier last week, I met a girl in one of my classes while we were walking there; we struck up a conversation, and afterwards, we walked back and chatted. For context, the walk was long, so we probably got a good 45min or so of chatting that day. From past experience with other girls at school (including the semester so far), we seemed to hit off really well. Of course she could have just been really nice, but it went well enough to where I'd really like to meet her some more. The problem is that in following classes three classes since, I haven't gotten more than a few minutes with her, and no chance to get her number. The first time she was said she was busy, and the second time she disappeared pretty quickly, though she was very pleasant both times.

As additional context, I have a close (male) friend in the class, and apparently they have several classes together (they don't know each other previously, and also the friend has been staying aside when I tried to talk to her). He said she tends to disappear after classes, and from what he's told me, the workload is heavy so I do think she's actually busy and I don't feel like she's just brushing me off.

The question: Would it be weird to send her an email through the school system to try to connect? (connect, not ask out) What I'm thinking is something short like ""Hey XXX, it's YYY from ZZZ class. I enjoyed meeting you last week, and would really like to meet again, maybe to get coffee. And of course, I'd be open to doing any class projects. If you're interested, here's my number. Best, -ZZZ.""

I know someone will ask ""Why don't you wait until the next class?"", I can (and have 3 times...), but my first reason is that I think it will get more weird if I wait too long to move; and secondly, just from past experience, I'd rather roll the dice early and move on rather than let things drag out too long.

A little bit of backstory, I (22M) live next door to this girl (22F) and we’ve been off and on hanging out for the last 6 months. We had a ‘what are we looking for from this’ talk about 2 months into getting to know each other and she expressed interest in seeing other people as that’s the way she’s sorta been living throughout the pandemic. I told her I was looking for a relationship (long term or not) but she seemed hesitant on the idea and I’m wondering if it’s partially due to that I haven’t had any relationships  survive longer than a few months. 

So last night I go to a party she threw for and all of her roommates and close friends that I know seemed to be egging me on to ask her out. The odd thing is some of them mentioned that I should make this happen ‘within the next few days’ as if there’s some sort of timer ticking. 

The thing is there’s a bunch of things about myself I’d like to work on such as gaining weight, trying harder in school, leaning off drug usage. I can’t see myself going through this “together” with her as it’s my own journey. It’s not that I’m not willing to share my life with her, I just know it would be hard to do all these things while also focusing on creating a healthy relationship VS taking each thing one at a time. 

I need advice, should I just send it and ask her out and risk not completing any of my goals before the new year, or should I gamble the chance of missing my opportunity to date someone that has already told me they’re both looking for exclusivity.

86,pl6cme,1631220622,I like my coworker but his actions sometimes make me distant/scared to step further and I dont know what to do,"So I am (23 F) starting to develop feelings for my coworker (27 M) after a year of working together in some past projects. Were in a separate departments so we dont to get to see each other a lot except on breaks these days which gives me time to be focused on my high demanding job. We have been out on lets call them “dates” and carpool rides where we jam music and talk about stuff and its awesome I genuinely think he is a great guy inside out although there are some things that do put me off which makes me confused whether I want to give it shot (aka if I really see myself with him,maybe I am being overly critical but I cant help but think about those things and i wanted to share):

1- I’m an introvert and he is too, were both reserved and very similar in some ways except I feel like I am more outgoing as in I like to take risks and step out of my comfort for growth and more opportunities either career or life wise, meanwhile its very hard for him to to step out and I try to have talks cause he tells me his struggles sometimes and I try to help him by giving him solutions/ideas on how to make things better cause I genuinely care for him but he is sometimes too reserved that it scares me for later on if i ever give it a shot. I feel like he hides so much and sometimes lies to himself to avoid “dealing” with things. Maybe if we ever get together it might be a struggle maybe I am overthinking idk

2- There are times where he is a little innocent for a 27 year old man it feels like he doesn’t seem to understand sexual and adult innuendos which are fun sometimes between my close coworker. Here’s how the scenario went: My female coworker showed me a meme at break time and part of the joke had the word “coochie” and he was there and he legit asked my co worker what is it, I was kind of shocked and also surprised? She looked at me super confused and said to him “I am so done with you” she kept laughing and he kept saying “cmon whats a coochie” loudly and I told him: “listen you need to keep it down, and told you’re too innocent sometimes try to google it” and then he just gasped and said “oh I understand” knowing and seeing him he just didn’t google it and just went with the flow after literally everyone gasping. So I ended explaining to him on private chat.. although general talks about sex have slipped in our convos and I know he understands it but I cant help but worry a little


3- Were both highly sensitive people but for him its extremes sometimes that if he comes to me while working to get my attention  I respond with: “sorry I am just busy I’ll get back to you” I feel like he takes it personally and it shows so he starts acting cold and distant sometimes. 

4- He might be a homophobe and its an issue because I have LGBTQ best friends and I am concerned if he gets to meet them at some point how will he react. Back im June we were taking about how Its amazing to see people coming out and finding their strength etc and his response was “ooh well i dont know what to say but sometimes it disgusts me I dont know what to tell you” and he paused with a semi-straight face and never continued and I just felt annoyed and asked to myself (maybe he is having a bad day or something) still its not an excuse

5- There are days where we used to carpool when I didn’t have my car because he lives a building away from me. So we agree that we will clock early to avoid salary reductions and so I am dressed ready to go on time meanwhile he would take 30 mins and he wouldn’t say anything and his excuse “well sorry I am just not feeling things atm” completely discarding my timing as well. 

So by the end of that month They deducted half of my salary (be reminded that both of us are underpaid and its sad also not cool). I keep telling him that he needs to care about time or he will lose his job and he has no other choice (based on his field and the market in covid these days in where we live) not to mention we were warned by the HR already and my manager noticed my tardiness. I did tell him that they deducted my salary from last month and you should check your message too and replied “I am really sorry I didn’t mean to”

I really dont know if he just is selfish or inconsiderate but I get it there are times its hard to get out of bed but discipline at where we work is important and he should be more considerate and all. Then he just complains well you know this and that happened.. and in my mind: well maybe because you keep coming late and I dont blame your manager for being furious when he wants to work on something quick and you show up 30 mins/1 hour late since you’re his associate. 

Thank you for reading this, I dont know if its enough for me distance myself cause I already feel like I am not as drawn to him cause of his actions and its stressing because I thought I had found my person after a painful 6 years of being heartbroken by someone who got away. Maybe I an expecting too much? Should I give it time? Maybe he is inexperienced too?

TLDR; I caught feelings for my coworker and I know he might feel the same but there are some things that just make me feel drawn away from him and I dont know if its normal or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl6cme/i_like_my_coworker_but_his_actions_sometimes_make/
87,pl6k1s,1631221270,What is her intention? Her mixed signals are confusing me.,"I was at the bus stop yesterday and this cute girl starts a convo with me and asks where I got this drink from. I tell her where. We talked about the drink flavor I had and she asked where I go to school etc. We get on the base bus. I was sitting towards the back. She entered via the front door and walked all the way to sit next to me. We talked for a bit and I asked if she wanted to hang out and I show her where I got the drink and we get some boba etc. She goes ""That would be awesome!"" and gives me her number. We texted for two full days. She is really responsive and sends long messages too. and I just asked if she wanted to go to the boba place this weekend and she hits me with ""that sounds nice, but I just want to make sure this is a hand of friendship, right? I don't get social cues sometimes."" So is she into me or is she just this bad at getting ""social cues""? Or did I ask her out way too early? I have a busy schedule and the only free days are the weekends basically and I didn't wanna miss this weekend. what is going on? should I still go out with her this weekend and figure out what she really is up to?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl6k1s/what_is_her_intention_her_mixed_signals_are/
88,pl6lag,1631221373,I accidently asked a girl out and she said yes,So I asked a girl if she had plans this weekend and actually meant if she had plans. As in I was interested what she was going to do this weekend. She said she was working both nights this weekends but did have time to go out next week. I myself wouldn't have had time this weekend either so this played out perfectly. Nice!,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl6lag/i_accidently_asked_a_girl_out_and_she_said_yes/

91,pl6yam,1631222514,Insight or advice?,"My friend with benefits of 1 year was using my MacBook &amp; “jokingly” said he was going to look at my messages. I took my computer because I value my privacy… and because I have a long distance “flirtationship” with someone else that I didn’t want to be a conversation piece. 
He played off his persistence to get my computer back as curiosity.
After a little back &amp; forth where I was adamant about him not looking, he ended up locked himself in my bathroom with the unlocked computer (apparently the default is to wait 5 minutes after closing 😒).. &amp; read my messages…
Which were… spicy lol
He came out the bathroom acting passive &amp; claims he doesn’t care what else I do and didn’t care to begin with.
He also said that I’d have an issue with him doing the same thing, but he personally doesn’t care &amp; it’s just funny to him.
Lastly, he made a comment about how I would’ve invited my long distance friend to see me if he hadn’t been with me recently.

He said no when I asked if he was upset…. but doesn’t want me touching him &amp; he hasn’t talked to me much even though he’s at my place.
He usually goes home when he’s upset (he’s also an introvert so he loves being at home anyway) but he went to sleep here. Barely touched me when I laid next to him.. which was weird because we usually hold one another at night. He’s pretty distant &amp; passive aggressive.
I don’t understand why he’s acting different. Or why he went through my mac. Or what he wants or expected.
I’ve asked him but it’s all been brushed off or met with silence.

Background:
I’m 25, 2 kids; he’s 27, no kids
He doesn’t want to be official, last time I checked.
He’s told me to find someone else for the things he wasn’t interested in doing before (FaceTime sex, for example)
He spends time around my kids with &amp; without me present.
We spend the night at each other’s houses… sometimes he spends a couple of days over mine.
We have never said I love you.

So…

Anyone have any advice or at least some insight?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl6yam/insight_or_advice/
92,pl70po,1631222732,Crossing a line?,"Ex Bf will not return some items of mine after two weeks. I’m trying to reach out via email, text, call as these things were important to me and my family. Would it be crossing the line to drive to his place to just get them in person? It’s been two weeks, I know he has trouble completing tasks and I really do need these things back. Have I already crossed the line by reaching out multiple times?? I don’t understand why people lack basic respect for people after a breakup.

93,pl76te,1631223256,Is it worth Facetiming?,"Kind of silly but wanted input. 

Been talking to a girl for a couple of months and had an awesome date where she spent two nights. Unfortunately she had to leave until October (this was end of July)

Our conversations died down recently but we still snap everyday. I asked yesterday if she wanted to facetime and she said sure but I get the feeling she wasn't crazy about it. We did facetime for 3 hours last month. That night she said she was tired and let's fight for tomorrow.

If she's not into me I'll get over it but I still really want to play my cards right with her however I don't really want to be that annoying guy who pesters.

Hopefully I can get a girls perspective. Is asking ""are you still up to FT tonight? If not we'll just have more adventures to talk about when we meet next"" weird or is it just easier to not bring it up again?

Silly thing to fret over but I'm still fretting 😅 just really tough hitting it off only to have her leave for two freaking months.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pl76te/is_it_worth_facetiming/
94,pl7dw4,1631223883,First Date Ever…Possibly,"So I (23F) have just started using dating apps and am talking to this guy that seems really cool. We seem to click so I’m very hopeful of this connection at the moment. We’re in the works of setting up a coffee date, but since nothing concrete has been set yet because of scheduling issues, I’m being realistic it may not happen too. The thing is, is that I’ve never gone out with anyone, let alone had my first kiss yet, and I just want to know what I should be prepared for and what to expect? I’m completely fine with taking initiative so being shy isn’t a problem for me. I’m imagining it just being super chill whether it’s with this guy or another, but since I feel very behind with everything, it would be nice to hear any advice or personal experiences. Also, how do I swiftly go pass the questions related to sexual past/experience, without outing myself as a virgin(not waiting for marriage if that matters)? That gets me every time unfortunately. I want to show I’m interested but at the same time make it somewhat obvious I don’t want to jump into anything sexual immediately if things go well.

We’ve had sex a few times and she’s stayed the night and kissed me goodbye etc. We all have our own lives so our text conversations aren’t back and fourth however they’re not dry, which is cool I don’t really care for texting. I asked her on Tuesday if she’d want to get dinner and come watch a movie after. She says I think I’m free I’ll let you know. Cool np. Thursday rolls around and she says, i don’t think I can come out tonight but I’m free next week. Not sure how to respond to this, I don’t think it’s the worst thing ever I mean it’s entirely possible that she is sick especially with everything going around now; but I’m pretty blown and the last thing I wanna do is come off as some sensitive little wuss or an asshole.

Problem is now I have a few guys on my phone and I don’t know what to do. I can’t just ghost everyone because that’s horrible.

This morning I really tried to talk give one of them a chance. We were having a conversation, we were both asking each other questions (generally getting to know each other) and I was answer his but he wouldn’t answer a single one of mine. I know nothing other than general information about him. 

I picked up on this and said “it was really nice talking but I think we’re a bit too different”. He asked what happened and I said “I think you’re a bit too closed off for me, I’m trying to get to know you and I don’t know a single thing about you.” I was met with a voice not full of insults and then 20 texts within the space of 2mins. I’m really not a confrontational person, I was literally shaking lool but I blocked him because that was uncalled for.
