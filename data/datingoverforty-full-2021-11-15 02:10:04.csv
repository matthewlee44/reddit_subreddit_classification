He then invited me to dinner for the first date. We were both nervous and neither of us had dated in about three years or so but toward the end of the evening things started flowing a little and we even hugged and he kissed me on the cheek.

Fast forward to this weekend and he invited me to cook out at his house. We ended up talking for a very long time and I started feeling very attracted to him and I sensed it was mutual. But then saying goodbye by my car it was like we were both paralyzed. I gave him a huge hug and then suddenly felt so shy and mortifyingly told him I felt shy and he said he did too but he was trying to kiss me. So we exchanged a few pretty nice kisses and then o felt tongue toes even firth so said goodbye and got into my car.

Here’s the thing, I’m nervous that he might have interpreted my shyness as not liking him or pushing him away. I did text him o enjoyed the evening when I got home and he agreed. We had previously said that we would get together next weekend and I even left a couple of items in his fridge (he suggested) assuming that will happen. We had also discussed not really using texting a lot to catch up but to use phone calls.

The problem is I haven’t heard anything from him all day and normally I’d think this is fine and under our understanding but now I’m worried that he might think I’m no longer interested. Should I just wait it out and assume he’ll text or call me at some point this week or reach out to make clear me freaking out over kissing was more about liking him than not",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,61683,public,self,When you really mess up the end of the date loss because you feel shy and not you wonder if he thinks you don’t like him,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qu5unx/when_you_really_mess_up_the_end_of_the_date_loss/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ideally, you should be around my age or older than me, say 35 to 60, and in the US and Europe. I'm not totally against the idea of a long distance relationship, so if you're somewhere else in the world and you think we'd make a good match then feel free to send me a message. The most important thing is whether we click, and for that there is only one way to find out! If you do send me a message, I'd appreciate it, but if you'd prefer to chat first, that's fine.

But it can be hard sometimes. My partner and I were pulled apart by life circumstances a few years ago, but managed to reconnect recently. It is a healthy, loving relationship, and she really is incredible. But I can't help but find myself scared that the same circumstances that pulled us apart a few years ago might happen again. The chance of it happening is real, and I'd say they're moderate.  I love her and have no intention of leaving. I never stopped loving her even after the first time we had to say goodbye.

So my question for you kind strangers is how you have coped with knowing you could end up heartbroken, but doing it anyway. What did you tell yourself so that the fear of what might happen tomorrow doesn't extinguish the joy of today? Or for those who knew that a loss was coming (someone moving away, or a health issue, for example), how did you wrap your mind around it in the healthiest way you could?

The first was the pleasant first date I had on Thursday texted me Sunday to say she had went out on a second date with someone else over the weekend and wanted to pursue him over me. It was a bit of a gut punch. Taken alone, it’s whatever; but my overall lack of success in dating has taken a toll on me. The second thing was someone asked to give some relationship advice. I told her I couldn’t even remember what it was like to be in a relationship- I thought about it, it’s be 10 years since I’ve been in an actual relationship.

It’s basically to the point I hate dating. It’s to the point it’s unhealthy for me.

I tried dropping a hint to him last time and he didnt get it/ wasn’t interested and at the same time my friends in the same class tell me he seems to be only talking and being friendly to me. We dance Bachata and touch each other pretty much everywhere and constantly, analyzing body language doesn’t work in this situation.

Is there any way to get into his head without embarrassing myself and avoid awkward moments in classes starting 2022?

Will spare the details for this post, but my ex 38F was emotionally abusive, and i had coped with it for years. When I look back, I realize how much true affection and intimacy were really missing. It had also been an enormous struggle in the sex department, for obvious reasons. Someone belittles you, makes you feel like shit, you don’t exactly want to hop in the sack with them. Or at least I don’t!

I spent four interim months in a limbo where, I guess, I never interacted with available women at all. Just married friends, family, and coworkers. This last Saturday I ended up out with a family member and met a friend of hers who I know is single, around my age, and whom I’ve interacted with a bit already over text. I felt the whoosh, the vibe, whatever you want to call it, and I’ve been thinking about her for days. Then lo and behold she texts me and I feel this rush of excitement, and then the usual “what do I say? Be cool, be cool,” like a nervous 10th grader. Haven’t felt this way in a long time.

But I wonder about this. Is it common for the newly liberated to fall on their knees before the first available, attractive person they come across? I guess the way to test this is to get in front of others. I worry that I could start down this road but it’s not this person, but what she represents: freedom, possibility, something new. Curious about other peoples experiences.

He has messaged me at least twice every day since. That seems like overkill. Because of my schedule we haven’t been able to meet yet, but we have plans to meet for drinks on Friday. 

Some red flags are:
Texting me on a day that I had already declined to meet up, asking me to meet up that evening. 
Asking for another photo after I said no. 
Lots of love emojis etc. 
I asked him recall a time he regrets because he was to blame, and he said he gets angry and yells like his father. When I said that is not a regret, his follow up answer was similar to the regret I shared with him. 
I told him I meal prep, and he did not say he did too, but two days later he sent a picture of prepped meals. 

I haven’t even met this guy or spoken with him yet and I feel uneasy. He hasn’t *done* anything wrong per se, and I should add that my last LTR was with a narcissist who had an entire FAMILY hidden in the wings! I was foolish and lied to myself when I had suspicions because I didn’t know such people existed and the truth would hurt. I also hoped the relationship would go back to the way it was—and this feels sort of like that. I’ve been healing and not dating (no romantic relationships, only sexual relationships) for two years. 

I’m doubting myself, wondering if my past experience is impacting my perception. I’m thinking I shouldn’t respond to him today and see how he reacts, but I don’t want to get into games.

I felt comfortable with him and after weeks of talking I invited him to my place (don’t judge). Felt very safe with him. 

In my opinion we had a great evening, laughed, held hands and I felt a connection. End of the night he asked for a kiss and I kissed him. 

We said we should do it again. He Text me the following day and asked how I was and mentioned again about doing it again.

Now I have been ghosted. Haven’t heard from him since and I did reach out once just telling him I hope all is well.  

I get it I guess. He obviously felt different, but it hurts cause:

1) we vibed so well
2) he held my hand and asked to kiss me
3) I have since moved back to the dating apps and have been talking with some men but they are just soooo boring.

But when he did, he was overly critical, pointed out my flaws, never complimented me, etc.

Today he got mad he couldn’t speak to me on his way home from work while I was getting ready for work with my daughter. We decided we weren’t compatible. I told him I felt towards him. It was the end.

I am embarrassed to say, I was holding on because I always enter the holiday season single and it is depressing. It was nice to have someone . But I realized I was unhappy more than I was happy. And we were in the early phases and I shouldn’t be unhappy or hurt

It wasn’t a formal consultation— she’s a friend of an acquaintance — but she does do well enough professionally so I was listening carefully. 

I told her about my latest disappointment that I thought had potential early on — a guy I’ve been meeting with for coffee over ~ 3 months with friendly texting in-between. Great chemistry, but didn’t progress beyond that. When I completely sat back to let him drive momentum of he’s interested, didn’t hear from him (well, until last night with a benign “Hi. How are you?”   But it’s clear to me now we’re just friends).

Her verdict: I was “too available.”  Any time he checked in to see if I can get away for a coffee break, I would be up for finding a time that works that day or the next. It seemed like a casual no-pressure way to keep the connection going while feeling each other out. She says it killed his interest because any time he suggested a coffee break, I was too easy. So now I’m just confused. 
I did get feedback on Reddit and it was somewhat polarized between: 1) if a man is interested, it’s obvious. As in, he’d be trying to see me more or will want to talk to you over the phone vs. the brief friendly texting. …and 2) “you need to make the first move…, call him, ask him out to dinner” 
I just can’t ask a guy out. In that way, I’m an old fashioned lady, so I embraced #1 and decided if he’s interested I’ll know.

I need to ask your opinion.
I’ve heard 2 schools of thought, and I can see it both ways. I’m referring to ghosting v. being direct with tact.
I’ve heard people say that a response is not obligatory if there is no interest . I’ve also heard that providing a response is a responsible adult-like way to handle these kinds of situations. 
Having experienced both, I prefer to be informed. 
With that being said, I figured I’d offer the same courtesy. But HOLY MOLY!!!! It has seriously backfired. Instead of no response or a response of “thank you, and good luck to you,” I’ve been getting a string of texts of how men and women generally don’t have anything in common, there is an increase in lack of sex by women, and women just aren’t motivated. WTF?!!! I’m starting to think that ghosting may be the way to go.

I'm an introverted homebody, so meeting people locally is a real challenge. Coupled with the fact it seems I live in an area where people couple up and stay coupled. So there just aren't many singles available at all.

When I've sought advice in the past, the general advice is ""get out and meet people, go to bars, do hobbies, get active, socialize, etc"". But do these people truly understand what it means to be an introvert? Or homebody?

To be clear, I'm not a prisoner in my home due to circumstances or debilitating social anxiety. I'm able to function in day to day life and hold my own when needed, but the true reality is I'm still an introverted homebody at heart. It's just who I am. I like working around my house, yard, and garden. And evenings and weekends are spent relaxing and reading or doing inside activities.

I routinely get the impression that being an introverted homebody precludes me from being in a relationship and I essentially need to become someone else to find a partner, but this simply can't be true. This is especially evident online where you're being superficially judged on a few pics and some writing and I simply don't show well in that way.

Does anyone have insight into dating for introverts?
How do you meet people?
