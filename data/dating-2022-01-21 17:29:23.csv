3,s9ofoh,1642808500,Piece of love advice ‚ô•Ô∏è,"As clich√© as it may sound.. but life is short. Take chances, show them how you really feel about them. Because trust me, the last thing you want in life is to regret not being able to do something (that they love) for your special someone, or even your family (of course it‚Äôs different when it comes to relatives who showed no mercy nor respect, you can forgive them, but you shouldn‚Äôt feel forced to forget all about it).

Every single day might be someone else‚Äôs last. To be frank, I lost someone who‚Äôs very dear to me, but I‚Äôm proud that I can say that we have no regrets because there was never a single day that passed that we did not show how much our love for each other was. But don‚Äôt worry guys! I‚Äôve already accepted what has happened ü§ç I believe God has sent me that guy to make me who I am now, so I‚Äôll be able to love whole heartedly, to become stronger and be a much better person than I was yesterday. In fact, I never thought this day would come ‚Äî rekindling a relationship from my past ‚Äî and he was worth the wait ü•∞

Turn their bad days to good days, by making them laugh, or maybe by making them forget about it even for a little while, it‚Äôll make a difference you know? Maybe your ‚Äúi love you‚Äôs‚Äù mean the world to them even if you think that those are just expressive words. Hear them out, stories of their day, what makes them happy and enthusiastic. Don‚Äôt let it fade away. Or comfort them when everything seems to be falling apart. Those simple acts might be what they needed to feel, and you just saved them!

I know things could be tough at times.. but you are always bigger than any of these circumstances. And if you want to make the relationship last, search for ways to keep his/her genuine love for you. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to lose someone who‚Äôs willing to take risks for you!

4,s9ofrk,1642808507,Need help with offline dating!,"Hello everyone!

Online dating made me miserable. Just check my post history for proof... It really bringed me down.

Now I try to improve myself. I started a diet, planing on doing exercises, but I have no idea, where to meet women offline. 

I don't drink, and generally feel bad about bars, and my interests (motorsport, history, science) makes it hard to find any social gathering of similiar minded people. I'm a Phd student, so I ""meet"" tons of girls with similiar age (20-24), but I find it awkward to just ask out random girls. I think most of them would find it intruding.

I basically don't have any social circle. I can talk to people alright, but I can't connect with anyone deeply. Nobody seems to share my interests, or ideas about life. I haven't experienced a really good talk for a long time. So meeting through friends is also not an option. ( I know lots of you will think that, I should have true friends first, before a girlfriend. Maybe you are right, but in this post I would like to ask for help about dating.)

It seems like online dating reamained the only possibility, but that is clearly a dead end with my current looks. (2 years on several sites, with several pictures, and detailed bio, achieving 1 match, and lots of rejection, ghosting, and zero effort conversations)

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9ofrk/need_help_with_offline_dating/

i have plenty of other things going on: university, music, friendships, reading, etc but all i really want is a relationship. the strangest thing is that me and my best friend have an exceptionally close friendship, one with an intimacy that few relationships could match, and it just isn't enough. it's ridiculous because this friendship offers me the intimacy and vulnerability that a relationship would offer, just without romantic feelings. i feel ungrateful for not recognising and adoring this friendship enough to not want a relationship, if that makes any sense. i desperately wish that it was enough for me. 

everyone always says to focus on yourself and channel your energy into your passions but what about the daydreams that lull me to sleep every night of that dream relationship or waking up in the morning and imagining my perfect person laying there next to me? i can channel my energy when i'm consciously aware that i need to rid of this neediness, but how can i rid of it completely? i'm sick of feeling jealous of everyone around me and i'm sick of watching couples on the street and saying ""that'll be me one day"". i just want to be able to enjoy the life i already have. i cannot enjoy anything because i need a relationship so much. every beautiful moment is taunted by the thought of what a partner would be doing in that moment, how they'd react. i want to enjoy my life.

E.g. I am going to have a date in park tomorrow. We plan to just walk around.

So, I was thinking about giving her flowers. But if I give her flowers at the beginning of our meeting, then she will be forced to drag them around. Which is not convenient I think.

Otherwise, the option is to buy flowers at the end of a date. But this way I am forced to manage all the hustle related to picking a bouquet, taking into consideration her preferences and the amount of money I am willing to spend.

So, I can not understand what is a correct way to give flowers at a date. Previously I would buy flowers beforehand, bring them home and whenever we would come over to my place I would give them to her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9p3n9/when_should_i_give_her_flowers/
9,s9p3t7,1642810335,I (19M) went on a second date and she (20F) told me that she needs time to think things over. Am I screwed?,"So I met an absolutely fantastic girl for a second date. We've known each other for about three months, and I asked her out a few weeks ago. The first date was coffee, and it lasted for about three hours. We talked a lot about our families, our personal interests, and she seemed interested in me. I told a lot of jokes and she laughed a lot. I walked her to her car and we hugged. 

We had a second date today, and it was good as well. It was a simple lunch date at a medium-priced restaurant. It was a similar situation. We talked a lot about families, personal interests, and more. It was great. She laughed a ton, and I felt much more comfortable. When it came time to pay, she heavily insisted on paying. I offered three times and asked if I could pay half. She made a quip about being a working woman and paid for the meal. She said that I paid last time, so it was fair. Afterward, I said the following words:

""I've been asking you on dates because I'm romantically interested in you. I would really like to continue going on dates with you. However, if you are not interested, I do not want to keep putting you in uncomfortable situations. If you're not interested, I would be disappointed, but I want you to be happy above all. I think you're a great person and have a lot of amazing personality traits that would mesh well with mine. Too many girls my age are focused on drinking, partying, and don't look forward or take life seriously. One of the things that initially attracted me to you was that you were mature, have a great head on your shoulders, and are future-oriented."" 

After I said that, she thanked me for being forward and said that all other relationships that she's had in the past were with people that she knew very well. She said that she didn't know me that well, and she wasn't sure yet. She said that she only gets into relationships with people that she can see long-term. She said that she needed to think things over and that she would let me know in a few days. She seemed grateful that we had the conversation and thanked me again. Then she said that she really enjoys spending time with me. 

Afterward, I walked her to her apartment and I hugged her again--a bit firmer this time, and she put her head on my shoulder. Then, before she went in, she thanked me for the nice things I said about her and said that she would text me in a few days.

I don't really have a big social group and I live on my own, so meeting people naturally has been really difficult. So I thought online dating would be the answer.

I've had my girl-friends check my profile and they've helped me out a bit, but have essentially said ""this is a great profile"". I'm a pretty average-looking guy I suppose, albeit lacking some confidence after the past year, but every time I match and strike up a conversation with someone there's a bit of back and forthing and then just nothing? Part of me wants to try and strike up a chat again, but equally I don't want to be that awful guy harassing an empty chat with someone.

As I would with anyone, I make an effort to be polite, engaging, light-hearted, and just myself really; I'm a pretty chilled guy, and genuinely want to get to meet and know someone, but I don't understand what I'm doing wrong- if at all? Is this a normal thing for dating online? I've never have problems with socialising IRL, but online I feel like some socially inept weirdo, and really, it's killing my self esteem.

34,s9sp6a,1642821289,I (33f) feel completely broken and don't know how start again,"Hello everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years I met a man that I thought was kind and understanding. We were never in an official relationship but we were dating. After 3 months he had to move away but we kept in contact. He would often fake a future to keep me on the hook and would call me up a lot when he was drunk to say that he missed me, etc. I am a very shy, and lonely person so even though this is nothing special, to me it felt like someone cared about me. I was excited every time he would text or call. I told him on two separate occasions my feelings for him, so there was no uncertainty how I felt about him. For some stupid reason I thought if I just did x we could make it work. If I just worked harder to save maybe I could visit him, if I just worked out harder I'd look prettier and he'd want me (I actually lost 60 pounds since he left), if I just was always complacent and didn't speak my mind he would see me as easy going and want me. I helped him with his grad school work, whenever he was on covid quarantine and bored I kept in constant communication and checked in on him to make sure his mental health was okay. A week ago he called me drunk telling me how much he missed me. Two days later he told me that he had good news and there was a girl who liked him. Today on his social media he posted a picture of himself and the new girl (she looks very beautiful. Much more beautiful than me and thinner as well. She looks like a sweet person)saying that he wasn't looking for love, and didn't want anything but then he met this girl and now he wants everything. I feel stupid for being heartbroken. We were never in a real relationship and I was an idiot that entire time. I had contracted an std from him as well (herpes, so I know I'm disgusting and won't be able to find anyone else) and I feel really dejected. My birthday is on Sunday and I feel like I will turn 33 being an absolute fucking loser. I don't even know where to begin, I feel completely broken.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9sp6a/i_33f_feel_completely_broken_and_dont_know_how/

Conversation flowed easily over text as well as in person, with the exception of a few stalls but we both were up front with struggles with anxiety and being nervous, but we found ourselves back on track and talking after like 15 seconds nothing too major. We talked for 3 hours until the restaurant closed, I‚Äôm confident it went well. He sent a text telling me how great the night was and that I seem like a genuine person and he likes that about me. I responded I had a great time to, I think he has a great personality / interesting to talk to and I hope to hang out again sometime soon. This is what confuses me: after I sent that text he loved my message, like on the iPhone when you hold down the message you can react to it lol, I was confused why he didn‚Äôt send another message setting up a second date? Or just to say something? I haven‚Äôt been on many first dates, but what comes next? Should I wait for him to get back to me? Should I wait awhile then reach out?

Last year I was stationed on one side of the country and met a great girl, made her my gf, and things had been very good! But LDR is tough. We took some breaks and both have issues with the loneliness and things have faded a bit unfortunately but we‚Äôve decided to make it work until I can move back in the summer.

6 months after meeting I‚Äôm sent to training on the other coast. It‚Äôs only a year so not worth blowing everything up. First day, I get partnered with a beautiful girl also in an LDR (bf deployed overseas). At first it was nice having an ally who got it. But now we‚Äôre inseparable. Texting constantly, joking all day, all smiles, great chemistry. 

Chances are we‚Äôll be sent to different parts of the globe. But I‚Äôve always had an issue swallowing my tongue. But honestly, what do I have to gain by acknowledging what we obviously feel? I feel like I‚Äôm part of a soap opera/ reality show man. Could hardly keep a girl around in HS and college and now I have the worst Sophie‚Äôs choice. Ugh.

Anyways, her friend who is SUPER HOT hit up my dms once on Instagram. I started talking with her a lot and ended up dating her friend.  This is also when I half lost my virginity (She was fidaling with my dingaling). Well party girl got super pissed and blocked me, and I didn't mean for this to happen. I loved party girl, but I didn't realize at the time. We were like Romeo and Juliet except Romeo was fucking with Rosaline.

I'm at the point where she has me blocked and I read through our dms everyday, I can't find myself deleting it because then it's over... She's gone forever. So what do I do, sit there and hopelessly read the dms? Or do I delete them and move on.

46,s9tc95,1642823376,Not everyone is made for a relationship,"I've come to the conclusion that not everyone is made for a relationship - even if you desperately want one. Happiness is a choice, something that both people in a relationship need to choose every day. As much as a lot of people don't like hearing, you do have to be happy outside of a relationship. And that doesn't mean a relationship won't make you even happier and add to your life, but you need to develop the ability to filter through your life and pick out the good parts and let the others go. Maybe you had plans to go to lunch with your friend and they got sick and couldn't go. Instead of getting upset because your day is ruined, think of the positives: now you have a whole day to do whatever you want! Maybe your SO didn't get you that gift you really wanted for your birthday. Don't get mad and throw a fit/start questioning your entire relationship and whether your partner is putting in enough effort... Look at other things. Did you guys get to spend the entire day doing things you love together? Was he happy with his gift? Did your SO at least try? How you choose to interpret a situation is all a choice. And that affects your mood and in turn affects your relationship. If you choose to be happy, overall you will be and your relationships will be.

I've noticed that there are people that self sabotage and complain about everything. Both people in and out of relationships. They snap, get mad and argue small, insignificant things that their partner does instead of taking a step back and considering whether or not it partner did it on purpose to hurt you... They take their partner for granted, don't say thanks/you're welcome and expect everything be perfect all the time. And then instead of trying to talk it through with their partner, they come here and ask people that don't really know what exactly happened for advice. And then act. Sometimes without even talking it out with their SO 

People need to build their SO up and go out of their way for each other and it can't be one sided. Doesn't even have to be big things. Take the trash out for them, leave them a note saying you love them, buy them their favorite snack on your grocery trip, tell them they are sexy, text them that you miss them, etc.

So I know a few people who ended long-term relationships (5+ years), not because of abuse or infidelity or anything egregious, but because they were not each other's ""person"". Not too long after ending things, they met someone new and are now happily married, engaged, or are on that path.

If you were with someone for that many years, you presumably had strong feelings for them and saw a future together at some point. So, what is it about your new partner that made you realize that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with them? What was missing from your previous relationship that led to it ending after committing to each other for so long?

I think of 500 Days of Summer when Summer says to Tom something like ""I just knew with him everything that I wasn't sure about with you."" Is it true that you just know?

My best guess was he probably just wanted to hookup. Anyway, he reached out asking for a date and seemed kinda sweet but then went into great detail about how he wanted to kiss me and how important a first kiss is. Despite all this, I told myself maybe he‚Äôs just excited. 

So tonight, he made a big sale and told me how excited he was and couldn‚Äôt sleep. Here‚Äôs how it went down:

Him: Would you be willing to come over and watch a movie with me? We don‚Äôt have to hookup or anything but I just want something to do and am in a really good mood

Me: Sorry that makes me kinda uncomfortable since we haven‚Äôt met yet but I‚Äôm really happy for you! I‚Äôm probably gonna be up a little late so we can text if you want.

Him: (sends video of his tv then pans over to his face and rolls his eyes) the caption is: Cmon what do you think I‚Äôll do

Me: I‚Äôm really not feeling that. I‚Äôm sorry

Him: Did I just blow it?

Me: idk but that‚Äôs is kinda giving me bad vibes

Him: All I did was ask you to come over for a movie. All you had to do was say no. It‚Äôs not that a big of a deal. My goodness.

Me: I did say no and you kept pressuring me to come over. How does you saying ‚Äúcmon what do you think I‚Äôll do‚Äù then rolling your eyes not give major rapey vibes?

Him: what the f*ck? How dare you put my name and the word rape in the same sentence. There‚Äôs no f*cking way I am like that. It‚Äôs not a big f*cking deal all you had to do was say no. I thought you‚Äôd rather hang out instead of wait another day. You can consider Sunday off 

I blocked him shortly after this

I feel really shaken up inside because him gaslighting me on how I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù when I politely did several times reminds me a lot of my toxic ex and triggers me a lot because he would convince me I was the problem. Also, if you look at my posting history dating has been ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL for me and I‚Äôm numb to getting flaked on or ghosted but I was actually looking forward to this date and feel really upset that this is who this guy actually was.

I do like him I just felt he was being overly forward as he was touching my leg and tried to touch my stomach. Then as we were leaving he asked if I could take my mask off and I knew that he wanted to kiss me. I said no as I didn't want to and after it was super awkward he just walked away and that was it...

During the ""date"", I thought that I clicked pretty well with this guy. We all had a few to drink, admittedly, but the sexual tension was definitely there, despite only making out that night.

We arranged for another date, and he was late by about 15 minutes, which isn't a big deal. But I had to text time to let him know that I was waiting for him at our arranged meeting place and right on time too (which I'm not usually, but I like to be consistent when it comes to meeting with new people).

That date went well. We went back to his place and ended up having sex. As clich√© as it might sound, I really am not that type of girl. But, it did happen and what happened, happened I guess. The chemistry felt present, and I asked him if he'd like for us to see each other again, to which he said ""It's all on you, but it's a yes on my end"". 

I thought well awesome, now I know that he wants to continue seeing me. However, I was the one who asked him if he'd be free tomorrow, which I asked 2 weeks in advance and have kept my day free for him.

Last week, I asked him what our plans are for tomorrow/what he'd like to do since I've saved the whole day to see him. I'll be traveling 2 hours to see him tomorrow. He said that he wasn't sure, but he'd ""whip up a plan"", then get back to me and let me know. 

Thing is, he hasn't said anything about a time, place, or what the ""plan"" is. I'm not the type to play games, I'm pretty transparent and straightforward but, I can't help but feel weird about messaging him with a follow up, since the ball is definitely in his court right now.

90,s9x978,1642837342,Hinge experiment analysis. Are men on dating apps really as bad as what women describe?,"Long story short, my roommate did this experiment where he morphed some of my pictures into a female (I'm a guy). It actually looked pretty convincing, and he used photoshop to touch on it further. Appearance wise, female me was probably a 6/10, decent but not stunning. I then installed Hinge, put a bunch of generic information in ""my"" profile like how I was an early 20s university student in California, doing some generic degree. Thus, the experiment began. I just wanted to see what the female experience was like.

Within the first 10 minutes, the profile got like 30 likes, I had to limit the dating pool to only Asian men (since we are Asian). Here are some of the things that stood out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The profile felt really popular and it was hard to reply to all messages. It was like every 20 seconds, there was another like. And I had likes from all sorts of people, from teens to doctors in their 30s. I could relate to women having trouble with filtering the matches, as it's only possible to talk to like 2-3 men at a time, while the rest inevitably get left behind. If I was a woman, I'd have a lot of trouble forming deeper connections in this system. And keep in mind that female me was just...slightly above average, yet I had some IVY educated very good looking males pursuing me, it felt surreal.
2. The quality of males on Hinge at least, is actually pretty good? I don't understand how some women are on about creepy/bathroom selfie males. Out of so matches I got, almost all had pretty good pictures, were highly educated, had relatively interesting profiles and many began with intuitive openers I could have never come up with. Apart from one guy who began with an innuendo, the rest were very respectful and honestly seemed like great guys. They evidently put a lot of effort in the quality of their messages, and were definitely more interesting compared to the women on Hinge. I recall when I swiped as a straight male on Hinge, conversation with women was like pulling teeth, and it felt like I was just there to entertain them. And their pictures/profiles in general had far less effort to the males I saw. Though now that I've gotten the female experience, I guess I could definitely relate as to why women don't even the effort; they just don't have to.
3. Most males on Hinge were above average compared to the street. If you are a 5/10 in real life, then you are probably a 4/10 on dating apps, because the pool is simply better looking. I would imagine that it would be very difficult for an unattractive male to get dates on dating apps. Even if you are an above average male, why should any women choose you on there, if she has a lot of other guys competing for her that are better looking and richer than you?

I feel like after this experiment, if I was make an actual dating that creates relationships, I would probably have a matchmaker system where you had consultants within the app. You would provide them with information about yourself and what you look for in a partner, and they would play matchmaker, linking you with people that are actually compatiable, and maybe you could only get like 3 ""options"" a month. Because right now, dating apps simply don't result in relationships. Women get too many choices and are overwelmed, while men get nothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9x978/hinge_experiment_analysis_are_men_on_dating_apps/
91,s9x9dt,1642837368,Decided I wanted to stop looking for a Mrs and hook ups and now‚Ä¶.,"Hey guys. 28 y.o aussie male here. 
Quick backstory;
I have always managed to date/ find hook up‚Äôs ect, however none of the relationships were ‚Äúlong lasting‚Äù per se, and found it relatively easy to find regular hook-ups/casual ONS (Definitely not bragging or anything as it‚Äôs a lonely life) since I was in my late teens up until a year ago and found started not having much luck with either. However I made the conscious effort a few months ago to delete my dating apps and all that and to stop pursuing, and also to work on myself a lot more considering for the last 7-8 years I have struggled yet also managed being a habitual stimulant substance abuser. This also involves focusing more on turning my occupation into a career ect. I have been clean from heavy every day substance abuse for almost 2 years now and about 8-9 months currently clean from very casual once a month/ every two months if that use.(There was around a 6 month gap in between before I began casual use again). As a result now I‚Äôm experiencing a weird thing where I‚Äôm having multiple females come out of absolutely no where and pursuing me for dates, hook ups ect which feels very odd and alien considering we are living in COVID times and I don‚Äôt leave the house all that often except for work and grocery shopping lol. 

Now I have noticed this happen to me before when I was a little bit younger, but not to this scale, maybe it just feels more intense cos I‚Äôm older now? Once again I must clarify that this is definitely not bragging of any sort, I was just wondering what the significance is behind all of this? 
Have I hit a point in my life where I‚Äôm truly happy within myself and its something to do with the laws of attraction OR is this the universe testing me in an obscure way to see if I‚Äôve really changed within myself to see if I‚Äôm gonna seriously fuck it up?
I consider myself a spiritual person of sorts and tend to be pretty good at following my gut/intuition but I‚Äôm just finding this point of my life very confusing considering dating in your late 20s feels very foreign to navigate.

Anyway the point of this post is has anyone else experienced this or anything similar and have any wisdom whether that be positive or negative to bestow upon me?

She has been initiating conversations with me since the last two days. She told me she would one day be comfortable meeting me over a coffee, as she has been liking to connect with me.

96,s9yhfo,1642842461,She said she I could take her on a date but not yet,"
So basically if u can be bothered to read my first post here it is https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s4dkrn/im_not_sure_how_to_tell_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

So I met up with this girl tonight and we‚Äôve been extremely close for about 2 years now anyway I won‚Äôt go all the way in read the linked post if u can

So all is well, except for when we‚Äôre at dinner and she starts talking about how she went on a date with another guy and I cut her off and say I don‚Äôt want to hear about and that I don‚Äôt care, didn‚Äôt seem big at the time as we just moved on with conversation 

So we finish dinner and we drive to the beach and just talk in the car

So this is my second time seeing her after not talking for 3-4 months and I proceed to just have the convo about What happened between us, long story short I was just being an overall asshole because she broke up with her bf and was getting angry and being a little bit controlling and possessive when she started going out with other men and paying less attention to me

So we talk about it and how it‚Äôs unfair how I can talk about girls etc but whenever she talks about a guy she can‚Äôt, which now looking back is fair, I acknowledge I was an overall dick and not a great friend becuase I really just didn‚Äôt want to hear about it due to my feelings for her

So anyway we‚Äôre driving home and I proceed to relax and let her talk away as she really wanted to talk about one encounter she had that really upset her and was with a guy that I really do despise, so she explains it to me and how it was a transformative moment for her and we proceed to chat more about her love life and how it. Is.

We‚Äôre approaching home stretch for her to drop me off, and my mind just kept telling me to say it so I just say it ‚Äúcan I take you on a date‚Äù I ask. She doesn‚Äôt take me seriously at first and I assure her I‚Äôm serious. She kind of just awkwardly smiles and in a very unconfident tone says ‚Äúsure if u want to‚Äù but didn‚Äôt seem very serious. So we talk a few more minutes before I leave. She tells me, ‚Äúhow do I know your not going to be. Any different from x and y (previous possessive controlling bfs), I‚Äôve only seen you twice, i can see you‚Äôve changed but I know people that change and just go back to the. Same person‚Äù and something more I can‚Äôt remember. 

So I leave her with aa kiss on the cheek and hug basically with what I interpreted the answer being yes but. Not yet kind of like a prove it to me thing. Now it‚Äôs just when do I ask again and the fear of losing her to someone else Before I get to take her on a real date. 

Sorry for. Lack of detail, it‚Äôs late here and I‚Äôm writing this with one eye closed. Highly suggest you read my first post[first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s4dkrn/im_not_sure_how_to_tell_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9yhfo/she_said_she_i_could_take_her_on_a_date_but_not/

98,s9z78b,1642845450,This guy likes me too much too soon. How red is the flag?,"I met a man at work two weeks ago. Different departments, huge organization, so that's not a conflict. He is VERY good looking, successful in his career, and 27yo. I was surprised when he told me he's never had a girlfriend. Never been in a relationship. He has admittedly been emotionally unavailable due to some childhood trauma. Anyway. We've been on 4 dates and had lunch together at work twice. He made our selfie his phone background and tells me pretty much constantly how much he likes me and how special he thinks I am. How he has never clicked with another girl. Even told me he wanted to be exclusive (which I declined for now and he took well.) I don't know if this is love bombing or not. There have been no red flags eluding to him being controlling or narcissistic. He thought I was angry with him earlier tonight and when we talked he started to *cry* saying he just cares about me so much and wants this to work so bad he doesn't want to lose it. I am all for emotions but it's just too much... what do I do??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9z78b/this_guy_likes_me_too_much_too_soon_how_red_is/
