0,o8hfjr,1624735940,I don’t think competition in the dating market is what makes people better dating prospects. It’s almost the opposite,"Competition in the dating market makes people pissed and want to give up. It does the opposite of making them into better dating prospects. It take people of all walks of life and turns them into bad dating prospects.

What makes people good dating prospects?

1) Having it made. You didn’t really have to work for it much. You were for the most part already there. Because you were lucky.

2) Not engaging in the dating competition

Engaging in the dating competition is going down a toxic rabbit hole that only snowballs on itself the deeper you go",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8hfjr/i_dont_think_competition_in_the_dating_market_is/
1,o8hhlr,1624736135,Mixed signals from a guy I’m interested in.,"There’s a guy at my gym who began to talk to me back in November. Mutual attraction. He waves, smiles and compliments me here and there .. not overboard to the point of being creepy though. However, I’ve noticed a trend that concerns me; when I reciprocate or initiate anything (I’m timid so it’s not often that I do any of this), he pulls back and almost ignores me. Lately we’ve been running into each other a lot (arriving at the same time, me coming out of the locker room and him going to the men’s locker room, etc) and he made a comment the other day “why is it that everyday we seem to run into each other a lot?” Almost alluding that I’m doing it on purpose. The other day same thing happened, I said hi and he looked at me like I’m crazy when I wasn’t by any means trying to run into him. I cannot read this guy for the life of me! 

If you liked someone wouldn’t you want them to reciprocate? He is a lot younger than me so maybe he’s immature and needs time to mature in that department?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8hhlr/mixed_signals_from_a_guy_im_interested_in/

4,o8hwkd,1624737537,Messaging Problem,"I have some type of success when it comes to online dating as I get a few matches here and there as well as some conversations that lead to exchanging numbers. The problem I face is that after exchanging numbers I tend to chat with my matches for a very long time and overshare too many things. 

I usually talk with them for a straight few hours then what ends up happening when it comes to the first dates (if it even gets to that) is that I have already run out of topics to talk about. Once I was talking with a woman for two weeks before we went on a first date and towards the end the conversation became more dry but still managed to get a second date.

So, how do you manage this part of dating without seeming that you are not interested in the opposite gender ? I mean, if you continue talking to them less often, they might think that you are not interested anymore. So, how do I navigate around this ?

30,o8kwfi,1624747789,Unsure whether to pursue this girl because I don’t want to be hurt,"So I met this girl at work. She no longer works there nor do I. It was instant attraction, she is intelligent, authentic and just a beautiful person in general. We went on 2 dates in 3 weeks, we kept it professional at work, just chatting to each other in a friendly way and having the occasional laugh at things.

One day, our last day working together we are talking and she’s talking about her new job, I mention we should go on another date, maybe too eagerly, she says now she has a new job she doesn’t have as much time and isn’t feeling it.

I walk off really hurt, but hiding it. It being so out of the blue it caught me off guard and I needed to be on my own for a bit to refocus. I reproach her and say what do you mean “not feeling it”, I say “the dates” she says yes but not the first date, she specially said that one was amazing, she was into me and kept wanting the date to go on and on offering to go to new places which is a really good sign and she even waiting at the end of the date when we were both sat on a bench for a really long time for me to finally have the balls to ask her for a second date and to be her boyfriend to which she eagerly said yes.

It’s just the second date wasn’t the best, firstly it was at 9:40 am which isn’t exactly romantic, it was raining, and we walked around a park in the pouring rain and I couldn’t keep the umbrella up because it was too gusty so we both got wet. Despite this she was still showing signs of attraction, she kept conversations going, she wanted to walk further and longer despite the rain etc.

So with that context, it hit me hard when she said she wasn’t feeling it. As she was walking off for the last time after work, I ran after her and just said “if you change your mind, just text me, that’s all I wanted to say” and walked back. I haven’t texted her since other than congratulating her on her new job sincerely. It’s been 2 days since we saw each other or texted.

I worry that because I wasn’t forward enough on the dates and we never kissed after each of them that she thought I was “friendzoning” her. But I was just trying to read the room and give her time to get used to me before going for the kiss, since she is shy.

Before she friend zoned me she said “I really really really like you and we should get drinks as the last date just didn’t feel right” she even mentioned a bar. Is it even possible to impress somebody again after being friend zoned to get out the friend zone. A part of me wants to go with her and try to impress her, but another doesn’t and just wants me to let her go and not go because if I went and just realised it was just “mates going for drinks”, I’d have to go through all the pain again. I truly like this girl, she is wife material so it’s difficult.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8kwfi/unsure_whether_to_pursue_this_girl_because_i_dont/

But any time I'm rejected by a woman they always say something mean/rude, laugh at me, or something. 

Like why do they do that...That's all I want to know is why? I just figure respect garners respect. Not saying bc I was respectful they should be into me. Just saying kindness is okay. You can also say, not interested. I don't need to know why you're not interested. Calling me fat, ugly, too dark skinned, laughing in my face, etc. 

I'm just genuinely curious what their need to bring me down is...I don't even seek out women anymore bc of how I've been treated by them...

I used to see a therapist about my issues surrounding dating. He encouraged me to face my fears and actually go on dates, which I have.

 The problem is that I often end up an emotional wreck because I’m so afraid the person I’ve developed feelings for will dump me for being impotent.  It’s a really bad feeling.

Anyway, I feel really stuck and down about this. Deep down I really want to open up to a girl I am interested in. I’ve just been struggling with confidence and am having a hard time getting excited about the prospect of starting a romantic relationship even though it’s what I want .

Natürlich habe ich das klassische Problem, dass ich nicht weiß wie sie für mich empfindet. Wir treffen uns regelmäßig, mindestens einmal in der Woche. Meistens sehen wir uns dann den Sonnenuntergang an, eigentlich ist das ja eher Romantisch aber ich weiß nicht was sie dabei denkt. Sie hat mir auch erzählt das ich einer der wenigen in unserer Umgebung bin mit dem sie etwas macht, da die meisten einfach komisch sind. Als wir gestern in der Stadt etwas essen waren und zurück zum Auto gegangen sind habe ich bemerkt das ein Typ ihr sehr auffällig hintergestarrt hat, daraufhin meinte ich zu ihr das sie kurz vor mir laufen soll da es für sie unangenehm sein könnte (dachte ich mir) und einerseits hat es mich Extrem angekotzt. Als wir dann beim Auto waren hatten wir nochmal kurz darüber gesprochen, anstatt einer angewiederten reaktion wie ich es erwartet hatte, kam nur ein:,, wie sah er den aus?'' Eigentlich war ich mir zu circa 70% sicher das sie mich auch auf die selbe Art mag, aber diese Situation hat mir die ganze nacht den Schlaf geraubt und ich weiß nicht mehr weiter. Ihr direkt zu sagen was ich für sie empfinde geht momentan nicht, da ich mich dazu noch nicht bereit fühle.

52,o8nji8,1624757741,My creepiest date this year so far,"So I’m 23M just got home from a movie date with a girl and I feel just so creeped out and just uncomfortable with her…

(Keep in mind we didn’t get good during the movie, at the end I need to pee, she also lived 40 mintues away too) ( sorry if story is a little confusing not good at writing a story and feel uncomfortable and shaking currently… 😪)

The movie part of the date was nice we cuddled watching it. No like serious physical contact. Didn’t kiss which happy we didn’t. 

She was cool the whole movie and talking a little more then what I would’ve liked but not a red flag. 

Was after the movie where she just turned into a big red flag 😅 

so movie ends and she still cuddling me as people are leaving. I subtly joke like oh wow we need to move cause people are trying to get by and I don’t wanna be rude or that guy. She doesn’t move till everyone is gone and I’m like oh boy is she trying to kiss me or do something sexual?

I then get up and she awkwardly gets up and takes her time. We exit the movie area and are walking back I mention maybe seeing another movie together cause date was nice but would have to wait an hour and  half and didn’t want too. 

So she then wants to walk to a home decor place on the way there and in the store starts getting really personal about where I work and how long I’ve lived here and if imma stay here.

At this point I’m like okay we need to end the date. So we leave the store and walk back to the movie parking lot. I  admit I said we could do another date but I was trying to end the date cause she wanted to go to a park and walk with me. That’s my bad for saying we should do another date. That was wrong of me. 

I felt uncomfortable and wanted to get out of there with out being rude. We walk to my car and she stops me and says. Hey can we talk for a second? I’m like okay? She’s like I had a good time tonight you want to keep taking? I’m like oh uhh I thought we were gonna. End the date here and go home you live 40 mintues? 

She then goes in to hug me and tries to kiss me and I kinda back off. She then starts a new conversation with me and tries to hug my side and asks me 3 more times wanna keep talking?

Every time I keep saying not that I don’t want too I had a good time with you just wanna go home and eat and process the date.  

Then she asks me to walk her to her car and I wanna be gentle men and polite so I do it’s one row over from my car. We get there and agains tries to hug my side and get all touchy. I then swat my leg cause uncomfortable and play it off as a mosquito biting me. 

She then starts telling me in detail her entire Monday work day. Tuesday. And I cut her off saying hey I had a good time imma head home and process the date. We can maybe do another one next week. She then hugs me and I’m like okay bye. 

I walk away and she’s like waving me over like hey let’s plan that next date. I say that’s okay let’s just text about it. I want you to get home safe. Text me when you get home safe. I quickly walk to my car. 

Usually I will get my gps set up and music but I was so afraid and creeped out and just anxiety was making me shake… so I just drove away. I got creep feeling like she may follow me… Fml just idk very horrible vibes I got and just wasn’t okay with how touchy she got. 

I feel like I gave plently of like cues that I didn’t wanna be touched or wasn’t feeling it. Maybe she didn’t understand some social cues but still. Needed to vent this still shaking.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8nji8/my_creepiest_date_this_year_so_far/

54,o8nq30,1624758490,How can I navigate dating?,"25m

Been out of the relationship thing since I was 18. Took the time afterwords to focus on myself. Honestly, it took me a while to get over it emotionally too. I now feel ready to start dating, and in fact just went on a first date a couple days ago for the first time since. 

The issue being, I am finding it way too emotionally draining. I’m looking for an actual relationship, and for me, that requires a complete and exclusive emotional connection. I’m dumping all of my eggs into one basket every time. I can’t *not* do that. 
This last date went well, imo and what she said, but I guess I got ghosted after we set up a second date. And honestly, it’s spirit crushing. I had little emotional connection or physical attraction prior, but that typically all happens after I meet someone on a personal level. Like on/after a 1st date. I can’t just look at someone and be attracted to them. 

All the expectations, nervousness, anxiety of meeting...just to then actually feel that connection and then start over with someone new. How do others do it? I’m not in it for hookups or anything, nor would I participate in that. I legit just want a relationship. It’s so easy for me to form my own emotional connections to people, and it takes so much out of me when it doesn’t work.

Okay so i'm a 26 year old guy, never dated. Opened up a dating account two days ago. I was to ashamed to go on Tinder. So i went to an international dating site &amp; changed the city to limit myself from bumping into people i may know. While i wasn't the most unpopular kid in school i still got a lot of shit &amp; i guess the fear of being ridiculed still haunts me today.

However there's still people from the same country as me on the site.  
I didn't actually have high hopes, my confidence is lower than a submarine &amp; has been that way for many years now. But i felt it was worth a try, because as of right now i wont meet anyone.

So i actually got 30+ matches. (I bought premium so i didn't have to swipe for hours)  
\***Drumroll**\*, none of them are actually from my own country. They're all foreigners from various countries, mostly Asian.  
Many of them are super pretty &amp; way out of my league. So i should be thrilled...

But instead i feel worthless since no girls from my own country actually wants me. I mean the bar is high.  
And then looking through all the Asian women like i was ordering something off on Ebay.  
I don't know. anymore. At least i'm their age but there's literally no way for me to know if they genuinely find me attractive or not? Maybe exotic at best.  
Or that i seem way more interesting in my profile than i really am. 

I literally earn minimum wage &amp; live with my mom right now. Since i'm currently selling my apartment. I don't have a useful degree. I do have about 100K $ saved up, when the apartment is sold. But without a solid income i doubt i'm eligible for another loan. Which i probably couldn't afford anyway.  
And a degree will take years.  
So with other words, who'd actually want to live with me in my mothers basement?

Good mixture between anxiety, depression &amp; self hatred. I should probably just go see a shrink instead. But if anyone can make sense out of my messy post &amp; give me some advice id be super thankful.

57,o8nvj8,1624759125,Today was a good day,"So I had a good day and want to put into words everything. 

I was engaged around 5 years ago give or take. I was not a good boyfriend and was very emotionally neglectful. Did a lot of things I’m not proud of and spent years meditating on that and gave my ex a heartfelt apology for specific things and it was well received. Also came to grips with my depression and have sense started getting medicated for it because meditation and talking to myself (and being brutally honest in self reflection) has not been enough. 

One of the things that I noticed in a trend of toxic relationships is I always had sex with the person I’m into after like a first date. The only exception was a girl that was on her period and she didn’t want to so we waited for that to clear up so she was more comfortable with doing it. I’m not saying that it’s bad or good to wait but I have been infatuated with the idea of sex that feels more meaningful because you know you are doing it with someone you truly love.

In the years between it has been rough. I would meet someone I’m into and they either just wanna hook up or just don’t want anything serious. Which is fine for them but not what I’m looking for. I promised myself that I wouldn’t cave on having just hookup sex and also I wouldn’t welcome any dating prospects unless I felt we were on the same page. 

Well, the other night on my OKCupid I had a convo with this girl that just posted that she’s looking for friends and we had a conversation. We met up today and got lunch then went back to her place and played chess and go fish. Just sort of hung out and joked and talked a lot of shit to each other. I think she’s really cute, funny, awkward (I am too) and just an all around really cool person. So before I left I told myself to face my crippling fear of rejection and ask this girl out on a romantic date. 

Before I could even ask her, she suggested that we should exchange phone numbers. That definitely made me asking a lot easier. So I said something like “I really enjoyed hanging out and I think you’re super dope so would you be willing to go on a romantic date with me? Like, today was definitely more of a hangout and get a feel for each other” and she said yes! On top of that she also said she is not into just hooking up since that’s what so many people are looking for. I told her that was perfect. 

The thing is, maybe we won’t get that far into anything serious or maybe we will. I don’t know. I’m just happy that I put myself out there facing the fear of rejection and also there are other people not looking for just a hookup.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8nvj8/today_was_a_good_day/

63,o8oa6m,1624760757,"Why is it so difficult for some guys to find girls that are interest in them, but so easy for others?","So I am 28, have had no luck in love, and my online dating profile is just a magnet for bots and influencers. 

Some of my younger friends have no issue finding girls. And most of the ones my age and a bit younger are engaged or married. And their gfs are pretty much everything that I wanted my dream girl to be: wholesome and super nice. I mean they deserve them since they are really nice guys themselves (the reason why they are my friends to begin with). But, I cannot stop myself from feeling lonely and a bit jealous of them based on my situation. 

People keep telling me that there is “someone for everyone” and to “just be patient”. But everytime that they say that I can't stop myself from remembering that there are more men than women in the world, so there are guys that are destined to be alone, and that I might very well be one of those guys. 

The uncertainty of not knowing if the right girl exists just drives me crazy. Sometimes I wonder if the point of living is to be a donkey chasing a carrot tied to a stick that is placed in from of him. That is how trying to find someone has felt to me. I am just trying to find something that I don't even know if it is meant to be or if it will even happen.

64,o8obbf,1624760887,"Today I made my first cold-approach at the mall at 16, and even though it didn't go as planned, it felt awesome..","I(16M) have been in relationships before and feel quite confident in my ability to talk to girls but it mostly happens with girls that I know from school. 

Since school ended and I am single, I have been considering the practice of cold-approaching(Hitting on people you don't know in person) for a week or so but haven't actually hit on anyone. 

Today, while at the mall, I waited for my parents by the seating area while they were looking around inside a store. I was scouting(looking around for someone to cold-approach) for a while but felt a bit nervous(mostly because most girls are walking right next to their parents). But then a girl walking with her friend really caught my attention as she was really beautiful and seemed to be staring at me while walking and almost looked as if she was giving me the green light, so I didn't even think about it too much and went for it. I said ""Hey, I saw you from afar and thought you were pretty attractive, what's your name?"" to which she responded, ""sorry I have a boyfriend"", and I just said ""okay thanks""

Afterwards, I didn't feel awkard or sad about what she said, but instead quite proud of myself for putting myself out there, I even called up my buddies to tell then the whole thing. It was an awesome high and I will be practicing for the rest of the summer for sure. Not just a way to get numbers/dates, but also a great way to gain experience and confidence with girls--something that many teen age boys and even men struggle with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8obbf/today_i_made_my_first_coldapproach_at_the_mall_at/

I got a lot really helpful advice and insight, even valid criticism of what I might be doing wrong. Some people suggested I may need therapy which I initially scoffed at but I gave it a go. 

Maybe I just got lucky and found a really good therapist, but after just 3 sessions in 2 weeks, I've uncovered a lot of unresolved issues I'm carrying. Turns out that through a complex history of trauma and re-inforcement, my brain keeps telling me to be passive and and non-confrontational. It's like an over-compensation that I fall back on, which undoubtedly shines brightest when I'm talking to women. 

So anyway I'm now on the path to improvement. I'm finally able to see what I've been doing wrong and what's causing my failure, so I have a lot to work on myself now.

79,o8pmqj,1624766325,I’m not good at “getting digits” or taking chance encounters to the next step,"On an international flight, I (F) ended up chatting with the people (Ms) next to me. It was an awesome and easy conversation, which was surprising to me because most first encounters are awkward. We talked about jobs, hobbies, travel, passions, etc. I usually don’t don’t talk to strangers on a long flight. 

I live overseas and it’s rare that I connect with other English speaking people from my home state. Plus I work at a job where I don’t regularly meet new people. Not to mention that often as an adult you strike up a conversation with people who are jerks, racists, rude, etc. Plus COVID has dramatically reduced these encounters. It’s been a lonely year. 

So I had a great time getting to know new people (one of the guys I was attracted to) that ends when the plane lands. I say, “it was nice chatting with you and have a nice time at home” and disembark the plane. 

Why do I do this? I’m a chatty and friendly person but I’m not good at ensuring that things progress further. I just don’t know how to take things to the next step (whether it be with friendships or romantic relationships). This happens more than I’d like to admit. 

So since I’ve landed I’ve been questions the root cause of my tendency of doing this. Fear of rejection? False projections? Avoidance of true connections? Obviously I’m overthinking this. 

Am I alone? 

TL;DR: in a rare occurrence, met some cool dudes on a flight and didn’t get any contact information when we landed. It’s left me in a hyper overthinking state.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8pmqj/im_not_good_at_getting_digits_or_taking_chance/
