So I walked into a hair salon and the hairdresser there was very good looking. He sort of stared at me for a while, like didn‚Äôt break eye contact. Then, for my consult he sat right next to me on the large sofa. When calculating the length of my hair extensions, he literally went to touch my chest where my hair would be. Maybe smiled. Said my hair is a nice colour. Then, when sorting out the colours of my hair extensions, he sort of put his body over mine, and just brought the swatch book to my hair.

He is really good looking, a lot more than I think I can ‚Äúscore.‚Äù He seemed older than me, and idk if he single or no. Also, when the first man consulted me, he didn‚Äôt touch me at all, and sat a bit far from me.

I‚Äôve (M) been attracted to this lady since last week, when she helped me and my friends starting on a new mobile career plan, on installment and new phones. The whole thing was pretty messy at the beginning but she handled the whole thing so gracefully I instantly fell for her. 

The whole time she was having small talks with all of us, we exchanged generic informations, but no social media ID or contact. The whole process took around 3hours and when everything was finished, she came along to the exit door and when my friends entered the car, I asked her out, and she said maybe. 

I never knew what to say when you face a maybe, so I blurted, ‚Äúso what do I do now?‚Äù

Luckily enough, she said, ‚Äúyou should wait patiently!‚Äù

I took it as a challenge. 

Fortunately, the career shift wasn‚Äôt smooth, so I had to go the store a few times around the week, along with some other necessities, which allowed me to talk to her and know more about each other, and finally today, I asked her again, how do I change the Maybe to an Yes. She smiled, and said she doesn‚Äôt know, as she‚Äôs taking summer classes and has work. 

I said, a 30mins won‚Äôt do much harm, and I‚Äôm taking the same courses in her department so I know the deal.

She smiled again, and said, okay next week!

I told her, I know which days you work, Tuesday, and Friday, and another day I‚Äôm missing, and she corrected, Wednesday.

I said I came here Wednesday, you weren‚Äôt there, and then she corrected me again, she works in the morning that day. 

So I said see you next week and left the store. 

I didn‚Äôt stop there. I noticed she was having a cold problem, so I went to Starbucks, bought a hot chocolate, and went back to store. That time she was assisting other customer, and when she was done, she came to me, and I handed her the cup. 

She was genuinely happy, I could see that. 

And when I was going back, I turned back, and said, see you next week, and she gracefully said the same too. 

Now that I can say, I am going to have a date NEXT WEEK, what should I plan ahead?

At first, which day should I choose?

As I haven‚Äôt taken her number yet, because I feel this is a very personal information, so my only to pick her is to meet her in the store on her work days. 

Plus, what else should I plan ahead? I hear people say do not go on lunch/dinner on the first date. But as I am from a different culture (Indian Subcontinent) I wish to take her to an Indian Restaurant nearby which is pretty good. 

Seeking advice from experts. Thanks.

I‚Äôve been lurking the past few days because of my own unaddressed trauma so I‚Äôll share.  

Matched with a girl on tinder (18f) who was super cute with great pics. Got off tinder fast to Snapchat, she quickly turned things sexual and we hooked up pretty quick. I‚Äôm no ladies man I‚Äôm just decently attractive and fit, I also have anxiety problems like the average zoomer. I feel like a mistake I made early on was answering her question of how many partners ive had. I told her the truth which was 2 at the time, she would be the third. She told me I would be her tenth which I genuinely do not and still do not have a problem with. She also told me she didn‚Äôt want a relationship, which at first disappointed me but I became okay with it as long as she was actually a friend to me.

We had amazing, mind blowing sex as in my **** was chafed after doing it for an hour or two. Had her orgasm in the double digits from foreplay and the real thing. Genuinely best sex ive had. She told me the same as most of the guys she‚Äôd slept with had been one time things that were bad.

Great I‚Äôm looking forward to this new hot friend who I can fuck (lol). She told me she had mental health issues and I‚Äôm the type of person who cares for people they are intimate with even in this situation, so I would support her when she was sad etc. I can‚Äôt express how sincere I was with that, I have mental health problems myself and trauma from my past. 

Fast forward because this is getting rambly, anytime I would bring up my own problems I would get literally zero response. She would actually ignore what I said to snap me some cute photo. She would tell me she didn‚Äôt want a relationship when I would bring up that that was unfair to me as if I was asking for a relationship, then use BPD as an excuse for any bad behavior as if she has no responsibility for her actions. 

I would ask her to hang out and she would always insist on letting me know vaguely at some point in the future with no consideration of my time (happened over ten times). I just genuinely wanted to see her as a friend. Obviously I cared much more than she did. But she would always tell me how much she cared about me and my feelings, it‚Äôs like she was a different person when we talked on the phone versus Snapchat and text. I called off an overtime shift once to see her after we verbally made plans on FaceTime just for her to cancel last minute so she could hang out with her friends.

She was only 15 minutes away from me and could only make time to see me barely once a month. Continuously claim she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship when I would bring up how inconsiderate some of this behavior was, randomly ask me about my exes and if she was hotter than her, grilling me if I fucked any girls when I went on vacation. I cut her off a few times for several weeks because of this behavior but I would always let her back in when she would text me because she was cool in person.

The last straw was her trying to humiliate me when she cancelled on me last minute again. She told me she couldn‚Äôt come that day after work because she felt sick. We had made very explicit plans over FaceTime, there was no doubt about these plans I‚Äôm just expendable. Okay,we keep chatting and try to make another plan for later in the week. I end up FaceTiming because it would be easier and she is dolled up in her car going to see her friend. Then she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always disappointed/rude when I don‚Äôt end up coming. I never said I would.‚Äù Then she tells me she knows I have feelings for her, it all clicked right then. It was humiliating to feel like this whole time she was using me because she knew I cared more than she did.

I'll try to be short. I've tried something with an older guy (40), but despite our connection, undeniable chemistry, we end up fighting a lot and now we've decided to take a break from each other. 
They we're some things going on, as follows: 
-we're both in the military, officers. Being a female in the military and a lot younger (inferior rank, obviously) seems to be an issue and I partially understand. Regardless of smart or diplomatic I might be, people will still talk shit about female in the military and that bugs him. The age difference says a lot, as back in the days there were a lot fewer females in the system and he gets to hang out with people his age, listening to their sexist, inappropriate comments, also seeing women using their sex appeal as an advantage and I feel like this gets to be projected on me. We met outside work, so he said often that he can't see me as someone in the military, but we both know that's an issue. I don't know if he can get past it;

-the early jealousy tantrum. He acted all jealous over an incident I mentioned happened after first encounter. We didn't kiss or establish that we're dating at that point and the situation went from 1 to 100 really fast and he was constantly bringing that up, although I was telling him constantly that i was owning him anything back then. He just projected on me his plans and dreams and me not going that fast just triggered his insecurities. Took him months to apologize for being out of the line;

-communication styles. We don't communicate in the same way. I try not to take things personally, but I feel like sometimes he's patronizing me and I told him that. I don't have a problem with constructive criticism and arguments, but he called me naive several times, bankrolled eyes at me and there are times when he acts (and verbally mentioned) like he's disappointed. The last fight was on why I dont keep my phone on sight. I told him I get to see him once a week, so i don't need my phone to constantly check, which was entirely true, but he insisted so much on not believing me, on me having something to hide or be ashamed of I started crying in anger and frustration. I think that if that was something bothering him, he should have asked specifically. This is how I do, I point out what bothers me, but he 'wanted to see me act naturally'. This lack of clear communication and acceptance towards natural behavior annoys and frustrates me. 

-I told him once I don't think I can feel loved by someone like him and I know this will stay with him forever. When things are good between us are really good, he treats me nicely, he has manners, he's smart and appealing, but when we disagree on the smallest thing, the power imbalance feels rather obvious. He makes me feel small, naive and patronized, rather than someone with less experience he can tactfully taught, if he wants. And even if there's something I might be be right on, purely theoretical subject, sometimes he takes  my personal opinion like a mind game I'm playing just have a different opinion than his. I just like debates and is not the first time I'm mentioning. 

The question is...why do I keep getting back in this vicious cycle and how do I break it? Does it worth trying again? Is it something that can be fixed using a different approach? 

I do think about him often, but the reasons I mentioned above weight a lot, especially the first one, as is the one completely out of control. He never dated in the system, I can tell he really likes me, not ashamed or scared to go out with me in public, but the system is a trigger for him. He gets annoyed by plenty of aspects work related and being both in it, I can't be avoided permanently. There's a tension between us and sometimes it doesn't feel right. We've been through a lot already and our honeymoon phase was smashed by the early fights on jealosy and system. 

We both struggle with depression, anxiety and various traumas, but we never bonded on those. We expressed our vulnerabilities, but we seem to be unable to treat each other calmly and compassionately. It almost feels like mirroring each other. 

Then how 2 people so similar can't get along and have so much friction between them?

(My partner is non-binary so I will refer to them as s/o)

TW: mentions of sh and suicide

Throw away account since they know my main

Me and my s/o have been dating for 2 and a half years and we‚Äôre both in our late teens, but due to their strict parents we only se each other about twice a month. We both have our fair share of personal problems, mental illnesses, and other challenges we deal with but they are on a different level.

They have depression, anxiety and an ED, but show signs of BPD, Adhd/Autism, schizophrenia, and a couple other things that I can‚Äôt remember.

They come from a family were their father was extremely abusive to them and their mother, both are drunks, smoke a ton, don‚Äôt know how to show affection to their kids ,are terrible when it comes to taking their children to hospitals when they need to be at one ,and don‚Äôt believe their children have any mental illness even when putting them through multiple traumatic experiences when while we were together. I hear them constantly fighting and have heard the father make fun of my s/o‚Äôs cuts and multiple attempts of suicide.

So all around a horrible environment.

Since even before our relationship started I‚Äôve always tried my hardest to be there for them when no one else would, tried my best into talking them out of a lot of things, and as quarantine came around it severely impacted their mental health to where this is the worse I‚Äôve seen them.

Although they have apologized multiple times for the way they are and feel like I would leave them since their ‚Äútoo much baggage‚Äù unfortunately I feel like that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening.

They now were constantly struggles to get out of bed (often spending full days in bed), never eating, constantly conveying ways that they would want to ‚Äúgo out‚Äù, purposely sending me other people with a better physique, or having aggressive mood swings towards me out of no where. I can‚Äôt even find time to talk to them about my own issues without them bringing up how they have it worse. 

And when they aren‚Äôt doing any of this they‚Äôre completely obsessed with me. Talks of marriage, kids, apartment planning ,stealing my clothing, wanting to look like me and does things that make themselves extremely uncomfortable just to ‚Äúmake me happy‚Äù when usually I beg them not to do so and other things when Im just about to be a young adult next year

I‚Äôve tried my best to accommodate to the best of my abilities to them constantly even when I‚Äôm tired, sick, or emotional/mentally unavailable and after dealing with them so long I feel drained and unhappy with the relationship.

And it doesn‚Äôt help when neither of us have friends anymore so I have no one to vent my stress out to so I‚Äôve just been holding it in and try my best to distract myself whenever I get the opportunity to be alone or off the phone with them. 

I‚Äôm also trying to go into a career of music, but feel like I have to put away my interests since I either get too passionate about it and become ‚Äúannoying‚Äù or just that I have to put their problems first.

At this current moment I feel as if I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs going on with them anymore and would want to stay single for awhile if we end up splitting.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and apologies for how this is worded, I‚Äôve never had to type something like this.

TLDR : S/o is extremely mentally ill and I feel unhappy about our current relationship and where it stands

Edit 1: Forgot to mention how they‚Äôve told me multiple times that I‚Äôm the only reason that they‚Äôre alive, for others it you may appreciate but it has put a lot of pressure on me since the beginning of our relationship, all while this being my first true relationship ever",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,903052,public,self,Their mental health has tired me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/om3iuf/their_mental_health_has_tired_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,

We would always exchange kudos and all that.

Last week I finally got the courage to message her on IG and I suggested that she should join me for a run sometime. Surprisingly she said that it would be really nice and we arranged to go for a run last weekend. after the run I asked her to get coffee with me and she immediately agreed. And I have to say I had the best time with her. The conversation was constantly going, there was no awkwardness or silence at all. She was asking me a lot of personal questions as like she was trying to get to know me better and I was doing the same. There‚Äôs was some banter and mocking of each other. I walked her to the station and she even gave me a hug. 

Naturally after an hour or so I messaged her to say that I had great time talking to her and that it would be nice if we did this again! I also wished her a nice weekend as she was saying how excited she is for other plans she had made. The reply I got from her was not the best and not the one I expected. She only wished me a nice weekend too and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the previous message‚Ä¶

After a few days and some convincing from my friends that I messaged her again, i message her to ask if she wanted to meet up on the weekend and very quick I got a response saying that she is working on the weekend and can‚Äôt make it. Nothing else, didn‚Äôt propose alternative time, didn‚Äôt try to hold a conversation with me or anything, so I left it there‚Ä¶.

This outcome really made no sense to me so since then all I have been trying to figure out is why that happened. Is it possible that I completely miss read the situation and the date was not actually that great or did i pick the wrong energy from here? Is it me or is it her own issues or sth? Will she text me herself to meet one day? Was this all just an excuse to not see me or just bad timing?

Let's look at what would a man expect out of a relationship:

- an emotional connection

You can straight up forget about this one. A woman will never feel anything close to a real ""emotional connection"" to a man when she has 10 other options, ready to replace you in a week.

You cannot feel ""emotional connection"" to someone who you cannot relate to - majority of women have robust social lives and dozens of bodies before they hit 20, while male loneliness is at an all times high. A ""good social life"" to a man would be crippling loneliness to a woman, they are used to being wanted by everyone. How can you relate to someone like that?

- for the partner to put in an equal amount of effort

Will never happen. Women are used to men doing everything: the first approach, carrying the convo, chasing after her, making plans, paying for everything...

Only thing women really offer in a relationship is sex, but that feels good for them too, so can we really consider ""a favor""?

If the man stops putting in all the effort needed to maintain the ""relationship"", then the woman will simply find someone else who will.

- be actually wanted and desired

Not gonna happen for men who dont look like male modes


And for a man to even qualify to *attempt* to date, he must first check a number of physical requirements: height, good looking face, be socially well versed, have income and not be considered a loser by society, fit...

We discussed early on what we were looking for, I said I wanted a relationship, he said he wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship but was open to one and that he hoped that wasn't a dealbreaker for me (I said no, but I don't have casual sex). We have not had sex though we have a lot of passion between us and spend a lot of time doing other things and he's very attentive to what I like and don't like. We have very interesting, thought-provoking conversations and definitely have plenty to talk about when the conversation is non-sexual and often poke fun at and joke with each other. He told me that he likes me and has told me he's taking a trip in early august so he wanted to communicate that to me because I had expressed earlier how important communication was for me. Whenever we're together he always says ""next time we should XYZ"" and has given me vague invitations to events down the line and he'll stare at me when he thinks I'm not looking and even when I am looking he'll stare right into my eyes and say nothing then smile, and ask me what I'm thinking about.

Anyway, I hope that this is going somewhere but it's sorta hard to believe that it is because 1) I'm not entirely sure that we are on the same page about what we want and 2) I've been disappointed in dating before when things seemed to be going somewhere but ended up not working out. He's shown a lot more initiative in person than over the phone (we exchange a few texts everyday but no phone calls and don't have each others social media) which I don't know is more about how he communicates or shows a lower interest (I'm thinking the first thing).

So today I‚Äôm feeling used and alone and depressed. Not over that loser. Just over life.

I‚Äôm trying so hard to not download another app. I feel so weak. I keep telling myself, but maybe he‚Äôs out there. I need to keep trying. 
But what if I don‚Äôt. Why can‚Äôt I just go a day or a week or a month without being on any apps? Without the constant hello, hey, how you doin? 
Why can‚Äôt I just embrace my life, and get control of my grief, and not depend on others to distract me from my depression? 
I‚Äôm pretty well adjusted. Most of the guys I meet are into me. I get lots of attention. It‚Äôs like a high I can‚Äôt live without. Till I crash and burn. And it‚Äôs so hard constantly having to send that ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm not interested‚Äù text after each date.

Obviously no one forces these men to take these women out on dates  . And as guy , if your intention is to use this merely as way to sleep with a woman as opposed to geniuely being interested in her and trying to get to know her , most of the time it won't work , plus that's the wrong frame of mind to have , because she doesn't owe you anything . But this goes both ways, too... because she doesn't owe you her body , you don't owe her your time and a free dinners . 

Back to women. Anyone--guy or girl-- go through the comment sections of posts in this sub , and see how often the words 'manipulative' , 'toxic' or 'controlling' are used by my women to describe the majority of men . This is highly ironic and funny to me at least anyway , because these negative traits seem to be disproportionately more present in women as opposed to men . 

Understand that a lot of women download Bumble or Tinder at the end of each month when they're broke  to go on dinner dates with men they know they have zero interest in , and have zero intentions of sleeping with . If you're still not convinced , what about times when women trick men into believing that they've been celibate or have less sexual partners than they actually have just because they've been single for an extended period of time ?

So I broke it off because of that. Neither of us were happy but, I made sure to keep her in my life and agreed to work on my personal issues and help with her‚Äôs too. So she recently started talking about just being friends, which I am honestly not bothered by because she is worth it and really cool woman. So one day I made some sexual comments to her and she responds with how we are just friends now and she wasn‚Äôt sure if I was joking or serious. So I said that yea I was serious but also joking. She just starts laughing her ass off. You know I am just trying to keep everything light and enjoyable. I am cool either way. Is a response like that typical? I think she still likes me personally. We still talk a lot even when I am having a tough time. She has been so helpful to me just being so cool and kind. I am 100% only worried about her health and not the relationship.

I suggested that we go to this pretty swank place that we had talked about on the first date and we had a great time. We really had a great time on both dates, the chemistry was great, lots in common, and the attraction was very mutual. My intention was to pay for the entirety because she did the first time around, as I had told her I would on the first date, but she had told the waiter to bring her the bill while I was in the bathroom. I protested but didn't want to make a deal of it, thanked her, and told her next time is definitely on me please!

So last night we end up at my place around midnight, and we've both had a few but we were far from drunk. So I set the mood and we get down to it, and things are going nicely until I notice that I'm starting to lose my ahem virility and this is when the anxiety starts to set in, making it even worse. So I pause for a bit to just relax and take in the moment to get back into it, meanwhile I'm reassuring her it's really not you it's me let's just take a few etc.

To preface, it's odd 'cause I don't really consider myself to have ED, and my willy would easily spring to life throughout both dates as there was a lot of light touching, but I guess it isn't clutch during the big game. This has happened before as well and not recently, but once I got through the first time with my last partners I would never experience it again and it would only get better, although most of those times there was always alcohol involved.

Anyway, I'm lying down next to her in bed just chilling out for a few, and I'm starting to feel her mood wind down, and about 5 min later she gets up, tells me ""don't worry about it"". That's my queue to worry, so I reluctantly ask her to stick around cause it's gonna come back up any minute now and try to explain I'm just having a little performance anxiety, but I know that with my anxiety of her wanting to leave now coupled with all the booze it's going to be a moonshot. She seemed pissed and shot back with ""you know what? It's not even about the money, but I could've spent those 300 bucks on hanging out with my girlfriends tonight instead"", and she left.

I felt kind of bummed after that. I didn't mean to kill the mood, and I thought that was kind of tough to hear cause sparks were just flying before all this and I thought the rapport we had built could get us through that hiccup, but I digress. oh well, guess I blew it, but now I'm worried this is just going to keep happening.

Things were looking very promising for him. They exchanged messages and arranged a date. I was proud of him for accomplishing this so quickly.

And then tragedy struck. During the middle of the date, the woman told him that she was trans. And then my friend said in a polite way that he wouldn't date a trans woman because he's straight but would still be friends with her. Then she stormed out of the restaurant and left him alone. When he went home, he received a lot of abusive text messages from her calling him anti-LGBT, a right-wing supporter, transphobic and to name a few other offensive terms. It got so bad he had to block her.

While some dating sites/apps offer the option for transgender or it would show up in their description, her profile did not contain any of this. She was classified as a regular woman in that profile so he wasn't able to find out until she met. Not to mention the way she dressed and her body appearances looked nothing masculine (although she had a deeper than normal voice). Now would I support him even if he accepted dating her? Yes but he chose not to. We don't hate or anti-support the LGBT community. In fact we went to a pride support parade 2 years ago as straight guys. He even has friends who are MTF trans on his Facebook.

Unfortunately he has avoided dating apps because he's afraid he might end up dating another trans woman. So is it really wrongful to choose not to date a transgender as a non-LGBT person?

The problem is I feel like I am eventually going to burn out of things to say and she'll loose interest.

I spoke with my therapist about this yesterday and she told me it's not a bad thing that I go all in,  but that I need to put boundaries in front of myself so I don't go overboard and get upset if I get rejected.
