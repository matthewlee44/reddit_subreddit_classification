Back in March my ex broke up with me.  It was a very toxic relationship full of gaslighting and emotional abuse which devastated me. My every attempt at communicating with her to fix our relationship was always met with an argument and me apologizing for something insignificant (white lies about not reading text messages, not being ""attentive"" enough, etc.). She tried to persuade me into being her ""friend"" after the breakup which I wouldn't accept because she only wanted my support without her having any obligation towards me, basically bringing the toxicity up another level. It all ended with me going no contact


After a month of breaking up I started to spend time with one of my colleagues. I've known her for about 2 years now, hung out only once or twice before and we initially got together to study. She also had a toxic relationship which ended around the time mine did, we both shared our stories and supported each other through our difficult time. She always compliments me, tells me I'm ""a perfect husband/boyfriend/future father"". After our exams were over we started hanging out more frequently, we text each other every day, she quickly became one of my best friends and I'm starting to question myself if I'm catching feelings for her. I wasn't attracted to her in the past so that's why I'm a bit confused about my feelings right now. I usually know if I'm physically attracted to a girl the minute I look at her but this seems different somehow, it's like we're building a connection over time slowly. Even if I am attracted to her, I'm not sure if it's a genuine feeling or I'm just starved of attention and still hung up on my ex. 

I've never had a deep platonic friendship like this and I'm not sure what to do here, not sure if I should do anything. She is special to me and I'm ""the best guy she's ever known"" (her words) and I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship just because I'm hung up on my ex and she is the one giving me support and attention. On the other hand, maybe deep friendships and gradually increasing connections are foundations of a long lasting relationship.

I just want to paint a full picture of the situation.    

I'm a 22 year old guy who's recently realized that I'm not as completely straight as I thought I was my entire life. I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. I'll call him JV. He's basically the perfect guy. He's very attractive and talented. He's a former model, he can sing and play a lot of instruments. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do dirty things to me.    

I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I did, but I like to take things slow, and he understood.    

He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, that he might be my perfect match and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I'm basically social inept, never been in any relationships and only been on a few dates, but this seemed like everything I was longing for. A really attractive guy really liked me. I couldn't believe it.    

I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I'm socially awkward so I've never been in a relationship before, and have only been on 3 dates so far, but this seems like something that I've been longing for for a while. The only potential issue is that we live an hour away from each other and I can't drive yet (I've taken driving lessons on and off over the years but I just have difficulty with it.)    

We videochatted a few days before we planned to go on a date. During the call, he told me that he was ""complicated"". He told me that he cheated on his previous boyfriend with older men because he has ""daddy issues"" and his ex boyfriend didn't satisfy his sexual needs, that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that he blew JV off and didn't spend time with him a lot. This made me a little nervous, especially because me and him live an hour away from each other and JV and his ex boyfriend did too.    

But when I brought up my concerns to him the next day, he assured me that he regretted cheating in his previous relationship, and sex wasn't the main reason why things didn't work out. We set up a date on a weekend, to go to a diner near me for lunch. We were texting the night before and I mentioned a first date I went on last year where the guy tried to have sex with me, and how it made me feel because I don't like to have sex on the first date. JV replied saying that maybe we should cancel the date and go our separate ways because we're too different of people.  I told him that was probably for the best, as I didn't know where we could have sex because my family lives with my stepdad and he doesn't like me, my sister or any of his kids having significant others spend the night at the house. JV said that his ex stayed over at his house when they were dating, and that his family was fine with it, so I could too.    

He asked if I'd be able to fulfill his sexual needs and I told him that I could change my sexual boundaries for him, and he said that he thinks that this relationship could work. We went on the date and it went well. He told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone for the first time, and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things. We had lunch and then we went to a nearby park and made out for a bit on a nature trail. It was my first kiss. He asked if I wanted to go further, and I said that I didn't.   

After the date, we kept texting and we planned a second date. He said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date and that if it was good, I'd be his boyfriend. We started talking about what kind of stuff we'd do to each other and sending each other nudes. He asked if I'd take him to my room to have sex on the second date, and I reminded him that I couldn't do that. He said that it had to be in his car then, which I thought was kind of strange, since the reason we were even still talking to each other was because he assured me that we could have sex at his house. His family was moving soon, but he knew about that before the night before the first date, so it wasn't like it unexpectedly came up after.    I asked him if we would wear condoms, and he said that if we were dating, that we'd only be having sex with each other, so we wouldn't have to, and also that he wanted to cum inside me. He assured me that he was clean and taking medication to prevent getting HIV.

I realized that even though I found him very attractive and he kind of drove me crazy, I didn't want to have sex on the second date. It's just too soon for me. I feel like I don't really know someone that well after talking for a few weeks and going on one date. I told him that I didn't feel like we were sexually compatible and that we should probably stop talking. He got upset, saying that I was acting like he was a sex addict and that he was hurt that I would assume that about him. I told him that I changed my mind but he said that I already made my choice, and that he couldn't be with someone who didn't know if they wanted to be with him. He then told me that his ex had been calling him recently and he's been ignoring it but now he might go back to his ex. 

We've stopped talking now, and I'm extremely frustrated with myself. This guy was so sweet to me. He was my perfect match and I completely ruined what would have been a great relationship. I've cried and gotten drunk a few times since all this happened.

After about 2 months of being friends and I was ready to tell her how I felt, she told me one day that we needed to talk and that she has a boyfriend already and she didn't know if I was interested in her was why she never thought to tell me. As expected, I was shocked because the way she related with me wasn't like someone in a relationship. A lot of people even thought we were dating. She still wanted to remain friends and she was like the only person that got me so I continued the friendship. I eventually told her about my feelings and she rejected me as nice as possible and that she already had a boyfriend.

We continued talking all through the pandemic and got closer than before, I could not handle that kind of closeness and still term it friendship. I broke things off like 3 times during the pandemic and her coming back every time. She said I was always nice to her and that she loves talking to me, and that she likes me but not in that way at the moment, plus she was still together with her bf. Finally broke things off this February and told her to just let each other be. She said 'I know what you want but I just don't see it happening anytime soon."" That was not the answer I wanted and I remained firm about us cutting contact. 

Now, it's been 5 months and nothing has really changed for me. I still like her a lot and even though we don't talk, we attend the same church and I see her every Sunday. Just seeing her and not being able to tell her how nice her dress is, how beautiful she looked and ask how she's been as just been so hard. At times, I look away and don't talk to her at all, at times I just say hi. She's reached out four times during this period. The first was to ask for an advice about her career, the second was to check up on me, the third was when the football club she supported won UCL and the last time was last week, a robbery happened in the street I live and she was checking in to ask if I was safe. I know she cares about me but it doesn't make it hurt any much less. I'm really trying my best to move on, unfollowed her on all socials, deleted her pics and number but it's just not been working. She's the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend. And I don't want her to think I'm doing any of this out of revenge or anger or anything like that. I get that she is loyal to her bf but it just sucks. 

There's also the issue of a beanie and cardigan she made for me during the pandemic and planned to give me once we resumed. Well, she hasn't and I don't even know what to make of that. I'm confused about how to handle everything in general. Should I keep looking away when I see her, should I say hi and ask about her, her birthday is coming in a few weeks, should I wish her? Or should I just regard her as someone who is no longer in my life and not give a damn about her??",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,918253,public,self,I don't know how to handle the aftermath after breaking things off,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oreym1/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_the_aftermath_after/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Last weekend I went to a backyard party at a friend's house from high school. At some point a friend of mine came up to me and told me this girl thought I was cute. So we started talking and playing drinking games together and we got along really well. She took the initiative to bring up going on some sort of date together and I got her number. 

We spent all week texting back and forth, not too crazy but we were having good conversations with actual substance to them. And there were other good cues I was getting from her that told me she is definitely into me. We set a date for Thursday and we went out to get dinner and then we were supposed to go mini golfing but we ended up talking for so long in the restaurant that the mini golf place was closed by the time we were done. 

We ended up meeting a friend of hers and going back to her house to hang out. I invited a friend at their suggestion and we were having a good time. During the night we ended up making plans to go out to a local tiki bar the next night. I texted her early in the afternoon to see what her plans were because we didn't iron out all the details yet. She got back to me a few hours later while I was at the gym. She texted me twice. Once saying what her general plan was and then a second text an hour later. Her uncle died so she was now being dropped off to be with her family. I texted her saying that I was so sorry and hope she's ok and to let me know if there was anything I could do. 

I haven't heard from her since then which was Friday and I was just wondering given our rapport so far, if I should just reach out to her at some point and say something like, ""Hey, just wanted to check in and see how you were doing in light of what happened.

I'm slim and go to the gym regularly but I'm definitely not attracted. I used to be ranked last on the lists guys used to create in school and that has kind of stayed with me through out my life.

Spoke to a friend yesterday who suggested cosmetic procedures (fillers) to try and accentuate features in my face like lips, cheekbones and nose. I think it would drastically change my life, going from the ""ugly girl"" persona to a more better looking woman.

I've been reading around subs like this one on reddit and have gathered the fact that women are placed into ""values""  by guys - every woman has a market value, you're either hot and dateable or unattractive and not so dateable, mostly used for sex. The second category doesn't sound nice to be in so trying to avoid.

All of them does that everything is over but they keep liking my posts and viewing my stories they just won't get out of my mind.

I never ever dated anyone for more than a first date  never kissed anyone never got intimate with anyone never got to express my true feelings with anyone, i have friends but no one i feel comfortable with to talk about these things.

Am i that boring? Am i that ugly ? Am i that bad of person ? Why can't anyone like me?  Why can't anyone give me a chance ?

I know this may not seem like a big deal to many people but to me it really does ,i don't want to be in a relationship just for the sake of it and to match with my friends it's really not, i just want to be in one so i can know that i am normal and that i am worthy for someone. 

I want to feel loved and wanted by someone other than my family.

i just need geniun advice and the perspective of people other than mine.
also please, just don't try to tell me that it's normal and i will eventually will find someone because BELIEVE me i know , and am sick of hearing it.

I've been dating this guy for 2 months. We met through Tinder and went on 4 dates the first 2 weeks, which all went really good, I even met his friends. We have been texting every day the past 2 months.

Then we didn't see each other for a month (he got Covid, I got ill etc.), but I started to feel he was making less of an effort to ask me to hang out, even though we still texted every day.

But last week he invited me week to a party at his house. I stayed the night at his and he told me he likes me and I said the same to him. He asked me what I'm looking for. I said I want something serious and he said he doesn't know what he wants but that he can see it going somewhere with me.

A few days after I texted him that I really like him and he said the same (again).

At the party I was talking to his best friend and she told me that she hasn't seen him being interested in someone as much as he is in me in a long time, but that his heart has been broken before.

A few days ago I finally asked him why he isn't really making an effort to see me (as in, go on dates), to which he replied that he is very busy and doesn't really know what he wants. ""He needs to take some time to figure things out and he knows it sounds shit but he doesn't want to waste my time either""

I am obviously going to respect what he said and give him the space he needs. And I'm ready to move on, but I don't wanna shut him off completely in case he does change his mind.

Here, my friend, who is the co-owner/developer of this application, just launched this in the U.S. so let me tell you why I’d love to recommend this to all of you.

I believe most of us who use dating application may sometimes feel sick of swiping and swiping and then waiting for someone to match with. Sometimes, that someone may have different view of life from you and the conversation just dies down. This goes on and on but why you have to waste time on this?

If you value your potential partner’s attitude more than anything else, « Ansxer » is the answer. Here how it works:

1. You can download the application from ansxer.com
2. Create your profile and set up/select up to 10 questions that you would like to ask others (can be both MCQ and Q&amp;A)
3. Once you like someone, you swipe right and then you will be asked to answer his/her questions
4. That someone will not see your profile picture. Only answers will be displayed unless they like you back and tadaaa it’s a match!
5. Now, time to start your convo.

Who knows, love at first conversation can start here 😉 (at least, it happens to me)

Feel free to share this post and give comment/feedback so that we can enhance that. We’re really excited and would love to hear from you!

I’m a 18 yo guy with 0 confidence. I have a passion ( cinema and screenwriting) and i kind of study it right now.

I generally don’t adapt to what others want, if that would led to betray myself. So, i’m always myself, or at least I try.

But here’s the problem: I’ve never been in a relationship and I don’t really think i’ll ever will. 

I also got absolutely 0 confidence in how i look, despite i’m tall ( I can send you some pics of me in dms if you want me to )

I’ve seen this dude’s videos on Youtube ( ThatWasEpic is the channel’s name )… he’s an handsome blonde ( and tall ) guy that has so much confidence that he approaches girls on the streets. And usually gets numbers too. I know that maybe my country is way more strict and diffident ( nobody wants to be approached especially on the streets ) but i felt very bad while i was watching his videos. It gave me so much anxiety that I started to doubt about my future… does a guy REALLY have to approach random girls like that? Just to be in a relationship?

So maybe I shouldn't even be thinking about him because he deserves someone who's more on his level and probably timeline. If I lived within an hours distance, I'd date him in a heartbeat. At this point, I'm just going to throw in the white towel. Cause it shouldn't be this hard right?  Tell me to give up and I'll stop thinking about him. I doubt he thinks about me like that. Purely because he's busy doing stuff and I need to carry on the same and stop daydreaming about him and comparing the guys my girlfriend shows me to him and not being interested at all lol.

We talked for like 2 weeks on the app till i decided to ask for his snap. From there we were texting everyday for like a month all together, he would be asking me about how my day was, what i was up to, and also asking questions about me (and I him). If I wouldn't answer (not on purpose but because i felt it was dead) he would message again with another convo starter.

Now it has slowed down alot. Now we have convos like every 2-3 days but he sends me snaps everyday but doesn't always respond to my responses. Or when I send him snaps like he does he doesnt always respond, even if i'm saying something that garners a response. This led to me asking him does he actually plan on trying (bc we may not clique IRL) to be actual friends or does he just want a texting buddy because I assumed he was doing a slow fade/ghosting.

Also, i'm not pursuing a relationship with this guy ATM. Idk if I want him casually or as something more, but is something I plan on figuring out irl and not rn.

So does that mean he is actually interested in seeing where it goes but is just waiting for me to get there ?

I struggled with picking the right guy my whole life. About 3 months ago, I met a guy who I thought was a wonderful fit for me. Same morals, same religious beliefs, same interests. We spent so much time together and I quickly fell in love. He said he was in love too, and often told me that. 

He left me a couple days ago and I’m in shambles. He told me he didn’t feel anything for me anymore and that during sex (I gave my virginity to him) he felt nothing for me. He said he could’ve orgasmed just the same on his own and that I did nothing for him. I was distraught. I could’ve sworn I saw love in his eyes when he looked at me, and I really believed all the compliments and encouragements he gave me. He says it all wasn’t true. How can you have sex with someone who you’ve put so much emotional investment into (especially when YOU ask for it) and not feel anything? 

The reasons all shift; he doesn’t love me anymore, the spark died, sex wasn’t what he thought it was, our relationship doesn’t make him happy, he doesn’t emotionally connect with me. The last one hits hard because I did everything I could to be a better person with him. I listened to everything he ever asked of me and respected his feelings. When he said to change something because it wasn’t working for him, I did. I did everything I could to support him and I spent hundreds of dollars on him trying to make him understand how special he was to me.

And maybe I should’ve known. I felt a bit defensive and nervous after our first time, and I think it’s because on a subconscious level I knew he was a liar. I did too much too fast because I thought he could be “the one,” but apparently this was just a fling. That might be crazy to some of you, that I felt so certain about him, but I can’t explain it. It just felt so right with him.

I just want to know why, if it wasn’t serious for him, he said all that shit about taking me home to his family and confessing his love to me. He knew he didn’t feel the same way but he still called every night and fed into my belief that he truly loved me. It really just breaks my heart that I gave my virginity to a guy who didn’t even appreciate it.

To top it all off, I found out he was giving my abusive ex tips on how to get in bed with me after we broke up. He even said he sympathized with him. He always told me how bad my ex was to me and how I deserved better. Guess those were lies, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I (m38) am newly divorced after being married for 20 years. I thought I had a happy marriage but I was being cheated on repeatedly. My ex wife blamed my agoraphobia and the impact it had on her life for her cheating on me. She cheated on me with her boss....her best friends husband.....dads from our kids school and various others.  Eventually I had to end the marriage because of this. To be cheated on because of an illness you can not help is soul destroying and it completely took my confidence away. 

Thats my problem. Around 15 years ago I developed Agoraphobia. I would really like to meet a woman to have a real relationship.....but being agoraphobic is not exactly a turn-on I am finding.

So if I do an online dating profile, do I put in it that I suffer with this illness and it does impact my life? I figure what is the point lying? If I hide it and then decide to meet with someone I meet online....I think they are going to clock on pretty quickly. So is it best to be upfront?

Or....

As it seems to be such a turn-off, am I better off trying to build up a rapport with someone and getting to like each other and then drop it in down the line somewhere? hopefully by that point they will like me enough not to care.

So last night I matched with someone who ive crushed on for a while (from school) on Tinder, I usually remove these matches out of embarrassment but this same chick had already done it before and now we matched again, I was too shy to send first message but she did, and now she’s asking for the snap. Now Ik this sounds like a no brainier but I’m scared of a few things:

- I used to talk to one of her best mates but I got friendzoned (but yk when u actually become friends) and have been fairly close with her since, but we barely actually meet and not at all since covid. I don’t care if she says anything about me cuz she ain’t like that it’s just if something goes wrong I could piss off this friend (she’s rly defensive around her friend group) and I could possibly end up not being mates anymore.

- some of my friends don’t particularly like her, not like either her or them did anything she just has a strange sense of humour and comes off a little weird. Again they aren’t dicks or anything but my best friend is hopeless when he’s drunk, always says stupid shit so I’d always be on edge if those two were in the same room

- Idek if this chick knows that we live so close and went to the same school n shit off my Tinder profile alone - she doesn’t rly know me that well.

I’m not rly worried about any of this for my sake it’s just Ik she suffers from pretty bad Anxiety and I rly don’t want to hurt her feelings in any way cuz I rly do like her.
