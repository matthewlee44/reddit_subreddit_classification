0,qf04an,1635106304,"i’m a 23f with no dating experience. guys, is this a turn off?","pretty much what the title says. i’m 23 and i’ve never even kissed a guy before or gone on any dates. reasons being religious indoctrination, and the fact that i was super focused on my achievements in school. plus i’m more of an introvert, and this pandemic has not helped me make friends at all. i don’t have a lot of friends in general, let alone guy friends, but i’m hoping as things get better i’ll be able to get out more. 

i’ve spent a lot of time by myself and tbh i’m quite comfortable being alone. i’ve been to therapy and done my healing and i’d consider myself to be happy. i’m not desperate for a relationship but i think i’m ready to try dating. 

i’m not saving myself for marriage or anything but i’m not into causal dating/sex. being that this is my first relationship i think i would have to take things slowly so that i don’t get overwhelmed. anyways, would the fact that i’ve never been in a relationship be a turn off?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf04an/im_a_23f_with_no_dating_experience_guys_is_this_a/

2,qf0etw,1635107169,Asking guy from dorm to set me up with his friend,"
So before the college semester started, my RA gave me and the guys on my dorm floor a tour of the campus. One of the guys I knew from my floor brought two girls with him and there was one I found really attractive and I only talked to her for a tiny bit. The thing is I thought the guy was dating her so I didn’t really bring the conversation further. Ever since then I’ve been passing her by on campus and making eye contact with her, but I’m too scared to talk to her because she is always with friends and I doubt she would remember me from the tour and it’s now midterms. I also know she is not the girlfriend of the guy from my dorm, because he always brings a girl with him back to his dorm every night. I’m thinking I can ask the guy on my dorm floor if he can set me up with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf0etw/asking_guy_from_dorm_to_set_me_up_with_his_friend/
3,qf0gbf,1635107296,Should I continue talking to him?,"We went out on a few dates after not seeing each other for five years. We never were together, just friends who would catch up every now and then. We met back in college. Now we are in our mid to late twenties. Our friends who were dating tried setting us up. He saw a picture of me and wanted to meet me. He reached out to me two years ago and we were texting almost everyday. He would send me good morning texts and asked me how my day was. He then came back to my state to visit his friend and I asked if we could go out to dinner and drinks. I wasn’t expecting it to be a date but we kissed a lot and it was a great date. We then went on a walk the following day and we danced and kissed and opened up. I felt really great after those dates and it felt very mutual if that makes sense. Usually I like the guy and he doesn’t like me or he likes me and I don’t like him. 

Anyways, he goes back to his state and invited me multiple times to see him. This was when Covid first started and I was terrified when the pandemic broke out. I explained to him I wanted to wait until things got better. He said he understood. We would still talk and FaceTime every once in a while. Weeks later he told me he’s moving to a farther state. He would continue to invite me but I kept saying no because I was a scared of the pandemic. He’s invited me to thanksgiving, a family members services, to events, etc etc. and I kept saying no because of the pandemic. I would send him a selfie and he would call me up just to say how beautiful I was in it. He even called me the next morning when his family member died. 

We eventually went our separate ways. He got a girlfriend and they broke up months ago. I’m not sure why they broke up. He then reached out to me again. And since then we have been talking he invited me to see him again but I had legit plans so I wasn’t able to. I am vaccinated and much more comfortable going out to places and seeing people. He mentioned he’s coming back to my state a few times for weddings. I suggested we meet the next time he is here and he said he won’t have time since he’s staying here for such a short time. But he explained that he misses me and wants to see me. I noticed that he followed his ex fling from a little over a year ago. He told me in the past they didn’t work out and he couldn’t see a future with her. I’m just confused, is that a bad sign?

I’m 26m and have suffered from pretty bad anxiety and depression most of my life. It’s extremely difficult for me to meet new people and go on dates. During quarantine I finally decided I wanted to start dating again (after a really rough break up a few years ago) and after searching for a very long time, I finally found someone I really really like. From the first moment we matched we have been talking nonstop and laughed a ton.. it just feels “right” for the first time in my life. 

With all of that being said she is 29(F) from China, and she has mentioned that she is hoping for marriage within a year or two in order to stay in the country. I’m absolutely ready for marriage at this time in my life and have been looking for someone serious who wants the same, but within a year or so seems extremely fast for me, and I worry (although it doesn’t seem the case at all) that she will marry for citizenship and lost interest afterwards. As I mentioned, I suffer from horrible anxiety and have only been in 2 relationships ever (both lasted a long time and ended poorly.. essentially me being cheated on). I want to give people the benefit of the doubt and it very well can just be my nerves because we really do get along amazingly. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

What should I do?","Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this, I'm just looking for some advice. Also, I am on the autism spectrum, and struggle quite a bit at reading social cues so forgive me if I seem to be missing something obvious.

I (M20) am a student in my first year of university in the UK. For a few weeks now I have become quite good friends with a girl (F18) who is on my course and I also share quite a few of my classes with her.

She is an international student from the US, and I find her very intelligent, funny, pretty and just pleasant to be around generally, very easy to talk too. I think we get along quite well and she seems to like spending time with me (I can't figure out why, but I don't want to push my luck). She has even been teaching me some of her native language after classes after I asked her if she would be willing too (Swedish, her family is originally from there). We also, along with a mutual friend, carved some pumpkins for halloween at her place and have been on a few nights out together.

I like being friends with her, but more and more I feel like I am becoming romantically attracted to her, but I don't want to ask her out, mainly out of fear it would ruin the friendship if she didn't feel the same way. The unfortunate thing is she asked me, along with 2 other mutual friends (both girls btw), if I wanted to pitch in to rent a flat/apartment for the next academic year and I agreed. We'll be looking at potential places in the next few weeks. I am looking forward to it, but it also just complicates things even more.

On one hand I don't want to risk the friendship or make her think I was being friends just to try and get with her, I really like her just as a person and want to continue that at all costs. But on the other I'm afraid of missing out on a chance like this just out of fear, I feel like we have so much in common.

This is super embarrassing kinda because I feel like such a child feeling like I can’t do this anymore because he doesn’t wash his shorts?? 

* please note: I’m on my phone so excuse any mistakes and weird template - Let’s get right into it: 

I’m a female 27, he’s .. male 26. Let’s call him Mike. We work for a really big nationwide company and that’s where we met. We’ve only been “talking” / dating for a little over 2 months and I haven’t felt the need that it should be taken to the next level (relationship) yet. Our dating has consisted of multiple breakfast / lunch / dinner dates, watching movies, etc. And oral. No sex yet though. 

Let me be clear and say this guy has a clean penis (as far as a scent goes and it’s a great size) but boy are his pubes longer than anything I’ve seen but still doesn’t smell that bad so I know this isn’t a std or whatever other UTI thing. 

I get whiffs of his shorts when he’s sitting next to me or we’re cuddling and it turns me the hell off. We are GROWN. This guy truly doesn’t wash his shorts. 

So I’ve turned him down the last couple of times because I can’t go near his shorts without gagging, I’m so turned off by it. I know that the adult thing to do is to talk to him about it, cause it maybe be an easy resolve. Right. 

It’s just I don’t know how to tell him this in the nicest way: 
• Honey, your shorts don’t smell pleasant. Pls. 
• Mike, I’m really into you but I have to let you know .. 
• I’ve noticed your shorts smell like urine, can I help with laundry? 
 
You guys get my point. 
Please understand I’m not trying to be mean or make fun of him. But I truly don’t look forward to seeing him anymore (we fucking click) because I can’t wrap my head around an adult reeking of piss and not smelling it?? Like dude you stink like a bathroom whose walls have been pissed on multiple times. 

I wish I was joking. I wish I was exaggerating. 

Can someone advise?

Is there a better way to approach this?","I am crystal clear on my boundaries to try and save anyone from wasted time or frustration. I usually just drop it into the conversation (before the first date) with something like, “I know people use OLD for a variety of things, so just to let you know where I’m at, I don’t have sex outside of a committed relationship and am looking for something long-term. I’m not looking for a quick commitment by any means, I just want to be sure our intentions are compatible and those boundaries are okay.” 

Enter a guy I started seeing, after discussing personal intentions and boundaries. He was so nice on our first date, super respectful and responsive, agreed with my boundaries, etc. We got to date 2 and it ended with him saying, “I want to sleep with you. I don’t want to commit (which is fine, I think committing after only one week of talking and 2 short dates is way too quick), and honestly most guys won’t wait like you’re wanting. I don’t want to wait, and you’re going to have a hard time finding someone who will. Sex could bring us closer, can’t we focus on that?” 

I just feel discouraged, as this isn’t the first time it’s been like this. I know what I am comfortable with isn’t for everyone, but that's why I lay it out before anyone spends money/time with me and before I start liking someone who wants different things. 

I have had a few dating phases of just wanting sex and just got it out of my system, it's not about shaming anyone for wanting to have sex/have sex earlier than I currently feel comfortable with, either. 

I just feel discouraged and stupid, I guess.

Think about how the frat guys and star athletes got with all the girls while all the other guys got left out in the cold. So when women are older they find themselves meeting men who have no experience with women and I’m surprised how they couldn’t see this coming. If you reject the vast majority of guys for a select portion of the male population that all the other girls also hook up with then of course there’s going to be lots of guys with no experience. I guess women literally didn’t even notice guys outside that very small portion of guys they hooked up with.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf2k7q/arent_women_setting_themselves_up_to_be_let_down/

36,qf2l38,1635113771,[UPDATE] Had my first kiss this Sunday!!! (23M),"Previously on this first post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbxxec/had\_my\_first\_kiss\_this\_sunday\_23m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbxxec/had_my_first_kiss_this_sunday_23m/)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok guys and girls, because a lot of you asked me about an update after this Friday's date, well, I just can't help it ;) (and also I love sharing stories) so here you got. Second date.

&amp;#x200B;

We met this Friday afternoon and went to a bar because I wanted her to taste a beer I really like, so we went there immediately (btw we hugged when we met). Zero nervousness, absolutely calm (she was too). Also, I didn't remember she was THAT beautiful, I swear she has an angel face. 

We arrived to the bar, ordered and sat down, and we started chatting lots of things (studies, work, etc...) and we spent almost 1 hour and a half there, just talking. On the first date, if you remember, she drove a public car you can rent in the city centre, so it was my turn. We left the bar, just before I remembered I didn't pay the beers by absolute accident, so I told her and we started running away from the bar and laughing lots. I swear it was like some romcom kind of scene hahahaha.

After that, we took the car and I drove for an hour and a half, just going around the city and enjoying that evening drive, laughing and singing to the songs the radio was playing. Super fun time.

Therefore, I parked the car and then we went for a walk near a river in my town. At that moment, I showed her my hand and told her ""Give me yours"" and she didn't hesitate at all to give me hers. During that walk, we didn't stop holding hands and I was like ""Wooooooooooowwww"". Absolute cloud nine I swear.

She needed to go to the same bus station as the last bus was leaving earlier (because we weren't on weekend yet), so we went to the subway in order to go to that bus station. During the whole time we were on the subway, I put my arm around her and she put her head in my chest, started caressing my leg while I was caressing her hair. I told before I was on cloud nine, now I was on cloud eighteen lmao.

We arrived to the bus station, and as we got earlier than the bus, we sat ourselves in a bench waiting for it to arrive. It was really cold around here, I was feeling real freezing, so I told her and instantly hugged her again while we were on the bench. During that, we were talking and as soon as there was a short moment of silence, I grabbed her face carefully and started making out with her. Same feeling as the first one (OMG!!!!!). This one was more passionate than the first one, as we were making out for a longer time (but it was still really short, needing more of it hahaha) and got ourselves real close and cuddling each other. Cloud twenty-seven.

After making out (still didn't know what I was doing lol), we saw ourselves eye-to-eye, she smiled and she put her head in my chest again, hugging each other. Only to realize myself that the bus was waiting to leave, pity. I told her, we stood, and when we arrived to the bus, we hugged and then I told her to wait a moment, and put her mask down and stole again a kiss (becoming an expert in that lmao), and then she picked it up.

Honestly mates, I'm blown away and I feel like I'm day-dreaming absolutely. Just a few weeks ago I was on the verge of absolute sadness due to thinking myself I was going to be alone all my life (even though I was already chatting with this girl). Now I succesfully accomplished these two dates with her, having one of the best moments in my life. Now I understand that caption that says ""You'll never know what comes around the corner"". What a 180 turn.

We are planning to go eat sushi since she wants to go to a restaurant in my town, so there it goes. We have some exams real close, so we will date as soon as possible. 

This is the update mates, hope you enjoy it and like it! Oh, and also thank you soooooo much for the support, advices and congrats you people gave me.

TL;DR: After the date where I had my first kiss ever with this girl, we went for a second date. We had a drink (zero cost haha), we drove, we laughed a lot, we held hands while going for a walk, we cuddled on the sub, we made out at the end. My second kiss ever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf2l38/update_had_my_first_kiss_this_sunday_23m/

I still am not sure how I stumbled upon his actual relationship status. But I even figured out who she (f21) is by pretty much an accident and ended up talking to her. She was sweet, gave me lots of information about him and what I needed to do to make sure I was safe. (Since he has a major std) She let me know they live together, he uses her car on a daily basis. I explained to her how we met and how he was telling me how strongly he felt about me, showing her receipts as well. 

She offered to take me out for drinks or something just to talk more and possibly become friends. I said sure and told her I would let her know when would work for me. They’re still together I believe which is none of my concern.  But I still had recently texted her letting her know I had went to go get tested and am waiting for results. She never responds, then the guy texts me no more than five minutes later asking if we could talk. I said “sure as long as we’re in a group chat with your girlfriend” he said no and proceeded to block me again. But now I am getting texts from random numbers saying various vulgar things. I left them both alone after those previous messages were sent. I have a strong gut feeling that it’s him making numbers to mess with me but it could also be either of their friends.

In the show Jessica had a type ( rock star guys) but she went against her type and married an intellectual academic and eventually their relationship exploded. Now this started ringing alarm bells in my brain, because before me my gf also had a type- creative people like singers, drummers, artists and one painter. On the other hand she never dated a corporate professional like me. Thats a red flag for our relationship, right?

Do people really have a type and if they date outside their type will the relationship succeed? I am starting to get really attached to her so I am thinking its better to get out before getting too attached as it will hurt a lot more. But on the other hand she does really seem to like me and always wants to hang out with me. And I also like her a lot. So I am confused now.

I don't drink because I'm opposed to it or anything like that even though I've have an alcoholic for a dad but it's just that I've never needed to, most of the time I was either the DD or just that a lot of the friends I'd go out with are muslim so they never drank either.

65,qf4ejw,1635119794,What does this man want from me?,"I could know this guy on an online dating app. We personally met because he was on holiday where I am actually living.

He decided he wanted to come here again, he told me I was important for him.

We organised a week on holiday together, nearby where I am currently living, but in places which were new also for me.

It was going perfectly, he was really like ""drunk"" of me. I have never seen such a behavior in a guy. He was really highly connected and emotionally involved, much more than me. He could see me like somebody to protect, to have children with, to take enormously and extremely care of.

An evening I decided that we could have sex, but I told him that I was not sure because I did not want to have sex with somebody I was not sure to see again. He suddenly stopped and changed his behaviour. He started to tell me that because of the distance it would be very hard to meet again. I asked why he did not think about it before. For me the distance was not a restriction but for him yes. If I could know this in advance I would had refused to have a vacation with him.

I realised he did not want to see me again from that night I told him about having sex only at a a condition. This changed all, not the distance. But he was emotionally bound and asked me to be friends. He is also physically very attracted.

I asked about what was going wrong with me and he made a list of things lacking in my personality. I told that I needed more time in order to externalise part of the aspects he listed and to know him more.

The last day of our vacation I was surprised about with how many girls he flirted while walking next to me, so disrespectful. I left his hand and started to look at guys and he immediately started to hug me in a possessive way.

Now he is back home. The first days was quite active in sending me messages and wanted still to play nice jokes. I disappeared in the weekend because he became quite passive in replying me. Today he was also quite short in his answers.

Why is he still in contact with me if he does not want to meet me anymore? Why did he change idea and decided to not meet me anymore if he likes me, he is emotionally bound and physically attracted?

66,qf4jq3,1635120266,"I stopped using dating apps and started putting myself out there, and I thought my experience might inspire some of you:","26F, like many of you guys I've had very poor luck with dating, especially dating apps. 

Over the past year, I've really begun to work on myself. I started working out, got into therapy, began a few side hustles for extra $, cut off a few bad friends. Everything independently with me has improved, but still I've had trouble with dating. Getting flaked on, ghosted, stood up, etc etc etc... 

My therapist gave me ""homework"" a few weeks ago to go to a few new places a week, even if only for an hour or so, and strike up a conversation with people. Half of them could be people I'm physically attracted to, but half of them had to be people I wasn't. 

Over the past few weeks, I've been doing just that. I started by going to places during their less busy hours, and not just on Fri/Sat night. I went to a few happy hours, an LGBT+ drag show (I'm bi), a karaoke bar, an open mic night comedy club, a workout class, etc. 

I'm a very introverted person, so at first this was honestly a daunting task. I also definitely felt like people would perceive me as ""the weird girl"" going to some of these places alone. Still, I bit the bullet and tried it anyway. 

And then I realized a few things: 

* When it came to starting conversations with people, most people were way more receptive than I thought. I would simply ask people how their day/night was going and if a topic clicked, suddenly they were the ones feeding off my energy. Not just people into me either - I was laughing with this older woman and how her husband drags her to sports games, talked with a gay guy for an hour about how him and his husband met and gay culture, just a few examples. People LOVE talking about themselves, and when you're interested instead of just trying to be interesting, people will latch on. 

* People generally care way less about you than you'd think. Most people aren't looking at you at any random place and thinking you're a loser who doesn't have any friends. Most people are just minding their own business, and even if someone asks you if you're alone, saying you're waiting for friends or they're meeting up with you is a very common thing.

* When it came to people I WAS attracted to, I approached them the same way I did the people I wasn't, and wasn't goal-oriented. I got a few numbers that haven't gone anywhere, but I still found this method way more successful. A few people were into me but I realized I didn't vibe with their personalities. But I still feel the conversations I've had with people were way more sincere. I got to know WAY more about people I was attracted to over the course of 2 weeks than YEARS on dating apps. I feel the conversations had more value, and on top of that I'm learning to be a better in-person connector and not just rely on a screen. In a way, I almost felt like I've been on more ""dates"" by going out and talking to people, vs on dating apps where I was constantly getting flaked on and wasting so many more hours swiping and endlessly chatting. 

* You can meet people almost anywhere that's social. This idea that no one wants people they don't know ever to talk to them is a huge myth. People don't want to be bothered at the grocery store or walking down the street, and women especially don't want some random only talking to them with the intent of having sex. But people want to make new connections, people want friendships, people want relationships. It's all truly about being socially calibrated and not trying to force a conversation if it becomes obvious someone doesn't want to talk to you.

I know the pushback will likely be that because I'm a woman, of course it's easier. And yes, I'd agree to an extent. But I also took pointers on being more charasmatic from one of my friends who is a bit older, chubby guy in his late 30s. I've watched him light up a room with his energy; this man and many others I know have no problem making connections by being very social and genuinely interested in everyone. 

TLDR; This post isn't to say dating apps can't work for some, I realize they're very convienent and if you enjoy them, cool! 

But if you're one of the people, like me, who felt like you've been wasting years of your life endlessly swiping and swiping and getting flake after flake after flake with not even as much as a date to show for it, maybe this post can inspire you to try another method. 

I know we're living in an era where it seems connections can only be found online, but I promise you people are still out and about and the apps are not the only places you can search for love. 

It might seem daunting initially, but I do believe it also builds a tougher skin and increases the quantity of connections you can make, which by pure statistics will increase your quality eventually.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf4jq3/i_stopped_using_dating_apps_and_started_putting/
67,qf4q4h,1635120885,Is she flirting with me or am I just funny?,"So I (21M) met this girl a week ago at my (now former) job. She (23F) was my actual replacement. A more attractive replacement but a replacement nonetheless lol. We have a lot of common interest and bounce off of each other pretty well. She made my last shift more enjoyable than it should’ve been. Near the end of the shift, she said that I was funny and that it was too bad that I was leaving today. I took that an invitation to ask her for her socials or number. She gave me her Instagram. 

She gave it to me, so that’s a good sign right. She posted something on her story Monday and I made a stupid little joke that she seemed to appreciate. After that, this we’ve been talking on and off all week. 

Idk if these are good signs but:

- She uses a lot of emojis

- Laughs at pretty much all of my jokes. (A lot of “Lmaoooo” and “Lol” in the chat)

- I said this clever comment about her looks that I was pretty proud of. She laughed and said “thank you”. 

- We talk about family life and aspirations (but nothing really personal)

- She doesn’t really reply in a timely fashion. Then again, I don’t either. We’re both pretty busy and motivated people. I just sort of match her when it comes to that. When she does reply, it’s never anything low effort. 

There’s a horror movie that we want to see but I heard that it’s not really an ideal first date. So I’m trying to get to know here more before I ask. My backup date is that we go to a haunted house or bowling.

68,qf4qzl,1635120969,Update on Girl who Ended our 'Almost-a-Serious-Relationship' - She suggested FWB,"Some of you may remember my post from a days back - [Prior Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbhmka/girl_i_was_seeing_for_35_months_ended_it_a_week/hhomgru/?context=3)

**Short Story** \- I got a firm answer that the potential is just **not** there for us anymore after dating her for \~3 months. I'm perplexed, the feelings were there and it was mutual for so long but suddenly vanished for her. One day she felt this wouldn't work, and had to end it.

After two weeks of no contact, I called her to see if it was a pacing issue and she said no, she just didn't see us moving forward and then suggested FWB (I firmly said no to friends).

**Context -** this girl has lots of sexual/mental trauma from past relationship. She felt very comfortable while I was dating her (especially sexually). She'd often say we had strong sexual chemistry. To be clear, there isn't another guy(s) that I was competing with either. We openly talked about that.

**Current Feelings -** Anyway, I accepted the offer for now cause I figured I had nothing to lose (maybe a bit of self-respect lol). We met up and we had an incredible time, as expected. We set some rules and **she was very transparent about her lack of feelings towards me**. I've mostly accepted the outcome and am ready to move on but it made me feel sick. 

How is she capable of turning them off so quickly? We even talked about how we liked each other and how I compared to other guys. She claimed I'm perfect, with the best qualities. WTF???

**Question -** I think my problem was, I revealed that I liked her too soon while we were seeing each other. I wasn't a challenge anymore. I still care for her, and she cares about me too but likes me as a friend.. Is there any chance this FWB thing could reignite the potential? Maybe there's something I need to really work on. I did literally everything right...

**Regardless, I'm back on Hinge.** She wants me to find someone else to date and I said the same to her. But 1% of me hopes this could reignite things..

**tl;dr -** I was ready to walk away but girl suggests FWB since we had strong sexual/physical chemistry that she's never felt before. Any chance of relationship in the future?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf4qzl/update_on_girl_who_ended_our/

Now onto the actual post. I moved halfway across the country in June and have struggled to make friends and find dates. Things were going great for me for a while. I had a decent job for the first time in years but because of my food allergies I was pushed out of the field I have training and experience in. 

I'm no longer able to work in food service and now having a difficult time finding a job. I'm a single parent and thankfully have amazing parents that are helping to support my daughter and I while I search for a job and go back to school to get specialized training in a different field.

As a 28 year old I feel like this should be the end of the road for my potential with dating, especially since so many people on here think that it's too much trouble to date someone who doesn't have their shit together.

I've never been a picky date. Always been willing to plan cheap or free dates and am generally in it to find a life partner, but I feel guilty putting myself out there knowing that I'm in a rough spot and not knowing when I'll break free of it.

80,qf5qtm,1635124351,I want to cut off all intimacy,"I am definitely overweight but by no means ugly, 
I gained alot of weight while being on mood stabilizers and anti depressants over the last 7 year and had some tests done and seems they've done some good damage as I now have the metabolism with the speed of an average 63 year old (I'm 29) so losing weight is anything but easy for me. It's something that really kills me as my ex was very verbally and emotionally abusive.. he would force me to exercise for hours and tell me how fat I am and that he was never attracted to me as no one could ever be but I am a good person and that's why he chose me but he has to think of his ex when we have sex because I'm just so gross. I eventually ended up in hospital with extreme somatic symptoms and had what I'd call a breakdown. He then left one day back to his country without even a discussion. So the fat thing is a huge trigger and kills me..
My new partner has straight out told me I was fat. We met on tinder and he told me that I was definitely ""rounder"" in person and hinted that I deceived him which is insane since my profile said in a very not so subtle but humourous way that I was fat. When I mentioned this he just asked then why can't he use the word fat when I did.
He's made remarks about a shirt not being his as he didn't recognise it and when I said that it was definitely not mine he insisted that it must be, I said that perhaps it's his exs shirt and he scoffed and said that his ex would never need to wear an extra large. 
He has pointed out fat under my knee and asked what was wrong with my legs.
And tonight he told me he'd be happier if I was thinner.
I'm not a lazy person....I have a 6 month old baby...I clean all day....I'm painting his place myself...I never stop working and watching our baby. I have severe chronic back pain that's been around for years, I'm on 3 schedule 5 pain meds to control it and I'm still in excruciating pain ALL day. also, my pregnancy was so extremely difficult as I had Hyperemesis Gravidarum. I've had a really tough 2 years but I'm not lazy and I work hard all day.. I work through pain that brings tears to my eyes. I have no time for myself ....no time to even pee some days. I barely find time to drink a full glass of anything and my health and mental health is definitely in the decline. 
He has now gotten into the habit of trying to push me into going to a 2 hour boxing class every day as well as telling me to do yoga. The more I explain that I'm in pain and the doctor said that the disk's in my back are too inflamed to exercise, the more he just then suggests yoga. 
I don't have any time for myself at all and now I need to on top of a full day of watching the baby, cleaning, painting, making dinner etc all while on the verge of tears. Because of the insane amount of pain I'm in, I must now go do more and do high intensity training for two hours because I'm fat. I've never felt anything negative about him or the way he looks. No one is perfect but he's always been perfect to me. 
Am I wrong to feel absolutely sad and depressed about this?
I'm considering taking illegal weight loss drugs even though I know it is incredibly unhealthy and even banned in the country just to lose enough weight that I don't feel absolutely disgusting every single day of my life...
It's incredibly hard to know that you're not what your partner wants.
Ive been extremely suicidal lately and this isn't helping.
I don't think I want to be intimate with my partner anymore 
I feel too bad about myself and I know that for him he will only ever want me out of pure desperation, he will never look at me and think I'm beautiful and desirable unless I'm thin.

I know it’s not healthy to depend on your partner Bc I barely have friends but I just wanna hang out with for a whole day(I never did that before) maybe from 5pm-12am (that was when we first started dating )though I had to ask him why we only go out at 5pm but he says I’m draining. I like to bother him and my energy is pretty high but that’s mostly Bc we don’t do anything couple like barely kisses barely hugs I’m only one that does them. Never held hands walking I don’t want to do everything I want him to do it to me to. We had multiple talks about how I want to be loved on but nothing clicked I’m screaming at myself inside like CUT YOUR LOSSES but the other side like I don’t wanna.

85,qf60cu,1635125292,What Does It Mean if a Guy's Girlfriend is In The Hospital But He Asks Me To Cuddle?,"I have a huge crush on my roommate (a guy). He's lived with me for a few months.

He devastatingly has a girlfriend who he's been with for 2 years and I see them together hugging, at the beach, on dinner dates, etc. on Facebook.

They also talk on the phone for hours everyday.

It's really frustrating because I have a HUGE crush on this guy and have been working really hard to do my hair/makeup for him and get him to notice me. 

Unfortunately he never asks me out, the only place he's taken me is to get a drink 1 minute down the street. I also have nothing to talk about with him whereas his girlfriend went to high school with him so they have lots more to chat about.

Anyway I was feeling bad until he told me his GF was in the hospital last weekend. He then texted me asking to watch a movie in his room. He asked me to cuddle but I stupidly said NO, feeling bad about his GF.

The next day his GF was over!!! And locked myself in my room, depressed and lonely.

Could this mean he secretly likes me more than his GF? And how can I get him to take me out for actual dates/break up with her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf60cu/what_does_it_mean_if_a_guys_girlfriend_is_in_the/
86,qf60mt,1635125321,Advice,"I’m generally trying to figure out if I’m being selfish or if this guy is right. So a guy that I’ve been dating for a little over 3 months spilled something in the floor. He asked me if I had anything that he could clean it up with so I go over there and see if the spill was on the carpet or wood floor. He gets upset and says, “why are you going over there, I didn’t tell you to go over there, I asked you a question.” And I tell him I was just looking to see were the spill was to see what I would offer to clean with. So then I go to the kitchen to look for some cleaning supplies that I felt was safe to use on the wood floor. I didn’t see anything so I said don’t worry about it. I’ll just clean it with a damp paper towel. And as I’m going to clean it up he’s like telling me, that he didn’t ask me to clean it and that he could of done that himself and he’s honestly mad. I told him it was fine like I know it was an accident but he was really mad. He started saying he’s a grown man and he can clean up after himself and that I need to start respecting him as a man and I owe him an apology… so I told him to leave my house because I wasn’t gonna have him mad about a spill that wasn’t even that serious and I saw nothing wrong with cleaning.

87,qf6680,1635125843,Does this interaction mean I was considered unattractive?,"My friend and I were dancing in the club on the dance floor. Two guys asked her if they wanted to join/dance with their group and talked to her for like a whole 10-15 seconds (which is pretty long for a party context) before talking to me to get my name, etc. I don’t know why they didn’t approach me first, or why they waited so long to talk to me. I feel like they just did this out of courtesy so I wouldn’t feel left out. Granted, she was drunk and was dancing much more enthusiastically/happily and I was sober and was already feeling self conscious about what people thought of my looks, but I can’t help but feel like the real reason is because she was pretty to them and I was unattractive. Both of us are young 20’s, fit, and dressed nicely, I think her face is so cute but mine is weird so no matter now nice my body is and how much I work out, maybe that turns people away. 

I walked away for a second to take a breather cause I just felt really humiliated, then Idk I felt really emotional and angry and came back to ask one of the guys why he ignored me. He said he didn’t recall that but he’s sorry if they did. He then tried to ask to dance and said I was cute as hell, but I truly think that’s just consolation/pity because it’s clear I felt left out and if he really thought I was so cute he would have approached me first during that encounter. He just seems to be saying this after the fact. They call everyone cute anyways to coax them to dance with them. I asked if he thought I was ugly and he said no, but I realize that’s a dumb question to ask because who would tell a person to their face even if they actually believed it? I feel like if he truly didn’t think I was ugly the answer would be something incredulous like “Are you kidding? How could you think that?” Finally I asked if he thought my best friend was prettier, to which he said ”I’m not going to compare”After which he said “no” after I asked one more time. 

I think my behavior was regrettable and I’ll admit I think I have some emotional and mental issues to work on, and am working on finding a therapist for my self esteem. But in the mean time, the fact that they talked to me only after talking to my friend for some time, his lack of incredulity when I asked if I was ugly, and him saying it’s rude to compare (very PC response) is telling me that I really am unattractive to them, but he just didn’t want to say the truth to my face, and any compliments were just lies/consolation cause he’s probably desperate would rather go after me than have nobody. Im wondering if this interaction means I should lower my standards and I’m not as pretty as I think (I thought I was about equal to my friend and we’re pretty in different ways, she’s more slender and I’m more thick, w/ 35-27.5-39 measurements, etc.)Is this how you would have answered someone you found unattractive?

I texted her after graduation in june


And 3 days ago to tell her happy birthday,and she responded with ""Thank you!!❤""



I dont know if i should talk to her more,before asking about the movie


Or do i just let it go

Meeting her at the theater,and getting know eachother there,then seeing the biggest movie with her

It's simple moving to South East Asia men we all know at this point in 2021 it's getting harder to find women in the west that won't cheat or monkey branch you.  I mean we all know women are hypergamous my nature the science is clear at this point. This isn't sexism at all this just pointing out facts if facts are sexist then I guess reality is sexist.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways the reasons why SEA maxing is a good option is.

&amp;#x200B;

1 The women are less likely to cheat on you in trandional societies cheating is shamed upon and your less likely to get cheated on.

&amp;#x200B;

2 There isn't an constant anti monogamy propaganda every time you go out in the world.

I(18F) met this guy(21M) on tinder. We've hung out once a week on the weekends for the last month now. He told me he just got out of a long term relationship and wasn't looking to get into one ""but if it happens, it happens"". He drives about 40mins-1 hour the past four saturdays to see me because he lives in a different state. We've hooked up each time. He's paid for food, alc, etc. He texts me good morning and good night and ss my snaps where he thinks I look good in. He asked me how my family would feel if I dated him(he's a diff race), opened up about his previous long term relationship.  Since we only see each other once a week, he's told me that misses a me a couple times. He's said that he actually enjoys being with me and that ""sex"" is just a bonus. He likes that I'm uplifting and kind and understanding. 

Today he asked me the question: what am I to him. I responded with ""what do u mean"" and he said that he enjoys spending time with me but he doesn't know if he wants a relationship anytime soon. I told him that i know because he told me that earlier. then he said ""we both kinda like each other"" but that we can still enjoy what we have without being bounded.  then i asked him what he wanted and he said he doesn't know. he wants to focus getting his career on the right path wherever that leads him. and he said that he thinks im a genuine person and that we vibe really well. and i told him that i thinkn he's kind and we always have a good time together. he asked if i wanted to date him and i said that i wanted a relationship(in general) but when I was ready bc I told him I wasn't looking for one either. and i said that i would like to date him bc he had the qualities I was lookinig for but i was fine being casual with him. he responds with that i might never know what could happen and maybe he'd want a relationship down the line. Yeah people say that ""i don't want relationship *with you*"" but why would he do all of this when he could just stay in his state/city. 

The issue: I'm obviously getting mixed signals and it's not the usual kind. He does very ""relationship"" things but says something differently. My friends told me to start detaching my emotions from this but also let it flow but guide the flow. Yeah I like him but I just want advice. How do I deal with this?

Should I just trust you 100% and throw caution to the wind when you don’t want to talk on the phone and you don’t want to provide legitimacy to who you say you are from a dating website? I’m concerned who you say you are because of the aforementioned. It’s like your hiding from presenting who you say you are… yes, Om asking for proof. You could be a guy for all I know….
