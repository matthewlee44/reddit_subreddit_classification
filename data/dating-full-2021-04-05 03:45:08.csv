This is the case in some cases and, above all, in some age groups. We could say that this way of ""crossing"" with love is more valid during adolescence than in other moments of adult life. Difficulties begin as our peers establish stable relationships as a couple and as we incorporate responsibilities into our lives.

Finding a partner, therefore, is not, in most cases, a matter of chance, but the result of a series of predispositions and changes that must be made and that we have tried to collect in this article.

If you want a partner, look for her!

The first step would be to acknowledge this obviousness. As in any change, we must make a decision and focus our energy towards what we want.

Open possibilities

You can find a partner anywhere and at any time. It is not about joining the gym and believing that this is where the couple will be found, or registering on an Internet page to find a partner and waiting for love to reach us exclusively through this means. So, now you know: socialize as much as possible and sign up for www citasaciegas net if you want us to help you...

Stop negative thinking

Forbid yourself phrases like: ""I am not made for love"", ""I will never find a partner"", ""All men are equal"", .. We are what we think!

Pamper yourself, take care of yourself, love yourself

When a person is good about himself, his power of attraction multiplies. Take care of your image, get ready, play sports, leave home ...

Control the language you apply to yourself

Your self-esteem goes higher or lower depending on how you talk to yourself. Don't throw dirt on yourself! It puts an end to phrases such as: ""I am very shy"", ""I don't know what to say"", ""I think my things are not interesting"", ...

Emphasize your strengths

We all have skills, knowledge or concerns that differentiate us from others and that, if we develop, make us feel better about ourselves. Let others know about them.

The past is past

You can't start a relationship if you have a past relationship too much in mind. Try not to fall into monologues about a previous partner when you are meeting someone.

Show yourself as you are

Show yourself as you are but according to your best version ..! You like what you like, you are as old as you are, you know what you can do ... But you may want to know new things, change habits, be flexible ...

Visualize the person you want by your side

It is not about creating a ""prince charming"" but about marking us a ""must have"". For example, if it is very important for you to go to the mountains to go hiking, find someone who also likes it. If you need a certain stability to feel calm, look for someone who can offer it ...

No to teenage ""tics""

Looking for a much younger partner, who has not been married or who does not have children after a certain age is not recommended. Apart from the fact that you have many options to meet wonderful people, you can project little maturity and / or a certain fear of commitment.

Well guess what, we all love to be with someone attractive, affluent, smart..., that's why you as a man prefer a sexy, smart, attractive woman.
I guess what i am trying to say is, don't blame your failures in dating and getting your self rejected on a whole human gender. Cause i am man and when i get rejected i blame it on my self. So better work on your self, and by the way getting a woman shouldn't be hub of your life and focus, women will follow eventually if you are on your own journey to improve your self.

I found myself having such a relief knowing that I'm not gonna have to put myself out there, getting rejected, thinking I'm not good enough, etc. Just knowing that I'll be single forever gives me more confidence to do whatever I want, and I'm actually pretty happy. It sounds strange, but it really has made me feel more independent in a weird way.

I've been on tinder and other dating apps since I was 18. I've gone on about 9 dates, and most of them went well. But I don't seem to attract anyone for a second date, usually the girl I'm talking to tells me she's not interested, and later starts dating a more attractive guy, or a guy with more to offer. And other times it's because they lose interest after the first date. If I'm being honest, I think it's because I'm kind of nerdy. Im really passionate about mathematics, and I noticed that every date I've had, I tend to talk about math, or just bring up something cool about it. I'm also introverted, and maybe that's a turn off, I still try my hardest to spark up conversation, and I've actually gotten really good at it.

I'm also quite short, I'm 5'6. I'm not saying it makes it impossible for me to find someone, but I've realized that whenever I get a match, and I they ask for my height, I get unmatched. Or if they don't ask, upon the day of the date, they tell me I'm shorter than they thought. So being 5'6 just makes things a bit harder. I try to dress well, and have good hygiene. it's certainly worked, I've gotten some compliments on my style/hair/looks. 

now I'm just focusing on my phd in math. I recently just finished my last season as a D1 runner, so I spend most of my time alone doing math. I also skateboard by muself whenever I have the time, or play the guitar. I spend most of the days alone, but it feels good in a way. Like I don't have to worry about nothing. I get everything done, and I feel productive. My confidence is blossoming, and my drive to become a better person is growing.

So I’m going to go into full detail as possible. 

There was this guy (M/24) that I’ve (F/25) been working with (we’re both servers at a restaurant) for over a year. He said he was interested in me, and I was single at the time, but nothing ever came out of it because COVID-19 hit, the restaurant shut down, and we ended up getting back with our exes. 

Then, a couple months later, we break things off with our significant others and found our way back to each other. Right after Christmas 2020, one thing lead to another and we ended up meeting up with each other and eventually hooking up. He invited me out for NYE and we spent our birthdays together, things were going well. We had a great spark and great banter. I asked him what he would like from this, whether that be casual hookup, exclusive FWB, etc. He told me he liked where it was at the moment (exclusive FWB), said he likes how we click, and that he would like to see where it goes from there. 

Then in February, he started to become more distant. He said it was for school, but he didn’t even ask me to do anything for Valentine’s day, which is weird because we spent NYE and our birthdays together. I confronted him and he said he wasn’t sure where he wanted things to go. That school is ending and he’s going to find a job outside the city we currently live in and doesn’t want to catch feelings if he’s going to leave. I was sad, I still am sad, and i just wanted to enjoy our time together before he left. But i couldn’t convince him. 

Fast forward to right now. I currently make content on OnlyFans as I await to go back to work. He’s the person I would always make content with, until he ended things. So now, since we don’t see each other anymore, but we still text on occasion. The past 4 days he’s asked me very personal questions. Like if i’m hooking up with a mutual friend, if i’m making OF content with anyone else etc. He knows i’m DTF but when I ask him why he’s asking these questions he says he’s “just curious”.  

I’m not really sure what to think about this? Is he jealous or actually just making small talk? Is he even interested in me? What is the correct way to handle this? I would like things to develop into more, but I’ve never really dealt with this sort of thing before.

Here's how it went down.

A couple of days ago, I matched with an Asian girl on Facebook Dating. Her profile seemed legit upon first glance; nothing seemed too suspicious and she didn't give off any red flags.

Nevertheless, I did sense a pattern. Over the past week I've been matching with profiles that share a very distinct layout: pictures of attractive Asian women, one-liner bio, &amp; same location (Seattle). I've never made any serious attempt to converse with those matches, but enough so to notice that all of them have been very eager to talk about investing.

So, when I got to chatting with this ""girl"" and she refused to a voice or video chat, I was immediately suspicious. I played ignorant for a bit just to keep the conversation going and - lo &amp; behold - she immediately steered the conversation towards bitcoin investing. Before long, she's asking me to download this app.

==

I'm 99.99% sure this is a scam. But I'm not mad or surprised. I've been scammed numerous times before and, despite my head telling me to behave sensibly, my hormones have been dead-set on the slim, slim chance that the match might be legit.

To be fair, though, most of my matches on dating apps have been bots or scammers.

- Once in passing while we were talking, he said he was 6'2 but in a comment on his Instagram from a year ago, his comment was that he was 6'1 on a good day
- He said he was bringing ice cream then didn't and never mentioned it. He did bring the other food item he said he was going to bring so clearly had gone to the store.
- He asked me in the morning if we could make plans for x day/time. I confirmed. He then asked me the same question much later the same day (late night)

Later on a bunch of us were smoking weed, and she stroked my back like I was her child when I was smoking next to her (you know, that type of ""Are you okay?"" stroke).

I expressed to him that it felt like he just wanted to free himself from guilt and he said he thought it would be healthy in general and that there was a bit of truth in wanting to free himself from guilt, wished me all the best and apologised for the hurt he caused me. I texted him the following evening saying that I wanted to see him and have a nice dinner but I didn't want him to catch up with me just to tell me how sorry he is. That it overwhelmed too.

he texted me that night and asked if I was having fun with my friends (I had told him I was going out with my friends that night) I replied right away but he never responded after that.

For the first time in months I fell in love with a girl. She is really beautiful, kind and weird. She has matching humor and we talked and talked. After some time we met up irl. We hugged and kissed on the first dates and then we started dating.

We made plans going to the beach, steakhouse, anime cons. Trying all sort of foods. Driving in the car and just explore things.

The girl I fell in love with, has been through so much and is still going through loads of bad stuff. I knew she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship.

But I loved her and told her that, she couldn’t say it back but that was ok.

And then everything came crashing down.

She started to ghost me. I was really mad at her because I felt betrayed and used. There wasn’t any explanation and I was really confused. I asked if I did something wrong. And why?

After a few days she replied and told me I did nothing wrong. She fell back into depression, and couldn’t give me what I wanted. She also didn’t want to talk to anyone. She wished she could undo everything and that was the last thing I heard from her.  She also said she wanted to be my biggest supporter but couldn’t do it.

I replied with: I’m not mad at you anymore and I forgive you. I’m always your biggest supporter. But Ghosting is something really harmful for me so I need to recover from that. 

She started ghosting again after the last message and I never heard from her again.

Right now I’m just really worried.
I wished I could be there for her, bring chocolate everyday to make her feel a little better and see her smile.
I blame myself a lot, maybe I asked too much? Maybe I said the wrong things?

I message her once in a while to still let her know I’m there for her. And I really am!

Do you prefer someone you like(but stranger) approaching you, you both talk a bit and then you understand you’re not compatible(different life view) or just him not talking to you in the first place?

My story-
So I’m(20M) serving in an army base with ~8,000-9,000 here daily.
I go to eat every day launch between 11:30-13:30 and somehow I see the same girl every time for like 10 times already, and I go on different time each day...

She looks cute and maybe she noticed me once or twice, but maybe she doesn’t remember or sees me as a stranger.
I don’t do cold approaches as I’m a complicated man (I’ve been in an abusive relationship) so I’ve got some boundaries, and I don’t want to go to a stranger, then we talk and we get to know we got alot of differences.

Any way, it feels to me a little bit like “universe” or “karma” or idk, but that I see her every time is kinda weird and feels like a “sign” or something like that.
I don’t like social media and revealing clothes, I’m a introvert simple man and I don’t like attention, sue me but that’s me and I don’t wanna try to get anyone to do this as me, but to find a girl that thinks like me in the first place.

I thought about approaching the girl, telling her just something like “hey, i see you every time i go to eat and that’s pretty weird and funny, so at least if it’s gonna keep happening i wanna say hey, Im X”

And then if we will keep talking then tell her carefully about myself, or just let her have a nice time alone.

Of the 12 or so cases of ""romantic entanglement"" I've had in my anecdotal experience 10 of them were awful, generally involving me experiencing some form of emotional abuse and/or sexual harassment, and always a helping of garden variety douchebaggery. To be fair 2 of them, fortunately, were with some decent folks and I have nothing but respect for them... but they were the exception to the rule in my experience. My therapist described to me that I seem to attract particularly toxic kinds of people, and while I'd love to explore that further that's not the topic of this post. Figuring out my path forward is.

As hard as this is to say, I don't regret my experiences. They were all valuable lessons, but I'm tired of it. I've made the conscious decision to focus on other parts of myself and live a more fulfilling life regardless. I'm about to complete my undergrad, and I'm trying to prepare for the LSAT (for non-Americans that's the test for entering law school). I'm also working out again, slowly. Despite Quarantine being ass, I'm finally starting to feel good again. Cliché ""I'm better than this"" talk aside, I'm confronting something that I think a lot of us, across all genders, experience: an intrusive sense of longing for romantic companionship. I'm not worried about sex- most of my experiences were... *not fun* ... so I'm not looking forward to that any time soon. However, I cannot afford to be derailed from this. I got pretty darn lucky because undergrad is so forgiving, but I don't think I can survive this kind of drama during law school. However, I'm worried about falling into some sort of toxic mindset as the price of having some dark chevalier attitude to carry me through the next 3 years or so. I've seen what happens to men (and women) who wind up like that. They turn bitter and mean. I've dated bitter and mean, I'll pass.

At the beginning, like all relationships, we were doing so well and very involved with each other. I got pregnant very very early in our relationship and we moved in a little over a month of dating. At first he was clingy, always wanted to spend 24/7 with me. It was too much for me and there was times where I would suggest him to go play his games or go hang out with friends but he declined. At the time he was also working out of town quite often. By the time our daughter arrived he got laid off and he was able to stay home with us for a few months. He started playing games quite often but it was never a problem because if I asked him to spend that time with me (which was rare) he would no questions asked. When he went back to work he left early in the morning and came home around 8 (depending if he was working in town) Eat dinner and go straight to his gaming room and play games until 10pm and go to bed. And I never really complained then either because I was so busy with the baby anyways. Now he is laid off again and although he doesn’t game until around 8 every night, he started talking about gaming all day to me, he’s watching tiktoks or YouTube about gaming, tweeting about gaming or texting his gaming buddies all day about gaming. It feels like it’s non stop. I asked him if he could cool it on the gaming topic though the day with me and he agreed and sometimes he still does but I genuinely don’t think he can help himself. Now maybe I’m crazy but there’s something about just going to bed at the same time with your partner and I always imagined my relationship being like that so I asked him if maybe once a month if he could just not game and go to bed with me. That’s not an option.. he said that since he spends all day with me, and lays with me until I fall asleep I should be okay with that. Like I said maybe I’m crazy but i just wanna be with him for a full night without gaming in the picture but he sees it as “why does it matter if your asleep anyways”. I guess he’s got a point but idk why it’s such a big deal to give up gaming for just one night but apparently it’s a big deal. The conversation lead to me saying the game comes before me, because I genuinely feel that way. I come first but there’s a line when it comes to gaming. So I asked him “hypothetically speaking if you had a choice, me or the game what would you choose?” and his response was “I’m not giving up my game, my one hobby”. It hurts to know that he would risk losing his potential future partner over his game. I genuinely feel like his game has more to offer than I do as a person. He started bringing up how his friends wives and girlfriends are okay with them playing every night and that’s okay for them but I’m not them and if I knew how much of an impact gaming had on him and how it was gonna be like I wouldn’t have saved but the first impression I had of him with with whole gaming thing was that is was just a small hobby but it’s actually everything to him. As a dad, he’s amazing. He loves his daughter and takes such good care of her and she adores them. If it wasn’t for her I think I would leave. I don’t wanna be with someone who would pick a video game over me. Part of me wonders though if I’m genuinely in the wrong for feeling the way I do.

So me (M18) and my girlfriend (F17) are in a LDR relationship for 3 weeks. But think didn't go that well.  
So we got together the 13/03 and we talked rarely because she's quite busy because of school, fine, nothing is wrong with that. And then she ghosted me till 27, and told me :"" My parents discovered I was dating you. And they prohibited me to talk to you because you are over Eighteen years old. But I love you. But they wouldn’t let me talk to you. I lied and said you were blocked but then you sent emails to my brother and they got more suspicious and took my phone till my birthday"" (basically the 1/04). So I waited till her birthday, and then she really did text me back, and then she said she wanted Venti (Genshin Impact for those who don't play video games), and she doesn't have credit card, so I bought 70€ for her 3 days ago. And then after that night, she didn't text me back till now. I don't know what's the reason that she ghosted me like that , and what could bother her since she's in vacation in Portugal right now. I have spent over 120€ so fr, and that number is quite a lot for me, since I'm still in a ""Higher School Preparatory Classes"", a specific education system that takes 90% of my time, so I don't have much time to find myself a work. She's very obedient and always do what I said, like when I asked for a nude, and she sent it to me without complaining a bit, ect. So I decided to text her and said :"" I just want to say that I won't be able to spend money till at least July because of school tuition. So tell me when you really need something. And I guess you don't need money to love me right ?"" and waited till she answer.  
Maybe if there aren't enough, please ask me if you need further information, because it's the first time I have a girlfriend and also the first LDR ever, I'm clearly lost and clueless, with absolutely no idea what to do. I'm absolutely frustrated and don't know what to do, so please give me advice if you guys have any idea about this

I (F, 22Y) met a guy  (M, 22Y) off a dating app around May last year and we hit it off instantly and began talking every single day non-stop. Kind of knew who he was because we had distant mutual friends, but I’d never spoken to him personally before. But yeah we hit it off straight away, like we always had things to talk about and even if he was a little delayed in replying (I’m talking a few hours max) he’d always apologise and say he didn’t want me to think he intentionally wasn’t replying to me. Only thing that was weird (should’ve been a red flag in hindsight) was that he didn’t actually ask to see me or ask me out on an actual date in person. Because of Covid lockdown in Aus I played it off like it wasn’t a big deal. 

So we were talking every single day and finally in Jan we organised to go on a date (like 8 months after talking, and I had to initiate asking to meet up). So, I’ve been on heaps of dates before and I have to say say this was literally the best one I’ve ever been on. We talked all night until last drinks were called and then I went back to his and we talked again until about 3am. We didn’t sleep together just made out for quite a while. Anyways after the date he talked straight away about how great it was and how he wanted to see me again blah blah and so we started organising a second date (with him initiating now) and then literally one day about two weeks after the first date, nothing. Complete silence. He still hasn’t even opened my last messages on fb which were replies to his questions. He still views my gram stories all the time which is super weird too.

New here.

So i went in a date the other day. I'm a really old fashioned romantic and love to give flowers on first date or a poem. I love making a lot of effort appearance wise.

So the date I went on. I walked 2 hours there and then 2 hours back. I had to get changed at the place otherwise I would have been incredibly sweaty.

I had no other option but to walk the total 4 hours to and from the date. I could have easily rescheduled?

I would a casual shirt with jeans. I even cut my hair by myself as barbers aren't open here in England. My hair looked decent to be fair according to a few peoples opinion before the date.

I'm a very talkative person and love having meaningful conversations. We had an awesome date.

I was late by an hour for which she said its fine but subtlety throughout the date kept bringing it up.

I don't drive FYI hence had to walk. Ubers would have been a whole thing as I didn't have a mask on me so didn't want to waste more time making her wait.

I want to ask, is it just me or is walking 4 hours for a date, that should show such amazing effort for the girl? Rather than being caught up on being late and not wearing like a suit or anything that she also subtlely kept saying. We had a really nice date. She laughed throughout. We were comfortable etc.

I don't know if I am overthinking it because I am use to guys being quite upfront and forward about their attraction to me and kind of ""taking me as theirs"" while with him it is quite soft and I am unsure if he likes me that much.

Long story about a toxic relationship I was in. I'm not dating this guy anymore so this probably isn't the best sub to post this but I don't know where else to post it.

Basically, I suspect this guy I dated is on the spectrum. No, I'm not a doctor and I don't know. But every behavior he had matches with being on the spectrum. This relationship really hurt me. He was mean, dismissive, and emotionally abusive. It really got to me. But after I ""figured out"" the autism thing (again, I could be wrong I know) I started to feel a lot of guilt. Like I was one more person to misunderstand him. I tried to circle back and gently tell him that I felt bad that I missed some things and that I forgave him and wish I could've been a better friend to him.

That wasn't really working and I don't think he wanted to ""be friends"" or interact at all. We talked a little bit over text and both decided that it was best that we both move on for good. I then suggested he look up aspergers and that maybe it could provide him some relief to read about that if that's what's going on. And then I said that if he knows this is what's going on, I wish he would've told me bc I wouldn't have judged him.

I figured I'd just say it since we are both totally done and I won't see him again. He wasn't a big responder to messages, half the time he'd ignore me with really important things, and was generally dismissive, but he responded to this one. I have his messages on mute so I don't know what he said. I don't know. I probably shouldn't have said anything but I said it. I wasn't mean about it and didn't say it to hurt him, but I probably did hurt him by saying it.

Regardless of his reaction, we're done and no matter what, I'm never engaging with any type of correspondence or interaction but dang, what a way to end things for good...

   I (28M) have been casually dating this girl, lets call her Madison (25F), for about 3 weeks. I approached her and initiated the whole thing. We've hung out about 5-6 times and it's been fun and we have gotten along well. 

   I have definitely noticed that I seem to be much more interested in her as far as curiosity about her life and what not...I am really not one to be that into talking about myself all the time but I find myself always being the one initiating conversation and asking personal questions while she honestly hasn't really tried at all to get to know me on a deeper level. She has never asked me about my career or seemed interested to find out more about me as a person. None the less, she is always interested in getting together and seeing me/going out. She's very short in texts which is fine, but still does not give off the vibes that she really cares about my life, story, whatever you want to call it.  Everything is very surface level so far. 

   Granted, we are early on in dating and I initiated and reached out to her to start the whole thing. I have to keep reminding myself this but I still can't shake the uncertainty I have about her now. It's important to me to be with someone genuinely interested in me, as it probably is for most people. I am extremely attracted to her physically and we do enjoy spending time together. The emotional chemistry is just not coming along at all and I cant tell if she is slow to warm up or if it is just her personality. I am worried about taking things further if she isn't emotionally compatible with me especially when....   

   ...Enter Sarah(26F), who I have been out with one time. Probably the best date I have ever been on. We connected on every level. She is super interested in me, as I am in her. The conversation was easy and our interests line up extremely well. Could not have had a better time with someone I just met and I am also very physically attracted to her. 

   I feel guilty for sure seeing two women at the same time, despite the casualness of both. I just can't deal with the stress I get thinking about how I feel about both, and think I need to commit to one of the relationships only.  I feel like I know Sarah better than Madison even though I've spent much more time with Madison. I can not tell if Madison needs more time to open up or if she is just a closed off person, which I don't think I would connect with well at all. 

   I can't stop thinking about how well I get along with Sarah, but at the same time still have feelings for Madison and don't know if I have given that enough time. I tried to bring this up with Madison once casually, asking if she was that interested in me and really all she had to say was ""of course why else would I be here?"" and didn't expand at all. 



  ***Advice?***   **How do I go about bringing this up again with Madison? Should 5-6 dates be enough to start opening up with someone, especially since I have been actively trying to get to know her more personally? Should I keep seeing both for now and give it more time?**

tl:dr Seeing 2 girls Madison and Sarah. Been out with Madison 5-6 times and don't feel like she is too interested in knowing me on a deeper level despite always wanting to hangout and see me. She does not seem interested in who I am and never asks me questions. It's early on but I have definitely attempted to get to know her deeper with little reciprocation.

So we started talking on Instagram 2 years after passing out of school .
She was again really flirty and really into me and I reciprocated the same and we hit it off .
We hung out for the first time together casually in the car and then I asked her out and we went to a great cafe.

She also mentioned that she has never had such a great 2nd date before and I was really happy that like she also considered it to be a date because out of some anxiety I didn't use the word date while asking her out.

So we then got really into each other and started talking all night for a couple of weeks and we used to meet even between the lockdown phase by running errands and grocery shopping together.
She used to blush a lot with me and held my hands and did all the cute stuff that like generally people who are more than friends do , we didn't kiss or anything tho.
Like you can tell that we aren't friends and something more than that .

She then kinda stopped talking for 2 months after that because of some family problems and she went out of the city to her brother with her family but kinda sometimes she used to text me.

After she came back , she kinda seemed a little different , very less flirting and all but we started hanging out everyday and we used to talk all the time and she started showing that interest again in me but idk like slowly she started drifting into more being friends. Like I had caught some feelings for her after hanging out with her for like 6 months and going on some dates and when I told her that , she said I never wanted to date you but I said that you like went ok dates with me and all that flirting and holding hands and stuff , so she brushed it all off and gave me some weird reasons for not dating me because of her bad last experiences.

After like 15 days of that she got back with her ex who was like her 1st boyfriend 5 years ago. 
I felt so heartbroken on this , like I did so many efforts for her , why give me false hopes by going on dates and acting like we're dating if you just wanted the attention and love . She said she feels nothing for me and started fighting with me when I confronted her of giving me lane excuses to not date me and getting back with the ex just after giving me false hopes for 6 months

So I just blocked her now since I can't really see her face everyday after being mislead like this.

But like sometimes I feel like it was my fault too in giving her much more attention and affection than she deserved or maybe I overreacted on this thing that she got back with her ex.

Like idk why she gave me all those false hopes of being together and going on dates with me if she wasn't over her ex

So I'm just really having trust issues of getting played again like this

I (M20) promised myself at NYE, that from now on, every girl i try date, kiss, have sex with or whatever, is a girl i would see potential in as a partner. I’m simply just bored of one night stands, and i’ve never tried FWB actually working Well through a good amount of time. Someone is gonna be left sad at the end. I haven’t had a GF either, by choice before, but now i’m really curious about getting one... since i’ve had something like it, but that have never been official.

I’ve not had sex since a few days before NYE and i think my dick is gonna explode. 3+ months is a very very long time for me. And i haven’t met a single girl i’d consider, i feel like it won’t ever happen.

Idk i feel like i want something serious but i’m also super bored and feel like i’m not the same guy. Yet, i don’t wanna be like i was in HS and start uni, where i just didn’t give af. 

I’m conflicted between not wanna be the person i was once and wanting something serious, but sorta missing just slaying?

He was extremely upset and cried a lot. I sort of could see the break up coming as things were stressful around that time period and I myself, a few times over the phone suggested ending it. We caught up a week later after we officially broke up and he continued to express doubt but claimed he felt it was the right decision for now. We have been in contact on and off since then, the longest period being 3 weeks (right now). We've had a few hour phone calls since the breakup. In Feb/March he was initiating contact, I would not respond and he would text again about wanting to catch up with me but I got cold feet as he conditioned the date about wanting to clear the air, even though he briefly said it would be nice to catch up. I expressed to him that it felt like he just wanted to free himself from guilt and he said he thought it would be healthy in general and that there was a bit of truth in wanting to free himself from guilt, wished me all the best and apologised for the hurt he caused me. I texted him the following evening saying that I wanted to see him and have a nice dinner but I didn't want him to catch up with me just to tell me how sorry he is. That it overwhelmed too. He responded with ""Haha, ok, I can see how that caused it. Sorry, it was the furthest from my intention to make you feel that way"" that was 3 weeks ago, I didn't respond and I haven't heard anything since.

She flaked on me once but I was willing to give another chance because hey maybe something really did come up last time.
Last week I invite her to come to the movies with me and she agrees so two days later I ask if any time works for her so I can get the tickets and she says yeah any time is perfectly fine just to tell her the info a day or two before not last minute so she can be ready I say sounds good. So a day before the movies I send her the info and she says sounds good she’ll start driving there around this time. 

So I’m at the movies waiting for her it’s already a couple minutes before the movie starts so I call her but it keeps ringing then she sends it to voicemail then texts me saying she’s sorry but she has to go Easter shopping with her mom and she forgot it was Easter weekend her bad but she can’t go.

It all went really well, we clicked on a lot of levels and have a lot in common. At the first date, he admitted that he has some issues that he is dealing with and seeing a therapist about it all (it's mostly cause he has some trust issues and has a difficult time connecting emotionally to someone).

On Saturday we had our second date. We went out for drinks and - because bars close at 6 pm here on weekends and it is forbbiden to go outside after 8 pm  (covid restrictions) - we went to his place to hang out afterwards. I told him I do not want to have sex yet and he was respectful about it. We spent the evening drinking and laughing, having a good time. The thing is, when we went to sleep, he didn't even attempt to hold me or put an arm around me...he just stayed there on his side, which I found kinda peculiar. In the morning, he didn't attempt to kiss me or hold me either, we just talked briefly and he went to make breakfast. I felt really awkward.

After we ate he told me I seem kinda moody and distraught and I adressed what bothered me directly: the fact that he was so cold towards me when we went to bed and in the morning. He apologized, said he understood my point and said mentioned again that he has a tough time showing affection. I explained that I understand his feelings and that they are very valid, but that I cannot have him project his traumas and dissappointments on me. We managed to end the convo on a light note though and, before I left, we kissed, he apologized again and said he'll work on fixing himself.

Here is what kind of shook me: 2 hours after I got home (yesterday), he called me. He said he feels sorry for making me feel uncomfortable, told me that there are so many things he likes about me and that I'm absolutely amazing and that he'll work on himself, but it will take time. 

Since the call yesterday, he hasn't contacted me (call or text).

I immediately connected with this one girl. We met only once though. Next date is already scheduled. She makes it pretty clear that she is highly interested in me as well. I have a very good feeling about her.
Now, there are other girls as well who I could meet again or for the first time. Especially one girl whom I had two nice and very long Dates with (although we didn't get physically close to each other).

Now, how is this done, usually? Should I focus on that girl I have a positive feeling about and cancel all other plans? Should I keep seeing other people as long as we haven't reached a stage of seriousness? Now I would most like to just get to know her, but as I have met her only once it might be too early to put my hopes on just her?
