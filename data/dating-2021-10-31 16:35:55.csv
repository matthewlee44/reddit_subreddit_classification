Nowadays you see all kinds of beautiful women that play; not a ton, but still a ton more than there were in my era. Girls like Pokimane, Destiny FOMO, Miss Click... just didn't exist, man. But they do now. And they're all ~10 years younger than me and wouldn't want anything todo with me.

Hi guys, I had a date (which I considered a hookup for me) around 2 weeks ago, it was good with a guy I met on a dating app. I talk a bit with the guy days after the date. We didn‚Äôt talk for about a week and I don‚Äôt plan to talk to him this week because I went on vacation in my hometown and I‚Äôm gonna travel in my family‚Äôs village the following days. So I‚Äôm coming back in the city I‚Äôve met him the 8th November. The thing is I was quite busy and tired the past week. And my last conversation with him didn‚Äôt make me want to text him, so I didn‚Äôt care. But since Thursday, I‚Äôve dreamed of him and when I‚Äôm horny I think about what we did and I‚Äôd like to pursue what we did. The thing, is I want to talk to him again once I come back in this city because I want to have him as a regular sexual partner. I want to be clear, and make him understand that I don‚Äôt expect him to be my boyfriend or something serious. Because I feel like, he would me annoyed if I expect a serious relationship from him. So is it appropriate if I talk to him again? How can I tell it? There are chances that he would reject me.

I thought about possibly trying a second date to see if things changed, but I felt like it wasn't likely and that I would be stringing her along if I kept it going. So today I sent her a message telling her because I don't like ghosting people. 

I think I did the right thing, but I feel like crap. I debated back and forth today and ultimately I asked myself if I truly wanted to be with her and my gut told me no. 

I read a post recently about ""settling"" and how some people think that if you don't want to end up alone, you may have to settle. I don't agree, but that idea kept creeping into my head. I don't get a lot of dates, so my brain is telling me that I wasted an opportunity to at least have someone.

Let‚Äôs call the girl I was talking on tinder A and call her friend B.

I was instantly into girl B, so I asked her instagram when girl A went to bathroom.

Girl A and B seems not that close besides they are roommates.

We all had few drinks and I felt like me and girl B really connected and made lots of long eye contact. 

After few drinks girl A told her friends to go home and somehow me and girl A hooked up.

After hooking up with A I realized that we are not that compatible but it seems like she likes me.

I want to talk to girl B, I think that we are really compatible and feels like she is interested in me.

Is it fucked up if I stop contacting girl A and ask girl B out to a date?

Or should I wait few month and ask her out?

I also found out that girl A was charging her roommates more money so she can pocket some money behind so I don‚Äôt think they are close friends.

My parents were big on no dating in high school.  For some reason that really stuck with me and I never went for it in college either.  So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never been on a date.  The closest I‚Äôve been was having a date planned from a dating app, but they flaked.  Due to COVID circumstances I‚Äôm WFH from my parents house.

However, this past week when I downloaded the app again I actually make progress with someone and we have something scheduled for next weekend.

So, here‚Äôs my question/concern‚Ä¶ why do I feel the need to hide it from my parents?  I have a strong desire to not tell them about it, it feels like it would be embarrassing.

But it feels so pointless‚Ä¶ if this were to go anywhere I‚Äôd obviously have to reveal at some point that I was lying.

12,qk0eme,1635719622,Chasing Dynamics in the Relationship,"So I've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now. It started with her admitting she has a crush on me. Us deciding to go on a few dates and eventually kissing and getting into a relationship.

Now initially, I wasn't super into her. I didn't ""play hard to get"" deliberately but I never had the need to ""text"" or ""call her"". She had to call me one day and say ""Since we're dating, we should talk on call sometimes"".

She used to be extremely flirty and use cheesy pick up lines etc to woo me. We live nearby and have met once a week atleast.

However, since the months passed, our attachment grew. Now, we mostly talk on call daily or atleast every second day. We still meet once a day.

But, I wonder if I've started being ""too available"" and it made her lose the will to put in the reciprocal efforts. 

To give you a context, we both have busy jobs. However, at night, I pretty much have an hour free to talk to her. It ends up that I call her mostly. She sometimes refuses to talk saying she's tired which I don't really mind.

However, I mentioned it to her that sometimes I feel ""I'm the only one who calls or takes out time for you"". Her response was somewhere along the lines of ""I know you'll call that's why I didn't call because we'll talk anyway"".

Our calls and meets are still great. However, I get this slight feeling of her getting extra power. I don't usually say no to calls or meet unless I'm genuinely busy. But, there have been many occasions where I set the date to meet next, she refuses and comes up with a random date. I don't mind since we get to meet, but I've started getting the feeling of her having ""the final say on when we meet"". 

She's still sweet and tells me she thinks about me the whole day. Looks at my pictures, wants to meet me etc. But me constantly asking ""When do we meet next"" or ""let's meet this weekend"" only for her to refuse has started to irk me a bit.

I got busy for the last couple of days. She called me. I didn't pick it up and texted her ""Will talk later"". It's suddenly that a switch lit inside her and she's been constantly asking ""Let's meet"", ""I wanna talk to you on call"", ""I miss your voice etc.

I don't like playing games, however, when I did become ""less available"", she started showing all the things which we communicated. But when I was being available, I got the feeling she took it a little for granted.

So is it necessary to be a little less available, to keep the attraction with the chasing concept. Or is it just a stupid immature game I shouldn't bother playing?

13,qk0enf,1635719624,I Broke Up With My Girlfriend," 

I (22M) really loved this woman (F22) I've dated for nearly a year now. But, it's gotten too stressful to maintain and here's why. When I first got into a relationship with her, she'd told me about her past abuses from ex boyfriends and the molestation she received from her previous ex. I've listened to her, and comforted her as much as possible on this. We live over 100 miles apart, so it's a long distance relationship. We really liked each other when I first came over to her home back in last December after talking to her on the phone and on a dating app. We hit it off, and things are going very well. Then, when she came over to visit me and my brother over in our apartment in March, my brother immediately did not like her. He didn't say anything rude to her, but it was made obvious to her. Then, she looked through my phone the next morning while I was showering and locked me out of my own room.

When she finally opened the door, she saw a long list of acquaintances and friends who were female and started accusing me of cheating. I told her that these were people I'm friends, acquaintances to, or hardly know them at all. Then, when she left the apartment, she kept asking what my younger brother really thought about her, and I spilled the beans because I'm a brutally honest person, I guess. She gets upset and a grudge forms between the two and her insecurities start to build up from her past significantly. She'd ask me constantly if I was going to leave her, or if I was just using her for sex, which I've explained many times to her that that is not how I feel. Those are things she'd even tell me well before she met my brother. I'd sometimes travel a couple of hours just to come sleep with her and spend time with her family during the school week and during the summer, she'd come over more often. Now, at this point in time, the feud had gotten so bad between her and my brother that she started asking personal questions about my brother, (18M), like why isn't he paying more in rent, or that her car was somehow better than his because hers was brand new and that his was a used car, stupid shit like that. She started saying that I loved my brother more than her, and I felt she'd cornered me into an awful scenario. Keep in mind that I'm on the autism spectrum, and I do not react well to stress or anxiety most of the time, and she understands this very well. This made me realize that no matter the fact I'd call and text her every day, and how I'd take her on dates, tell her she's amazing, come visit her when she's over 100 miles on days where I felt comfortable doing so, no matter how many times I'd convince her to seek therapy or other professional help for her sexual and relationship abuses, she never worked on herself and used me to distract herself from her emotional baggage.

I couldn't take it any longer when I've got a part-time, on the autism spectrum, go to college as a physics, and have my own apartment. I just hope I'm not in the wrong here by breaking up with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk0enf/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend/
14,qk0fd8,1635719688,I have a good friend but I have strong feelings for her.,"I would say we have been dating on and off for a while. She struggles mentally. Thats not really a red flag in itself. Last week I was at her place for hours. We hanged out for maybe 8 hours in total before I called it a night. She flirted a lot but I didn't flirt back because of her girl friend.  


The next day we were alone and hanged for maybe 4 hours. I flirted a bit and she was ok with me getting really close and touching her thighs and lower back.  


Since last week felt like it went good, I asked her if she wanted to join a road trip to Sweden next week. She told me that she wanted to but that she got huge anxiety. I asked her about it again today. We had a Halloween date of sorts at her place, She just told me that she cant do it and didnt really explain why. I didnt put too much pressure on her. If she dont want to tell me what she is anxious about, thats okay.   


She told me she got a cold today and she seemed a little distant. Maybe because of the cold. She didnt flirt today and I would say her response to my advances was just neutral.  


What bothers me is that I always have to go to her place. I dont live more than an hour away but it is too far out of her comfort zone to just take a train and visit me. And I cant drive her.   


I really like her as a friend but I like her a little too much. I am pretty sure she has similar feelings but it just seems like this isn't going to work.  I am wondering if I should just tell her at this point and risk the friendship or whatever this is.

16,qk0j1p,1635720036,Deleting dating apps,"25M here - I matched with this beautiful girl on Tinder a month ago. We‚Äôve been on 3 dates, have the 4th today, done phone calls, text every day, and so far its been nothing but amazing.

The 3rd date (yesterday) we basically spent the whole day together, went to get lunch, did an IKEA trip as I‚Äôm setting up my new place, hung out at my place, watched a movie, had dinner, and the night ended on a sexual note. 

During the movie, her phone notifications were on. We were cuddled up, and her phone was right in my eyesight. It buzzed and a generic Bumble notification came up (Find someone‚Ä¶). An hour later, a Hinge notification also came up. 

At this point, she knew I could see/had seen it, so I joked and said ‚ÄòLook at you go, popular on all the apps!‚Äô. She joked with me but then told me she wasn‚Äôt actively using the apps, or talking to anyone else, or seeing anyone else. 

Later on, whilst we were in bed, we started talking briefly, and we confirmed this wasn‚Äôt a casual/fun thing. 

Now she‚Äôs obviously into me (when she came over for the date yesterday, she suggested IKEA, and I said I wanted to hangout/chill with her, and propped up the idea that if we did IKEA, we could something relaxing the next day if she was free. She immediately agreed.

I‚Äôm not a serial dater and when I know I want to see someone, I put in effort. I‚Äôve wanted to delete my account on Tinder since our second date, but haven‚Äôt at the thought of coming across as too keen. 

My main anxiety comes from dating someone in the past who told me they deleted their apps, only to find out they were actively using Tinder, Snapchatting / texting and sexting people from Tinder after we had the talk about being a couple and not using our apps/deleting accounts. 

After my conversation yesterday, is it worth me asking her to be exclusive / deleting the apps?

The sex we have is mindblowing. She (20s) is incredibly attractive, smells amazingly well and I can say for sure the intimacy we share is the best I have experienced so far. I haven't had many sexual partners (less than 10) but none of them compare with her

I know I am not the best she's ever had, eventhough she enjoys it a lot. We have discussed this, and I guess I am kind of okay with it

29,qk1lsc,1635723657,Advice on what to do next,"Last month I met this awesome girl in college and since then we became great friends and started talking a lot. (She always sits next to me during class)

2 weeks ago she invited me to her birthday and I was the only guy there, there were only her female friends and I was really suprised. 

That day she asked me if I could help her with some homework and said that we could eat something together as well. 

This wednesday we hung out for the first time and we got dinner at a restaurant. 
After we were done we went back to her place and we talked for probably over 2 hours about. All of a sudden she asks me if I had a girlfriend or if liked anyone (her obviously); I said no and changed topic but she noticed that I was blushing really hard. She made it clear that she's never really liked anyone and doesn't like anyone atm.

After I went home I texted her that I loved talking to her and she said that she's had a strong bond with me ever since she met me because we have lots of things in common. Oh and I asked her if she wanted to hang out again.

We met on Thursday as well and we hung out at a bar and talked a bit. At the end I asked her if she wants to go out again this week to which she said she would love it.

At this point I'm not sure whether she likes me or not, because I'm afraid she likes someone else (even if she said she does not) and don't know what to do. Should I take her out to dinner or just hang out?

31,qk1ti5,1635724409,My ghosts new girlfriend contacted me!," I was ghosted by this dude a little over a month ago. To my surprise I come across in people you may know on Instagram his new girlfriend, great. Her main photo is of them, and I recognized him right away, her account is public and yea I left a comment under her picture. It was interesting because a few weeks ago he was coming to see me. This prompted her to call and message me, calling me jealous and screaming at me. Not realizing and not listening to what I‚Äôm trying to tell her, that this guy is a ghoster. He did it to me not once but twice. And to be careful so she doesn‚Äôt get her heart broken. Well after this exchange she blocks me. 48 hrs. later I wake up to a message from her best friend, begging me to have a conversation with her again, because she wanted to apologize to me. Apparently Mr. wonderful is ghosting her as we speak. I agreed because I‚Äôm not a jerk and yes I was owed an apology. She did just that, she told me she was grateful I reached out and that she was hurt and felt foolish to fall for him. She said he had put up red flags for weeks and she overlooked them. Everything from lying about where he lives, to finding recent logins to a tinder account. She told me, they had been intimate and he had disappeared for a week. I told her it‚Äôs her life and she makes her own choices but to respect herself. We had a pleasant and cordial conversation for over an hour, added each other on socials and I told her to keep in touch if she ever needed anything. An hour later I was blocked again. My best guess is that he finally called her and smoothed it over and now she hates me again.

It doesn't even have to pleasant experience but indeed it's a lot of details about his ex. It's way too much to ignore it and not see it as a red flag. I wasn't paying much attention to this behavior back then since I didn't think we would end up in a relationship. Now I can't get these out of my head maybe it's because I think it's a bit unfair. I have never had relationships last that long and I have not been through so many things with any of my ex.

37,qk25yt,1635725570,Should I feel bad I went through her Snapchat?,"So my wife and I have been married for 9 months now and she recently left for Navy Bootcamp. We‚Äôre both in the Military now and I‚Äôve been super excited for her because it‚Äôs been a life long dream of hers to join. Shortly after she left I hopped on her tablet to look at all the photos she had of us and herself because I was really missing her. That‚Äôs when I saw she had screenshots of guys she had ‚Äúthings‚Äù with and would have sex with before we met. I looked at the dates of the screenshots and found they were after we got serious about eachother and made it an official relationship. One particular night I was driving to see her she was on FaceTime with another guy and took screenshots of him and he was shirtless. So I got pissed off and felt really hurt and wanted to see what else I could find, so I hacked myself into her Snapchat. She was signed in on her email on her tablet and I used it to change her Snapchat password and there I found a whole lot more. After we became official, she was texting with a guy and they made plans to meet up and drink together and they sent one selfie each to eachother and were flirting with eachother a bit. T this point I went through all the dudes on her snap to see if she was doing anything else and I found another guy who was flirting with her and said they should meet up when she visits his state and she was soon because she was going down to be with family and they both said they want to meet up and that it‚Äôd be fun. I also found a screen capture she took of one of her past fling dudes off Instagram of him shooting guns.. all this happened the first few months after we started dating and it became a slight problem and we talked about it and she stopped over time but I was never made aware about these messages. She was talking to one of them at 2:30 am while I was sleeping right next to her and I assume the guy wanted to talk because she said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt it‚Äôs dark and late and don‚Äôt want to wake my bf up‚Äù it‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cheating and isn‚Äôt explicitly flirting back but she‚Äôs entertaining these guys and being too friendly.

So my point and to summarize (TL;DR) I was missing my gf since she left bootcamp and went into her kindle to look at pictures of her and us because I was missing her. Found screenshots of other boys, one I knew about too she has told me she had things with in the past (present??) and then wanted to find more so I used her kindle and open email account to reset her Snapchat and found her talking to guys and making plans to hangout, dudes that were clearly not wanting to just be friends.

Is there a way around it?","This is basically the story of my life. I never had a woman show overt interest in me or ask me out. I usually would get some faint interests from classmates and co-workers and whatnot, then I would start paying attention to them or message them and I guess they kinda liked the interest and it would escalate... I actually managed to get into long-lasting relationships that way that didn't continue for reasons outside our control.

 I've recently come to the conclusion that many women would give me a shot if I make it convenient for them to do so... on the other hand, I never had a single woman to actually ask me out or take initiative in being bold in their interest in me.. It is as if a woman wanted to be that bold, she would rather be that way with guys that are more ""desirable"" (by any definition of the word) than me... Before covid, when I was active in asking women out, I would go on date with a different person at least once a month or so  (if I was single) but since COVID I decided to stop asking out women and wait for others to take initiative.. and as you could guess I barely met any woman in a romantic way since then.

I think my question is that, is there any way for an average guy to be successful in actually receiving interests from women without always being the first person that makes the relationship or date happen.

he works and studies for his master's degree right? so he doesn't put his phone on ""do not disturb"" so he hears the phone ringing when me or someone send a message on whatsapp, he gets ""really"" mad when i send him messages, he always said he would never hurt me but i felt bad when he typed in caps lock sometimes, yesterday he said he would put his phone on ""do not disturb"" mode because me and his friends were texting and calling him so much so i thought i could text him today, i texted and he got mad lol, then i said i would uninstall whatsapp and he said i don't have to uninstall but to respect him or something like that i read the message without clicking on his chat and uninstalled the app for 1 hour, it was gloomy and rainy in my city today and his time zone is 1 hour behind mine (his time zone is eastern time zone but they're using daylight savings since march so it's only 1 hour behind, but it will be 2 hours behind in some weeks), so i laid on my bed and closed my eyes because i do that when i'm sad then i got sleepy, but i decided to reinstall the app and send a message apologizing for my petty and childish attitude, i said a lot of good things and was super polite and respectful and he didn't say nothing back lol. do you guys think i should stop caring too much or start being short with him or this will just damage our relationship? we don't date bc i don't live in his town also. also why do you guys think he's single??
so yeah im considering this bc im literally tired. it would be a loss for both of us tbh bc he's at least upper middle class and he's hot, and a loss for him because i'm 18 and look underage and have a cute voice and i'm skinny and polite/caring (if we parted ways) but like i think he should care more because i literally like him so much and my looks are appealing too (i don't find myself too much good looking but he genuinely finds i guess, or he doesn't and just chat with me because of my age and underage look?), maybe he thinks i'm only interested on his money?? or he doesn't even care about me because he could find another boy for him, guys please help me should i be short with him or not will this make him care more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk3g1l/is_the_sentence_the_less_i_care_the_more_he_does/

Is it too early to have a conversation about being exclusive? I personally don‚Äôt like dating multiple people at once, but if he has I don‚Äôt really care. Now that I‚Äôm starting to gain more feelings and want to get intimate I‚Äôd prefer if he only sees me. I don‚Äôt want to become bf/gf yet, just to keep dating (exclusively) and see where things go. 

I do tend to rush things, but I like him a lot so I don‚Äôt want to mess things up by asking for too much too soon. 

Also what would a conversation about exclusivity even start as? I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up or start it. Any advice would be appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk3pjg/how_long_do_people_wait_before_having_a/
58,qk3ujg,1635731647,did I make the right decision?," 

I (19M) have a friend (19F) and we've been friends since 9th grade. Although our friendship was tough at first because I kept throwing jokes about her and eventually we ignored each other for months. After that, I apologized to all of the jokes I've thrown around and we eventually became very close friends that would talk almost everyday.

When we both graduated in junior high school, we parted ways (went to different schools far from each other) but we still talked to each other through messenger. She was always the person I would go to if I want to vent/say something.

She replies to me fast but very close ended but I still kept talking to her because she's the only person I trust, I also just thought that she's busy with school which 90% of the time is the truth. I jokingly asked her if she ever wanted a boyfriend she said that it isn't her priority and she would always prioritize her studies first and would wait until she finishes college.

We are both in college now, and recently I fell in love with her. So I immediately told her that I felt such thing but she cringed at it and later just laughed it off. I just told her I love her but I didn't ask for a relationship because of her study first mentality and I just thought ""yea, atleast you confessed now and there's less to worry about"".

I haven't talked to her for almost a month because of school and a few weeks ago she recently checked and asked me if I was busy at school so I just said yes. It was also a great timing since the school gave us a break to rest. That night, I invited her to a voice chat and I told her what I did in the previous month when I haven't talked to her. During that period where I didn't talk to her she kept posting something about love in her stories and the my delusional ass thought it was for me and I thought she probably changed her mind about me.

After talking about my part, I asked her if there is something she would like to say, she just kept saying there's really nothing that she want's to talk about but I kept insisting her. So I just said okay I will say something again but you probably know what it is. She then just told me ""noooooo, we're just friends okay hahaha?"". I replied with I know that but I just wanna say it because I still do.

I didn't end up saying it but later on she said that she actually wants a boyfriend literally right now but it's just not me and repeatedly said ""just not you"". I got shocked because I always thought that she would prioritize her studies and she said it herself that she would wait until she graduates. Out of shock, I disconnected in the voice chat and didn't get to sleep.

After that, I just went to read reddit about similar experiences about getting rejected and at 3AM, I unfriended her on all social media because I was thinking that there is no point on talking to her again and I just thought that unfriending might be a great coping mechanism.

Was cutting off communications the right choice? Should I just leave her alone now and move on?

thanks in advance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk3ujg/did_i_make_the_right_decision/

I initially said just drinks at a local pub but on the day she suggested food too. It was really nice and the conversation was flowing really well, we laughed and joked and even got desert (I don't usually go for desert)

Maybe it's just me being bad at reading signals, but I wasn't sure how it ended. We said our goodbyes and said for her to let me know she got home safely. My intention was to text the next day, but she beat me to it within about 30 minutes and said she had a lovely time and would like to do it again. We then texted back and forth that night and the past few days. She even mentioned wanting to kiss but not wanting to overdo it 

We both live in a small-ish town with not much to do outside of pubs and restaurants, however the next big city (30 minute drive away), has a lot to offer but I don't want to go there just yet. 

Just wanting to get opinions on my thoughts of a second date. I'd rather not repeat the pub/restaurant just yet and I thought of a sort-of picnic instead. I'm in the UK so the weather has turned a bit. But we both talked about liking local farm shops, so my idea was to pick her up, take her to a nice farm shop near the local airport to pick up some lunch, then drive to a nice viewing area, sit on the boot of my car whilst watching planes take off with some nice lunch and a thermos of hot coco. 

Now neither of us are into plane spotting or anything like that but I thought it would just be a nice backdrop for conversation. I feel like being close sat on the boot (trunk for Americans) of the car removes the table obstacle between us, and if it goes well and opportunity presents itself we can kiss. 

Just wanted to know if this sounds like a good idea or not? I want it to be fun and memorable and a bit romantic without it being just another restaurant dinner date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk4hcx/need_advice_on_a_second_date_idea/

69,qk4kru,1635734205,Is it me? [28M],"I recently met someone and went on a first date that ended up turning into a 36 hour first date. We had first met in a bar where a friend and I were celebrating my birthday. She walked in and sat down 2 seats over. My friend and I went on with our normal conversation when she decided to join us. We really hit it off and had a pretty deep conversation. She was shocked how young I was since she was 8 years older than me. I thought at that point it would be a deal breaker since I was younger, but it wasn't. We continued to talk for about 2 hours. 

At that point, she asked me to put my number in her phone. When it was time to leave, she asked me if I was going to take her home and have my way with her. I told her no, but I would walk her home. (I'm not into hookups to be honest)  

So I dropped her off and told her I would text her. That night we continued to keep texting and she asked me if I was flirting with her. I told her that she can be the judge of that and we continued to hit it off. So I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime and she said definitely. So I texted her two days later to ask her how her day went and if she wanted to go out with me for drinks and dinner at the end of the week. She said definitely. So we continued to text all week long. We had a few good conversations. There were also multiple occasions where she would put out sexual innuendos during our conversations.

Finally, the night of the date came along. I picked her up at her house and we went out for dinner and drinks. The place we went to is very casual. We had a really good conversation for hours and got to know each other. At the end of this, I asked her so what was next. She looked at me and said where should we go next. I told her unfortunately I cannot keep drinking since I had to drive home, but we could go back to my house if she felt comfortable. She said well I'm not having sex with you tonight and prefaced this by saying we wouldn't see each other again if we had sex. I told her that was not my intention at all and if it was why wouldn't I have just done that on the night we met. I just wanted to have another drink and talk since I really enjoyed our conversation.  So she agreed to come along. We went back to her house first and she picked up the things she needed to stay over. We continued to talk until 4:30 am and then decided to go to bed. I got in bed and got ready to sleep. At that same point she got in bed naked, but went to sleep.

The next morning we both woke up and she turns over and says that I can have sex with her... I asked her if that was what she wanted and she said yes. I also asked if I would see her again if we did since she said we wouldn't. She said that was last night not now. So we did, it was not good since I was nervous. She told me after to not feel bad. She still got off and it was fine. After this, we continued to talk. At that point she said to me to be clear that we are not exclusive and can see other people. I said of course since this was a first date... This caught me slightly off guard. After this she proceeded to tell me that she has another date that night. I asked her if she wanted me to bring her home on multiple occasions. She said no. We continued talking for a few hours and she then said she was cancelling her other date so she could stay. We had a good day. Went for a walk and sat by a fire outside. When we went back in the house. She walked up to me, looked me in the eye and said this is the part where you kiss me. So we did. She then said to take my pants off and get on the bed. We proceeded to have sex again. This time it was much better and felt extremely passionate. About five minutes after that round, she continued to kiss me and proceeded to go for round 3 which was also good. 

Later that night, she asked if I could come back to her place. So we went back to her place and watched a movie. She laid in my lap the whole time and told me all about her previous relationships and what she wants in a relationship. We kissed and she told me she felt safe with me and that I was going to fall in love with her. I joked saying how do you know that you're not going to fall in love with me first. After the movie, we went to sleep since we had a long night the night before.  I woke up in the morning and she was feeling sick (she was actually sick, but maybe it was an excuse to get rid of me). I asked her if she wanted me to stick around and make sure she was okay. She said she would rather be alone and I can go home. I said okay and I would text her and see how she was later.

Later, I texted her and asked how she was. She said she still was not feeling good and thank you for spending time with her. I told her that I had a good time and asked if we could go out again soon. She said let's not go from date 1 to 5 so quickly. I said I was sorry for being forward, but I felt like we had a connection. She then said okay to a second date on the following Friday.

We texted back and forth very little that week. She told me she had a few bad days that week. Then Thursday night rolls around and I asked if we were still on for Friday. She said she couldn't and was responding shortly. A few more days had passed and it was short responses or no reply. I finally asked if she was still interested in me or if I did something. If not just to be honest since I don't want to waste her time. She responded a day later saying that she could tell that I wanted a relationship but she doesn't. She is not ready.

I responded with I appreciate the honesty. It's been 3 weeks since I said this.

Sorry for a long story, but this happened about a month ago now and I just feel like it is a strange transpiring. Was I too forward? Was she attracted to me or did she just want to get off? I'm an average looking guy, but she was a very good looking woman. I just shake my head daily and don't particularly know what to make of this situation. Why would she talk about what she wants in a relationship if she doesn't want one and why would she tell me that I was going to fall in love with her and spend 36 hours with me?

Also, I explained to her that I got out of a relationship where I was lead on for about 3 years and I don't like games.

79,qk58b8,1635736583,Hot and Cold. What to do?,"Talking to this guy for a month. I wouldn't really mind waiting as I am taking everything very slow, I guess he does too. And I am more of like becoming friends with him first rather than dating instantly. (We are 10K miles away from each other, so this makes it worse)

Sometimes, I can't help but think if we got a chance. Though when we talk through the phone, and we talk about people on dating apps can sometimes get apathetic, he always says that if a person doesn't have a chance, just say it to his/her face and don't give em false hopes. So I am thinking that he's definitely gonna do that to me if he's not interested anymore, so since he has not said that yet, he's still interested right?

By the way, we are both adults. I'm 25 and he's 33.
I don't really know what makes him very busy. He only works for 6 hrs a day and he's a 100% introvert.

There are moments that I get slow replies, like 1 to 5 hrs üòÇ and also being left on his inbox for days (he's not checking my message. It happened once that he didn't message me for 3 days. This is when he knew that one of his family members is sick. He didn't say sorry or explain anything for being MIA I just assumed that it may be because of his family because he cried when we talked about it)

But there are also moments when he's kind of clingy. I sometimes wake up with his random cute messages.

Right now, he's still got problems with his family and I think it contributes as to why he doesn't want to talk to anyone plus he is an extreme Introvert.

I'm losing my patience, really. But I am trying to be more understanding.

He always says that he's happy that he has me in his life. That I am a blessing. And that it feels good to talk to me with what's been happening in his life, especially with his family (he just keeps it to himself all the time)

I will only accept comments from extreme Introverts or people with Introverted partners. üòä

The three of us dressed up as a group costume with one of my roommates being Cruella Deville and my other roommate and I were Dalmatians. 

So we get to the party which probably had around 25 people in this fairly small house. It had been going on for some time, so a lot of people were already drunk.

So we start drinking and talking to the host and other people. After some time I end up in a group talking with this cute girl and one other guy I was talking to a bit earlier.  

The girl is dressed up in this kinda grey skirt with blazer jacket and she has black and white hair. I didn‚Äôt really put the whole thing together at first but she tells me that our costumes go together, and she‚Äôs dressed up as Cruella Deville, but not the normal one I‚Äôm used to seeing but the Emma Stone version when Cruella was a kid. I‚Äôm not really familiar since I never saw the movie, but I thought it was really cute and quirky.  And here I was third wheeling as a Dalmatian and here‚Äôs my very own Cruella lol. 

And it could have partially been the alcohol but I just was really into her. We spent the majority of the rest of the party talking. Sometimes in groups, sometimes just the two of us. It wasn‚Äôt overly flirtatious for the most part, but we talked about a lot of different things from music, to a recent relationship she had gotten out of. 

She seemed to be really enjoying her time talking to me, but she was also very drunk.

At some point I gave her my phone number. And here I feel like I messed up, because I put my phone number in her phone but didn‚Äôt ask for or get her phone number.  So now she presumably has my number and could text(if she even remembers I gave it to her) but I don‚Äôt have hers to reach out.

I would really like to see her again, and want to ask if she wants to go out to dinner or something with me, but not really sure how to go about it.

 I found her facebook and could try to reach out that way, but I really don‚Äôt want to come on too strong or do anything creepy.

I also was thinking I could try to get my roommates to feel it out with the host of the party who is friends with her I think but I find the whole thing a little awkward.

For a bit of background neither of us are overly social, we are in college but we both don‚Äôt party and he is of age but very rarely drinks. In other words we are fairly boring people with not great people skills especially when it comes to dating. 

We are on a team together so I see him at practice once or twice a week. Besides that I have gone to some volleyball games out families were playing in with him and have started texting him more. I‚Äôm basically always looking for a reason to text him and go do stuff. And he isn‚Äôt shutting me done if that makes sense? We have good conversations and he is very responsive but he won‚Äôt start anything. 

All that to say this. Am I wrong to want him to ask me out? Or, even less than that, expect him to start conversations and text me first? Once I start something it goes really well but should I always have to start stuff?

Im not upset just confused because my emotions are making me feel jealous but the situation is what it is I feel. Im just not sure how to handle my feelings. 

My girlfriend is divorced and has a 2 &amp; 3 year old. Joint custody. She had the kids for Halloween but invited the ex to go trick or treating. I think it‚Äôs nice for kids, but it just ads confusion to my position with her. I was working anyway so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd be invited or if that would even had worked.

They met for trick or treating at her friends house in a suburban neighborhood and had some shots before going out. They came to her house and carved pumpkins after, and hung out. I came over later. She planned that, and she said he was welcome to stay but he decided to leave to avoid me.

I feel SO awkward. It‚Äôs a mixture of feeling weird because I show up right after the dad leaves sort of ‚Äúfilling‚Äù his spot. I see the pumpkins carved knowing they did them together (she said we‚Äôd do them tonight) . I feel like a jerk feeling this way because it‚Äôs for the kids but I can‚Äôt help it.

92,qk5s7y,1635738657,Am I just not cut for dating?,"25M. I always had difficulty interacting with people, always have been the weird guy in class and suffered bullying throughout most of my teenage years. 

I started dating people at age 19, and always found it quite difficult. Always my acceptance/rejection ratio has been very high. 
The only 2 times I had a girlfriend officially, it lasted less than 2 times. 
Frequently I get told even by my friends that I am weird/autistic.


Well, recently I have been going through a series of many rejections, with people with whom I had created a lot of expectations. 2 girls that I was going out with decided they didn't want anymore, just to shortly later show up with boyfriends. I have always heard the ""you are very nice/good looking guy, you're gonna find someone(just not me lol) ""


I always find it difficult to get close emotionally to women, even tho I feel very attracted to them. It's like I am always scared of being myself around them. 

Anyway, after all this venting, what I mean is... Maybe my personality is just no what women want in a romantic partner? I dont really care much about marriage and children, but I don't really like the idea of being alone. I always kinda dreamed of having a partner who would truly be by my side through good and bad, but maybe it is not going to happen? I'm not really that insecure about my appearance, it's more about really relating to women. 

I make a lot of money, I read philosophy, play an instrument, I'm pretty athletic, take care of my appearance. I'm not boasting, it's just that these things don't really seem to give me an advantage. I imagine without these things it would have been even more hard. 

Well, that was about it. Maybe I'll learn to be single and happy with it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qk5s7y/am_i_just_not_cut_for_dating/

95,qk61ni,1635739614,Need advice on asking out a friend (please help!),"I also posted this in r/relationshipadvice but did not get too many responses. 

Need advice on asking out a friend

Ok this may be long but please help me out here‚Ä¶

I should note I have 0 dating experience. I did not date in high school (not that I was rejected or anything, I just never tried to date). And my college was all online so I didn‚Äôt meet anyone there. 

Basically I 19M have a friend 21F that I have known for like 6-7 years. We have never had a romantic relationship or gone out on a date. I think that throughout our friendship there have been times where we both had feelings for each other but never acted on them out of fear of losing the friendship or making it awkward. (Its came up in conversation a few times, us teasing each other about dating, lots of my friends and even a family member have told me to ask her out on several occasions, her parents like me, etc) Now, she is in college about 2 hours away from our hometown where I currently live. (i know some people frown on the whole LDR thing but it would be temporary just while she finishes college) I want to ask her out the next time she is home like for Thanksgiving or Christmas break. Should I ask her out as like a casual date? A formal date to a nicer restaurant? Not ask her out at all? Other suggestions? I think Id want to do it at the beginning of the break so we could then go out a few times during her break if the first one went well. We have known each other so long, I feel like if we mutually wanted a relationship it would progress quicker than people that say met online. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss for what to do here but I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôve tried meeting other people (through online dating) and the few matches I‚Äôve gotten are ok, but I usually end up thinking about her again. So I feel like I just need to give it a shot with her and if she says no or if we go out and it doesn‚Äôt work out and we decide we‚Äôre better off as friends then maybe I‚Äôll have more confidence to move on looking for someone else.

I should note I am not looking to hookup with her as a 1 time thing. This is someone I have known for a long time and care a lot about. I would do anything for her whether we were in a romantic relationship or if we just remained friends. 

Thanks for the help!

TL;DR - Should I ask out my longtime female friend? If so, how should I do it?

96,qk6331,1635739764,Advice?,"I‚Äôve been dating a guy for a little over a year. He has a younger sister who is also in a relationship, she lives else where with her boyfriend. 

About 2 months ago, when his sister and her boyfriend were visiting she cried out of no where that she can‚Äôt have any friends in the relationship and has no alone time. To my understanding, she cheated on him early in the relationship and doesn‚Äôt trust her. Their always together because he doesn‚Äôt trust her and doesn‚Äôt like her friends. He stated that their married in the ‚Äúeyes of god‚Äù. And he won‚Äôt dump her. 

A week ago her best friend reached out to me to see if I could talk to her. Her mother called her and tried to arrange a girls dinner. That didn‚Äôt work. The only answer we were given by her is that if her boyfriend can‚Äôt come she‚Äôs not going. 

My boyfriend is not against me randomly showing up at their house to see if I can chat with his sister. I understand how hard it is since she has not been speaking to her best friend and doesn‚Äôt have any sisters. All I have are sisters, no brothers. 

It appears that she is being mentally abused and doesn‚Äôt want to leave this guy. I don‚Äôt think we could do a welfare check on her.
