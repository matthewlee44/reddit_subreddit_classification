I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and on only a handful of dates over the past few years. In 2019, I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. 

We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood. 

We went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home. 

We kept texting afterwards and the told me a few days later that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. 

I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was. 

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me. One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not, and that this was goodbye. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it, just explaining what happened. 

He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home and I couldn't have potential romantic partners stay the night and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking. 

Since then I went back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. 

Back in November, I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking. I know it's dumb to ask a question and then get upset when the answer isn't what I wanted, but I don't like knowing for certain that I ruined things with him and I'm having trouble coming to terms with it and moving on.

So, for some context, I matched with this guy on Tinder last week and we ended up meeting up for a drink and it turned out he was my sister's ex-boyfriend's brother, so I felt comfortable. I also went to high school with him and we had mutual friends. We had a good time. He was funny and sweet and everything seemed good. I made a Tinder not looking for a relationship, just to make friends and maybe some casual hook ups. My sister told me he was a cool guy and so I trusted he'd be a good candidate for a one night stand (I practice safe sex and all that). From the start I was very vocal that I wasn't looking for a relationship, and he said he didn't either. We ended up hooking up that night and it was fine, although, there were moments where he asked me to do stuff that I wasn't comfortable doing but did anyway. I figured I'd never see him again. The sex was mediocre at best and I found myself kinda grosses out by the whole thing, but it was consensual. 

The NEXT day he asked me to hang out again, if he could make me dinner. I said I couldn't but maybe that Friday. I felt bad because I didn't want him to feel ghosted or anything, even though I was very open and honest that I'm not looking for something long-term. I agreed to dinner that Friday. Friday comes along and I go over. We end up going to a bar instead and meeting up with some of my friends. He kisses me in front of them all which makes me uncomfortable but he does it several times. I get kinda drunk at the bar so I couldn't drive home so he offers me to stay over. It's kind of a blur but we ended up hooking up again. It was consensual, but still weird because I knew sober me never would've done it. 

The morning after (Saturday morning), I'm kinda hungover and he starts trying to have a deep conversation. He asked me if I want kids. He asked me to spend his birthday with him and his mother, which is in a month. He tries to give me a key to his house. He says I'm the best sex he's ever had and he's not ""letting me go anywhere"". This whole time he's like cuddling me tightly and I am obviously tense. I remind him, again, I'm not looking for a relationship. I laugh off the invite to his birthday and the other personal questions. I go to leave and he puts my shoes on for me, I tell him that I can do it but he insists. Anyways, I leave. 

At this point I'm weirded out and don't really want to see this guy anymore. He was coming on way too strong and kinda seemed to just be ignoring when I said I wasn't looking for anything serious. I talk to best friend about it and she agrees that it's a bit odd, but I start to feel bad for him as I talk about it more and start making excuses for him, like maybe he's just lonely or has only had serious girlfriends or is just super sweet. 

I was wrong. And I found that out last night. Following Saturday, he asked me to hang out almost everyday for week, I kept saying I had other plans but when he still insisted I ended up just telling him I was sick. He starts sending long texts about how much he likes me and praising me in different ways. He sends texts again like 15 minutes later when I don't respond. I start to feel bad for him and agree to see him Friday, yesterday. I figure that I'll draw a firm line and tell him I just want to be friends. I go out with some friends before hand for some drinks to come my nerves. 

I go over there. He tries to kiss me when I come in but I dodge it. We have a brief convo, and he seems so excited to see me that I can't bring myself to have the we're-just-friends talk. I am quite buzzed, and tired, and he offers me to stay over. I figured this is my opportunity to draw a boundary, so I say yes, thank you, but that I can sleep on the couch. He insists I sleep in the bed. I agree but tell him no funny business. Anyways, I start to fall asleep and he starts to cuddle me and rub my back. I pull away and so then he said ""is this okay?"" and I said it was fine that he touch me. I feel like this could be misconstrued into full blown consent, but it wasn't, I was just saying that it's fine we cuddle. 

So, this is where I get sickened by what happened. I fall asleep and when I wake up in the middle of the night he is rubbing is hard penis on my butt, like trying to stick it into me kinda but I was wearing underwear. I quickly pull away and then he like starts to cuddle me SUPER tightly. I felt like I was going to puke. I keep wiggling to try and get out of his grasp but he keeps holding tightly. Eventually I shove myself away and he ask ""Do you want to be cuddled or some space?"". I said ""Space"" flat out, with an attitude because I feel so violated and annoyed. I can't fall back asleep and am shaking cause I was so uncomfortable. I can't stop wondering how long he was rubbing up against me like that before I woke up. I am so grossed out. I feel degraded to an object and that he somehow feels like that was okay cause we had slept together already. I got up to leave and pulled me in tightly to cuddle and I blatantly pulled away, and then he tried to kiss me and I just said ""No."" and he said ""Why? Am I in time out?"". I said ""I told you I'm not looking for anything right now"". He said that was okay and tried to kiss me AGAIN. I got out of the bed and practically ran out of there. He stopped me at the door and pulled me into a hug that I tried to wiggle out of but he held me so tightly. He said ""I can't wait to see you again"" and I just say bye. 

Now I'm nauseous and grossed out and feel so violated, but also feel like I don't have the right to be?? Cause we had slept together already and that maybe he read me saying it was okay to cuddle that it was okay to do sexual stuff, but I also feel like he had to have known I was asleep? And I was very obviously tense and not cuddling him back. My stomach drops every time I think about the moment I woke up to that feeling. I feel like I'm gonna think about this for awhile. I'm not sure how to get past this feeling, it's like a mixture of anger and disgust. I don't ever want to hook up with someone I don't know well ever again.

I get that complimenting may be flirty (although not necessarily), but even then, I find it hard to distinguish between flirty and friendly compliments.

Essentially, I've been going out for coffee with a girl (I myself am a guy) since last year, on a rather infrequent basis, maybe going out a total of 6/7 times, but having a good chat each time. We're both at university, so we're both busy and have different schedules, so regular meetups are something difficult to achieve.

I was thinking things were going well, if a bit slowly, but I've been having growing concerns over the past month or two.

This girl isn't the best at responding to messages/checking up on them, so it can go a couple of days of the message not being seen/responded to, which I get can happen. However, she went dead silent for 2 weeks not too long ago, and did respond to say she was away and had no reception/wifi, but I don't know how much of an argument this is really in this day and age.

We've talked since then, but I've recently brought up another get together for a film perhaps, which she said sounded good, but then hasn't said anything else for 3 or 4 days now, and she has seen the message.

Over the time that we've been talking, I've been hopeful and thought that maybe we've had the very early, and somewhat slow starts of a developing relationship, which could grow into something bigger. But with all this, I'm wondering if I've been seeing what I've wanted to see, vs. the reality of things.

So, I suppose I'm asking if it's pretty clear that things won't be progressing any further, or even if there was a chance at all given the little we've been able to meet up for things.

I met this African (Ghanaian) guy a few weeks back at a Spanish dance event and I fell hard! I'm Colombian and he came with another Colombian guy I sort of know so there was some shade of ""hey I know you"" kinda. 


Night was perfect and the next couple of dates were beautiful. First time I have ever told a guy I love you first. Everything about him was just perfect!

 Currently I have not had sex for a year plus and I don't want to rush into that, we exchanged nudes once and on the 3rd date we made out and felt each other up (Tmi it was like he had a snake in his pants... crazyy). At any rate I stopped him before we went further and I apologized and told him how I was all over the place and didn't want to have sex yet. He was so sweet and told me he understood and everything we even ended up cuddling.

So we have a 4th date and we go out to eat and he invited me to his place after and I told him I don't think it was a good idea. Long story short right after the date he had sex with someone else. I know we weren't together but I told him I loved him and I would even cry about him some nights...I've never felt something so deep. He just made me feel like idk..a woman! Anyways I told him I knew what he did and he apologized and apologized again today and asked to meet up but now I'm just annoyed because he did that.

I don't know if someone has already asked something similar to my question but here we go:

So next week, I have a somewhat ""date"" with a friend of mine I have a crush on. We are in the same friend group but for the longest time she had a bf, with whom she broke top about a month ago. Now I shot my shot and asked her if she's free to do something the upcoming weekend.  I asked her once  before, but she  declined, I guess so because she had a boyfriend at the time I asked. We are no close friends but we get along quite well and I want to see if she's into me or not when we meet 1 on 1. Also, I think I'm not in the friend zone (even though I don't really think it exists)

My goal is it to make the time we spent amazing, but I really need some ideas. The last time I went on a proper date is about 3 years ago and truth be told I am quite rusty now. 

**Do you have any ideas how to make a casual get-together with hints of a proper date?** 

Cause I never really asked her out to go on a date, however I do think she believes it is somewhat something in that direction. And I know, I should've labeled it as a date in the first place, but I didn't want to be pushy.

So  I (27M)  been seeing her (25F) for around 2-3 weeks and weve went on a  couple dates and we vibe really well! Shes open, honest and we get each  other...even on our first date we immediately started kissing and touch,  the chemistry is nice

Shes an  extremely guarded person (she suffers from anxiety) so shes even afraid  to be alone with men bc she thinks theyll hurt her. I respect that and  never pushed

We had our 3rd date  and we got sushi and went for a drive. It was fun and great, we kissed a  lot and talked a lot...but she told me that she was hoping i could come  over next week for our next date so we could have sex. (we've done  other stuff that night like oral and hand stuff; which shes done with  other guys shes dated lightly-but rarely ever actual sex which is VERY  intimate to her)

Normally Id be  down and not think twice about it but i know that shes a VERY emotional  woman...she wears her heart on her sleeve and shes only had sex with a  small handful of people. I know that she trusts me and wants to go that  route with me but im still trying to figure out if im truly into her  enough to want to go that route and have her that emotionally tied to me  (or the other way around)...im able to separate physical from emotional  and because of that sex isn't an emotional experience for me but i KNOW  that for her it is and shes already a very emotional and senstive woman

I  just want to be respectful of her feelings and emotions, i know that if  sex is such an intimate thing to her then i shouldn't take that lightly  for the sake of my own sexual needs and i should make sure i honor that  by being emotionally available for her.

The  dates were fun and i know that weve both had a great time but im not  fully sure if shes someone i want to date and commit to. (im NOT talking  to multiple people and im not doing any f- boi stuff), but its one of  those things where youre just not fully sure if youre into someone  enough to keep seeing them even though its been a great experiece thus  far and if their quirks and some insuffiencies (and my own as well) are  worth tolerating and being with...Its only been 2 weeks.

And as such I won’t be successful with many girls. Last night I was with some friends who told me “I should keep waiting as I have a chance of just scoring real love and I can prove love can exist like that” and shared past heartbreaks to serve as motivation to keep my pledge going, but at the same time they were like “you don’t have a chance with some of these girls you’re too innocent and can’t give them sex”.

Saw a similar post to this and needed advices on this matter.


So my bf (20M,a Muslim) knows my family (Buddhist and brown) is extremely against anyone of us dating another race and religion. I (21F,atheist ) don’t care about it and I love him a lot. I’ve been dating behind my family’s back and only my brother knows about it,which he isn’t very supportive of. My bf knows all of this and is still with me,in case someone thinks I’m manipulating him. 

We are currently doing ldrs for 8 months now and been dating in total for 1 year and 3 months.I’ve met his family once and I sometimes text with his Mom. They seem to accept me and is okay as long as their son is happy,the choice is up to him.

For me,there is a high risk of me getting kicked out and being cut off any relation with my family if I marry him.I’ve been trying to bring up something like“ you know, my Muslim friend and his family are so generous,even when they’re not doing well themself they always donate and share “ but my family always say “yeah they can be but we should never marry them because they oppress woman and they have no right. A lot of ppl discriminate them and you’ll also be if you marry one of them”. They’re so discriminative. My bf’s family and himself are genuinely nice people. 
If they abandon me,I’d have them but I do love my family a lot and I don’t want to lose them. 

I know my dad might even get a heart attack or pass out. My bf wants me to close the distance and study in Us since he probably won’t be coming back anymore. He wants to finish his degree there and move somewhere for master or live there. His family will eventually move to where he is but mine won’t. They’re stay here in SEA probably forever and I’d barely see them. I don’t know how to approach this situation. I’d need my family’s financial support if I want to study abroad because I can’t handle a lot of work plus studying. Sometimes I feel like it’s not fair for me to move 8300 miles across the world for him and also lose my family and the inheritance I would get me would give me a stable life. I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Note: I do love him a lot and I wanna try dating him irl a lot more before I decided I’ll introduce him to my family but he had to go abroad on his family’s decision. I didn’t any plan to move to Us nor any country that far away before.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to me to be totally honest, she had a couple of parts lately and I was only invited to one 15  min before it started and when I told her that's not nice, she tried to convince me that she invited me a week earlier but she did not and I'm 100% sure of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly,  she is surrounding her self with guys who have a crush on her and hand out with those guys almost daily and one of the guys told me today that he wants her and blah blah blah, I was a bit shocked because apparently I'm a secret for everyone until now .

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I opened up this topic with her she got sad and gave the silent treatment again and told she was thinking to end this and I was like okay and yesterday is where things got a lot worst, she had her party again and I was not invited and she shows up at my place at 1:30 after her party ended and ask me why I am angry and that we should do things maybe next week, and she planned all of her vacation with her friend and did not really leave any day to do a vacation together, and ofc she planned a trip in may and included her interested boys and then I was the last one to be added to the plan.   


I have got out of 3 years relationship 8 months ago and I put myself out there but I can't tolerate her behavior she is doing all the things my ex already did before and I feel that I am an option again, like she comes late at night for what sex only and this is startting to make me so fucking mad and I expressed it. I will see her again tomorrow and I'm thinking to tell her we should stop seeing each other and just kill it now, but there is part of me that want this to work out because I don't want to be alone.

Well as the title suggests, I just screwed up my situation with a group of friends.

So I got into this awkward situation where I got cold feet when a girl went to kiss me and backed away. The girl took it as rejection and it was extremely embarrassing for the both of us. 

So we've been avoiding each other in school for a few months now, but I was also avoiding her friends too. I felt bad keeping this to myself.

One of her friends who I was interested in hanging out with and potentially starting a relationship, pressed me to tell her and she promised she wouldn't get offended. I told her I'd been avoiding her because of the incident. 

Girl #2 then ghosted me and told girl #1 that I was telling everyone about her. Then girl #1 denied this happened. Now an entire class believes I'm a liar.m

What should I do in a social situation like this? I should have respected her and not told this happened, but it was eating me from the inside keeping this to myself.

I met him at university, and I've known him for half a year now. He's flirted with me in the past, and I'm pretty sure he likes me. Even if he doesn't see me in a romantic light, he at the very least finds me attractive. It's hard for me to tell, because he's always been very respectful. If he does have a fetish, he's not a stereotypical guy who constantly comments on a girl's ethnic background and dresses in traditional Asian attire. He's a nerdy guy, and likes a lot of anime and video games. He's what you'd consider to be a weeb. I'm a weeb too.

In high school, he was in a five year long relationship with a Korean girl. He and I grew up in the same hometown, where the population is predominantly Hispanic. Asians only make up about 3% of the population. On Instagram, he follows several Asian pride accounts. He sometimes posts stories of political awareness, but 95% of the time, it's regarding Asian pride/rights, even though he himself is Hispanic. There's a girl at our school who I know for a fact he doesn't like, but finds her really pretty. She's half Filipino half white. He even follows at least one girl that he doesn't know, only has like 1000 followers on Instagram (so she's not an Instagram model), and she's an Asian chick, and even though he doesn't know her, he likes every single one of her pictures.

The reason why this concerns me is because I'm mostly Hispanic, but also part Asian. My great grandfather was Chinese, so I'm barely even Asian, but I've had several people tell me that I look Asian. Even people that are Asian themselves tell me that I look like I can be half Asian. My friend even told me the other day that the way I do my makeup makes me look even more Asian. I asked my brother later if I look more Asian the way I do my makeup, and he said yes. It also doesn't help that because of COVID, we don't see each other's full faces. So in all likelihood, my crush probably thinks I look Asian. If he doesn't think that, my Chinese last name will sure do the trick. Do you think he may have a fetish for Asian girls?

I get that we all have preferences. We all do. He just happens to prefer Asian chicks. That's fine. Some people prefer Hispanics, Caucasian, Black people, but I'm having trouble differentiating as to whether he thinks I'm pretty in general, or if he thinks I'm pretty because I'm Asian?

I met her on vacation doing karaoke in a random bar.  She was with 2 other friends (lawyers).  We have spent a couple weekends together and talked on the phone quite a bit.  Several hours a night.  

So far I have really enjoyed her company and was feeling very good about moving forward.  That was until we had a conversation the other night where she started discussing cocaine use kind of out of the blue.  She explained she had an ex of a few years ago and that they used semi-regularly when they were out with friends.  She talked about it like it was no big deal at all.  She went into details like how to pick the best dealer and how careful she was in selecting which cocaine was safe to use.  

The whole conversation terrified me.  I have a sister who is an addict (which she knew about me) and drug abuse trauma has been a big part of my life.  So I am very sensitive to these topics in general.

Once we got off the phone I texted with another friend (40f nurse I had previously dated but now am platonic with, we often swap dating stories).  She was adamant anything past weed is a huge red flag.  She has had a lot of experience with drug use in ER medicine.  I honestly felt similar, I had an ex that used cocaine that had significant mood swings and was thinking I probably should steer clear.  So I sent the girl I have been dating a text telling her I wasn’t interested in continuing to date due to said cocaine use as it just wasn’t a place that felt safe with my family drug trauma history.  I cancelled the flights I had purchased with airline miles for her to come visit me again (I offered my miles, she didn’t ask, I have a lot due to my line of work and wanted to save her the 400$).

Her response was that she was sorry she wasn’t more sensitive to my family history of trauma and that she hadn’t used cocaine in over 2 years.  It was not something she had plans to do again and that she wanted to keep seeing me.  I haven’t responded.

I got together with a guy friend last night (he’s a professional and successful in my field). He discussed using cocaine as a younger guy and said people go through phases and maybe it is not as big deal of a deal as I’m making it out to be.   

She is a successful professional that is funny and I’ve really enjoyed meeting.  She is very recently out of a relationship (his stuff isn’t all out of their apt yet 2y relationship) and there are a couple other deal breakers out there we haven’t worked through yet (I’m pro children, she has never wanted them but I honestly don’t know I she is totally anti-children, I have not pushed the topic and have been focusing more on building a connection prior to broaching it).  Honestly my 1st thought about the cocaine use was I really wish you hadn’t told me this.  I didn’t want to respond but felt like I had to.

He was very flattering and sweet and we had a lot of similar interests, so I continued talking with him despite knowing that he's very far away (At this point in my life I'm not opposed to relocating though I didn't tell him that).
* He wanted to video call, which I did but it was really awkward on my part and he was kind of rude during it (he was doing his hair and getting ready to go out the whole time, and he eventually said he had thought I would be calling earlier, even though I had told him in advance the time).
* Being someone who's very anxious, I apologized and said something like ""oh, it's okay don't worry about it!"" and we hung up. Afterwards, I (stupidly) asked him if he'd like to exchange phone numbers, which we did. I was sad because I assumed he didn't like me anymore, but happy that we could be friendly terms
* Then, he started texting me good morning every day, and complimenting me. Eventually I said ""I was hoping I wouldn't like you after talking with you, but that didn't happen, I'm just sad because I wish you weren't so far away."" To which he replied ""I like you too, but I'm not too down and out about it, people online can seem close but then you realize there's a lot of distance there, but if you're ever in the area I'd love to show you around!"" I was a little hurt, but just said ""same here!"" and assumed I wouldn't hear from him again.
* This morning he says ""we should chat again soon, maybe later this evening?"" I didn't know what to say, so I waited 3 hours before saying ""tonight doesn't work, but maybe next weekend? Have a great day!"". I wish I had just said no. I have been more rationally considering things and I'm realizing that he might not be a nice person, and I'm kicking myself that I let him get this close to me.

She hit me up on a dating app. 

We started off as friends and we had a lot of conversations disclosing our past relationships, childhood stories, just getting to really know each other basically. I think one of the things that I look back on now that rings alarm bells was her sending me a picture of herself in lingerie despite us having only spoken for a day. I shut her down and told her I didn’t really appreciate that as I don’t know her which she apologised for. 

Anyway, we grew pretty close over two weeks and had a lot of fun texting and talking on the phone. We met up and it was a very casual date but I was still fond of her. However, she “ghosted” me for almost a month after our date (texting me every other day with very dry texts). In that period, I came to the conclusion that she just didn’t like me after meeting me and didn’t really need to give me an explanation so I moved on. 

She hit me up again and apologised and said she had one of her depressive episodes and that she wasn’t talking to anyone- just sleeping, etc. I consoled her and told her I understood. We started talking again and set up more dates. I guess we’re here now where we’ve been dating for almost five months. 

However, these past three weeks, I noticed something. She always sends me screenshots or screen recordings of interesting videos she can’t download. Within those three weeks, I’ve noticed usernames of girls and guys she hooks up with popping up on the top of her phone (she’s mentioned their names when recalling stories about them). I noticed in one of her screen recordings a time stamp of a guy she was involved with romantically during the time she “ghosted” me. It was a tiktok trend disclosing “crazy” guys/girls you’re involved with (with screenshots of their “crazy” messages). 

I feel like I’m not getting the truth from her and maybe she’s using me. I don’t know. I pay for all our dinner dates and buy her whatever she wants which I don’t mind. I offer sometimes. 

She did tell me she prefers I don’t get involved with anyone and that she’s not involved with anyone, too. So surely I should trust her, right?

On our first date, we didn't really click and she said she viewed me as just a friend. Fast forward a couple of months, I've been infatuated with her, have met up a couple of times for dinner, paid most of those times; probably a mistake - and really like her personality as well as her looks. Only -ve is she constantly checked her phone during dinner (another caveat is that her ex spoiled her - her words).

Long-story short, she takes ages to reply usually and has admitted this and lately has been stressed with deadlines and other things going on and said this before. When she was abroad/ill, I couldn't hold back (even though I tried to), and invited her to meet up when she got back - rejected both times. Having not heard back for a few days, I asked if I'd done anything and she said I hadn't, and her absence was due to stress/deadlines/etc. However, one night I texted again after a few drinks (bad move) asking where we stood, bearing in mind she'd previously said it was nothing I had done. Then she sent me huge paras saying I was being inconsiderate by asking her out when she was ill, and again when she got back from her holidays, and not emphasising with her situation when she was ill (fair enough on the latter, it was bad timing). I was actually scared to lose her which is why I was so eager to arrange the next meet up. 

Anyway, I didn't realise I'd made her feel so uncomfortable, and sent texts back apologising for everything (although have to say, if friends invited me out whenever I'd be really happy and offer an alternative), she's seen it but has now ignored for a couple of days, even though she has been putting stories on IG up.

Is it best to just leave it at that? I don't know why I'm so infatuated and think about it most days - sounds very childish, but also has to do with some anxiety/attachment issues I reckon.

We did meet up and went on our first date which was amazing and I'm  so glad I gave him a chance after rescheduling twice.

We made plans to go on a second date, but again, he went on another work trip and had to stay later than planned. These work trips are common for him, but staying longer is a by-product of covid so I try to be understanding.  He was very apologetic and even got me gifts to say sorry. 

We went on dates 2 and 3 which were also amazing. I really liked the guy and feel we're  a good match, abd I'm  also extremely attracted to him. We ended up having sex on te third date, which is very unusual for me (I've never had sex with someone that's  not a boyfriend), but it had been  a really long time for me (&gt; 6 months) and I wanted to get over my sexual hang-ups and just have fun. The sex was great and I felt so giddy and happy the next day. Couldn't stop smiling. That was Friday night. He also asked me to date him exclusively,  and considering I'm  not even talking to anyone else I said yes. 

He told me he wanted to see me again on the weekend, and could I do Sunday lunch. I said yes, but I had family dinner in the evening so the date could only be lunch/afternoon.  I had started getting  ready for the date at around 10:30am, when he messaged me to say his mum told him they're  all going to a lunch at a family friend's and we have to reschedule.  He said ""I wanna see you so bad and now I’m gonna be stuck hearing stories of old people I don’t know."" 

So now I feel like I'm  being made a knower priority than a last minute extended family event he doesn't even want to go to. It sucks because his words and actions aren't lining up. I don’t know whether to give him yet another chance becuase I like him, or drop him and not accept this kind of treatment.  
He also said maybe he'd have to after the lunch to ""see my beautiful  ass"" but I certainly  don't want to just see him for sex after he canceled on me. 

I messaged him to say I was hurt that he's  canceling again, and is  he obligated  to go? He hasn't  replied for 2 hours and it's  not past lunch time. I thought I would decide whether to go forward based on his reply, but so far there is none.

We had great chemistry (at least I thought so) and chatted for hours. I rarely have so much chemistry with someone as I had with him so I was very happy. He then texted me on the app to ask me if I had gotten home safe. I said I had and thanked him for the nice evening. He then asked for my number. I gave it to him. He sent me a couple of texts and that was it. The following day I texted him. And also the day after. I wouldn't normally show so much eagerness but I wanted to see him soon because I was going to be very busy the following two weeks and I was not going to be able to see him during those two weeks. I wanted to show him that I was interested so that he wouldn't misinterpret my not being available for two weeks. At some point I asked him if he wanted to go have a drink. Again, I wanted to see him before this extra busy period where I was not going to be available. He accepted. We had a good time too. He offered to pay (he had also paid on the previous date) and when I asked him to split the bill instead he said ""you pay next time"". Well, that was 10 days ago and he hasn't texted me again. I figure he's not interested but I am wondering, why would he mention that the next date was on me if he had not intention to see me again. I wonder if I should contact him again. Is this a good idea even if I was the one who asked him out last?
