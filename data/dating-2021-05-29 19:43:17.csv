2,no0lsh,1622337593,How do you cope with anxiety from different texting/communication styles?,"Hi,

I’ve lurked in the sub for quite sometime now, and I’ve always been curious how other people deal with anxiety if the person you’re getting to know has a different texting style or communication preference.

I prefer a more consistent daily flowing conversation and can keep up or guide the convo as needed. But the person I’m talking to doesn’t initiate too much or depending on day etc doesn’t reply too much, not their fault of course, busy day and such. Before people say it’s because there’s no interest, we do have plans made and stuff but just the in between time, I like keeping a convo going.


Ive grown up with a lot of anxiety and this sort of stuff just gives me anxiety (anxious attachment theory), what are some good tips or things to think about to help calm down?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no0lsh/how_do_you_cope_with_anxiety_from_different/
3,no0pwt,1622338043,(M22) Am I doing something wrong ?,"Hey there ...   
I'm sorry to disturb y'all, I am making this post to vent a little ...   


I just had one of the most intense anxiety attack, or at least the one that made me crying the most ever.   


I think i'm bad at love. I may even have a romantical disability I don't know anymore what's wrong and why it's so hard for me to be ""successful in love"".   


I'm 22 years old and I never had a girlfriend ever, despite falling in love something like eleven time. eleven is no big deal, I know, but I am so sensitive it broke my hearts every time. Of course it hurts a lot but I always get confident after some month (years sometimes) and I jump into love head on again.   


I don't think of myself as a bad dude (according to the DnD alignment test i'm more like loyal good aha), I try my best to be good and kind, doing my life without hurting other's. In love i often see myself as a very romantic person, and even if I never tried I think I would be somebody very passionate and cuddly, or something like that.   


But, sadly I never found love. My heartbreaks made me go deeper into an overwhelming feel of loneliness, sadness, being unloved and unlovable (even if I know it's not true), and it made me also very anxious about love.   


I usually fell pretty fast in love, and that's one point. I think this make the whole seduction process unbalanced. I'm more into the girl that she is in me (never saw an inch of interest in a girl tho) and that may make things difficult.   


After another hard heartbreak in the end of 2020, I decided to let myself another chance not so long ago, and I allowed my heart to love again. The girl i'm in love is like so sweet, so kind, so adorable and we share many common interest. I thought that the odds were pretty good, because we both loved the same video games so I could found excuses to spend time with her and maybe start something in her heart too.   


But that got expectedly (considering my overwhelming anxiety) more difficult. Firstly she is kind with a lot of people  which makes it difficult to check if she's interested in me (I know she is single btw). Secondly she prefer not to talk with people in private (only with a very few people). Thirdly she dosen't let people got close to her easily ...   


I am trying to see if she ever gets confortable with me, but I'm not sure at all. I can see that she likes me, but this is hard because I know she need time to be confortable.   


And there is a guy on the same discord. They know eachother since sometimes, and they are close, like really close. Like she initiate the conversation with him and she talk to him about everything and nothing (i don't know the content of their conversations of course). She wants to talk to him. I don't know if they are interested in eachothers or if this just one of the two, but that triggers my anxiety like fire.   


I feel like the whole thing is slipping through my finger and I can't hold it, I don't know what to do. There is nothing that proves me that they are interested in eachother in a romantic way, but i'm just dumb and I have this creeping jealousy that make me feel terrible.   


I feel like I just fell in love with a girl, right before her heart is taken by somebody else. And I feel so bad, I feel guilty because I want her to be happy and I'd rather let her with somebody she loves, but my heart scream to death that it want her. I'm teared appart by those contardictory emotions, I don't know what to do ...   


I feel like I will never know this feeling. That my issues are to great and prevent me to do anything of the sort. That I will never feel the warmth of a cuddle, the softness of a kiss, the confort of being stared at with loving eyes ... Why do all those things sounds like unreal things to me ? I don't know what to do, i'm lost in all of this ...

4,no0xvd,1622338924,Idk what to do about my relationship,"Me and my girlfriend have been going strong for 2 years. But lately shes been suffering from some depression. This has happened before as depression doesnt just go away, but we were early in our relationship so i could solve it by a kiss and such. But now, she says she just wants to be left alone with her thoughts. I have no problem doing this because i love her and will go through anything with her, we’ve been hanging out like once a week and its been fine. But i fear this is going to ruin our relationship because shes been getting more distant lately. A few weeks ago she told me that shes leaving the relationship up to me, meaning she isn’t going to break up with me but if this gets too much to handle then she’ll understand if i break up with her. But i dont know what to do, should i just continue to leave her alone or end things? I want to marry her, but as i said before shes getting distant and wont talk to me about whats going on.

6,no12cm,1622339406,I don't understand why this guy is adding insult to injury after he already rejected me. why is he being like this?,"I had gone out with this guy and he made sure to contact me and bluntly tell me he likes someone else. Ok. Fair enough. I tried not to bother him but he has been coming up to me and being rather mean. I find the entire thing embarrassing. He also has reframed our brief interaction to say I pursued him. Meanwhile I had thought it was mutual. He keeps talking about me to people and it’s like extremely embarrassing at this point. I try to avoid him bc being around him makes me feel like utter crap. He basically has implied by his words and actions that he would never be caught dead willfully going out with someone of the likes of me. Even if I know I’m not that bad it just hurts to be around someone who is treating me like that. I’d rather just not spend time with ppl who are like that

Anyways tho. Part of me thinks it’s really dumb why he is going out of his way to treat me this way after he rejected me. Like he could just like move on and leave me alone. He could be KIND. How can he not know that he’s adding insult to injury ? I’m so humiliated by the fact that he told ppl I chased him and basically was obsessed. I feel like I can’t even talk about it bc then it would only confirm that I’m “obsessed”. I’m very sad about this bc I really thought he was interested in me and I am embarrassed that he’s saying I chased him like sometimes we date ppl and it doesn’t work it’s not a big deal so why I’d he acting like this? Is this ppl I have not really reacted to his rejection? I have to assume tho that he really doesn’t like me

Ps recently he “fell” on me and we both fell on the ground. He said sorry but part of me thinks it was on purpose. I didn’t really say anything. He repeated within earshot of me stuff I said to him to a group of three or four ppl I did not know (didn’t hear what else was said bc I couldn’t bear to hear any more); he said I “planned” going out with him for a long time like suggesting I tricked him or concocted a scheme

added: ok why would he feel badly, if he's not interested in me, it is ok to reject me. I've rejected people before. if he had left it at the rejection, there would be nothing to feel bad about. he rejected ME. so it's not like i rejected him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no12cm/i_dont_understand_why_this_guy_is_adding_insult/
7,no1aea,1622340295,Could she be interested? Does she know I'm playing a game tho?,"Let me first start off by saying the gym is my mecca, I do not shit where I eat. I come to work out, turn my mind off and leave -- that's it.  


That being said, I had been noticing a new trainer at my local gym with an incredible butt -- and she's young which is a deadly combo for me cus I chase younger women (I'm 36) she recently turned 21.  


I had been pretty much keeping my distance because I didn't wanna be a creepo or try hard, though I could notice her looking my way, or if I'd be in the area she was training someone, she'd play with her hair a lot (an attempt to get me to notice)  


She happened to be training a former neighbor of mine and we talked for a bit and I dropped that I did photography for a living and the trainer goes ""You do photography? I do too!"" and talked for a bit, kept it short and went about my workout.  


Got her insta, followed her and she's been liking almost everything I've been posting lately, but when I see her at the gym I simply nod, or even just leave her alone cus she's training clients and plus has a ton of guys already talking to her -- I've learned not to be that guy who chases, but the one who doesn't to leave some mystery.  


The other day I was grabbing my water bottle to drink mid set, she's at the training desk and happens to walk by, I've got my earphones in, I decide to give her a fist bump -- but rather as a ploy to make her think I've friendzoned her. Then went about my workout.  


Today, I walked in, she hadn't been there for maybe 4-5 days, but as I walked in she walked by me and gave me a bit of a sly look, like a slight head tilt, no communication and I gave her a wink and went about my workout.  


I could get the feeling she looked my way maybe once or twice. I was walking back to get in a final stretch and she just happen to get off her shift, I threw her a ""peace"" sign like ""cya"" and then she goes ""Hey, how are you?"" almost like surprised. So I say, ""Good, you? Okay well, bye"" and I left.  


I have the slightest inclination that she knows what I'm doing, but might be doing it back to me -- thing is, she's young, so I'm maybe mistaking friendliness here? Or she's intimidated? Or she knows I'm playing some sort of game and is attempting to do it back to me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no1aea/could_she_be_interested_does_she_know_im_playing/

I thought I'd finally meet someone when I started grad school two years ago, but all the women in my program were taken.

I'm in my late twenties, which I know isn't old, but the more time goes by without me gaining any experience with relationships, the more difficult and awkward things are going to be. At some point, I'll just have to be honest with myself and admit that if it hasn't happened by then, it probably never will, and I should save myself time and stress by not trying anymore. 

I used to think the worst thing in life would be waking up in my forties and realizing that I'm always going to be alone, but I've been alone my whole life, and have gotten pretty used to it.

1. Online opinions are completely different from IRL opinions.

2. I feel like nobody actually knows what they want so just figure it out yourself through REAL experiences not online debates

3. I also feel lots of you with problems are aware of what the problem is and just don't want to fix it, nor want reassurance that it's not *really* a problem. It's probably you, not the and i think you know that.

4. Facts are not acknowledged on this sub, and therefor all advice is not that helpful or correct. People will often tell you what you want to hear or be extra supportive just because.

5. Nothing and I mean NOTHING is accomplished through r/dating, you have to actually change and apply the solutions to your problems which I think most of us have no intention of doing

6. Venting is fun but again, doesn't solve anything IME.

14,no1tux,1622342448,I (early 20s) want to work on myself too after what happened. How do I limit the amount of emotions I invest?,"I saw this comment from someone else (I’m not sure if I’m allowed to put their user here but will credit them in the comments). 

“Here's a rough guide of how much of your emotions you should invest in different dating scenarios.

•	⁠Before the first date: 0%
•	⁠First date: 0%
•	⁠Second date: 5%
•	⁠Third date: 10%
•	⁠7 dates: 25%
•	⁠Dating for 3 months: 50%
•	⁠Dating for 6 months: 75%
•	⁠Dating for 1 year: 90%
•	⁠Dating for 2 years: 100%

The emotional investment should somewhat match the likelihood that things will work out. During a first date, things are way too uncertain to invest any romantic emotions at all.” 


While I know the numbers are rough estimates and every situation is different, I find myself going over and my goal is to really just lessen my emotional investment. As for what happened, I went on 3 long dates with someone (totaling 17 hours) - obviously we had a really good time and enjoyed each other’s company. We both thought we were on the same page about not wanting anything seriously, but after the 4th date, he clarifies that he’s not looking for any commitment *at all*. Up until then, we had been talking constantly for weeks and meeting up every week (this is what I usually think of when casual dating is going well). Now he’s taken a step back and just wants to be able to just focus on himself, take it easy, and if things line up then we meet. 

I respect that he knows he needs to work on himself and heal from a toxic relationship and I’m at a point where I don’t feel I need a serious relationship nor am I dating with the intention of getting serious (but I’m not against it if it happens later on). Obviously I’m pretty disappointed - I really felt like we clicked extremely well on top of physical attraction and it went both ways. In fact, normally dislike physical touch and affection but really enjoyed giving/receiving with him. After finding out, I’ve been lessening my hopes and expectations towards him but realized that I had probably 25%-40% emotional invested when I should’ve had less. 

I know I have anxious attachment style and have gotten better with it over the past few years through therapy, but I’d really love some reminders/tips/encouragement on how I can avoid investing too much too early and save myself extra disappointment moving forward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no1tux/i_early_20s_want_to_work_on_myself_too_after_what/

I’m not sure whether it was on me or if she was just a bad kisser but it wasn’t really all that enjoyable. She has her mouth open too wide and then she randomly switched sides on me not too far in to the kiss which caught me off guard. 

Afterwards, we were both at a little bit of a loss of words as to what to say next. I could tell by her body language she didn’t enjoy it and was trying to get out as soon as possible.

For my entire life I have been in a toxic household growing up. My mother has been very emotionally abusive to me. To where as an adult today, I still struggle with my self worth in lots of ways. I finally found a way to move out now, to get away from this environment for myself. However, I cannot bring my cat with me until after I finish college. My baby. My comfort animal I confided in for 8 years through all of the absolute he** I went through. For a major part of my life, she is all I had. I would scream and cry to her, not understanding why I was dealing with the things I was dealing with. She is also equally as attachment to me. 

When things began setting in my mind that I would have to be leaving this piece of myself for a while, I began to get really emotional. I felt horrible, I felt guilty. Even though I knew deep down this was best for me. And that if she was a human, she would understand. And that I will be back soon. 

My boyfriend listened to me. Sympathized with me. He Understood how much she meant to me. And as a complete surprise, invested in several ceramic planters that look exactly like my animal, to have a peace of her with me. I cried on my way home from receiving this gift.

Well, yesterday a guy who lives near me (meaning we'll run into each other from time to time) asked for my number. I figured, hey, why not. We have a short chat and I found out that he's 10 years older than me, which doesn't completely turn me off but is just something to keep in mind. Nothing else seems to pop out at me. Then, as soon as he gets home he starts texting me, like 5 texts in a row. When I finally acknowledge him, he sends more... Then sends like 6 selfies of himself doing nothing before I even get to respond. Like, I JUST met you, slow down a little! He continues to send multiple texts for each one I send...

We aren't officially dating but we both see that we have similar interests thus doing more things together and he has been inviting me out to eat and paying for lunch. We're not officially dating or have even talked about that subject but considering he's older, I'm assuming that is his intention from this friendship.... hoping it blooms into something....  now I'm not turning down the idea of potentially dating him because of his age but 2 things: 1st one is, from our interactions so far, he's very timid. Probably too timid for me. Conversations aren't exactly lively..... and the 2nd one is, my parents had me when they were young so my mom and dad are in their mid forties. Meaning he's closer to my parents age than mine. Now, there's the context. The question is, should I be upfront with him and tell him I'm not looking for a relationship at this time (better than saying I'm not interested) or just continue being friends and most likely keep him in the friend zone until he brings up the subject.

When we got back to her house to drop her back off I decided to go in for kiss and it was probably one of the worst make outs I’ve ever experienced. I’m not sure whether it was on me or if she was just a bad kisser but it wasn’t really all that enjoyable. She has her mouth open too wide and then she randomly switched sides on me not too far in to the kiss which caught me off guard. 

Afterwards, we were both at a little bit of a loss of words as to what to say next. I could tell by her body language she didn’t enjoy it and was trying to get out as soon as possible. To comfort the situation, I made a joke about her leaving her purse in which she laughed but maybe more just out of politeness. 

I’m not sure if I am overthinking it, whether it mattered or didn’t matter but what exactly does this mean?

So, we had sex, it was only barely passable.  So the next day he sends me a text saying “if I come by will you come out to my truck in a tee shirt and panties?”  And I said “no but if you come by I’ll come out there fully dressed and give you a kiss.”  Not too surprisingly I didn’t hear from him for two weeks.  lol

Then he comes back with “how are you? So sorry, there was a death in the family...”. 🙄  I told him coma woulda been a better excuse, bye.

A few weeks later, yesterday, I get an “I REALLY WANNA SEE YOU!”

* Catfishing: I'm not trying to be superficial, but this guy I was chatting with sent me more photos, and it became clear that he looks like a junior magician and tried to hide his bald spot. Tbh I genuinely don't judge people harshly based on appearance, but I'm pretty annoyed about being purposefully misled. I assume he knows, because the photos on his profile and the ones he sent are completely different.
* Bad at scheduling/rescheduling: I have people that I'm down to meet, but they'll tell me they're free ""this weekend"" and then wont seal the deal. I want to give benefit of the doubt, but it's pretty annoying to me. How many times is it reasonable to nudge them? How many times is it reasonable for something to come up?
* Bad at small talk but constantly wants to chat: Guys who message good morning, hi, etc, but give really short responses and expect me to carry the conversation. I personally do not like small talk and find it really annoying esp since they started the convo, but is it petty to make this a dealbreaker?

Additionally, is it terrible to just disconnect with someone you've been talking to for a while? There are people who send me racist/misogynistic messages, and I'll cut them off right away. There are also people who seem nice, but we just don't have chemistry, and I'll just be honest with them and tell them we aren't a good match. What about people in this grey area? Should I give them an explanation? Some of these people I have been talking to on and off for 2+ weeks, waiting for their schedules to work out. I feel frustrated because I actually do have a number of people messaging me (not trying to brag), so I'm putting them on hold while I try to see if these people pan out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no5rrq/how_should_i_approach_these_issues/

69,no64pu,1622360700,No follow up after date,"So generally when I've gone on a date, the guy sent a message afterwards saying it say nice to meet me or something. And then the last date I went on didn't message me. I waited until the next morning, said fuck it and messaged, to which he replied straight away. Instant. And a tongue wink face like he was feeling it after our kiss, which I had initiated. Saw him again last night and again, no message. My intuition says he's nervous, likes and finds me attractive but isn't sure if I'm feeling the same. It wasn't a perfect date, but I'd like to see him again, but I don't want to reach out for the second time. Thoughts?

78,no700j,1622364374,How should I proceed,"To keep things short and sweet I have been seeing this guy for 1.5 months now. We are exclusive and do boyfriend/girlfriend stuff often spending 3-4 nights a week with each other. I have stated before I do not want a bf at this time, but I obviously do enjoy his company, have developed some feelings and could see myself dating him in the future. He has expressed he likes me as well and has always been honest/kind. We do not see or talk to other people, frequently talk everyday, and it essentially feels like relationship behavior.
However, he has been less than forthcoming about his emotions towards me. He has stated he is unsure about dating. I find out tonight he said he realized he did not see a romantic future with us (i.e. dating) since our second date. Furthermore he expressed that he can’t end it every time he has tried to as he is so confused by his feelings for me. He states he cares about me and likes me, but to be quite frank I don’t think withholding this kind of information, especially when i have been forthcoming with my own emotions, represents this.

I had initially approached this situation with a lets see what happens mindset. However, I feel the fact I have started genuinely caring about this person are making me question his intentions and if I am even ok with continuing. I have never been in a “situationship” before, so I am unsure how to proceed.

82,no79s5,1622365607,I'm putting in all the effort into a relationship and she's putting in none,"Hello Reddit! I just got into a relationship with this girl I've known for a while now. We've known each other during high school but only really started to talk during the last half of the final year. I've always liked this girl but she's never shown a single sign that she was interested. Keep in mind, I'm a little bit introverted in general but she's probably more so than me, so I had to put in the most effort to even talk to her in school as she was very quiet all the time. It generally stayed 100% platonic up until now. We've also gone out irl a few times but never acknowledged them as dates.

Because the Covid cases were rising rapidly in my country, we both started calling since we couldn't go out for a long while due to lockdown. She then came out to me first on-call saying she always liked me but was terrified to make a move on me. We both confessed and things were going along smoothly for a while. (FYI, we've never been in a relationship before, so this is a first for both of us.) Anyways, ever since that confession, our calls and texts have gone from close to every day to little to nothing for about a week as well as being dryer than the Sahara Desert (it's only been a week since we confessed).

Obviously, I want to keep this relationship afloat, so I start every convo or hitting her up every so often, but recently she's been a bit dry for no apparent reason. I try my best to give her enough space but I thought communication in a relationship is the most important thing? She NEVER hits me up first or ANYTHING. And the thing is, she said to me herself that she too will put in effort into the relationship, and that she cares about me. I kinda feel like I'm overthinking this too much since this is only the first week, she probably feels a little awkward about this whole thing too as it's her first time, but I would appreciate if she puts in at least a little bit of effort instead of none :(

84,no7jsf,1622366844,my bf didn’t do anything for me for my birthday and even made me cry,"Hello everyone! I’m new to reddit hope i’m doing this right! My birthday just passed a week ago and I decided to celebrate the day with my bf (22) instead of with my friends because we are still in covid lockdown and only one visitor is allowed in the house. 

I was really excited and I was ready to pick him up from the bus stop, when I did, we hugged and while walking, I realised he had nothing in his hand. This made me a bit confused because we always exchanged gifts on occasions. He said he’s sorry because he didn’t know what to get me. 

I think it’s a very lame excuse (receiving gifts is also second in my love language after words of affirmation) but I was thinking he might do something special for me later. It can be super simple like making me pancakes but to my disappointment, he didn’t. 

We got home, i had a lot of food prepared and we both ate. We planned to visit the theme park later in the afternoon so while watching a movie (which he chose and i told him i didn’t enjoy this sort of genre but he watched it anyways) he kept asking me about the timing schedule or how long it’ll take to reach the theme park. The park was pretty far, about an hour train ride but i told him from the station. But he soon lost his cool and asked me “yeah so how much time  is it in total?” 

I was confused, was he referring to how much time we needed to walk to the station? I was pretty pissed he couldn’t well check it himself and expected me to do everything. I then told him “check it yourself” and I think he wasn’t happy with my tone. 

It resulted to a 3 hour silent treatment from me and he asked me what’s wrong? I told him and he was pretty stressed out saying “if you don’t tell me how would i know?” 
the situation was bad and he seemed cold so i left and cried silently in the toilet. 

But at the theme park (which i paid for him and me too), we had fun at the end of the day. 

In conclusion, he’s usually a gentleman, he’s handsome, tall, polite and likeable but I find that we both have NOTHING in common and my feelings for him goes up and down a lot. We been together for 2 years and I find it tiring I’m the one always paying when WE AGREED TO SPLIT THE BILL throughout our relationship. But that day was my birthday and tbh it was the worst birthday. 

Now, I’m thinking of breaking up because I don’t find us compatible. He’s not a bad man but I don’t think we can meet each other’s needs, may I get advice on whether I’m thinking this through correctly or should I give another chance?

I’d give anything to be able to be passive and let people come to me.,"It’s so exhausting having to do all the work in dating. Even before you get a date, if you’re not super physically attractive, as a guy there’s so much work you have to do. You have to get in shape, you’re told your hobbies aren’t good enough and to make more, you have to be confident and not insecure about anything just to get A DATE.

Then actually getting a date, guys have to make themselves vulnerable to ask out a woman. They make themselves open to rejection and typical women don’t have to. Then you have to push a boulder up a hill on the actual date with whatever woman you ask. You have to impress on the first date, I find that a lot of my guy friends don’t even focus on if the girl impresses them on the early dates, they’re so focused on trying to impress them that they can’t think for a second if the girl is impressive. 

Then you have to pay or you look like a miser or like you’re broke. Even after you’ve don’t all the work, you have to pay and the woman you’ve asked has only contributed by showing up and maybe being a good conversationalist who the guy enjoys being around.

Then as a guy you continue doing the majority of the work. If y’all want to drive the guy drives, if you get food the guy pays, guys buy gifts, they buy flowers, they put on a show just for the chance to have a relationship. Women can expect all of these things from a guy, and if he doesn’t do it, she could just as easily find someone who would do it.

It may be that I'm too afraid of the consequences of taking a little charge and taking opportunities, because I have zero ideas about real, healthy dating (social inadequacy of mine). By 'taking charge', I mean like stop being passive about my desires and a little active, like slight flirting without running a hundred possible outcomes in my head.

Maybe I'm just too ugly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no9gux/do_women_actually_care_about_height/
