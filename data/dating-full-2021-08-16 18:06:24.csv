She is mostly like me when it comes to silliness and humor and we can discuss endlessly about all kind of things. It just feels easy and effortless if you can understand what I mean. It just kind of flows.

But there are things I just can’t get out of my head. 
I personally want to have children one day - she says she does not, which is very, very bad.
I like to do a lot of sport. Calisthenics, hiking, things like that - she does not.
We both spoke about that and in general she is more like working most of her time on a horse farm which is kind of her hobby as well. In her free time she is also working on another farm. Horses are a major pet in her life. But other than that she doesn’t seem to have any major interests in anything what bothers me a bit because I wish she would like to go hiking with me or share some interests so we can do more than sitting on the couch talking.

So I learned about body language signs a girl like you, and I ended up realizing she likes me. 

I waited until May to make sure if she really was interested in me. After seeing several signals, and consistently, I made my move to get her phone number. We started to get to know each other, and she was reciprocating. After a week, I asked her out in person, she said yes.

However, after a few days, she opened up to me that she was still going through a recent break up. She then said it was best not to go out. I told her I understood, and that I hope she feels better with time. Here's the interesting thing, she still gives me signals to this day. Whenever I talk to her at work, she starts giving me signals, and we have good chemistry. She also recently began to open up to me about her family, nieces, etc. My friends say that she's still interested, and it could be she's hoping I'm still available when she feels ready.

Some of my friends have also advised that the ball is in her court now, so it's best I don't make a move again because I can't guess what her headspace is. In other words, let her come to me to tell me in a subtle way that she's ready for that date.

So my question to everyone, what would you do? What advice can you provide in a situation like this?

The gist as I remember it was this guy had a date with a girl from tinder, they vibe, they have their second date at some sort of house party with tinder date's roommates and some of OP's mates, OP apparently bought the drinks, not sure if for everyone or just for tinder girl. They vibe again but halfway through one of OP's friends starts dancing with her. His other friends tell him that wasn't okay and so he doesn't initiate anything anymore and decides to leave early. Tinder date swoops in and tells everyone she will accompany him to his car, later they all hear them having sex in the next room. OP has been humiliated in front of everyone and understandably breaks down crying in his car, end of story.

Now the issue I want to raise is not about the post but the comments, where there's a lot of arguing about who the asshole is. The notion of ""both suck"" gets met with ""just because he brought her drinks, doesn't mean he is entitled to having sex with her"". Most only fault OP's friend. That is a very messed up take.

Since when is female sexual liberation (which I'm a fan of) a wild card to being a giant narcissist that knowingly traumatizes other people?

First of all, if both knew they were hurting OP's feelings yet decided to still go forth and engage in this then they are both equally assholes.

Second, the girl is actually the much bigger asshole here, since she was the one who initiated the way it played out and could have pursued that friend in any number of other ways that didn't include humiliating OP like that. For instance she could have just given him her number and tell him to call her tomorrow. But no, her immediate sexual gratification was more important to her than OP's mental health. Incredible.

Yes, you don't owe anyone sex just because they brought you drinks.

Two hours later he was online again, which seemed unusual to me considering he wasn’t online the whole week before. Maybe this was just a coincidence, but it already made me wonder if he was avoiding my message before, or he was thinking about what to reply the whole time.
I hadn’t replied at this point yet, but while he was still online I did and asked him if he sometimes missed school. He didn’t answer and has not been online since then, it has been four days again already.

so last week his band mate/best friend got him a job at his work. it’s awesome for him. i’ve been working at a chain restaurant for about 3 weeks now. i really enjoy. it’s probably the first job of my life i’ve actually enjoyed. 

so now to the actual story. friday he found out he could start his new job monday. he ordered a pizza from my place and asked i take it home with me from work. i didn’t mind of course so i did. turns out one of my coworkers put the wrong pizzas in the wrong boxes and got our orders mixed up. before i left for the night i had to remake the pizza she had given us and got a lecture about making sure to carefully read over tickets. i was annoyed already about this. i get home and he flips out that it’s the wrong pizza. he starts talking about how he just won’t eat even though he hasn’t eaten all day. i offer to drive back and get him the right pizza even though i just worked an 8 hour shift and i have a condition that causes extreme pain in my back, legs and feet when i stand for long periods of time and i was dead beat tired bc it was a friday and really busy. the whole car ride back to my work he’s yelling about how everyone i work with is an idiot and the r slur and just overall saying really mean things about my new coworkers, who i really like. he talks about how my manager must be this miserable sad sack for working there for 9 years, i didn’t see anything wrong with it though. he obviously enjoyed the work. but finally when he gets the right pizza he calms down and apologizes. 
then all weekend all he could talk about is how much more he’ll be making than me and how he’s so happy to have a “real job”. it’s been making me feel really miserable about my work bc i feel like it’s not good enough for him anymore, even though he himself worked there for a brief period. so i was already feeling a little insecure and hopeless about my work, which is a big deal to me bc i have really bad depression and its really important to me that i don’t dread work like i have in the past. 
so comes monday and he wants to get a jump start on his training so he gets up at 5 so he can get there by 6, which means i also have to get up that early to take him. the day goes by fine and he texts me all day talking about how he’s found his place and he’s happy about his new work where so many of his friends work. don’t get me wrong i’m more than thrilled for him, it is very exciting to be at a place where you feel like you fit in. 
i worked at 2 pm and got off at 8. so around 6 i was taking a break and called him and he said he’d stay awake until i got home so we can spend a little time together. i get home and he’s asleep. i was a little annoyed about this but let him sleep. around 9 he wakes on his own and i ask if the dog needs taken out at all and he said he does but that he’ll do it. so i ask if he could stay up for a little bit when he gets back so i can tell him about my day, i had an amazing day at work and was really excited to share it with him. he says in a really aggressive tone “yeah it’s not like i need to get up at 5 am or anything.” so i just say i’ll take the dog out and he can just go back to bed. don’t worry about it. he then says “you don’t have to be such an asshole about it” 
i ofc was upset bc i didn’t think i was being an asshole, all i wanted was to spend an hour with him since i hadn’t seen him all day. i take the dog out and call my mom bc i was upset and wanted someone else’s opinion if i was being an asshole for just wanting to spend time with him. she said that he’s still adjusting to the new sleep schedule and i should just let it go. but it’s hard to let it go when someone so close to you calls you a mean name. when i got back down i went and sat in the closet bc i didn’t want to lay in bed next to someone who just called me an asshole. he starts blowing up my phone about how i need to come out and how are we gonna fix anything if i just hide. he has a valid point, i just have a really hard time with discussions. my whole life a discussion was sit down and shut up. so i walk out of the closet and all hell breaks loose. 

we start arguing about things from months and weeks ago. every time we fight he brings up how i live in his house rent free and i always ask him if he wants me to leave bc it makes me feel unwanted and unwelcome. i’ve told him this before, and what’s ironic is that he doesn’t pay rent either. he brought You how he puts gas in my car and gets gas money for me. i told him the only time i leave the house is so i can go to work and to take him wherever he needs to go. he then said that he’s not putting money and gas into a car that doesn’t take him anywhere. keep in mind that neither of us have had steady income for stuff like gas bc we both recently started working and haven’t gotten out checks yet. 
i then brought up how i take care of his dog during the day while he’s at work and his response was that he regrets letting me care for charlie. this really hurt bc he has a human son that the mother of says i’m not allowed to meet ever. this hurt bc i understand not meeting him after only a few months but ever? i was excited to meet his son at some point. eventually the fighting stopped and i started crying. he didn’t know but that day on my way home from work i actually felt hopeful and excited about my future with my work and that was a huge deal to me. it felt like he had stripped it away from me. his response to me crying was to turn to me and say “it’s not the end of the world you know” which completely invalided the fact that i was upset and he didn’t even know why i was upset to begin with. 

we ended up just going to bed without talking. the next day was tuesday and i was off work so i picked him up from his work and we had to run a few errands. i guess i wasn’t acting like my normal self bc he asked if i was mad at him. he has a tendency to just pretend nothing ever happened when we fight like that but that was the first time we fought in that manner. i told him i didn’t even know what to say to him and that i was really hurt by some of the things he said. he agreed that he was being a dick last night and came clean that he had been drinking before i got home. 
he has a problem with alcohol and wasn’t supposed to be drinking, his baby mama even told him that if he can quit drinking and smoking weed she’ll let him be more in his child’s life. so it was big deal bc at that point he had been sober for nearly three weeks. 

we talked a little more about it and agreed to just admit that we were both in the wrong. i still don’t think i was in the wrong but i wanted to move on. 

then on wendesday he had band practice and i was off again so i hung out with his friends. i’ve never really felt like i fit in with them, we have very different upbringings and don’t have any common interests. but since i moved in with him in a new city i didn’t have any friends of my own nearby. this is the part where i think i’m in the wrong. one of his friends girlfriends was there who i had never met before. she seemed really nice and genuinely trying to get to know me. she was asking about my home life and my family and we ended up talking about his drinking and smoking. i told her he’s been trying to quit for the sake of his son. she ended up leaving early and i was chitchatting with his other friend who i be seen many times at this point. she was asking about our relationship and if i see it going anywhere. i admitted to her that i was having doubts about our relationship bc of our fight and told her about some of the things he said. she gave me some really good advice and i felt better after getting some outside input. 

we left and the next day while he was at work he called me. he asked if i had said anything to his friends about him. i admitted that i did and told him i was feeling isolated and wanted someone to just listen to me. he told me he gets that but i shouldn’t have talked to his friends about it. apparently the girl i had never met before was really close with his baby mama and was only talking to me to get inside information on him to report back to baby mama. and then the friend i have met before went and told the whole friend group everything i said and now there’s a lot of drama between everyone. i feel bad for bringing everyone else into our fight but i was just trying to get advice from someone and i didn’t know who else to turn to. so our whole fight has restarted bc i told his friend and she told everyone else and everything’s a mess.

I (29F) have been dating a great guy (31M) for around 3 months now. We’ve been seeing each other a couple of times a week, lots of sleepovers, constant texting - everything has been great. 

There was a little blip a couple of weeks back where he thought I was about to ask him to go “official” (I wasn’t - though I’d like to) and he panicked and told me he wasn’t quite ready for that. His last couple of relationships have ended badly and so he’s being super careful not to get hurt again I guess. As disappointing as that conversation was for me, I decided that it was probably worth me being patient for a little while longer and seeing what happened. 

Couple of days ago after a few drinks, he referred to me as his girlfriend. I was a little surprised but didn’t react to it in case he’d said it accidentally (hi there social anxiety). Later on, he did the same thing again - we were laughing about a conversation we’d had with another couple earlier in the day when he said “I bet they looked at you and thought ‘her boyfriend is a right jerk’”. Again, I didn’t react to the use of the word “boyfriend” - though maybe I should have done.

What makes things awkward now though is that the next day when he was sober, he referred to me as his “friend” when speaking about me to a cab driver. V confusing!

So..  I'm dating this guy for 2.5 months now who is 5 years younger. I'm 33. 
I have had some pretty serious relationships; one from 7 years and some relationships around 1.5 years. I also lived together with a previous partner. I'm pretty serious when it comes to relationships. I like to get to know someone, invest in them, grow together and have a lovely time together for a - hopefully- long time.

He only had a one long-distance relationship and one relationship when he was 16. He never lived together and still lives at home with his parents.

I'm a sucker for deep connection's and honest conversations. For me a person is attractive when I feel this emotionally strong bond where your open, honest, ask questions, tell personal stories about Big or smal events that happened in your life and that lead up to who you are.

This guy is great when it comes to a lot of aspects but the connection just doesn't go any deeper since day 1. He is very interested in me, and showed me of to al his friends/sport friends whatever, talks about the future, wants to introduce me to his parents.

But i'm doubting more and more if it's just because of my physique or for me as a person.

The compliments are so shallow: your sweet, your pretty, your nice, your fit. And it feels so meaningless.  Never do I hear something about me as a person, my character or my traits that attract him.

When im dating I like to ask a lot of questions to get to know someone and learn more about them personally. Compliments that I gave are always personal, because telling someone is pretty.. doesn't mean a lot to me because it's something anyone can say.

The conversations are really shallow unless I ask him about things in his life. I told him once that I miss getting some questions back so he could get to know me. But I never got any. So now and then he asks; and you? After I ask a question, but even that's something he lacks of most of the time.

When we talk about feelings, I initiate it 9/10 times, sometimes he is even silent when I open up and says NOTHING. And then he later texts like: o, about what you said.. I just let you speak, but I have the same. 
I feel like; why is it so hard to say that in person? I'm not someone who is into texting, I rather have face to face talks.. it's wayyy more personal and special then a stupid text.

Whe are dating now for 2.5 months and I'm not sure about the whole thing.. Do I need to give it more time to develop a emotional bond, is it the lack of experience from his part with relationships, shall I bring it up again and hope that he understands what I need?

Do more people experience this huge difference in there relationships when it comes to the needs of having a emotional bond with your partner?

I never experienced anything like this so I'm not sure what to think about it.

You're happy spending the next 25 minutes talking about gardening. Listening, learning, joking., *responding to what they say*. it's their boat. you're bobbing along with it. you actually give a shit. you actually engage. 

I'm not saying *fake an interest*. I'm saying *be interested*. 

honestly. this trait is so simple. but it's so rare.

Three weeks ago on a Tuesday morning I match with a girl on Tinder. Almost immediately she messages me and soon after proposes we meet for a coffee before she goes to work in the next hour. I've got nothing going and we live less than a km away from each other (I'm in Poland) so I'm down for it. 

It goes well, we meet, chat for a bit, have some Starbucks, then she catches a tram to work. Later that evening, she invites me over to her place for some pizza, drinks, and meet some of her friends. After a fun night of hanging out and playing cards against humanity, we call it a night and head home at 1 AM. 

I was out of town for the rest of the week, but when I got home on Sunday, I let her know I'm back in town and would like to meet up, but then, she hits me with this:

""I must focus on work🥺 but if I will be available or something I will let u know that I'm bored or smth"" 

So I'm here thinking to myself ""Where did I go wrong? I thought it was going well"". It stung a little to read that, but I knew to keep my head up and keep moving forward. To my surprise however, the following evening, she texts me saying we should go to the gym the next morning. So Tuesday morning, we go to the gym, then she comes back to my place for a coffee and she needed to use my laptop to take a test for her work or something. Turns out she was somewhat genuine about her work. 

However, she kinda goes into a low mood after she finds out she failed the test. I'm an optimist so I try to keep her spirits up, but instead she wanted to go back to her apartment to smoke weed to relieve the stress from it I guess. Nevertheless, she thanks me for a good workout session, coffee, and letting her use my laptop, and we'll see you soon.

Except that was 2 weeks ago and I haven't seen her since. I just even just texted her now saying I'm thinking of going out Friday or Saturday night. She says she already has plans for Friday (fair enough), but Saturday she's not sure. At this point for me, anything but a yes is a no. 

So here I am once again trying to figure out where did I go wrong, but honestly, I'm not sure what. I made my intentions clear, that I didn't want to be just friends, we matched on Tinder after all. 

Still, I don't get it. One week she wants to see me and hang out, the next she doesn't. It's basically hot and cold behavior. I'm supposed to travel to the US next week for 5 weeks and then I have to go to the UK for work, so I really need to get ready for that now. 

I will continue to evaluate myself over the course of the 3 interactions I've had with her to find any mistakes along the way. One thing I have learned though is that you can do everything right, even on the first 3 dates, and it can still not work out. 

The important thing is to not take it personally and keep your head up. It'll sting a bit (it does for me), but just keep improving yourself to be the best you",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,958634,public,self,You can do everything right and it can still not work out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5qwcj/you_can_do_everything_right_and_it_can_still_not/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So we have known each other for a while (3 years, out of which I wasn’t available for long) and I have just became available lately. We have texted and he has been very responsive, and I think he likes me. Still, he never initiates conversation. It is always me. As I said, he answers promptly and reacts in a meaningful way to everything and anything I say, he asks questions but he doesn’t ever initiate.

1. He is gay - that is impossible because he would definitely not be the way he is if he were. 
2. He has someone - would he though? Would he be available to talk for hours if he had a girlfriend? On a Friday night?? My bad too, I never asked him. 
3. He is playing around, because it is nice to flirt. 
4. He is a wuss….? He thinks I’m still unavailable because I haven’t made it clear for real, only sort of given hints… so maybe he is careful. 
5. He is just respectful and thinks the client is needy…? Yes, I’m the client. They don’t make money directly off us, and him being more professional wouldn’t change a thing.

There’s no way he didn’t see me because after the fact I walked around to the other side of the counter and I could clearly see where I would have been. THEN last week I happened to be sitting on my front step and I saw him bike by house even though it’s not his usual bike route and is super far from his house. Then he liked my most recent IG photo, unliked it days later only to like it again. Couple days later as I was driving to work I saw him drive by my place. Cut to today, he came in **AGAIN** but my coworker helped him while I pretended to be busy and look away. He made a point of talking to me, then accidentally dropped his shit on the way out (it broke) and he was super embarrassed. When I looked out the window I noticed he parked his car right next to mine despite the entire lot being empty. He obviously knows what I drive so there’s no way he didn’t know I was working.

We are just friends with benefits at this moment. She’s really cool and sweet. Though it has been a minute since we last had sex. It’s been a while that I thought she lost interest in me, but I didn’t trip out about it because it is what it is. I have a very high sex drive whereas she doesn’t. Last night, we finally had sex again. 

This time I was a little surprised she wanted to do it. I asked if she was still into me. She said ofc. Then I asked if she really wanted to do this. She nodded yes. Then she replied, “I know you have a high sex drive so I’m just trying to please you at least”. This drove my anxiety through the roof. I am a survivor of rape/SA so consent is very important to me. I need it clearly and I need it to be said to me “yes” before proceeding. The thought of having sex with someone who’s not really in the mood, but they’re just doing it for me gives me so much anxiety. I cannot enjoy it if the other person isn’t enjoying it. I lose interest quick.

Be honest please. If you don’t want to do it, please tell me.” and etc. She said even if she isn’t in the mood, she likes seeing me happy bc I do truly enjoy the time with her. 

Idk if this pestering about having her consent is a trauma response. My anxiety is so so bad when I try to not annoy her about it. I can’t help but to feel like I’m pressuring her when it’s not my intention.

I got into my first relationship a little over 6 years ago. She was genuinely my everything. I loved her and did everything I could to make her happy. We talked around our 1 year about marriage and such and we had both agreed we wanted to be in a relationship for at least 2 years before getting engaged. Well, we passed the 2 year mark and I didn't wanna appear too over excited, but I had definitely decided this was the woman I wanted to marry and spoil the rest of my life. So maybe a month or so past our 2 year I brought it up and she abruptly said she could never imagine marrying me and she broke up with me that day. It shattered me and tbh, to this day I'm still healing. 

Anyway, big mistake, but I got into another relationship about a month after 1st girl and I had broken up. This 2nd girl told me I was the person she was looking for and I believed her. She spoiled me as much as I spoiled her and we seemed so happy. Eventually she brought up sex and after some talks I agreed to give up my virginity since I really believed she and I were gonna be married and we'd be together for ever. Well, you can probably sense where this goes, we didn't end up working out. Mostly because she cheated, got pregnant, and married this new guy.

The first 6 times he drove to me, I started going his way in March. We're not publicly exclusive since his parents are homophobic but all his friends know about us.

He had an anxiety attack/breakdown with me when I was there the last weekend of July for my birthday. Long story short, I drove the entire way to him for the first time (normally he picks me up halfway). My car was unsafe to drive home and he still insisted I left Sunday night, threatening to call the police to remove me if I didn't. He later apologized multiple times over text and phone once I got home. We'd never had any kind of fight or minor issue whatsoever until then.

Early on the first week of August, one of his cats needed emergency medical attention and he ended up making a $1000 goal gofundme for the bills. I put up $225 and got other friends on my end to put up $250. He was very appreciative of it multiple times.

That weekend, I went to a surplus store in my city he loves to use a $20 coupon I'd had for months since it was expiring later in August. Yesterday I asked him when I could come his way again to give him everything I bought, he said to remind him tomorrow.

I did once he got off work today and he unexpectedly (to me) suggested the weekend of September 18th. I'm supposed to start working an in-person fulltime job after August ends (I've worked remotely since right before covid).

I told him that and asked if it was possible for me to come stay with him either this Sunday or next Sunday through midweek. He ignored that part of my message, only asking what kind of job I'll be starting, then ignored me a second time. We've not talked tonight since then.

I'm thinking the only reason he's doing this is because he's not ready to physically see eachother in person after his breakdown, and he's just too nice to tell me. I guess I'm not sure what to do.

I am now a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug last month after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and extreme introversion.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, especially since I live in a semi remote area. Small town of 2000 people, about 40 mins from the nearest city.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. On top of that I am waiting for marriage which reduces possible dates even more. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Extreme introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"".

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated in a rural area and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

That’s a completely different conversation, but I was wondering like how common is it for guys to actually get hit on or asked when they go out. 

I ask this bc after I started going out I realized that it’s become normal (it’s maybe happened 4-5 times now) for a girl to come up to me and ask me out or call me cute or whatever. Usually it’s by girls I don’t find attractive and I just say I have a gf, but I always make sure to never be rude and tell them how much I appreciate it bc I 1) really do appreciate it and 2) respect that they’re going out of there way to talk to me.

I’ve had times where girls I find attractive make it easy for me to hit on them, by being extra nice or whatever, but I want to go after shy girls and girls that I actually like. I was out the other night and I just felt off even though I was talking to people and having a good time, and like my confidence wasn’t there for whatever reason. 

I’m saying this bc I feel like an imposter at times, like they’re just flattering me and I get really anxious when a relationship starts to begin, and I just want to find my person you know. I’ve only been in two almost relationships and they died out both at like the 3 month mark, and Id like to believe that I’m going to find someone and just click and everything will be all good, but it hasn’t happened.

I guess I think like since I’m not in a relationship or seeing anybody right now, it must be me.

I saw the name twice and disregarded then something came up later and  stimulated me to search the name, I don’t consider it too much of prying even though not like me to do so, it is 2021 and everyone’s on the internet. It in fact was his ex girlfriend. 

His first rebuttal to me was “ I don’t know who that is”

Second, “‘maybe it’s my sisters friend”

Maybe? Ha

I think it’s really a farfetched response.

When if he just said an ex from a while ago would’ve just ended the conversation and I wouldn’t have asked anymore nor cared but since lied I am really conflicted.
