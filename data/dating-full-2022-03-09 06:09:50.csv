So I am writing tonight because I just can't get some things off my mind and need to know if there is something wrong with me. I am 25 and a guy, and I have never been in a relationship. Last time I kissed a girl was right before the pandemic started. I live in Vegas so social life is not hard. I am finishing up my degree so I can get a job. I live with roommates and I now thankfully work out and lift. I have a healthy social life with a lot of friends both girls and guys. My issue is is that I seem to be surrounded by a bunch of hornballs who seem to have an easy time going out and dating and having casual sex. I have never dated or had sex or was ever really motivated to. I have gotten there almost a few times but a mix of drinks and nerves made it impossible. Since then I just have never really been comfortable dating or trying to hook up or anything. I so desperately want to feel like I am normal and can do what seems to come so easily to everyone. I feel like I am missing out on so much and losing out on so much experience and its's getting to the point where I don't really want to live if I know the future things will just get more difficult and painful. I don't know how to date, how to take a girl out, what to do, where to go, or what to talk about. I am incredibly shy for how social I am. I hate all the dating apps because they're honestly a pain in the ass and absolutely not productive. Please can anyone offer any advice on how to cope with being such a loser? Is no experience a red flag? Why does everyone, and I literally mean EVERYONE, have the ability to just do all these things and put their anxieties away and find the motivation to go out? I feel like I have either 0 libido or I just am incompetent of a person. Either way I don't know if I can do this anymore.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163050,public,self,"I have little to no experience and need help/advice, please!

I've been in both ends of the relationship. Where I've been the class-wise the poorer one or the one seemingly better off. I say seemingly since in both situations I'm still like lower-middle-class. I've found it really hard to date when our backgrounds or incomes are so different, and feel guilt or shame in both situations. 

Also, being a girl, I feel like my partners who were less off income-wise become bitter towards me. And my existence seemed to be emasculating them. On the other side when I (in a way) had less, I felt that my partner would look down on me and my upbringing or would judge me if I splurged a bit too much. Which was not fun. 

Anyways, being in my mid-twenties and recently single, I've realized money has played a huge role in my relationships. How it created discomfort that was hard to remedy. Or, it magnified gender roles in a way where I didn't know how to be less intimidating for my partner. I was just curious if this was something others have thought about. 

\*Sorry if it's a silly question. I assume money is something people think about, but obviously isn't the end-all factor of any relationship.

Been on two dates with a guy I’m crushing on hard. He works in film production and he’s told me in person that he’s not a huge texter (partially bc he has to stare at screens all day) but we have great physical and emotional chemistry. Both of our dates have been super fun and we’ve both really enjoyed each other’s company.

He works around 10-6 sometimes later during the week, has a side business on the weekends sometimes plus he plays DND with his friends. All in all, he usually can only hang on weekend nights. 

I’ve had a particularly rough few months financially, and I had a promising interview for a new position that’s pretty much all nights and weekends. I think this is going to make seeing each other really difficult.

I’ve read a few threads on here with dating advice on opposite schedules and stuff online but it seems like it’s geared towards people who are already in established relationships not for people seeing someone new. 

I’m torn because while the obvious thing to do is communicate and talk about it, we’ve had to postpone our third date due to scheduling difficulties before this (last weekend he had to work late and had to cancel last minute but was very apologetic, and this weekend im out of town) &amp; I worry that putting too much pressure on him will scare him away and ask both of us to try and either communicate better on the phone or sacrifice our sleep schedules and during the nights that I don’t work if he’s more receptive to seeing me when he gets off work, even though I know he’ll be drained from a long day at work. He also lives about 30 minutes away from me and I don’t have a car and he told me he doesn’t mind driving.

Since he told he prefers face to face in person interactions, my gut instinct is to be vulnerable and tell him the next time I see him that I really like him and want to find a way to make it work, and im hoping he’ll be receptive and understanding especially since he knows that money has been tight for me. 

What would be the best way to navigate this predicament with someone who you’re dating whose new? It feels like a third date is too soon to setup these kinds of expectations.

Dear K.B.,

       I miss you and love you so much!! I'm sorry for everything that ever happened between us. The lies the women everything! Despite what you thought my intentions were the love for you was always real. You could walk into a building or a room and automatically you were the most beautiful person there. I loved you for you being you. Without makeup without the big boobs. I looked at you as beautiful. Your stretch marks were a thing of beauty. They were you battle scars from your 5 kids. Loved the way when you did hair how intense you were.

Being around you made everything ok. Despite if we had a horrible arguments days or weeks before. I miss you and I love you still. But something changed. I hurt you time and time again. And for that I can't apologize enough. I betrayed your trust and told you lies. Truth is right now it hurts so bad not being able to talk to you or see you. So many lies I can't take back. I'm not here to win you back. I'm here to say I hope you find happiness. And that you find someone that loves you unconditionally. 

Truth is I have no idea how to let you go. I know you've moved on. And I should do the same. But it hurts so bad. I do miss your smile and your laugh. Holding you while you slept. Our 15 min fights then our foot hugs. The way you wrapped your arms around me when you hugged me. The way I could tell you really loved me by the way you looked in my eyes.

Fellas don't be like me and take someone for granted. Because if you think you won't miss her. You will. It's the toughest pains emotionally I've ever felt.

I end up meeting them there and also met my date afterwards. 

For the beginning I was just dancing with my girlfriends (which consist of one long time friend of 10 years, her roommate who I’ve known for maybe just over a year, and another who I’ve only met twice) but later into the evening I stayed with my date. 

Before this night, I did a bit of an internet background check on said date, and found a trickle of evidence that indicates he either used to date or have a fling with my friend’s roommate two years ago. 

By affiliation I am technically friends with this girl. She saw me dance with him all night and hasn’t said anything since.

Me and said date aren’t in a serious relationship but are open to the possibility. 

Tonight he told me about his past relationship with said roommate and wanted to clear the air because for all he knew, we could be cousins or something lol.

A quick synopsis of the myself (27F) and the 30M I'm talking to:

* Started talking in June 2021 after I followed him on insta. A month later when we went into a city-wide lockdown for 4 months. We continued talking and built a relatively strong connection. We've know been talking for 8 months now.
* Continuously messaging and talk on the phone every other day for a good hour/two hours
* Try to see each other once a week but we're both professionals (he's a lawyer, I'm a marketing exec) so our work schedules are crazy. We respect each other's careers so it's not a big deal to either of us.
* We haven't had sex - I'm waiting for marriage. He knows this and while we have sexual banter &amp; chemistry, he knows I won't change. He even made a comment that he is compartmentalizing sex so he doesn't view me and make me feel uncomfortable.
* He has messaged me 'I love you' twice while he has been out drinking and when I asked if it was a joke, he said no. I think there are feelings on his end but not that deep.
* He has been in 3 long term relationships (all 3+ years - one cheated, the other two was a difference in values) - I've only been in one that lasted for 9 months (got cheated on)
* From my perspective, we connect on every level.
* He's told me he's not talking to anyone else or that he's on any dating apps (I've never been on dating apps) and gets triggered whenever I'm out with male friends or co-workers.

I want a relationship and I've always said this. He did tell me 3 months in that he struggles with expectations of a label and that he doesn't want the infatuation phase/the hormones you normally get in the beginning control his decisions. I agreed as I think a strong friendship foundation is required for any relationship but I'm at a point where I need a label. I feel like I'm being strung along.

This guy struggles with vulnerability and I believe he is emotionally unavailable deep down.

How do I handle this conversation in a non-combative way? I want to be able to say that we are technically dating now and he should respect me enough to not string me along if he doesn't see anything going forward. I want him to be proud to call me his girlfriend and I need security with him to break down my own emotional walls.

First of all, I'm very hairy. Grooming the hair makes it look unnatural and not actually better. I have a decent looking face, but my body is shaped like a pear. I have a female body shape despite being male, but all of my blood work comes back normal. I don't have some kind of hormonal balance or disease that makes it this way.

On top of this, I haven't really dated in 7 years. I used to have a girlfriend who was way out of my league and I just never really had decent sex since then. It happened a couple of times but I could never be attracted to my partner in the same way.

I also am unable to drive, I have a license, but can not afford a car and due to some minor mental health issues, have some difficulty with paying attention. I probably would end up in a car accident before long if I did drive. I am otherwise a bright and at times charming individual. I'm a pretty smart guy.

Lastly, my hobbies are playing the guitar and learning Japanese. I think that this is alienating for women close to my age. I'm not a mature person and don't really want to be.

I am aware that in order to attract a mate I need to exercise. Although because of my fat distribution and difficult body hair, I don't even think my body will ever be attractive. Because of my inability to drive, my personality, my looks, I might have to give up dating for good. It's also worth mentioning that I have unnatractive private parts as well.

I see how women look at attractive men and have never been desired by the opposite sex in the same way. It seems like someone will have to settle for me and will never really want me. My ex left me because she said she could do better.

I went on a last-minute date with a girl Sunday. She took a while to respond over the dating app, maybe a message at minimum once a day from her over a week. Sunday, she’s talking to me a lot and said she needs to find something to do, so I say want to go for a date? And then she says yes. Fast forward to the date, it goes great. We go roller skate, get boba. She lets me have some of hers, and then we go for a walk for like an hour and half. We talked about friends. She tells me about her roommate and their code words to save each other from dates, then then we had a quick kiss, then went to McDonald’s and shared food and one sprite. She talks about her past relationships and family, how she was so scared for the date and had to have her friends come over and help her pick out clothes. She tells me she always has to ask her roommate what to say to not mess it up with me. We talk on the way back to her dorm, and she’s holding my hand on the drive back and playing with my fingers, then kiss goodbye, and then I go back to my place an hour away and we planned another date this weekend in whole detail time place and what we are doing. Welp, yesterday I got one message to a good afternoon at like 7 pm, and today she sent what I thought about. I’m not in the suitable headspace for something like this, and when I asked what I did wrong so I can fix it going forward, she said I did nothing wrong, and that’s she’s not emotionally available. So I wanted to ask did I do something wrong cause I feel like this happens to me once or twice a month and I can’t tell if it’s just bad luck or did I do something wrong.

I’ve (23m) been single now for roughly 5 months and I’m actively trying to get myself back into the dating lifestyle. Not looking for anything too serious at the moment, my last relationship lasted 2 years until she pulled the plug and I’m not ready for that kind of commitment again yet. That said, I’m loving getting to know people and seeing where things go at a more casual pace.

All sounds rosy doesn’t it? Fast forward to last night. I’m not usually one to be dramatic, but while at a student gig the most perfect, beautiful girl I’ve ever laid eyes on. And she started flirting with ME. Everything about her, her looks, her laugh, her smile, was as if I had won some sort of cosmic lottery. 

So obviously, my entire sense of independence crumbled and I bricked up big time. We talked for ages, made each other laugh, had compatible interests but also wildly different ones to spark intrigue, and were immediately comfortable in each others company. But when push came to shove, at the end of the night I couldn’t find the courage to ask for her number or any way to contact her. And then she left.

Since becoming newly single no one had made me feel such a mix of emotions. Even my exes hadn’t really been particularly inspiring in that department. So to see this person, so perfect in every way, walk away was soul shattering. I didn’t sleep very much last night. 

I don’t really know why I’m writing this here or what I hope to gain, I suppose putting the words out into the world might help me at least get on with my day lol.

Friday and Saturday she will hang out with other ppl).

So she agreed on meeting. I said, ""alright, I have two suggestions, thursday night: dinner or bar, whatever hour suits you""

she said ""Actually, I'm going on thurday with some friends to a pub, wanna join?"" 

I agreed on that based in many reasons: A) if she friend zoned me, then I don't care and I would just go there and have fun with new ppl + dance (win-win). B) we haven't talked that much and maybe she is not secure around me? (but this doesn't make any sense, since I told her bar or dinner, just 1-1), or maybe she didn't want to feel awkward 1-1? or works better with group ""supporting"" the situation (which again, turns me off and just makes me wanna have fun and not intent anything further.). C) she wanted approval from their friends (?) or see if I was not a creep or see if I was ""friendly open"".

she has showed signs of interest in me.

I mostly agreed bc It turned me off, and thought: ""well fuck it, now I want to have fun, meet this new people and, most of all, be myself"" But there was and option I didn't thought. I should have re-scheduled for next week to make sure it's 1-1 thing, now I seem like if I where easy to get. But in reallity, is that I wasn't playing games whatsoever.

We went out on one date/hang out and we said at the end that we'd do it again. Didn't think much of it, people always say that just to be nice. I wasn't opposed to it, but I felt indifferent toward him since I could barely hear him the whole date lol. Throughout the months he would sometimes invite me to go downtown/parties with him and his friends, which I never wanted to do only because I barely knew him. Fast forward to around the end of January this year, we started texting again on snapchat. He asked me out to go to a park with him and get food, it was cute it was fun. It lasted literally 12 hours as we went back to his place to do a Star Wars marathon. Nothing happened. We hung out every weekend since then and he would make very respectful signals of touching me, like cuddling once, rubbing my feet, but he never crossed boundaries if I wasn't giving signals. I've hung out with his roommates and after talking with all of them, I can tell him and his friends have the viewpoint of not wanting to come off as a creep by being too forward with a girl. That's fine, I don't mind kissing first if I know for sure as well, which was what I did eventually. After a month of going out every weekend, we slept with each other. 

My issue that I'm having is that after he asked me to the park, which was technically our second date, he doesn't really initiate any of the other outings. I've mentioned this to him in a drunken state at the club and he invited me out to a restaurant with him the next day. That day was when we finally kissed and extra, and a couple days later he invited me over on my day off. I just don't want him to see me as a fwb. We've talked about past relationships and he's told me that after a toxic relationship of his, he's much preferred to get to know the girl and be more cautious who he invests his feelings in. It's so weird because one day I think he likes me then the next I think he doesn't. Right after I leave his place, he texts me sometimes before I even leave the complex. He's very consistent with texting and when I do initiate our hanging out, he never declines or flakes, even if he has to do something after. After we broke our physical barrier, he cuddles me and holds me and kisses my forehead, etc. If I sleep over he cuddles me *all* night and won't let go even when we wake up. But even in text sometimes it's hard. I'll ask him questions or how his day was and he'd tell me but never ask me back :/ I mean, Ima tell him anyway lol, but I want a question back. Sometimes he'll ask me how I'm doing or how my day was, but I wished he'd want to get to know me more as much as I wanna get to know him.

What do you guys think? Does it sound like he likes me or not? Should I just cut my losses? I'm hot and cold with how I feel on whether he likes me or not, but I just don't want my anxiety to self-sabotage if he really is interested. I just feel it's too soon to directly ask him, especially after what he's said about liking to get to know the person first. I don't wanna scare him off, but now that the relationship is sexual, it means something more to me even if we are taking our time emotionally. I  wanna know if the interest is there so I can carry on lol. I just don't wanna be used in a physical way as it's happened to me before and it fucking sucks.

Because I spent 30+ years not forming relationships of any kind, I find myself to be very socially stunted. I don’t read cues very well, communicating is incredibly difficult, etc. I am in therapy but haven’t felt like it’s been helping too much.

We met, we stayed together happily for 3 months. But i had to come back home now cause i had completed my course there.(it was IELTS course) Now here is the thing ik it will sound very corny but initially when i went there both of uses feelings were evolving. At least with my assumptions we were were not in love initially but after spending a quality time with each other for certain now i was sure we were in love. But the thing is he didn't used to give time much. He used to take me granted a lot. Prolly he used to think im gonna stay anyway but i dont think the love was less to be quiet frank. I tried to talk about it a lot. Infact till the time i broke up the only thing we had a fight bout was in this topic. About he not giving me enough time. I tried to tell him that i dont like when he takes me for granted and dont give me enough time. He used to listen too. But after some days or weeks things would be same. So for the second last time i said if you think you cant give me time i dont think i'll be able to pull it off. So we walked our talk and believe me or not after that fight i thought this might not be the topic we 'll fight for ever now for some reasons. Things were at its best after that talk. Couldnot get any better type of best. But then 1 month passes by and i am in my home now cause i had to come back. And same old guy he had become not talking to me giving me enough time.

I want to spend time with him, that is how things started getting worse. We didnot use to talk for 2 days straight. Prolly 2 text we used to exchange. I was not happy in this relationship. I talked about it to him as well AGAIN. sadly he was going through some shit too but he would talk about it to me. I didn't force him to talk about it but still i wanted him to share.

I want to know if I should ask this girl out and if so how.

Context: I’ve known This girl for around 4-5yrs, we don’t see each other that often only at events setup by a place we both Volunteer at.. I’m 16 about to be 17 she’s 17.. I’m in year 12 and so is she, and in year 8 we went to the same school, around year 10 is a point we were closest, the place we volunteer at setup a trip to New York where we met other groups of volunteers and sight saw ect ect, this trip was for 2 weeks, the first week was kind of casual and the second week we started to get rly close, hit it off rly rly well.. at first I didn’t rly think of it that way but then I started to “catch feelings”, after the trip we still talked quite a bit and she showed signs that she might be into me as well, me being the“smart kid” that I was I didn’t ask her out because of lack of balls and the fact I thought high school dating wasn’t important. Because of this we didn’t see each other for a long time cause of Covid and we were not in the same school anymore, it was hard but I “got rid” of the feelings and tried to forget about it, sometimes I see an Instagram post or something and I would think about her for the next couple days again but then it would fade.. -Fast-forward to Late year 11-12, I started seeing her again once a week at the place we volunteer.. I try to hang around her as much as possible but honestly I don’t see any signs of the attraction reciprocated. (Might just be oblivious) she’s quite serious and nice so I’m not sure.. the the girl who dates “everyone” u could say.. 

And that brings us to today.. I went to another event today and saw her very briefly with another one of her friends.
I’m decently close to that friend and see her even more than the girl I like but she’s just a mutual friend.. super nice ect ect, today the friend asked me when I was gonna ask the girl I like out!, Around a year ago the friend asked me if I like the girl and I didn’t say no but I didn’t give a definite yes (just for some context)

And finally my question, should I ask her out.. I’ve had girls into me before but I always just separated myself from it cause I didn’t think dating was worth it in highschool but im right on the verge of “fuck it” atm, so im not rly experienced to say the least with dating at all and would have no clue what to do..

1. People ghost or don't respond a lot:  Whether you're on a dating app or on something like Reddit R4R, it's not the exception to get no response to your messages or swipes, but the rule.  This is probably one of the big reasons for the ""mental grind"" that OLD can cause on people's self esteem and psyche.  Because it really is frustrating to feel like you didn't even get to properly shoot your shot, or that you were dismissed for no reason.  There are people who say to maybe wait a while and see if maybe there was just a misunderstanding, but honestly?  Both saying absolutely nothing until they respond days later (hopefully at least) or carrying on a one-sided conversation in an attempt to fan the flames is not a good look and the second option will definitely trip red flags in a lot of people.  For the sake of your mental health, I would just say unmatch, say farewell, whatever you need to do, and try again.
2. Tinder can't just be gamed, it *has to be gamed*: Tinder sucks.  Most dating apps suck.  This is just a natural thing.  In terms of Tinder, I've heard there's some sort of mythical ""guy with the funny bio"" or ""super attractive guy"" who gets tons of matches, but I've never met them, so this isn't about those people.  Tinder has a 24 hour expiration date on swipes.  This *directly de-incentivizes* you to *ever* swipe outside of a very limited time.  For people my age, many of them are working wage slave, uncertain hour jobs, but the best practice is always going to be to only swipe on Saturdays and Sundays, late night hours.  This is going to be the most likely time other people will actually be online.  I'm not sure how much this applies to other dating apps, but I imagine it works in a similar manner for at least some of them, possibly to the point that they only show the most recent swipes on someone, incentivizing you even more to limit your ""swipe days/hours""
3. Don't lose hope:  OLD is a mess.  It honestly would be better to just go outside, but for some people, that's not entirely a possibility.  In video game terms, you are a Hollow, come to the Land of the Relationshipless.  You are Solaire, looking for your very own Sun.  Giving in to your despair and hopelessness is a path to insanity, and possibly inceldom.  Try to remind yourself that you are a good, valuable person.  Spend time with friends.  Make friends if you don't have friends.  Constantly work to improve yourself.  Remember that you're not alone.

I think that's what I've learned so far.  Hopefully, if I'm not consumed by the encroaching darkness, I will return with more insights.

Tried dating when I was in high school and college, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. Didn't help that I'm demisexual, and due to abuse from age 10 until I moved out at 17, I was very uncomfortable with these guys wanting sex within just a few dates. Thankfully I've had a longterm FWB for many years, who is my closest friend and was extremely patient. We typically have sex 4x a month, in addition to normal hanging out.

The thing is, he's moving away in about 6 years, so I'll have to find a new sex partner. And honestly, other than the fact I really don't want to be celibate, I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with reasons to get back in the dating pool. 

I've never wanted kids or marriage, so those are off the table. I'm completely debt free, with a decent $80k job, and don't care about a man's money, car, housing situation, etc. Currently work 40-50 hours a week, saving up to start my own brick-and-mortar business, so not a lot of free time. I do hang out with my gaming group (all married or committed guys) every Friday and Saturday, and have lunch/dinner with my younger sisters twice a month. With all of this, my life feels happy, busy, and fulfilling as-is. 

How do I make myself feel like dating? I would like another FWB, a man to enjoy sex and split the occasional movie/dinner/short vacation with, but who doesn't want to get married, live together, or share finances...But unfortunately, on dating apps and in singles meetups, it seems this is what the overwhelming majority of men 35-50 are looking for.

We went to elementary and high school together, and she quickly become something of a surrogate big sister for me, always looking out for me and all that. Our relationship has always been completely platonic. Nevertheless, over the past few years I've been developing strong feelings for her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting here that Clarissa was violently raped back in 2019. I held her hand all throughout therapy and she's always thanked for being ""her rock"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, back in December 2021, she was hanging out at my apartment. We were just lying in my bed together watching funny Youtube videos. Long story short: I asked Clarissa if she wanted to have sex with me. She then laughed and jokingly told me ""when you're old enough"". She likened our relationship to that between a brother and his doting big sister: completely platonic and nothing intimate. She just patted me on the head and told me ""you're my little bro, not my boyfriend"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was really looking forward to getting into her pants that night, and I was so upset and angry that she'd lie in bed with me and all of a sudden become a huge tease. At that moment I thought that she was being so unappreciative of me being there for her throughout her recovery for the past 2 years. I acted perfectly fine, however, and told her that it's alright no hard feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A few days afterwards, we went to the gym together. Clarissa has always been one of those super sporty, athletic tomboys and she often encourages me (a couch potato) to come work out with her. That day, however, I just decided to take a break and sit on the bench and chat with my gym friends while she was running on the treadmill. She was wearing nothing that day except for some very short shorts and a barely-there, low cut spaghetti strap sports bra.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After about 30 minutes of running, she came up to me, looking scared. She timidly asked me if I could go to the car (I gave her a ride) and grab her long-sleeve shirt for her to wear. I told her instead that I was feeling too lazy. So Claire looked at me with these ridiculously sad, desperate eyes and told me that she was ""feeling exposed"" and wanted to cover up some skin. She said it was about ""that thing"" (the term we use to describe her rape). I could tell that she was trying her best not to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was still feeling really upset over how she turned me down in bed, so I bluntly told her to get her shirt herself and that she shouldn't dress up half-naked all the time if it makes her so scared. I mockingly patted her head as I told this to her, as a throwback to when we were lying together in bed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I regret ever saying those words to her. She broke down and started crying, and was soon having a full-blown panic attack. She kept whimpering ""please"" and kept her arms crossed over her chest and shoulder straps as if she were terrified that somebody would rip her bra off. The gym staff came over, and it took a full hour for them to calm Clarissa down and get her to stop crying. They eventually called her younger brother, who came and picked her up. Claire actually covered my ass and told her brother that she just had a random panic attack, and completely left out everything I said to her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel mortified for making Clarissa cry. Ever since then I've been calling and messaging her nonstop, apologizing and telling her that I should've just gotten her shirt for her. She never responds to my messages. I even drove to her apartment earlier this year and tried apologizing to Clarissa in-person. She opened the door and as soon as she saw me she started sobbing and whimpered ""oh my god please"" and shut the door. That was the last time I saw her. I just want my ""big sister"" back. Is there any hope at all? She seems absolutely terrified of me now.

Second, I'm so sorry this is going to be long, mostly just wanting to vent and maybe see if anyone else has had this happen to them. 

As the title says I'm worried I'm just never going to be enough for anyone, and not in the someone loves me but they do wish I had a certain characteristic way. But in the no one is ever going to be able to see past something and even give me a chance. 

I've been single for almost 3 years, and these last couple years of trying to date have destroyed my confidence and my hope of finding another relationship. The common theme seems to be that there's just one piece of me that is just not good enough for them, and it's usually how I look. I'm not hideous by any means but I know, realistically, I'm a 6 at best. 

I've had plenty of disheartening dating experiences but this last one just has me broken. 

Let's call the guy J. J and I met on tinder, good chat both of us talked about how we kind of suck at texting and getting points across over text so we agreed to meet up and for a drink. We going to one of my usual bars, very low key usually not very busy so a good place to sit and have a conversation. Date goes well, actually fuck that, I think it goes amazing best date Ive had in years.  Conversations kept flowing, we seemed to be on the same page in our life and we seem to agree on every topic that came up. (Now one of my friends had asked if I was saying things and he was just agreeing to me, no. For most of our conversations he was the one starting it and giving his opinion first so I know he wasn't just agreeing with me to be polite) anyway dates over we go outside have that awkward waiting around to see who's going to make a move and eventually he just asked can he give me a kiss to which I say yes. Amazing, a man with a job, apartment, and car, who asks for consent after an amazing date. 

Next time we hang out we're hanging out at my apartment because we both smoke so we thought we'd have a smoke sesh. Again goes great we're watching shows we both really enjoy and talking about it, at no point do we talk about something that one of us gets awkward about or someone gets uncomfortable about or do we have such a different viewpoint does it cause an argument just perfect flow the whole time. He goes to leave again and we do the awkward standing around waiting for one another to make a move and he gives me another kiss. 

The next and last time we hang out, same thing as before smoke says hanging out good conversations everything seems to be going well. Then kind of seemed out of the blue, but we'd been hanging out for a couple hours, he suddenly was like I need to go home I need to go to bed I have to wake up early, which I know is true he does work very very early hours so although I thought that seems weird that he left so suddenly, he does have to be up early. He got up so fast by the time I set my glass down in the kitchen and turned around to go give him the kiss goodbye he was opening the door and leaving. So right then I knew something was up. 

I don't say anything I don't text him I don't want to come across as too overbearing, you know it's just one time he didn't give me a kiss goodbye no big deal. Next morning I get the text. 

He texted me to explain why he didn't give me a kiss when he left. He said he just felt like we weren't on the same page and that although he would hook up with me he doesn't want to date me and he didn't want to make me feel used so he just left without giving me a kiss. I'll be honest I was blindsided. Felt like slapped in the face. I thought everything was going great, we seem to have a great connection we seem to be on the same page about what we're looking for out of life, things that are important to us in a partner ect. 

So I replied back pretty much just like oh I thought it was going really well and I was really starting to like you but I'll leave you alone if that's what you want. He continues. Saying he's sorry and he didn't mean to lead me on but and this is where it starts getting questionable, our ""styles"" don't match....  I asked him what he means, because quite frankly if you had just looked at us our actual styles were so similar. And at this point I can tell that he doesn't want to tell me the real reason that he is not interested in me anymore, because of this excuse I can't buy. 
 
He says that he just doesn't think our styles match because ""I'm more conservative but I like a girl to have dark hair tattoos and piercings and you don't have that. And I thought I would just come see you a couple times and see what happened. I am attracted to you, and you have a lot going for you and you deserve a really good man.""..... So he doesn't want to date me because I don't have dark hair and piercings, I have tattoos..... Really? Really? He even said that he does not meet a lot of women that were like me, that had the things I had, that had the personality I had, and the first couple times we hung he kind of would just mention that it's cool that I'm where I'm at, and so cool that we have like the same interests. Buttttttt since I have the wrong hair color he can't date me? That's his big dating deal breaker hair color and piercings? Everything else about me checked out personality wise job wise motivation wise family wise, at least from what we would talk about, but he said and I quote ""I just don't want date you because you don't have those things"" 

(Also side note you can't really, at least to me personally, say that you are attracted to someone while also saying the reason you don't want to date them is because of their appearance lol) 

Am I the only one that thinks that is utter bs? Is this really what dating is at now? You can have the personality they're looking for the lifestyle they're looking for, interested in all the things I want you to be interested in, but if you have the wrong hair color they won't date you....really? 

I've spoken to a couple friends about it, and honestly his excuses for not wanting to see me anymore we're so funny I had to take screenshots, also to maybe ask my friends if I was acting crazy and he really just had a good reason but so far everyone is saying that he's just lying and he didn't want to say the real reason. 

So I guess to the men out there, if you found a girl who checked all of your boxes except she didn't have the hair color you typically prefer, and didn't have enough piercings would you think you can't date her or she's just not good enough to date because of that? 

So I'm terrified. Terrifying that I can be everything someone wants me to be, but because I'm just not a super attractive woman I'm going to be kicked to the curb every time. It's been years of kind of similar situations. Dates go well they tell me that I'm an amazing person and I'm so great and I deserve such a good man.... Just not them. And I deserve to be happy and I deserve to be with someone, but they don't want me. And usually when I ask, they politely as they can say they're not physically attracted to me. How do I forget that I'm not very attractive and try to date again? I feel like I don't have trust anymore to even go on a date because I think the whole time I would be sitting there thinking, he's probably deciding right now that I'm not attractive enough and I'm going to get home and get the text saying you weren't attractive enough.

So I met this guy \[M25\] on bumble about a month ago, we talked for like 2 weeks nonstop. We vibed heavily and discovered that we happen to live in the same neighborhood (which is a huge coincidence living in a major world city). So, we decided to meet up at a place we both frequent for lunch. The date was great, we talked for nearly 3 hours about nearly everything. We talked about how we should do this and that next time we hang out, and even invited me to come over sometime to bake with him (we're both bakers). Before leaving we exchanged contact info and hugged before agreeing to see each other again. I left with all smiles, pleasantly surprised it went so well.

I message him later that night saying I had fun, and asked if he wanted to hang again next week. He didn't respond for 2 days, which at that point I was a bit hurt but cut my losses and moved on. The next day he respond saying he had a lot of fun too and was keen to hang again, made an inside joke from our date. I replied asking if he wanted to go see batman with me that weekend since we talked about it and the theater is in our neighborhood. No response again for 3 days. Confused, but cut my losses again and went to see the movie by myself (it was great btw 10/10). I walk out of the theater and check my phone, he responded. He apologized for being MIA and said he had to fly home to his family, but will message when he's back.

I'm just confused? We talk on instagram and I can see when he was last online or read my message. He genuinely hasn't been active in the last 2 days or read my message.
