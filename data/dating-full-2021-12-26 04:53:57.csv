I am at most times just feeling hidden in the dating world and feel like it’s getting pretty hard especially with Covid &amp; all. Im conventionally attractive [m], early 20s, decent personality, and built a foundation to be well off-ish in life so far. The problem is that I just can’t get past the “talking” stage at all. These “pre-relationships” go well (in my eyes); lots of common interests, overt flirting, reciprocation of feelings and sometimes sex. The problem kicks in right around the month mark each time, after excellent dates or conversations they either just ghost or state that they’re just not in the right mind to continue. Even after something as personal (to me) as sex, they’ll be extra sweet and nice but then just leave after a few more times. Keep in mind that I NEVER push to relationships and remind myself constantly to respect boundaries and just relax. Is now just not the time to pursue relationships at all?

And one day he came up to me and asked me for my name and my snapchat so I added him and he told me that he was mesmerized by my eyes. 

The thing is he’s kinda a bad boy and a player , he’s so outgoing with other girls and not just like that , sometimes he jokes with my other co-workers when he passes by and ignores me (even tho I’m the only one who is friends with him) and sometimes he gives me all his attention and flirts a lot like A LOT , he even gave me his personal favorite pin from his chest and put it in my sleeve and he told me “don’t be shy when you need anything just tell me” he even fought with drunk guys who harassed me late at night and he stayed until I closed the shop and made sure that I went safely to my car. 

I don’t know what to do with him he’s hot and cold and I’m confused I don’t want to break my heart again and I’m scared.

Another note I’m kinda cold with him and I don’t respond to his flirting like other girls so he sometimes tries harder for my attention and he said “don’t be harsh on me just be easy and open up to me” and when I text him he takes hours to reply. 

I know he’s not completely a bad boy he helps me a lot and always make sure I’m fine , I’ll give him that.

I am fine with the jokes, however, I really like her. I trust her, enjoy spending time with her and we have post-college plans as well.

He said he I mean a lot to him and he thinks about me everyday and he didn’t want it to end this way and he wanted to see me. Fast forward and he put off seeing me for two weeks. He has had some mental health issues and had just been diagnosed with adult ADHD and he was really upset about it. When I did see him it just went back to how it was and I wonder if he put off seeing me so I would have second thoughts about ending it. I’m so confused about what he wants from me. What I want to know is whether sex is enough to keep a guy hanging on even when I told him the situation is making me feel worthless and like I don’t matter.

&amp;#x200B;

My family is absolutely fucking insane. They are *extreme* Evangelical fundamentalists that insisted on ""homeschooling"" me as a child. I put that in quotation marks because there really wasn't much school involved, it was several hours of praying/reading the Bible as well as a little bit of math. Due to the fact that my parents are part of a very small, very extreme (growing up my dad taught us that 9/11 was God judging America for homosexuality) , and very insular religious sect I was never really socialized as a kid. I certainly was not allowed to date or even spend time around the opposite sex. 

When I ""graduated"" high school I was basically a little kid that was a legal adult. I didn't have a basic knowledge of the world and was essentially unschooled. The only people I really ever interacted with growing up were my parents, so I struggled a LOT with very basic social situations. 

Most of my twenties was spent trying to remedy these deficiencies. I spent a lot of time at the library trying to read and learn about the world. It is genuinely possible that I have watched more lectures on YT than anyone else alive. I spent a lot of time learning how to interact with people. Even very simple interactions such as dealing with a cashier at the grocery store was hard for me when I started.  It was hard. As fuck. It was mentally and emotionally draining. I had so so sooooooooo many embarrassing and awkward conversations...

I do feel like I'm at the point to which I am pretty good at dealing with people in a vast majority of situations. I have a very good job and I don't feel like I have issues communicating with people on a day to day basis. The one thing I haven't done is dating....as in I have never been on a date and am at 100% lifetime rejection rate. 

I feel like learning to date is going to be very hard for me. TBH I have never had any type of sexual interaction with another person. The worst part for me is that...Bros/Broettes I'm just fucking tired. I'm too fucking old for this shit (32m) and I don't know that I have the mental/emotional stamina left to spend...potentially years trial and erroring my way through the basics of human sexuality.

Mutual friends/my clients helped encourage him to message me and we’ve been chatting and getting to know each other since mid November. Things have been determined on his slow pace since he’s a shy guy, and seems that maybe he was hurt in the past. He was married in 2017, which I heard through my clients indirectly but he has yet to even bring up his past or that he was married, which I find a bit odd how reserved he is. I don’t think he’s trying to hide it, I think he’s embarrassed. They were married less than a year, his friends told him not to marry her but he tried to make it work. He doesn’t come off as a ladies man at all and is kinda quiet. He likes football and is a simple kind of guy, but asks me a lot of questions. We haven’t had sex or gotten sexual at all yet, but that’s fine. The slow pace is refreshing after I had my heart broken by my ex this year. He’s been respectful of me and taking his time to get to know me. We really enjoy our time together, after every date and the next day he says how much fun he’s had and that he really enjoys spending time with me. We laugh a lot and get along well, I can see this definitely developing into a relationship. We have even had two group dates with his friends and it was a ton of fun. We took some pictures together last Saturday (he took them) and he seemed to break out of his shell more the last couple times we’ve hung out. 

But I’m getting a little worried and confused: 1. I’m not exactly sure what he wants and 2. when I’ll see him next. We have kept things casual on dates and only have talked about surface level topics. I have gotten in my head a bit anxious about what is comfortable to bring up because I don’t know what he wants and he’s reserved. I don’t think he would continue to pursue me the way he has but it’s been extremely casual at the same time. I want to ask him about his dating history next time I see him, but he was vague when I mentioned today that I’d like to see him soon. All he said able was he would like to see me too and changed topics … I don’t know if I’ll be seeing him at any point the rest of this year. His dad is coming to visit and staying with him, but he plans to see more family and possibly go out of town to see them on New Years Eve in another city (2-3 hours away), not he’s not sure what plans are yet. I asked him to let me know. Otherwise I will need to make other plans. On Monday he mentioned him and I should take a trip together soon to a nearby city in January, but then said he might be able to get a hotel discount in February and said he’ll let me know. So I guess we’ll see. 

He last came over to my apartment on Tuesday, I made tacos and have him a little Christmas gift (49ers football mug tumbler). He thanked me several times for it and appreciated my cooking. But he didn’t get me anything and only stayed 3 hours cause he said he “was tired” and had work in the morning. I noticed he’s been using less emojis and kinda saying less (funny or flirt things) since Thursday but still will reply to my texts within 10-30 minutes, while sometimes I don’t answer for up to one hour or more.

So to paint the picture I'm asking here, I went to a Jewelry shop a couple of days ago to buy a last minute Christmas gift. 
The lady who was helping was quite cute and we had a pretty decent conversation and kept on making small jokes with each other and laughing a fair bit during said conversation.

I am considering going back to that shop to ask her to dinner or coffee but I am unsure if that would be considered creepy, weird or 'socially unacceptable' since she's at work.

she admitted her feelings for me first. 
one night we got in a fight and the next day we talked and she said she wants to take things slower and start off as friends.  

we had been sexting etc which she always initiated but would say it would give her cold feet but shes so attracted to me. 
when we first met she said i dont speak much and when i do everyone listens with such intent and that im funny etc

im also used to always making the first moves and decisions so with her this is different. shes very outspoken about men, consent etc and different so i wouldnt dare making a move without asking. 

anyways so she says about starting as friends but is still attracted to me and i respect it. so i start treating her as a friend and immediately she was flirting and texting me the same night. 

i was completely confused and didnt really play into it. 
we went on our first “date” and had SO much fun.  
i didnt initiate any physical contact nor flirt though as i want to respect her wishes. 

she professed her interest in me and asked if i had the same in which i do after. 

but still i am afraid of flirting and overstepping boundaries/not rush anything. 

the way she is i also feel like im walking on eggshells sometimes which from what i see if partially my fault in thinking so. 

lately ive been in a lull and losing interest in her simply just by the confusion and suppressing my emotions so i dont get attached and hurt. 

she will flirt with me here and there too. which gets me confused. 

the other day she started flirting kinda with me and asked me to go to stores with her so we did for like 2 hours, we went and had a fun time. but again no physical contact. 

last night she flirted hard so today i said fck it and sent a flirty text. things were getting intense. she even was “begging” for my attention.  she then asked if i was intimidated by her. and doesnt want me to feel uncomfortable. 

it took me 2 times asking her and giving examples to why she felt i was. 

she proceeded to tell me that she has been making all the moves. 
as well as the way i respond to her 
the way i conduct myself
 “you dont seem dominant” 

i told her i have been respecting her wishes and trying not to put her in any uncomfortable situations. as well as taking things slow. 
im afraid of flirting and holding back because of that. 

that im used to making all the moves and decisions and if i have permission i will then. 
she then told me how much she wants me and that we agree on telling each other what we are comfortable with and would rather press the gas pedal and reestablish boundaries than nothing at all. 

we started flirting and role playing hard. 

we are seeing each other monday as of right now and im going to kiss her and maybe even a little more. just this all has me kind of confused and the way she said that im not dominant along with it seeming like im weak when in the end im just trying to respect her wishes felt very disrespectful to me. 

i did thank her for telling me though and that im so happy she did. 

what can i do to go back to being myself and not seeming so submissive? and what was i doing wrong?

On the 24th I mentioned the idea of going out with her for New Years but in the end told her I think we should probably wait to go out after new years since I have immuno-compromised roommates.

After thinking about it more, if she tests negative before the 31st we can still go out. She's going to need to test anyway before going back to work.

Would it sound bad/desperate to mention setting up tentative plans for the 31st and cancel if she tests positive again?

And I trust that he’s not given he sees me most of his free time. He has close female friends but he makes an extra effort to prove to me that his interactions are platonic, something I’ve given the benefit of doubt.

He knows I like him, he’s too shy to verbalise but it can be concluded he kinda likes me too? We get along extremely well. We’ve accepted the “seeing each other” label for the time being.

We want to take it slow for various reasons But I don’t want this to become a situationship either or for him to think it’s okay to get girlfriend privelages without me being his girlfriend. So I want to put a loose personal timeline around when to have the talk by.

She said she would see me soon when I dropped her off, and I texted her and told her I had a great time once I got back home. She texted me the next day and said she did as well, and was glad she got to know me more. I texted her again a couple days later to set up a second date once I had my schedule for the week. She said that I treated her well and was very polite and respectful, but she didn’t see it going any further. I asked her if there was any reason in particular as it could be beneficial for me to know in the future and she said our personalities didn’t match as well as she had hoped.

Ok so I just got heart broken recently and downloaded a dating app for male validation. (I know it’s very unhealthy)

Matched with this guy who also got his heart broken and we vibed went on some FaceTime calls and established a really meaningful friendship that I hope will last. 

When we first met irl I established pretty clearly that this isn’t a date and i had my guard up pretty high especially since I knew his past of being a fuck boy and we both aren’t ready for a relationship. 

We were having so much fun just chilling and vibing and just appreciating one another’s company, BUT THENNNN when my shoe laces untied he bent down and tied them for me, we also shared an umbrella and you could visibly see he was getting wet cause he prioritized covering me, he also bought me flowers and lastly we plan on spending New Years together if he doesn’t have any plans. 

I’m just scared cause I feel like I can catch feelings for this guy but idk if I’m getting played especially since he knows how to treat girls and after his heartbreak and mine idk if I should catch feelings and idk if I can control them (whether I can stop myself from catching feelings) I just feel really comfortable with him and I don’t wanna loose a friend but I wouldn’t mind dating him.

While I completely get the first two being said, it was the latter part that caught me a bit off guard.

Here comes the problem: i have this stupid habit where instead of answering question, if i find it extremely weird or dont understand where it comes from, i ask ""why?"" first instead of answering,and answer after, and i know its a bad habit . So after one of these answers (i answered same way before that morning) she gets angry and starts saying she wants to go home asap . I realise that i angered her and try to hug her and ask if she still wants breakfast. She says no , tells me to stop touching her, which i do, and starts preparing to leave. I get hurt a bit because of all preparations for breakfast wasted, give it a minute, and try to communicate again. This time , she says ""Fuck off"" , and basically doesnt speak to me until she leaves at all. She knows i am anxious person so i obviously start thinking about whats happened and whats going on while she keeps preparing . It lasts for roughly 5-10 mins, then she says she called a taxi, doesnt say good bye, says i cant accompany her, and leaves.   


Roughly after 5 mins after i get myself together i text her to tell me when she is home, and instead she says that i dont care aobut her, because i didnt prepare breakfast anyway, didnt call taxi for her ( i probably should have done it, but i was anxious and neverous and was thinking aobut what happened) , and all that because of excuses.   


How much did i fuck up? Was i overthinking and should have cooked breakfast anyway, even though it was very demoralising and hurt to hear no ? I also dont feel its fair that she texts me everything after, instead of talking to me irl, when i tried to start conversation.

I panic, and get pretty upset, and tell him I should leave - and also throw out the idea of moving to this city with him. He was pretty upset too, crying as well, and said he would love if I moved with him. But I think I freaked him out. 

Shortly after, things got weird. I could sense it. Text replies got longer and he was putting off hanging out.

This is one of the most disgustingly toxic ideas ever perpetuated in our culture. 

First of all, labelling half the human race as ""hos"" - seriously?

Plus, taking someone's side by default just because of their gender, without taking literally any other aspect of the situation into account?

Because men are always as honest as the sky is blue and never have ulterior motives for anything ever?...

It really is a shame. No matter how good I am to a guy, his guy friends will always be #1 to him and will always automatically come first.

I would never try to get between a guy and his friends for my own selfish reasons. I told a male friend once frankly that a certain friend of his was a poisonous piece of trash - his response was ""don't insult my friends"". What the hell? So what was I? Chopped liver? Yeah, I guess so.

Personally, if I dislike someone, there's always a reason for it. If I tell a guy that someone in his circle is a poisonous piece of trash, I'm not saying that as a ""ho"". I'm saying that as someone who genuinely cares about him and doesn't want him to end up being hurt by that person.

It was in high school where it was built around her making me feel like I wasn't good enough so I wouldn't get a say in anything, and then she would control and manipulate the relationship. I broke up with her and that was around 3 years ago now, and it is still the best decision I've ever made.

Since then, I feel like I've done a lot of the stuff people always say, working on myself, building my confidence etc etc as I've never really had great self-esteem.

And honestly for a good 2 years or so, I felt really good about myself and who I was. I didn't overanalyse the things I did anymore worrying about what other people thought of me, I just felt really confident in who I was as a person. I really improved my skills in my hobbies and passions and achieved things I am really really proud of. That's probably the happiest I've ever been.

But recently (for just over 7 months) I got into a relationship with a girl (20F) for the first time in a while and it seems my old habits have come back. I worry about how she sees me, I worry about how I compare with other people in her life, I worry about whether I'm making her happy or not etc etc. It really doesn't feel good. I don't want to ask for reassurance because that gets annoying really quick. And it's not like she imposes expectations on me or pressures me to be a certain way, it's just me and how I feel. I know I shouldn't feel like that and that it's a pretty unattractive way of thinking but for some reason I can't help it. It's as if, all of a sudden, once again, I actually really care about what someone else thinks of me and that I've given them that power over me or something. I don't want it to feel like this and I know it shouldn't. If it goes on like this I'm worried it could sabotage this relationship.

I don't want my girlfriend to think I'm a weak person. Because I'm not, I just seem to get like this when I get into intimate relationships because I care too much about what they think of me.
Can anyone give me some advice on how I can start to overcome this? It would be really really appreciated.

So in a conversation with some female older coworkers ( I am the baby at work). I expressed, that I have in the past struggled with dating single moms.

They had a lot of baggage with their child's fathers and tried to pull me in the middle On situation I honestly, liked the father ( I know for shame!). But the guy worked hard, paid his child support, plus and seemed to be a good father. This infuriated my ex, as I would not take sides and told her that it is her problem.

I love both of these women and they have both been single mothers before meeting their now husbands. They told me, that it was short sighted and that I maybe missing out on a good woman.

I also saw my mother go through it with my half sister. My mother raised her, but because she was "" the other woman"". My dad's ex wife refused divorce. But my dad hardly cheated on her with my mom.

I just find the presence of a child and another man ( child's father). To be rouge factors, that I can't account for. I love kids and another man's kid doesn't bother me. But what if he hates me.

I am not trying to put down single moms. This is entirely a personal issue.
