Not sure how to say, I’m not down with that. 



Never been in this position before, so unsure of what to do. 

About 6 weeks ago, it happened by accident, relationship with my best friend became sexual, (both single in our mid twenties) We never really laid out any boundaries, other than we didn’t wanna make each other uncomfortable within the boundaries of our friendship &amp; kept checking if the other wanted to keep fooling around. We both did, so we just kinda had 6 weeks of being friends by day, and having “fun” at night. 

We Never put any names to it, told anyone, or talked about the consequences or where/If it was going anywhere. Never said we were exclusive, or that we were just friends with benefits. Or had a serious conversation of what we wanted out of this. In the moment, we did tell each other some things, but I’m guessing now that it was just in heat of the moment, etc? Can give detail If that’s important. 

I’m not one to sleep around. But I know my friend very well. I know my friend was and still probably hung up on other people, and has had a number of past partners, who they are still friends with, communicate often, etc. 



Now six weeks later, I had an awkward  incident, when we were having some “fun” via Snapchat, and in the middle of that, I received a steamy Snapchat from this friend, which was meant for a past partner of theirs. In the middle of our fun. My friend said “whoops wrong person”. I didn’t really know how to handle that. My “fun” stopped there, and I just didn’t respond for awhile, and my friend just kept going sending some steamy snaps, and I made excuses and went to bed.

Now, I don’t really know what to do? We never said anything was exclusive. Also anything more than what we are doing, might jeopardize our friendship &amp; friend-group. Pretty sure my friend agrees and would think that anything more than what we are doing now is unrealistic. With that said, I had been thinking over the past few weeks that maybe this could turn into something more. And was going to give things more time before trying to bring that up. 

In retrospect it was a very foolish thing to do. Get involved with my best friend. But I can’t change that now. All I know is that, regardless or not of if I had hoped for more/relationship, I’m not really cool with fooling around with someone who is hung up on other people, sexting them/at the same time as me (and not being phased one bit, when they realized they sent the wrong one to me) or possibly sleeping with them too. 

I don’t know now how or when to communicate that to my best friend. Maybe I should just let it fizzle out? At times thinking I was just an option, so that might be an easy route. 

Any advice on that, or where I should go from here?

Is this just an excuse? Does he just not like me? 

I’m 24F He is 26M 

We matched on tinder in early December and a month later we went on three dates in the first week, and then agreed to slow it down. But instead of slowing down we had sex and then got scared of how serious we felt so soon? 

The second time we hung out I told him I had sexual trauma just in case I had a flashback and he was really understanding. He never pushed for anything at all but I’m pretty hyper sexual due to my past. It was actually his idea to wait after he heard that I had been treated like an object so much in my past. We had sleepovers the first two dates but no sex. 

On the third “hang” he cooked steak for me and we had sex for the first time on Thursday, then the following Sunday he tells me he’s super into me but not ready for something serious because he still thinks about his ex and doesn’t feel like that would be fair to me 

He said “really helped him get over her” lol they dated for 4 years??... and sounds like he’s not actually over her..

I told him that I can’t be “just friends” right now because that would hurt me. I told him right off the bat that I didn’t want a FWB and that if we had sex I would wind up having feelings for him",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156352,public,self,Dating when you’re still in love with an ex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/shrzs1/dating_when_youre_still_in_love_with_an_ex/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I met this girl this summer, and we slowly started to know each other.

Over the time i noticed some mixed signals, like big smiles / free hugs / winking at me constantly  / caresses / neck kisses and so on. In general she was acting super sweet to me everytime, and i loved that.

Then at a certain point when i was about to ask her out for a date.. she did it first. I also got her phone # and we started to text us more and more often. She used a shit ton of hearths and loving emojis on every msg i received, so that was another signal (?)

On the first one we passed an entire day shopping , we dined out and we spent the evening in a disco-pub. That was a fantastic day for me, not sure about her cuz i never asked directly.

Since that we met other times in less-demanding dates, like breakfasts for example.

Since she made the first move, i thought that was my turn to propose a date but.. this time i got no response at all. Asked once orally and twice by text, and i got dodged all the times. I still have the pending messaged but at the same time she's viewing and reacting my ig stories and when i send her memes.

I intrepreted it like a situation of low interest so i wasn't going to ask her out a fourth time.

Days have passed and i noticed that she took a distance for a while. In the last days we got other text convos but the response times aren't the same and sometimes she completely ignores some of them. But when she's responding and when i see her, she's always the cuddle-machine i knew months ago.

So wtf am i supposed to behave? I think i have deep feelings for her but i'm slowly starting to lose interest because of that evasive manner.

She was clear she didn't want that. Her last one ended in real heartbreak (was engaged and got cheated on). I'm really busy with work right now. So being bf and gf once a week has worked.

We did little Christmas presents. Text around 3 times a week. Just painting the picture.

Early Jan she found a video on her phone. I'm not going to go into details. But basically she accused me of recording something I never did. The video does exist. But I knew nothing about it.

Since then I've sent a few long, considerate, messages explaining it. And then a week later one final message where I wished her luck, told her she was awesome, and thanked her for a lovely six months.

She sent back a voicenote saying she isn't prepared to talk about it right now, that although she doesn't want a relationship I'm very dear to her, and that she wishes this video never existed.

I replied saying saying “Take your time. If you want to talk please let me know. I still really want to try and resolve this...” That was one week ago.

The truth is I feel really sad.

I feel like a lovely 6 months has been completely crushed. Someone you care about doubting who you are... is not fun.

Our first date was awesome whilst the other three dates were also great (she actually came to my house, we watched sports which we both love, Netflix and had awesome sex). Afterwards we had an honest conversation on how we both wanted to do other things other than had sexual encounters, mainly because we both felt like we were dating perverts hahaha but we talked and communication was gold. We agreed to do other things with our clothes still on hahaha (what happened was that we connected through sex at first is not like we are actually perverts)

So, yesterday she posted a tik tok on her Instagram about a conversation she had with her friend and in the end of it her friend literally said “…but from time to time you hook up with each one” (the conversation is in Spanish but that’s what it translates, meaning like she kisses or fucks with multiple guys). I didn’t care if she was seeing other people but I’m mostly concerned about the fact that she had to post it, like what did you expect I would feel about it?

I decided she went a little bit crazy, tried to make me jealous and didn’t give too much importance to it BUT that same night I saw her WhatsApp story and it was a photo of her with a sweater of our favourite team and in the caption said “I promise I’ll give it back, i just looks so hot in it” and a bunch of sexy emojies 

Then again, I don’t expect for her to not see other people since we only saw each other like 4 times. Obviously we both said we liked each other and had an awesome time together, she even slept at my house. 
I just felt spiteful about her stories, like if she wanted to make me jealous well you did it girl! All you did was elevate my trust shields back up again.

We had gone out almost exactly a year ago but the timing was off and we were both in a sort of weird place so it didn't work out. But our outing last evening was honestly such a nice night. He took me to dinner, he made me laugh and we exchanged stories, we played castle crashers, we watched some stand up, and he offered me another drink but I decided I wanted to turn in for the evening. Went home, and I was so proud of myself. It was because I didn't base the night around him or anticipating his perceptions/needs/feelings and instead paid close attention to how I felt and my own needs.

Biggest things I noticed: 

* I didn't feel anxious at any point during our time together
* I sincerely laughed more than I have on any date I've had in the last two years
* I felt comfortable just speaking my mind/feelings/thoughts and didn't feel like I had to filter myself, I was able to just relax and enjoy his company
* I was able to identify that I would be willing to go out with him again not because I felt like I owed him, or was fighting for his attention, but because I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with him.
* There was no thrill in the date - no intense butterflies, or feelings of severe passion (my last relationship felt like this at the outset) - but there was warmth and safety and laughter. I almost fell asleep on his couch because I felt comfortable enough around him to do so.
* He didn't cut me off at all over the entire course of the date. He was responsive about things I mentioned or brought up, and the exchange of conversation was entirely considerate.
* There were no moments during the date where I could feel physical symptoms of anxiety manifesting...this is huge for me - most guys and dates I've been on, something in my gut feels off, and that never happened here (could just be because this is the first time in my life I've been listening intently to myself above other people).

Never underestimate the impact that listening to your own body, mind, and thoughts has on your interactions. When I've been on dates that left me super anxious with stomach flip-flopping and heart/mind racing with thoughts/anxieties/etc. wondering when/if I would see them again I came to realize that the intensity and passion is actually a sign of an unmet need. The guys on those dates triggered something in me that set off warning bells that something was missing (communication, feeling unheard, feeling disrespected, feeling inadequate, etc). Sometimes this was misplaced, but often times it was a call to listen to my self and my needs and I ignored it by trying to take on the responsibility of both people to participate equally in the connection.

What I'm trying to say is, listen to yourself in every capacity. Give yourself space to respect and consider your own thoughts/feelings/perceptions (not necessarily what your anxiety may tell you) before someone else. It has the potential to improve more than just your dates.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156374,public,self,I cannot stress enough the importance of paying attention to how you feel and your own needs first when you're going out with someone.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/shufuo/i_cannot_stress_enough_the_importance_of_paying/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I've terrible luck in dating. I've mainly 2 issues that I need to overcome, I'll talk about those in next paragraph. After looking through lot of dating advice on reddit and other websites, for men, I've noticed that the advice of improving oneself (self improvement) is  quite common. So I started following those advice, like building muscles, style and earning more money. Other than these, I also try to go out more and put myself in social situations to meet more people. 

Leaving the physical appearance aside, I'm trying to cultivate a more outgoing, social and fun loving personality since changing personality was also quite common among those advice.

Coming to the two issues, for me those are:

- Height: Not much can be done, I'm 4'11 and maybe 5'0 with shoes
- Appearance: This is what I've control on. To put it bluntly I'm not at all good looking, so I'm going to gym to build more muscles so that it makes up for my height and face. Other than that I've also bought some good fashionable cloths. Don't know if it's important or not but I'm bald too.

I don't know what to do next to better my chances. My main problem is that women don't give me a chance to showcase my other attributes, I'm rejected at first instance. As a result I've no experience with women or dating. One time a girl walked out of a date (blind) after she saw me. If anyone can offer any advice it would be really helpful.

Things have just gotten too difficult for me. At first we were really clicking. 3-4hr long dates and felt like there was no reason to stop. Fair for me to include that she is a MD in a ER unit so schedule has been something we have had to work through. At first she was very upfront with her availability. After the 4th date she did not give me her availability even though the date felt great. We text maybe once a day max which is fine for me. It did take getting used too, but we communicated well about texting expectations. She hasnt been receptive to calls either and for me planning dates over text is a pain at times.   


So like I said, after 4th date she said she would give me her availability and we continued texting back and fourth for almost 5 days.  Thats when I decided enough time had passed and asked where she was at with availability. I felt she was being flaky. She sent me this long thing about how she sometimes gets overwhelmed and isolates herself. She needed space. I understand her job is very stressful. She gave me her availability and we went on a 5th date.  


5th date she was tired and seemed off, but it was still fun. I knew she was potentially available the Sunday so I went for it and asked about that day. Discussed plans and such, She told me she might have a family thing and it took her till saturday to tell me she had to be at her sisters. Then said ""Maybe we could figure something else out later in the week"" Maybe?? What happened to her being really open with her availability at first? At this point I was convinced she was losing interest.   


I gave my availability and told her that I hoped she had a good time with family. 3 days go by and nothing. Not one text from her. Then I sent her a message basically telling her that I felt she wasnt in a place to talk availability and to let me know when or if she was. another 3 days go by and no response. So a week of nothing. At that point I thought I was ghosted. Was a bit pissed and was moving on. But in a last ditch effort I sent a message explaining that communication was important to me and that I didnt know if she had lost interest or needed space. Poeple might think I was wrong for sending these texts, but I honestly felt we knew each other well enough by that time that I was willing to let her know how I felt.   


She sent me a long reply. Basically sounds like she is used to be single for so long she struggles to include other people in her life. She also was feeling off and didnt know what she felt. To me it seems she felt things getting a bit more real and backed off. She did apologize, but if this pattern doesnt change then I see no way forward.

We again talked it though. I let her know that if there was any pressure that we should lower it. She wants to meet again. suggested we do an activity.   


We went back to our normal texting. Got a date set, but trying to figure out what we are doing. I just want communication from her to work the date out and that alone is a struggle.   


By the 6th date I dont believe  I should be calling all the shots. I dont even know what she would be interested in doing. So Im to the point with her that I'm just dont care so much. For instance today I basically told her that It would be preferably if I could give her a quick call to get plans set.   


Im tired of the lack of communication. I know that she has a crazy job, but imo that does not mean I should deal with an overall lack of communication or interest with working with me on dates.   


She is a great person and I really dont want to stop seeing her because I like her, but I dont think I can take this. Unless something where to change on/after our 6th date I dont see a way forward.   


Even planning this date is so annoying I almost dont want to do it. I think I need to end this next time I see her.   


And again I do really respect her work and understand that this was never going to be easy, but also if she cant take 5min out her day to respond to me then I dont know if this is worth pursuing.   


Im talking with other people who have been more responsive. I feel like I have enough of a friendship/bond with her that ending this would be hard.

I have a lot of fear and pessimistic feelings about dating and love because I also have a lot of emotional wounds from previous experiences (don’t ever try telling me the worst thing that can happen is rejection; that is a huge lie). 

I’m so afraid of both, succeeding and progressing and developing a healthy relationship, and total and painful failure followed by some serious repercussions (I was under surveillance by my high school after a rejection and lost one of my jobs after another rejection). Ironically the only thing I’m not afraid of is a simple rejection.

We have similar interests, and we get along pretty well, but I am so internally conflicted and naturally bad at socializing that I don’t know how to actually progress with her.

So I know this girl from work (we’re working in different offices) and we were never really close. No frequent texting or anything.

But we were on a 3 day seminar recently and I thought she’s kinda cute, and maybe she likes me.

However she never really dropped hints but we were having fun together (no, not that kind of fun). 

So after the seminar I let it rest for a couple of weeks but last week I thought „screw it“ and asked her if she wanted to go ski with me. (She recently said she liked skiing). And she agreed. 

We said we‘d go this weekend.

Today we saw each other again and I thought we‘d talk about details but she was pretty short spoken and just said lets text again about details.

I don’t know if she didn’t want to talk about it in front of her friends who were close by or if she isn’t really interested after all or if she’s just shy. I am very  shy as well btw

He’s a 23M. We were in the same class together for a semester and he randomly reached out to me on social media almost a year later but by then, we were in the middle of the pandemic. 

He texted me in February last year asking me to go out with him but I was stuck at home in a different country so I had to postpone it. He reached out to me again in March, May, and the list goes on. I returned to college last august and told him about it but he graduated and moved to a new city by then. He did come to visit college sometime in October but we couldn’t meet because of a few misunderstandings. He reached out to me by himself in December and asked me if I was interested in him and I said yes. 

We’ve been texting consistently for the past month or so and made plans to meet soon. He said he’d be flying to college during one of the long weekends either this month or the next month. However, my mom was diagnosed with stage 1 cancer recently and my grandfather passed away from Covid, the emotional and financial burden prompted me to take a leave of absence from college this semester so the earliest I can go to college is for the summer semester which begins in May 2022 until then I’d be home. 

I don’t have the heart to postpone our date again because I’d been doing that for the past year. I really like him - I liked him since the time he was in my lecture but he had a gf then so I never bothered to talk to him. I’m just devastated that he likes me and I can’t do the one thing essential to taking this to the next step - going on a date. He’s a good looking guy with a great future so I’m afraid he won’t be single for too long. I don’t even know how he’d react if I say we have to postpone it again.

I (22F) and my boyfriend (21 turning 22 soon M) have been dating for 5 years. We’ve been best friends since 2014-2016, started dating 2016-now. We got together in junior year of high school. Over the years we’ve taken a few week long splits. Recently he separated from me end of July until end of October. I almost didn’t take him back but I saw how much he regretted his choice to leave and how much he meant what he was saying about me and a future together. He’s been better about not picking fights and helping around the apartment since we got back together and listening to me but it hasn’t felt the same. I love him, but I think he’s my twin flame, not my soulmate. We are needing to sign a new lease and that stresses me out, another commitment when I’m not sure about us, and when he talks about marriage I don’t get excited anymore like I used to. I miss living by myself and how much fun I had as being single. I also am starting to really listen to my friends and family who don’t entirely LOVE him for me. Especially the ones who have known us the whole 5 years. They said I was happier on our 3 month split. I just don’t feel that in-love connection anymore. And I dread the heartbreak he’ll go through when I do end it. It will be hard for me too, but I know I’m all he wants, he makes that clear. I brought up briefly already that I feel disconnected.

I am a 25 highly introverted male, and not long ago I matched a gorgeous girl on tinder.

We started talking about movies and shared some really long messages with common interest for almost 3 weeks until I asked her out. On the phone everything was great, however, the first time we met things went wrong.

We went to the cinema and watched a movie, afterwards we talked about it and it was great, she was very clever. The problem started when we went to a little café where she started asking stuff about me: my job, my family projects, etc. As an introvert, my pace in life could be considered slower than other people of my age. I do not have many friends, I am still finishing my Uni, I live with my mother and I lack some social skills such as dancing and small chatting. I have been dealing with some depression too and I feel totally disconnected from the things I do. Anyways, to keep up with the conversation I started covering myself with little white lies that would not backfire. I just wanted to sound a little more interesting I guess.

As the conversation moved on from topic to topic the nerves and increasing awareness of my own lies got the best of me and I basically created a character that has little to do with myself. We ended up going to a bar close to her place for some beer and lost track of time just talking (I might feel uncomfortable talking about myself but I can pretty much go over any other topic, and I am a great listener). Then I walked to her place (somewhat close to mine) and before saying goodbye she told me she would love to meet again. I really felt some chemistry, I noticed her interest in me.

But after a recap of the date in my mind, I realized that her interest longs for a person who does not exist. And I ended up blocking her contact and removing her from Tinder. I guess I do not want to keep dating someone with whom I need to remember every falsehood I said. Or I just do not want to be a D.

For two-three months now, he's stopped asking me questions that make the conversation flow or even general questions like how I've been doing, how I am etc etc. We barely chat anymore and mostly just send some snaps and memes on Instagram. Now, I'm bored of the getting the same snaps and memes and his one worded replies on them. Our conversation just feels very restrained.. if he doesn't like me I'm fine with not talking at all. But I don't like how sometimes in a blue moon he'll text me and initiate the conversation, showing interest and then when I reciprocate, he doesn't match it up or even reply properly. One worded texts ughgh. To break this conversation dynamic, I stopped texting/sending snaps and memes on all platforms. After two days of doing so, he reaches out to me and asks me why I'm not talking much and stuff. As soon as I go like 'hmm, maybe he still wants to talk?' and begin asking him basic stuff about what he's been doing etc etc, he disappears again. Now all of this is really irritating me. I feel like he is stringing me along. What do you guys think? I know we're not in a relationship but he's still the first guy I kissed and talking to him everyday has made me feel some things for him. Now him behaving like this just irks me :s

There's this girl that I work with that developed a crush on quite quickly, because I found her attractive.

I focused on us before you asked me to.

I was ready to move halfway across the globe.
I was ready to live alone in a dangerous city in a country I never been to, if it means I can meet you.

I did my part. You never did yours.
Told me to wait. So wait I did patiently.

Thanksgiving. I waited.

I still waited. One month now.

My life is going well and my career is progressing nicely. I have my own place and have my own car. The only problem is that my dating life is nearly non-existent. I don’t think my appearance is the problem, I eat health and exercise regularly to maintain a slim figure. I’ve started online dating these past few months as I think it’s time I try to settle down as I really want kids. 

I do get matches but all the dudes are either very low in socioeconomic class (high school degrees or just an undergrad) or they are successful and stop talking once I tell them my profession. Is being a doctor really destroying my chances of a happy relationship? I see a lot of my female colleagues also have trouble with dating and we lament to each other about it sometimes. All the male doctors in my cohort are either in stable relationships or married already, so it’s painful seeing them in happy relationships (selfish on my part, I know). 

I’ve read that successful women have trouble dating but I thought that was only limited to the rural areas, being in a big city I thought that men would be more progressive and happy to have a high earning smart partner. But so far experience has told me this is not the case. To be honest I am kind of getting desperate and the thought of having a child later in life and juggling my demanding career really depresses my day sometimes.

Last year, we decided to try dating after having sex one night (it was kind of a long time coming). We were together for like 2 months before we had to spend the summer apart (in different states) and everything seemed great to me. This was the first relationship where I allowed myself to be truly vulnerable because I felt like he understood me are cared about me for who I am. My past relationships ended because they just fizzled out. Neither me or my parter at the time (previous 2 relationships) were serious about a long term relationship. Which makes sense because I am young, and sometimes relationships arent supposed to last. Nonetheless, these relationship failings did make me really sad when it happened. Like, I'm not good enough for people to want to stick around. I really hated that feeling of breaking up, so didnt even want to date anyone until my friend and I got together. I genuinely thought this was going to be ""the one"". He told me he loved me, and I started to think about a future life with him. 

But after this summer something had changed. When we got back to school, we almost stopped acting like we were in a relationship. He didnt want to be affectionate at all. I didnt really understand or know how to take it, and I mistakingly took it personally. I thought he wasnt attracted to me anymore. He wouldn't talk to me about his feelings unless I pushed him to do so. I ultimately asked him if he would prefer to take a break while he figured out what he wanted. He didnt want to break up at first, but the way we were was really hurtful to me. He would invite me over only to play video games the whole time. He didnt want to hold hands or show any affection towards each other anymore. And when we would be up late (past midnight) when he used to just have me sleep over with him, he would now kick me out of his room and offer the couch to me. I was just extremely confused and hurt. One night I was crying about how I didn't feel like he loved me anymore, and I impulsively thought I would feel better if we did take the break I suggested a couple weeks prior. I broke up him, and he was really fine with it and like immediately agreeing to it. But I didnt really want to be done, I just wanted the pain to end. 

I've been pretty depressed since we broke up which was months ago. I've asked him a couple of times if he'd be interested in getting back together and the response was basically 'dont hold your breath'. I cry about our break up pretty frequently (sometimes every night before I sleep). I feel like I really fucked up somewhere, but I also did not like how I was treated. One of my friends told me I had to uphold my standards. She said it wasnt fair of him to treat me like that. He even told me himself that I deserved better than that and he apologized. He said that what happened was not about me but I don't trust him anymore. I'm STILL upset. We still see each other nearly everyday and he is clearly fine with our old dynamic. It still feels good being around him and he is still my best friend but it just hurts when I think about how we arent together anymore. I felt so blindsided by his rejection and it makes me wonder if he ever loved me at all. We will go do the things we used to do when we were in a relationship. Our friends even forget that we arent dating anymore. Its just all very confusing. What really made me realize I'm not okay was the other day when he casually brought up being on a dating app. I just left because I didnt want to make a scene but that just confirmed to me that the issue was never him not wanting a relationship but not wanting a relationship with me. As much as I rationally understand that I shouldnt let my self worth be dictated by a relationship, I feel pretty worthless right now. When the person who knows you more than anyone else loves you then drops you it has made me very cynical about relationships in general. Whats the point in having any relationship when it will always end the same in sadness and regret. I could have gone my whole life with the sexual tension and never acted on it and we would still be fine. But I fucked up, fucked my best friend, somehow fucked up our relationship, and now I genuinely dont think I can ever have a loving relationship. When I think about trying to date again, I just feel the pain of that rejection.

Hey y’all, I (19F) just got „broken up“ with (we were dating for a little over a month but never made things official). 

During this time she (20F) spoke of me coming to visit her folks in Brazil, meeting her parents, and introduced me to pretty much all of her friends.

I guess where it went downhill was when we got into a run-in over the phone. She spoke of how recently she hasn’t been productive and is falling behind in classes. I noticed this was also during the time when I was over at her place quite often so I was telling her I’d be perfectly okay if she needed to take time for herself and have time away from me if she needed to get things situated.

She then accused me of trying to make her seem lazy and unable to make her own decisions as an adult. I expressed how I felt as if I had to watch my words or was unable to say things at times because the meaning would be misconstrued or overanalysed (for example, I was telling her how beautiful she was and she said „even with my tummy“ and I said „of course“ and then she accused me of calling her a fat ass). She then said „I’m sorry you feel that way but I felt judged and….“

We later had a discussion about it an I thought everything was smoothed over as she understood I was saying it not out of judgement but care. Everything seemingly went back to normal and we were back going on dates and spending time with each other.

Today she calls me and says she wishes to break everything off and stated we are now moving too fast and I displayed red flags that made her wish to put herself first. The red flags were that I gaslighted her because I never formally apologised for making her feel judged.
