We both chatted for almost 3 mi the prior to meeting because of Covid and my health issues. We both know we are seeking a relationship, but have both expressed a sense of feeling a little defeated after attempts at building relationships in the past. 

We get along well, there are a few awkward silences easily filled, we seem to have a lot in common so far and share the same values. I have complicated life/work/health circumstances and he doesn't seem to mind. I also have 2 younger kids, his are adults now. 

While we're in different stages of life, we are both in quite similar positions in a lot of ways, when it comes to our own goals and making changes to better ourselve. 

I am attracted to him, and I'm sure he's probably attracted to me, but I've never had a relationship that didn't begin with flying sparks and intense attraction, or where a man hasn't spent a lot of the time telling me how amazing/beautiful/awesome I am. Where sex wasn't rhe obvious goal/hope/intent from the start. 
While this seemed great at the time, all of these men later turned out to be quite toxic, dishonest, and none of these relationships ended well from where I was sitting. One was a flat-out love-bombing from a man who already had a girlfriend for the year we were together. 
I've been ignorant and too trusting, 100%. Now I am very cautious. 

This man is quiet, a little shy, has never complimented me, hasn't tried anything sexual (I went in for a hug and a kiss on the cheek last night), and this is not familiar to me at all. 
He appears interested, but in a quiet and patient way. 

This is EXACTLY what I need, but at the same time it is unfamiliar and uncomfortable for me. I'm almost conditioned to believe that if it isn't glaringly obvious from the start, then it's not there. I feel like men want sex, and it's unfair to continue dating a man for too ling if I'm not ready for that yet. I don't know what's healthy in dating, to be honest. 

Is it reasonable for me to continue dating this man without being sure how I feel about him?

So, I met a wonderful woman through yoga class like 3 weeks ago.   There's this excellent group of us who get together and do yoga on Sundays, we're like a community.  We got to chatting one day, I asked her for ice cream I was craving &amp;  we've since been on a couple of dates.  Had a coffee date in the park and a nice restaurant meal last week.  We have also been intimate once before as well; she invited me to hers last Saturday night, we had some wine, some food and yeah next thing we were taking our clothes off and got horizontal.

Anyways, we ended up hanging out again tonight.  Got some pizza from a local shop here, she had a drink.  I won't drink because you can get a DUI in your vehicle even if the keys are somewhere else like the glove compartment.  Really hitting it off and it's very clear we're going to get sexy again.  Also to note she was quite aways from home.  There was some events today out on the west side of our area and she was there and then I met up with her.  It's about 16k back to her place.

So she's heavily suggestions we go back to ""mine"".  So full disclosure: I haven't told her about my situation but I said I stay out on the west side and I ""live"" walking distance from work.  Reality is because parking is insane where I work I park two blocks away and walks every day. 

I said it would not work out tonight why dont we try again tomorrow at her place.  She said you live right around here, also your car is here and we could literally go to your house in like two minutes, right? I was making up excuses like my car isnt running well (lie, I work in automotive and my car is a custom built job) and I just felt bad.  I don't even have two seats in my car anyways so it's not like she could ride legally in the car.  I started mumbling and kinda just started running away from her.

Yeah I messed it up bad.  She's blowing up my phone asking questions alike what did she do wrong and everything and what's going on I thought we were having a great night etc. I haven't responded to her yet.    I just feel terrible because this is like, the one.  The.  One.   She's incredibly beautiful, amazingly nice like she volunteers with street people and does all of these great things with her life.  I'm perfectly normal I'm just in my vehicle to save money.  I legitimately have $185,000 in the bank because I haven't paid rent in so many years. - I've been living like this and traveling for nine years long story for another day. I've done hammocks tents hostels all of it.

I'm not even looking for advice I just feel terrible.  Like eventually she would've figured out and then kept asking more questions about why I don't pay for a place when I can afford it.

I‚Äôm not sure if I just need to vent or perhaps I‚Äôm thinking about this situation all wrong ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think I am. Thank you in advance if you read this whole thing.  

I (47M) dated ‚ÄúA‚Äù(44F) for a little more than a year, when we broke up. She said she couldn‚Äôt give me what I wanted from a relationship because, she has 2 children, 50% custody with their dad, and my kids are adults. At the time she was right, I was still discovering the ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù that many people that have been divorced told me to find, and I wanted a relationship where I could be a part of her life, not an every other week boyfriend.  

However, because we really have an incredible connection, we ended up being ‚Äúphysical‚Äù friends a week later. We agreed that if we were physical with someone else, we‚Äôd have to be honest and it would end. That lead to hanging out ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and spending the night after. It also led to my being more a part of her life, and her life with the kids (They like me). At one point she told me that she is not on dating sites anymore, cause she‚Äôs happy the way things are. I got off dating sites after a week ‚Äì but not just because we were being physical, there was another reason at the time. The common conversation that we‚Äôve had has been my asking ‚ÄúIs the door closed for us?‚Äù, and her replying that she doesn‚Äôt know the future, but it‚Äôs not closed. Very non-committal, except that she's ""not ready for a relationship"" right now.  FYI - she's been divorced 5 yrs to my 2.   

Things were going great; I was invited to an out-of-town family event with her and her kids. We made plans with another couple to go on a long weekend vacation. I‚Äôm invited to her moms for Thanksgiving. She had gone away for a girl‚Äôs weekend and when she came back spoke to me about how different, better, the relationship felt. I told her it was because I was in a better spot. I stopped putting so much weight on the relationship and just enjoyed my time with her. She stressed that she still wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, but didn‚Äôt know what the future holds. It was on that night, I actually started to allow myself to have emotional feelings for her again. 

About a week and a half after that conversation, things changed. She wasn‚Äôt texting (our main form of communication when not together) as much ‚Äì always replying to mine, but just not reaching out. Something happened and when she told me I understood and I assumed that when that improved her communication and the way I was included in her life would improve as well. It has improved, but not to where it was a few weeks earlier, where I was ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù in the relationship. I have no doubt that she cares about me a lot, but, just isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. 

We went to the family event this weekend. It was fun. I was simply introduced by my name, no title ‚Äì which is how we basically keep it.  

We‚Äôre going on that vacation in 2 weeks, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I want more. I want what she was giving me, and if she can‚Äôt, then I need to move on and find the relationship that can. 

**OPINIONS:** Am I obligated to tell her if I start dating? Once again, if I‚Äôm physical with someone, I would certainly have to. I would like to tell her I‚Äôm going to start, because perhaps she will realize she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. I know she is capable of giving me the relationship I want, so why not give her the opportunity to ‚Äúbe ready for a relationship‚Äù?

I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm kidding myself here. That after this vacation, we need to have a serious talk and she might actually come around and be ready? I read about Attachment styles and perhaps she‚Äôs just an ‚Äúavoidant‚Äù.

He is 72M.  

I am retired. He is semi-retired. He has an orchard that takes up quite a bit of his time and also is an avid hunter/fisherman who takes trips in his 5th wheel for weeks at a time during hunting/fishing season. 

We met in 2015 online dating. I thought we hit it off well. I haven't met anyone I like as much as him. We had some great dates. We tried intimacy in 2015 and although I did my part, his ED affected his performance. He couldn't do it. He emailed me the next day and broke up, citing politics and religious differences. I always believed that if he had been able to get it up, he would not have broken up with me. 

May 2021 he contacts me again on the dating site. I still hadn't found a keeper. We went out in June. He told me he had a new procedure for ED. Also said he had been kicking himself many times for breaking up with me.  We tried again and.... success! He said it was the best sex he had in 20 years. He lives an hour away. We were going back and forth. We took a weekend trip in August. We had fun, we had wonderful conversations, good sex, and he was very supportive of my personal struggles. 

He went on a six week hunting trip about six hours away. He did come home once during that time and we went to a party for his friends. We talked about me driving up to see him, but with weather issues and his hunting time and his meeting up with friends to hunt, the timing didn't work. So I haven't seen him since Oct. 30.

He said he was coming home Friday, Nov 19. I thought he would call and set up a date for today, Sunday, so he could cook me a pheasant dinner at his house. But he hasn't called or texted since the 15th. He will be going to his son's house for Thanksgiving, out of town, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday and I am going to my mother's home on Friday to give my sister some respite time. So neither of us are available at the same time for the rest of the month.

He did have a prostrate cancer scare in July and was on some heavy duty meds. Now he says he has to take them for life. These meds affect his libido. I was still willing to keep our relationship going. I thought he was too. We made plans for some winter getaways and talked about even a few overseas travel plans. I like to travel, but it gets difficult as a solo. 

But he hasn't talked to me in six days. I am not some middle school girl who expects a boyfriend to be at her beck and call, but I feel like I am just an afterthought to him. When we do chat, it is great, but it has never been as much as I would like. I am just someone who he fits into his schedule when he has nothing better to do. And now, we may go through all of November without seeing each other at all.

I know that I am the only one who can answer my question, but I would like some opinions.  Is this the best I am going to get from this man? I don't want to be the typical female who is always bringing up the ""relationship"", but it is on my mind all the time. Do I end it with him? Do I go back to online dating hoping to find (in that vast online wasteland) someone who is a better match? I told him that I would not date anyone else while I am dating him. I don't think I want to keep him just as a travel buddy because I really want a man in my life, regularly, who wants to see me and wants to be with me as much as I want to see him and be with him. I can work with his ED issues, at least I think I can.

We are both busy and independent.  We maintain our own homes, have careers and we are actively raising our own kids. I have a full social life and like spending time with friends. He has very little free time due to a demanding position and his kids activities. 
We make time to see each other once a week. 

We are exclusive, we love each other, we have fun together, similar values and humor. The sex is great. He is kind, patient, respectful, treats me well, listens and makes me feel heard. 

The possible downside, we live completely separate lives. He has met a few of my friends and family. His small circle of family and friends know about me, but he rarely sees them.  What little time we have together we prefer to spend alone. 

Neither one of us wish to introduce a significant other to our kids. Neither one of us wants to get married again. 

So what is the problem?  I guess I am struggling with what I (and the world) think I should want or have vs what actually works for me right now.  

I generally like our arrangement, but sometimes I wish we could spend a little more time together.  He has no more time to give.  We don‚Äôt talk about long term plans, there are just too many variables.  People will say, your significant other should make you their priority.  We are each a consideration for the other, but work and kids are the priority.  
At times our situation makes me feel insecure or unanchored, like, where is this going to go?  But then, who ever knows what the future will bring?

It's like a double edged sword!

I'm [43M] seeing a woman [41] who I fairly consistently have to talk myself down from her being out of my league and freaking out. Or, at least, I'll acknowledge she may very well be out of my league but try and focus on the fact that she's still responding positively as I try and progress things towards a relationship and hopefully she'll let me know if she stops 'feeling it'. Until that happens I should just enjoy our time together.

I'm about two years out of a 10 year relationship which included three years of marriage. My ex was seven years younger than me and let's just say it wasn't an equal partnership and she was quite controlling, jealous, lacked friends or close relationships to family, made decisions that led her to be financially dependent on me, and was emotionally abusive. 

The new woman has a pretty important job with a very well known college and she's just super smart, talented, independent, and attractive. She's a trained musician and has a lot of current and former colleagues who are also trained musicians, and many of them are male. She has expressed in casual conversation that she feels like it's good to get out of social 'bubbles' and doesn't feel like being surrounded by a homogeneous group of people is very fulfilling, so I remind myself of that when I start to think 'Gee, wouldn't she rather be with someone that can talk music with her?'. I know close to nothing about music, but I would be willing to learn! 

So maybe my different background and interests are more attractive to her than being with someone that shares more of her own? After all, she's been surrounded by fellow musicians and the musically inclined since she was in high-school and yet she was still on a dating app in August, haha. Plus, I can understand that just because there are shared interests doesn't mean there will be attraction. And if she needs to geek out on music she has plenty of people she can do so with AND still be interested in me romantically.

Fortunately, for my confidence, I have a fairly important job at a well known cultural institution so I don't feel completely mismatched professionally. Not that there aren't many successful relationships where the two partners have very different professions or are at different places in their respective careers. It's just something I can remind myself of when those negative automatic thoughts crop up.

So yeah, every once and a while I feel a little exhausted from giving myself pep talks or suffering from imposter syndrome but never when I'm with her. I haven't expressed any of this to her as I feel like that's sort of a weird needy psychological game to play, looking for reassurances. I think I have it under control, but felt like expressing it so this turned into more of a journaling session for me! Maybe it was an interesting read for someone. Maybe someone can relate.

The man is over a decade my junior and a platonic friend of 6 months that called me ""mom"" sometimes. We went to brunch with another friend one Sunday and got drinks after. It was probably my first time really drinking since the pandemic. I really liked these friends at the time. I couldn't drive home. He told the other friend he'd take care of me.

Anyhow, I was determined to face it and do my best to move on. Therapy, the criminal justice system, friends, volunteering, hobbies - it truly hasn't been horrible. Except. I. Feel. Horrible. 

My determination wore thin, my momentum - is almost gone. Maybe it's the holidays and I'm tired, but I am not sure how I can trust anymore. My ex-husband wasn't a ""bad"" guy, but we weren't great for each other. He ended the marriage, and I felt like maybe I did something wrong. He told me no, I didn't, but I lost trust in myself. Ten years we were together. 

I questioned my judgment, regarding my husband, regarding this friend. It's been almost five years since the divorce. I focused on building friendships, being good at my job, taking care of my aging mom. I really enjoy volunteering. Maybe I'm not cut out for a relationship. But boy, I know I want one. Pre-pandemic, I thought one day I'd find someone to be good to, for a long time. Maybe even a long, long time. Now I just wish there was someone to cry to. It's hard being ""strong,"" moving through all this police, legal shit, working long hours, maintaining my goddamned composure. Everyone knows me to be a mega-goofball, but lately, it's hard to smile. Men think I'm pissed. I'm not. Every time someone speaks to me, I take good care to look them in the eye when we speak and let them know how glad I am that we spent time together.

I'm average-looking, but here and there, I get stopped by strangers saying how incredibly beautiful I am. Usually it's a gay, lesbian or transexual person. I'll be 44 this March. I can't imagine what sort of man would be patient with someone like me. I'm still coming into my own. I wonder what people see when they see me, and if I matter. Now that this man has been arrested, it may take 1 - 3 years until a grand jury decides if we go to trial. 

I hope everyone here is taking good care of themselves. Maybe we'll never be ""with anyone"" ever again, but all we have are each other and we have to be good to one another. I hope you find happiness in something out there.

My kids are in their late teens, and I have the opportunity to date the single parent of one of their friends.  I'm not sure how acceptable or common it is for those situations to occur and I have no clue if this will cause some weird psychological issues to my kid.

I (hetero man) have gone out on one date with her.  It was a pleasant and ""appropriate"" date where we enjoyed each others' company, flirted enough to test out our chemistry (positive results), and we've been chatting ever since.  There are some good vibes here.

So now my worry is if there's something here I'm not noticing, if there's some bad stuff I need to watch out for?  I didn't ask my daughter for permission before the date (I'm not sure that was necessary, and I believe in boundaries), but I did tell her that it was happening, so there aren't any secrets.  i haven't had a ""deep"" talk with her on this topic yet - I wanted to have that first date and see how things went beforehand.

Back then, at least where I am, dating multiple women at once would have had you on the run from both if you were found out so it‚Äôs not something I ever attempted.

After a couple of first dates that didn‚Äôt go anywhere, I had first dates within a week with S and the C.  I‚Äôve had 4 dates with S and on the 3rd date the goodnight kiss escalated and we spent the night together.  We have plans to get together again this weekend

I‚Äôve had a couple of dates with C and we have plans for a 3rd date this weekend as well.   Things haven‚Äôt gotten physical with C yet but based on how the banter is going it‚Äôs on both our minds.

They‚Äôre quite different people and I enjoy spending time with them both for different reasons.

There‚Äôs been no questions asked or info given with either woman on being exclusive, or if any of us are dating others, I have no idea if they are although S has been super busy at work and wouldn‚Äôt have had time.

Afraid? Need a lot of space and worried about losing it? Worried about opening the heart?

A few months back I started dating a guy I'd known for a while (I've written about him previously). At first it seemed he was somewhat ambivalent but then one day a switch seemed to flip and we've been dating steadily for a few months.  Not fast, just steady.  He still talks about how he wants to go very slow, and he's been alone for a long time, gotten used to it and sort of built his life around it, so timing is a little challenging (from his perspective). I'm in no hurry myself but do really like him.

So, things had been going really great and I shared a piece of writing with him that was me opening up about how I experienced a tender moment with him and how I saw our developing relationship.  I used a lot of language around going slow, staying in the 'shallows' (lots of water metaphors in the writing) , taking time, us being sovereign entities who are flowing together.  He's an avid reader and writer himself so I thought he'd appreciate it. It kind of backfired.  


His message back indicated that he loved the writing but saw it as very deep and heavy, and that he's on a slower path, and referenced being alone for so long and a tendency to need to be solo, but really liking how we fit together.  He said that I come on strong (but didn't say how) and going fast makes him nervous.  It wasn't a good time to dive into it b/c he left to travel internationally (which he'd invited me on but i couldn't go),  and is on yet another trip starting today for a week. 

A couple weeks prior he'd written me a message about how he's grateful we are together and that it feels like a fire that burns a long time, like a ""good oak fire"", not a paper fire that is hot and heavy and burns out.  Really, really sweet.  Then some really flirty texts the next week about a thousand things he likes about me.

But then after my writing and his reply he's been quite sparse in his communication. He's been traveling a lot and I saw him kind of unexpectedly today. I asked if we were good and he said yes, but that it's just the same stuff he mentioned at the beginning when we first started dating (finally okay being alone). Then a big hug and a kiss, but he had to go.  

Here's where I want perspective: This whole ""I'm used to being alone"" thing has come up a few times, and I know that I can't change his perspective/attitude on where he's at, but it just seems weird to me that you'd maybe put up mental barriers to flow of a relationship b/c you are so used to being alone.  It seems like when I take any forward movement it triggers this. He has mentioned wanting to not get super hurt again. But isn't that all of us?

I've not been alone nearly as long as he has (dating a lot since divorce 8 yrs ago but nothing more than 6 months max, but lots of trying on his part).  


It's making me question what I feel when we are together b/c we have such a great time, so natural, and easy and he's mentioned things like me meeting his family and has invited me to Cancun and Kauai.  So I don't even get why he has to keep mentioning these things an pulling back.  I  have never mentioned being in a hurry whatsoever, and NEVER mention things like marriage or even broaching the topic of being ""in love"" (I'm not there yet, that is something I do really slowly, esp at this age).

For those who are used to being alone, does finding someone you really like freak you out when they reveal that they like you, or when they want something? 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a tendency to want to see the bright side of my relationships, so trying to look more objectively at this. Is it a red flag that he keeps mentioning the whole ""I'm used to being alone"" mindset.

We will have a talk when he gets back but I'm really thrown off.  If he's an avoidant person that just won't work for me (does that approach work for anyone) unless we can work through it together.

We had an argument last night on the phone.  Together 6 months, we love each other, no question.  He has not met my children yet.  It‚Äôs hard to summarize but essentially here is what happened.

I‚Äôm struggling with some pretty big issues with both of my children right now, and I‚Äôve learned to lean on my BF for support, which he has been truly amazing with.  I do the same for him.  Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances occurred after we‚Äôd been dating for a few months and I‚Äôve needed it more than he has.  However.  One thing that has come up before is that he will listen to my concerns/fear/pain, then what it at least feels like to me, he will then launch into advice.  Does he give good advice when I ask for it?  Absolutely, without question.  But in this convo last night, I was just feeling my children‚Äôs pain and I needed a shoulder, not to be coached.  Which I feel like he was doing, so I asked him if he was giving me advice because he thinks I don‚Äôt already know these things or haven‚Äôt already done them?  He was offended and amongst other things intimated that I focus on the negative, and as my committed partner he is allowed to speak his thoughts without me being defensive.  That hurt because I‚Äôve kept my chin up and have come through adversity with positivty and strength, and I have worked hard to ensure I move through my life without bitterness and resentment.  I show up for him and our relationship.  I open up to him when he prods me to do so (and also when I want to) and that trust has slowly built over time.  I am old enough to realize men and women communicate and process matters of the heart differently.  He‚Äôs solution oriented.  I‚Äôve raised my children alone for 8 years, and I am not knowing exactly how
to navigate someone sharing their opinions on how to handle things on the home front.  But I‚Äôm really trying.

Today we texted good morning and nothing else, which is clear to me he‚Äôs upset (we usually text throughout the day and speak on the phone more or less every day).  I texted to say I was sorry for last night, and was he wanting space tonight?  His response was simply ‚Äúyup‚Äù.  He has told me before when I‚Äôm not receptive to his thoughts it tells him I‚Äôm not committed an actual relationship, because this is part of being in one.  I‚Äôve told him I need time to adjust to a new person in my life even having an opinion.  Again, this isn‚Äôt the first time this type of conflict has come up.  Overall we are very compatible, couple hiccups along the way as we are both quite headstrong and he is extremely political and I am not, but I think it‚Äôs actually a positive thing as we have excellent communication.  But this is‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know.

I know I‚Äôll survive a breakup.  I don‚Äôt want to though, I want to continue to build what we have started because it has been wonderful.

I've always rushed things and attached to people too quickly, so I'm not sure how this is done.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,62289,public,self,Dating multiple people,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r1b4hg/dating_multiple_people/,some_ads,7,,768086fc-26b0-11e9-be98-0eb82b5255d4,dark,,,,,

Ugh so here goes. I (41F) hate feeling like a teenager again not knowing how to date but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at post divorce! I‚Äôve been trying OLD for about a year and I‚Äôve gotten a lot more comfortable with it and have had some fun experiences and met some interesting people, but I‚Äôm having a hard time dealing with the uncertainty and unspoken rules about expectations. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm overthinking this as I have an anxious attachment style but I really like this guy so far. We‚Äôve been on 4 amazing (IMO) dates so far. He is my age. We met on Hinge and he has been the one to ask me on each date. However, I was the one to text him after our third date because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him for a few days. But he did immediately respond and ask me out. After our 4th date, which was Mon eve, he texted as always to make sure I got home okay and I replied and told him I had fun. He replied he did too and said ‚Äúhave a happy thanksgiving.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. He was never a big texter but I‚Äôm wondering if this was a blow off or why I‚Äôm not starting to feel more certain now that we‚Äôve already hung out 4 times. FWIW we make out a lot on our dates (all initiated by him) but he hasn‚Äôt tried to take me home or anything, which I consider a good thing (I prefer to wait for exclusivity before sex). Should I follow up with him? Or see if he reaches out to me?
