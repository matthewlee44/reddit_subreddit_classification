When we hear/see/know they might be **bad** then we justify what we want regardless of other's *warnings* *and insight* and try to prove the world wrong. By **good** I do mean that 'nice' or 'sweet' person that isn't what you would initially prefer in a partner based off whatever personal reason but you know...the ones your parents and friends LOVE. By **bad** I do mean that 'risky' or 'dangerous' person you know you want because initially you just 'know' but and can't figure out why but you know...the ones your parents HATE but friends may question.

For example - I can run into a woman who I think is good or great in my eyes, despite their imperfections or flaws because that's what makes them 'them'. (Blinded by love? Puppy dog love?)

\- I can come across another woman who has great positive qualities that I like and can relate to( not drinking or not a fan of tattoos or likes to read)...but then they have kids from another relationship.(Picky maybe?)

\- I can meet a woman who I know instantly there is that instant 'type' attraction but deep down that it will be nothing but the physical/lust. ( Jumping too soon to conclusion?)

Let's be honest, doesn't it almost always go back to the sex factor? Everything other than it or everything about it, it all goes back to it. Be it our personal preference, that inner gut voice, or bio-sub-instinctive truth of what we feel would be best for us to mate with( pleasure/healthiest children/etc.)

I won't clump every person in the same category because not every man or woman intentionally goes after and continues to be with someone who is **bad** for them. Some know their worth more than others and walk away from what benefits them not. Some learn their lesson after a **bad** partnership. Some experience a **good** partnership and it ends for said reasons. Sometimes maybe what may be **bad** in others eyes actually is **good** for us, to us, with us? Maybe deep down those guys and gals aren't so good themselves ;)

As I write this I also think it might just have to do with *not being willing to take a chance on someone or something that does not fit into our subconscious or biased frame of mind what we think is attractive or best for us. Aka 'Our Type'*

I messaged him that I already have some materials because I used to teach my other friends. Basically, he agreed and we met.
And it was awesome. Never in my life have I seen anyone more charming than him. We studied a bit then we decided to talk just about us. When we left, he texted me 2 hours later that he enjoyed it a lot. But then he didn't text me for 2 weeks and I didn't care either. Before Christmas he casually texted me if we're going to meet or nope. I agreed and it was at his place this time. And same thing, we talked for hours I really enjoyed it. But then we started kissing and he proceeded to touch me here and there which I'm not comfortable with because of my insecurities. He apologized and I couldn't really notice that he cared much. We talked, left and no messages till then. The following day I told him that I really enjoyed the meeting  so he agreed saying it was very nice. I waited one day thinking that maybe he'd suggest something. Then wished him happy new year and since then, he still hasn't read my message.
Here's the question. Should I text him? Suggesting some meeting or asking if everything's alright? We never talked much on social media as he stated he's not very active there. Are there any red flags that I've missed and he just wanted a normal hook-up? I rarely get charmed as I've always been a cold person and couldn't really express my feelings.

Barely been kissed. I certainly don't know what a crush or infatuation was. 

Yes I am asking what a crush feels like. 

A few months ago I was on a trail where I encountered a park interpreter just walking up the trail. She was walking up a hill at me, I hadn't made eye contact yet because she was looking behind her, and I felt like a significantly enhanced feeling of admiration of her. This is before I literally even see her face. 

As she comes up I have a heightened interest in looking at her face, eyes, skin, hair, and needing to notice it. There's absolutely no reason for this. There's almost very light woozy sensation with in my mind. It's a little bit like brain fog, but not the same. 

None of this is lustful at all. It just stands out to me more and her presence is a more visible for some reason. All she does is say hello and tell me they are closing in a few minutes. That's it and walks up the trail. 

I know she's a park ranger, interpreter which I've encountered many times (hundreds actually) with no different feeling. For some reason in this ten minute experience I find that very admirable she does this for a living and I wouldn't mind talking to her more and getting to know her, like more than a friend. 

All of this almost instantaneous and sporadic. It just came upon me for absolutely no reason. It wasn't just like running into an average person or another girl. I've encountered many young and female rangers like this. It's never happened before or sense. Several months later it does stand out however.

I have essential tremor, which means my hands, and sometimes other body parts, shake rhythmically when I move them to quite a severe degree. I went on a date where the guy stared into his lap the entire time while we were drinking and eating. We're in our 30s.

I had no idea what was going on, but then he suddenly turned around without making eye contact, started making out with me, and initiated intimacy. This happened for two dates. I assumed he wasn't interested in building a relationship, but then he called to ask me on a third date.

I asked him why he couldn't make eye contact and he said it was because he was uncomfortable, and he didn't want to make me uncomfortable eating and drinking with my tremor. He said he didn't know where to look or how to help me.

I teared up. He said he did like me, and he thought that if we kept casually dating, he may be able to overcome his comfort, so we planned a third date. He then cancelled it because he was uncomfortable with how he had made me feel and didn't want to be in ""relationship repair mode"" already. Funnily enough, he had no problem instigating intimacy.

Others on Reddit have said it's quite normal for someone not to make eye contact when they're uncomfortable around someone who has a disability, but does this still apply when he initiated intimacy? Also, it's just a tremor, not a huge growth on my face or something like that. It just seems weird to me.

What are people's thoughts?

I think online dating puts a whole lot of stress on me and wears me down mentally. I figured I'd try a different route in 2022. I live in a small city, roughly 60,000 people but the city draws alot of people from the surrounding county close to 600,000 people. I'm going to list some things about me that I guess may be able to help me out in my journey!

\- 24 years old, manufacturing engineer, homeowner, dog owner, 6'1""ish and 200 pounds in good shape training weight lifting for the last 5 years. I'd say somewhat attractive as I don't typically have trouble finding matches or dates online(3ish first dates a month)

\-hobbies include working out, house renovation, walking, music, reading, skiiing, outdoors, video games

\- Sober for 5 years now, humor is important, sweet tooth, ambitious

\- [https://imgur.com/a/TZtS2ih](https://imgur.com/a/TZtS2ih) for images of me to help I guess

How do I play off of these characteristics to find potential dates/partners as I am looking for something long term? Online just makes it easy to list things but feels not so authentic in the end.

So i am 19F &amp; at the age of 17 is when i started to really dive deep into serious relationships. I had my first boyfriend at 17 and he was 19 and i was very naive so he could get away with a lot of things like texting other girls etc, well fast forward our break up with him i met a 21M and fell instantly in love our connection was like no other and i had never felt like this before. I really loved him although the love was strong we were very toxic and would break up a lot and get back together and this went on for a year and a half. So anyway to put this short we broke up around 6 months ago now for good, we started speaking again and we talked about how we both had matured and we see a future together still. Well i have found out last weekend that he got a girl pregnant (he never told me anything and kept this all a secret) i still don‚Äôt know if he had cheated on me or if it was when we were on a break. Now at 19 (i understand i am young etc but i want what i want) i do want a partner, i would like to have somebody in my life but as weird as it sounds my dating life is so unlucky , i will match with guys and they will unmatch me or i will meet a guy like him and he will not like me or anything like that , nobody seems to like me back and i will get guys following me on instagram to just unfollow me , i will meet guys at the bar we will get on he will invite me out and i would message him the next day to be left on delivered for a day and then ignored , i genuinely would say i‚Äôm a very attractive girl , i am curvy etc but is it me ? what is wrong with me :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1146336,public,self,Too unlucky for love?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rv60vf/too_unlucky_for_love/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I asked to go for a drink first but he wanted to just stay at his house so I just went straight over. I was certain that the nature of the relationship was that we were just gonna hook up, but then he seemed quite wholesome when we were together.

We did have sex a few times, but we also snuggled a lot and watched tv. He kept squeezing me a lot while we cuddled and he gave me back tickles in the morning and pulled me into him. I also caught him looking and smiling at me a few times. He also checked I got home okay after I left.

Long, elaborate letters via WhatsApp, quick exchanges, voice mails, jokes/memes, the whole nine yards. We got along great pretty much instantly.

To give context: She suffers from depression and has a lot of stressful shit going on in her life right now, but would always respond to my texts. Sometimes to vent, asking me for advice or just to joke around/flirt. She said it calms and centers her. The ""letters"", that I received from her the last 2 days sounded very absent-minded and ""matter-of-fact"". The messages were full of conversational cul-de-sacs like ""haha, that happens sometimes"", ""I can't explain that right now"" or ""I don't know"", which was rather unusual of her. I had no clue how to respond to that. The weeks before, we had an amazing dynamic. We never ran out of things to write and there was genuine interest on both sides.

So I carefully addressed it in an voice mail. I was upfront, but remained respectful and diplomatic in my tone and assured her that everything's fine and she didn't do anything wrong. I suggested that we should stick to shorter messages for the time being, since it seems to be a little to much for her at the moment and I didn't want to be an additional burden to her. She said that I was right and that she is falling deeper into the ""conversation void"", further withdrawing and not wanting to write or interact with others too much. She appreciated my honesty and didn't take it the wrong way. We ended on a positive note, joked and flirted for a bit. ""See you tomorrow"" was the last thing she wrote.

Yesterday, I wished her a good time at her friends' new years eve get-together, joked about probably getting drunk texts from her (we were both in on the joke) and after 7 hours of no responses asked if she was ok (I was getting a little concerned). She then blocked me around midnight on WhatsApp, unmatched me on Tinder and can't be reached via phone call.

The whole day I'm trying to rack my brain around what could possibly have happened, but it just doesn't make sense to me. She just doesn't seem like the type to just ghost someone like that, especially since I was understanding of her issues and never pushed or pressured her into anything (something she said she liked and appreciated a lot). This behavior just doesn't seem to make sense and seems so unlike her. But then again, I've only known her for a month, so...

I can't figure out if and when I meet the right person, I'll be really excited to keep seeing them after a date or two, and that just hasn't happened yet, or if I'm awkward and putting up a wall and pushing any chance of a connection away?

I‚Äôll ask if he wants to help me give our dogs a bath (he loves helping and baths so I thought it would be a good activity to do together) but as soon as he was up my bf asked his kid if he wants to help dad bathe the dogs. He happily said okay and my bf mouthed ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and I still ended up bathing the dogs, just not with his son. I was annoyed about this but got over it. Next day, his son was grumpy and saying this like ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù ‚Äúgo away, I don‚Äôt want you to sit on the couch‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to watch this show with me‚Äù ‚Äúmy house not yours (I pay rent..)‚Äù I tried to get him to calm down myself but at that moment I was the devil to him so I went to my bf who was on his phone in the kitchen for help. My bf goes up to him and asks ‚Äúare you being nice?‚Äù The kid says yes. I‚Äôm going to my room to play now. Bf says ok have fun. I explained to him that I didn‚Äôt like how he went about that and I felt like he was reinforcing the behavior of saying whatever he wants to me. He got upset and said that he didn‚Äôt feel that way at all about how he said it and that I‚Äôm overreacting. Next day (his son going back to his moms for the week) got home from work and his son greeted me happily. Had great conversation and time but asked why he wasn‚Äôt wearing the sweater I got him for Christmas. His dad jumps in and says if I send him with that I‚Äôm never gonna get it back from his moms. I get it but I had explained to him how excited I was about his sweater and showing it off and his mom was totally on board too! But his dad wanted him to wear it at our house. I asked if he is embarrassed of me getting him that or if his mom is gonna have an issue with it or what. He explained it wasn‚Äôt anything like that but it still definitely came off that way. 
He‚Äôs still upset at me telling me that I‚Äôm telling him how to parent and that he‚Äôs trying his best and I need to calm down.

I had met this girl and we had been talking for about 2-3 weeks. All on the phone by the way. This was when I was getting to know her and we were still in the talking stage. Everything was so smooth until she wasn‚Äôt replying as much anymore. She‚Äôd reply once a day or twice day. There was no change in her mood towards me but my anxiety kicked in when she was barely replying and I thought she was going to stop talking to me like the others and move on to other people. I‚Äôm a very weird person and also hopeless romantic in a sense that, once I start talking to someone, I‚Äôm committed to them totally and that‚Äôs when I thought the same cycle was going to continue. So one day when she didn‚Äôt reply I sent nudes back and fourth with someone I had known for a while. I did it knowing that she was going to stop talking to me and move on. It was the next day that she told me that she‚Äôs sorry that she hasn‚Äôt been replying and that it‚Äôs because a lot of stuff is happening in her life that she‚Äôs dealing with. Three weeks later, this girl became my girlfriend. The best person that has ever happened to me.
