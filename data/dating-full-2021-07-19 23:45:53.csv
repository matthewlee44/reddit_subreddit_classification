I want to have positive experiences with women and don't want to get into a ""all women suck, woe is me mindset"".. But my dating experiences have certainly put my optimism to the test and I don't see how I'm supposed to maintain a positive outlook in light of all I've experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

My negative experiences with women have far outweighed my positive ones.

Women my age where I live seem to be super reserved more often than not; they tend to freeze up around me (look like a deer in headlights) and contribute very little to conversations and certainly don't start them, let alone flirt with me (never happens).

I've been wildly successful on Tinder in terms of hundreds/thousands of matches, messages, responses, numbers, dates/hookups. However, in the process I've had to persevere through lots of crap from women like time wasting, enthusiastically agreeing to dates and then ghosting, gaslighting me, cheating, not communicating clearly, love bombing and then abruptly dropping me, trying to trap me at their house.

Dating aside, I occasionally have had women messaging me out of the blue just to put me down and be super rude to me unprovoked. I certainly don't have women messaging me out of the blue to say something nice.

Yes, there's the ""well you dodged a lot of bullets so don't worry"" mindset but it's the fact that it's so lopsided with so many negatives and so few positives that gets to me sometimes. What makes it worse is that Reddit dating threads and my peers act as if someone ""like me"" is supposed to have such a super easy time with women being out of their way receptive but yet my experience has been the complete opposite.

It feels like I'm just supposed to persevere through an endless gauntlet of bullshit, getting a ton of negative experiences with little positive ones, while still somehow staying positive just to have the possibility of meeting a woman who's a good fit for me.

But how do I do this in light of all I've experienced?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,907923,public,self,(24M) How am I supposed to stay positive and not get bitter about dating when my negative experiences with women far outweigh the positives?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onqmno/24m_how_am_i_supposed_to_stay_positive_and_not/,all_ads,6,,,

When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. We went to a party that was wasted. He and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me. Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.



He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about the trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.



I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him a rapist, a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person. I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for five years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager he's says he took them because he thought I wouldn't mind.I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time.



He acts like I'm a rude cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,”I was drunk too. I didn’t take advantage of you. You just made the mistake of fucking me apparently. Yeah sorry I didn’t hit you up after but what did you expect? You think I haven’t been dealing with shit too? You think you’re the only one who’s got problems? Grow up. Stop taking out all your anger on me. I’m sorry I just use you for sex but I thought that was a part of our relationship that was mutually understood. Apparently not, once again.”



One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend Am I a mean person for sending these messages? Does that make me a bad person?

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

It’s good information to know, but it’s difficult to figure out what to do going forward. Yeah, she might be cautious about jumping into another relationship so quick. But if you like me, i think you should give it a chance. I believe all guys would agree with me on this.

I need some advice, harsh advice… I’ve known this guy since I was young he was the friend of my “ex” when I was in 3rd to like 5th on and off. You know, kiddy relationships, lol. Well his friend let’s call him saiyn lol don’t ask why because I don’t know. Anyway, me and saiyn reconnected a few years ago maybe like 3 but I would always ignore him and like just respond, and be very inconsistent, even though he always texted me saying how he’s been waiting for me to come back around. I gave him a change back then, well…. Too many chances. Long story short he was super flaky when I actually put energy into it and started wanted him also. It continued for years. We never met up like he said we was, the “plans” were never actually plans they were just texts, but with no action. I remember following his friend (the one I brought up earlier in the story, and the one this is all about) let’s call him jusi. I remember following jusi on Instagram after seeing someone post him and he slid in my DMs lol. I was stiff for a little, but then I finally gave him my number. I don’t remember much from us talking, but it didn’t work out really I feel like mostly it was a kiddy thing and I had no business even being aloud to date and see him. Jusi came back around this April and basically said he really wants to get to know me more and possibly start something Told him I wasn’t ready and said. If he could give me some time that would be cool. So I told him I would hit him up when I’m ready. He would keep in contact basically just ask if I’m okay every once n again. Until we finally had a conversation after months and he told me he really liked me and had been waiting.I am gonna be honest, I would sometimes call him bae and just play around with him knowing I wasn’t ready. He told me he can’t keep chasing me forever and said that we could just be friends. I said ok and we went on about our way, other than him texting me sometimes and I wouldn’t respond, but in the back of my head he was on my mind a lot. I finally thought I was ready for a relationship and so I texted him asking to talk and he said okay and I told him I felt bad for leading him on and that I wanted to Give him a chance. He said not if I feel bad and I told him I really did like him and so basically over he period of me giving him the chance he wanted to see my apparently and the first time I told him I was getting off at a specific time, 8, and he said he would be somewhere but I didn’t wanna go so I asked him if I could chill with him before he goes and he said yes, and so basically 8 rolls around and I text him, but no response. This pissed me off being that I got done upto see him. 10:30 rolls around and I’m already home, and he calls like 4 times after I let it ring and the last two times I hung up on first two rings. I was mad. He accidentally send a voicemail n I heard him with his friends, and so I called him back, but he hung up on the 3rd ring. He later texted me at like 11 something and asked what I was doing and if I could take him to his moms house… wtf? So I said dtm and he said lol okay nvm bae. So we’ve asked me something and i said didn’t I tell you not to text me and he was asking what he did and I explained to him that I didn’t like flaky people and he said he was with (my ex the one earlier in the story) ( is that even considered an ex lol I don’t know? And said he knows how I am with people in my face ( which is true I don’t like social interactions like that especially with my ex) so I understood and I told him in the phone answer my texts but in a playful way like boy next time you better let me know and answer. He said okay and basically I was supposed to buy sonethibg from him and see him because he said he wanted tk se that day and he asked where I was and I didn’t text back till an hour and then he asked me to pull up to a specific place to buy it and and I asked exactly where like send my the adress and he read it and after an hour I said never mind, then I blocked him. I blocked him beCause I felt like I got played. Even though he was very open about how he felt and what happened. Now I’m wondering if I need to move on or ? He’s always on my mind I’m also answering if his friend my childhood ex that was also flaky had anything to do with it? Ugh. He seemed so genuine and every since I’ve known him he’s Lways been genuine and open about how he felt, :9 idk.

Majority of instances of online dating (thanks Covid) that I’ve dealt with, dates have been easily accepted however end up being nothing but super casual/nothing. 

For me, a date has always implied legit romantic interest and not just a super casual thing. I do say that upfront, but it still occurs quite frequently. 

It very well could be me, but I’m curious what the consensus here is. Both men and woman, please do answer. I’m curious what your views are and how I can better improve myself for online dating when searching for a legitimate relationship.

We decided to get drinks at a bar around 8 and by the time the night ended, it was 4 am. We met up with two of his friends briefly during the night. Neither of us expected to be out until that late, but we couldn't stop talking about life and getting to know each other. We didn't want the night to end.

We hung out again two days later and again, the time was so great. He met my dog at the dog park and then we got a late lunch. I had another commitment, so I had to leave.

One of my good girlfriends said to bring him to our Friday night dinners, so he's coming this week.

That said, I'm terrified to keep seeing this guy because in a month, l'll be going back to college for my senior year. And he just graduated from college this past May. I'm afraid of continuing this guy and falling for him and then feeling so sad when college rolls around in September. I got a full time offer, so I will end up in the same city as him and we do live one block away from each other. It turns out we both own the respective buildings we live in. So even if I stopped seeing him now, I'd probably end up bumping into him at the Duane Reade or subway or Dunkin. And he knows that I still have a year of college left.

She's 20 and I'm 23. We would be at the 4 date mark by now but I had to cancel one due to a family emergency. The next cancelled one happened because she actually tested positive for covid and had to quarantine for 2 weeks. 

Our last date was a couple weeks ago. It was great, and was about 6 hours in total. We haven't had sex yet, but we have made out and definitely gotten pretty frisky/hot. She's told me she isn't ready for sex and I totally understand that. 

A few days after our last date, I texted her. I wanted to touch base with her and see how she felt. I felt the need to do this since we have been talking for a little while (2 months) and wanted some clarification. I'm the kinda gut who'd rather speak my mind and be open with communicating versus holding things in. I value communication. 

She told me she wasn't looking for anything serious. I agree, because I'm ready to not commit to something either. I'm working on myself and if she magically texted me tonight saying she wants to date me I'd want to slow down also. I'm just getting to a point where I'm realizing there's potential and I'm getting excited/starting to over analyze and read too far into things. 

I asked her if she wanted to keep things casual and she said she didn't know, but that she wanted to see me again and go on more dates. She followed that response with that she ISNT friendzoning me and wants to keep dating, but doesn't know exactly what she wants. 

I ended it by telling her what we've been doing is great and would like to continue if she did also, in which she said she would love that too. 

I don't remember our communication patterns when we first started talking. We had a period of time where we were texting A LOT, had a long streak on Snapchat, and she would FaceTime me periodically as well. I've never FaceTimed her where I'm The one reaching out first. 

We still snap and text, but we lost our long streak. We text maybe once a week to every 2 weeks. On Snapchat we usually have small/flirty talk. We don't have a streak anymore. 

Lately I feel like I've been making the first move and initiating a lot of it. Last week she hit me up to talk about that show manifest and we ended up talking until almost 2am. 

Yesterday we talked on snap in which I initiated it. She was flirty and responsive and everything was honestly normal. Today I went no contact and she didn't reach out which I was expecting. 

We haven't gone no contact like ever. I feel like i should give her some space. She is traveling every weekend until august 21st. She injured her knee at work and I was initially wanting to plan a hiking date. With her travelling so much these upcoming weekends, I want to aim for a weekday. We talked last week and she said ""we will find time"" when she told me she was going to be gone. 

I was thinking a picnic or something. I don't know yet. In regards to giving her space, if I dont reach out for 3 days or so, that'd be the longest we've gone with no contact. She'd definitely notice the change.  

I want to give her space since I feel like ive been making the first move at least as of lately. If she doesn't reach out in 3 days (she's going to be busy and out and about) I plan on dropping a line and seeing how her trips going.  

After our conversation ended yesterday, she liked my Instagram post I posted that day. She also liked the Tik Tok video I posted today as well.

Two guys that never wanted to actual commit, and a few from Tinder when I was in my final year. EVERYONE in my HS was in a relationship, and I desperately wanted a boyfriend to seem normal. I felt like an unloveable, ugly weirdo.

When I got into college, I was focused on my education and kind of left dating behind me. I'd had so many bad experiences with Tinder LOL, and this time, I met a lot of new friends that were also single. So I didn't feel like a weirdo anymore.   
I had a close friend that I'd met during orientation week, and in a span of a few months, he started asking me to hang out more and more. At first I was kind of hesitant, but when I finally started paying attention to him it was too late... he met another girl in a club and literally fell in love with her.

I met a few guys in my classes after that, but I would always eventually get left on read. Then they would send me something a few days later like they hadn't just ignored me. I would try to make entertaining conversation/talk about something funny and it would be met with neutrality. So I stopped trying. They stopped trying.   
I started to wonder if it was because I don't show enough interest, Was I too indifferent (because I desperately don't want to appear clingy or annoying)?  I've done a few experiments I guess, where I've been super warm/nice/flirty with a guy and it usually ends up the same way. 

A year or two later, I met a guy in class that would comment stuff like ""you've probably got a bunch of frat guys in your dms"" and ""how many guys do you even talk to?"" What a joke. I actually really liked him and it was so obvious, but he never made a move beyond flirting.   
Just recently, however,  he's been suggesting a date. I'm just worried it's just going to go like 'ok let's go to a bar or something' - and then 'ok nice time' - I catch feelings again but then we never talk. 

In fact, this literally happened with a guy I met on a dating app last year. It basically sums up how most of my dates go:  
Usually when I go on dates, guys just naturally give compliments when they first see you. Nothing creepy, just a ""you look great!"" or something.  
When I met up with this guy, he just kind of looked at me. Mind you, every time we'd talked before this he went on about how *stunning* and *gorgeous* I was (way too excessive and suspicious, I'm more 'cute' than anything, not a supermodel). I have pretty bad self-esteem, so I started feeling really insecure. I just kept thinking ""ok he thinks I'm ugly in real life lolol why am I here"". 

As the night went on, the only thing he said was ""it's probably just this angle, but you look nice"". It didn't feel like a compliment to me. 

After the date, he texted me almost immediately that he'd had a lot of fun.   
He called me the next day to say the same thing, but did not suggest another date. My friends kept telling me that was a bad sign and that I had to fall back.  
We were supposed to talk later that week, but literally 10 minutes before, he said 'I'm too busy"", instead suggesting the next day.   
But then the SAME thing happened again. What makes it even worse, was that he *knew* he was going to be busy with work both days; he'd just waited til the last second to tell me that. I don't give a shit if you need to reschedule, but I got ready BOTH days in a row just to hear ""can't today"" 10 minutes before. You can only assume that it's out of disinterest and disrespect!!

Fast forward a month, and he asked to 'hang out'. It was the last straw for me. A whole month of sending memes once a week. At one point, I thought, ok he's sending memes as a way to reach out and spur conversation. So I TRIED, dear reader, I tried! Any stories or conversation starters were literally met with ""Lol"" half the time. There is no way he was interested. So when I got that 'can we hang out' text, I just didn't respond. Never heard from him again.

I guess that's an example of how most of my dates go. The guys I'm not very interested in are always the ones that put in tons of effort to make a second date happen, make an effort to talk to me, etc, but I'm just not attracted to them at all. I often wonder, if I was attracted to them, would it end up going the way it usually does? Downhill? Probably.

It's so frustrating. If I'm being honest, it really hurts my self-esteem and makes me feel so ugly. It's getting to a point where I don't believe anyone can truly love me.

I already made plans so I said I can't, but that I'd be in his area the following Saturday and he said we can go on a hike. So we went on the hike and it was fun, but I had plans after, I said that he can come join my friend's party after too, but when I got to my friend's party, no one else invited their S/O's so I thought it might be awkward, and told him next time.

After that, our convo ended with him giving me a one word reply, so I didn't bother. He texted me again 10 days later sending me a song about an artist we talked about on our last hang out. He said we should hit up karaoke and I said I was down. He told me he was going to go with his boys and asked me if I'm down to join.

Her family comes from a well-off background and my family is pretty middle-class. I never really communicated about how my perception of money maybe different from hers.

I have been dating a woman off of a dating app for about 2 months now. Things were going well until I started to get some bad signs. Figure I'd share a little bit to see what other perspectives think about this. I plan on asking her about it tomorrow, but figure I'd see if I can get some additional perspectives in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

Background

&amp;#x200B;

We're in our late 20's early 30's. She's been single for a few years prior to us dating and only casually dated since then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going very well to kick things off. We deactivated our dating app pretty early on and focused on getting to know each other. We'd speak for hours and wonder where the time went and realized we had a lot in common as we got to know each other. We already planned future ideas for dates with a date jar and talked about making plans for next month.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I appreciate the most about getting to know her is how upfront and open our chemistry is communicating together. We have been able to communicate about anything we've discussed with each other very easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this weekend. We just had our first weekend trip away together and just before we drove out of town she insisted we take a picture together. Afterwards, she asks if she should post it to her Instagram to make it official and I agreed. So she did and we went on our trip and had what I thought was a fun time for the both of us. One thing of potential significance to note is that I had decided to give her a gift I had purchased a few weeks into dating her and was looking for the right time to give her. I decided to give it to her at the last stop of our trip. It wasn't anything lavish or expensive. It was a handcrafted jewelry piece made of clay attached to a leather band from a movie series we both liked. I am not sure if in the general consensus of dating that it's acceptable to give a gift like that after 2 months of dating, but I thought it would be acceptable at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned before, the trip seemed to go well. It wasn't until the ride back towards the end that I did feel things were a little off. I was a bit exhausted from the driving and became quiet. She was quiet too shortly after I was and we sat in mostly silence the last 10-15min or so of the ride back. When we got back to my place where she parked her car she proceeded to put her stuff in and leave. I thought it was a little bit off at the time, but understood we had just been driving and checking things out all weekend and she was probably tired along with me and just wanted to get back home and relax. So I helped put her stuff in her car and said a brief goodbye. I perseverated on it for about 15 minutes after she left and decided to call shortly after just to let her know how I felt. I wanted to see if it was just me or something was off. She replied saying it was because we were both tired and not to worry about it. I agreed with her and we got off the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, we texted a little bit and had a brief chat while she was on her lunch break today. We texted a little bit tonight and I eventually asked her what her week was looking like for plans and to see if she wanted to meet up later in the week since we didn't make any immediate plans for this week. I didn't get a response as it got later and when I checked back on the text I saw that she read the text, but didn't reply. I figured she was probably wanting to sleep on it before getting back to me since I texted her around her bed time.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended opening up Instagram later in the evening. I checked her profile out and noticed that the selfie of us she put up there two days ago was taken down but the album of pictures she took from our trip without us was still on her profile. I found this surprising because she kept commenting how well we looked in the photo all weekend. When putting the missing photo and the lack of response and leaving it through the night together, it makes me believe that she's probably looking for a way to tell me she's no longer interested.

&amp;#x200B;

The only other alternative I can think of is that she's still into me but might have felt it was too soon to throw us out there and make it official and she has some hesitations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, it's not a good sign. Figure I'd put this out there and see if anyone else ran into a similar situation or has a perspective to share on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is discussing this upfront the best idea? I mean, it does seem kind of petty to bring up something like this up. But because it is so early in the dating game when we're not official yet it, it shows as an obvious bad sign. I just won't know truly how bad of a sign it is until we discuss it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,908479,public,self,Dating Two Months In and She Deletes the First Social Media Picture of Us - Not Sure How to Interpret Before Discussing,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onx8qj/dating_two_months_in_and_she_deletes_the_first/,all_ads,6,,,

My boyfriend went on a stag do recently to a party island. He said it was really chilled out and they rented a massive villa to themselves. He did mention it was a big villa so some people came by and they made friends with guys. 

However, I was on Instagram and a page was suggested to me. It was a an influencer type girl who he recently followed. I was curious and had a browse and she had several pics of her over the course of a few days in the same villa as the guys. They had small parties by the looks of things. She obviously got on well enough with my boyfriend for him to be adding her. 

I’m so upset because I thought he’d at least mention it in passing. And he told me it was a chilled holiday but really he was partying it up with other women. I could’ve gone if I knew it were a mixed group thing, or even some of his friends fiancées/wives. 

But what I’m most livid about is the fact that he felt the need to add a hot half-naked girl on social media who he’s only known for two seconds when he has a girlfriend at home. I understand when you’re on holiday you’ll mingle and talk to others (that’s fine), but I don’t get why you’d give them your number or social media when you’re in a relationship. His other friends haven’t followed her.

I’m going to speak to him but just wanted to vent as I’m really confused and hurt right now.

On our last date I've told her that I really like to be with her and she responds that she feel the same.

After this date we had a few days chat-break because she didn't know when she would drive to holiday with her brother. But this doesn't matter.
The problem is she told me that she don't see a future with me.
I asked her why she thinks that and it turns out that the problem is not that we have some (not that much) different point of views, as i thought at the beginning.
She told me that she just wants to end it, because she is currently not feeling in a romantic way as i do.
And this is true. I had the feeling that there were sparks. I also had the feeling though that ther were also some on her side.

When I asked her she also told me that she really likes to be with me and everything else is pretty good.
It sounds like its just the reason because she didn't have the same feelings as i do currently.

In my mind it is quite normal that one side sometimes feels something a bit earlier as the other side. And therefor I won't like to end this, just because of that.
And this is also something I wrote her and because she is working and can't write messages in work, i wait for her answer.

I also had the feeling that she could be a bit afraid to bind, if you know what I mean. In her past she made a traumatic experience, what is actually worked out but maybe its still a offshoot. Idk

So, I matched with a guy on tinder in March but he haven’t met till 10 days ago. Something would always come up, and he wouldn’t follow through. 
10 days ago, we talked and met. I was  drunk which is terrible, and I tried to initiate sex.. Can’t handle alcohol well I guess. I mean I wasn’t obviously drunk but normally I wouldn’t initiate it. He had a drink or two too. It was July 10th.
He didn’t have sex with me. We made out and talked for 7 hours.
The next day I apologized but he said “I enjoy your company so let’s hang out”. The next day he messaged and said that “I came to his mind all day so it is a clear message for him that he wants to see me again”. I messaged 2 days after as well to keep the spark and he said that he thinks of me at work so it’s hard to focus. 
We met for the second time on Friday (16), didn’t have sex either. To be honest I’m glad that he wants to get to know me. He said that there’s a specific reason why he won’t have sex just yet with me. I kept asking why and he said he won’t tell me just yet but it depends on me when he will say that.

I (m27) started dating a girl (f25) for about 1.5 months, we met on Tinder. We really really hit it off on the first date, had a great connection, and  had a brief kiss before saying goodye. She messaged me right after, we set up a 2nd date which was great as well, and ended up having a great time and having sex.

I got her number and and initated first few dates after and then not texting a lot more. She did however start to text me more and more and send goodmorning and goodnight-texts with kiss emojis etc and ended up initiating the texting and basically ""keeping the conversations going"" even though I wasnt giving short answers. Other than that on both the dates and through texting we seemed to be into eachother. She also started to initiate some of the dates. 

We kept on seeing eachother about 1-2 times per week and hangout both outdoor and indoor and were physical all the time and seemed to have a good connection.

We spoke a bit about past relationships, mainly if we've traveled somewhere etc and her latest real LTR (that I knew of at that time) ended 3 years ago.

Since we've both been working and seeing eachother on weekdays we didnt sleep together until last week, about 1.5 months in. She had previously shared some older dramatic experiences, about 10 years ago and well, we got into the subject and I told her about a death in the family that happened a few years ago etc and how that period was rough but it ended up making me a better, stronger person. Around that time I also found out she had broken up with a guy she was together with for 8 months, and we had our first date one month after. She didnt want to discuss it too much but told me she was over him and all they did was fight. Im quite a calm and generally nice, but firm guy, so she told me im nothing like him. Which I found strange and potentially a red flag. I found out his name and later that evening when she was gonna show me something on her phone I saw that she had top search results for him. I felt a bit decieved since this was new information, all of it. I also recalled her one time, when we said goodbye, answering a text (I wasnt snooping but saw the screen) and recalled that same name. I should have confronted her, because she saw that I reacted to something, but I thought I would let it go and and felt that if it still bothered me later I would talk to her about it.

Anyway we spent the night together and it was all good. Before that date she had already asked if I wanted to do a daytrip during the weekend that was coming, and we had made plans. However during the week after when we had contact, she seemed less interested, stopped the goodmorning texts etc and the kiss emojis, but was still the one keeping the conversations going and texted me. I had during that week decided that I was gonna talk to her about the recent ex and had basically set myself up to potentially break things of when we met.

Four hours before were gonna meet she texts me, apologizes several times, cancels the date and tells me that it doesnt feel right and that she feels something is missing. She tells me im a greay guy, awesome, kind and funny and that our dates have been really great. She tells me she wants it to work but that she is not 100% sure. She also then mentions that her previous breakup still affects her. I reply that its a shame to hear, but I had a feeling about it. I then also tell her its been nice, that shes is a nice person and then wish her all the best. She dont reply to that and we've had to contact since.

Afterwards I saw that her recent ex had posted on social media, about 20min before she texted me, an image with some girl and a description that can be interpreted as a hint.

I feel like theres some mixed signals here, but maybe im just not thinking straight. What do you people of reddit think? Was she just realising shes not that into me? Was I just a rebound? Seems she wasnt over her ex maybe? Or was the family trauma I tell her about ""too much"" to share? And, against my better judgement, should I try to reach out after a few months? I would never do under normal circumstances, I usually walk. But... compared to a few others Ive dated I felt like we had a really good connection.

My boyfriend (26, not sure where we stand right now) and I (24) don’t want the same things. He wants a open relationship (we’ve been dating for 6 months and together for 2), and I can’t seem to get myself to be comfortable with something like that because I can’t create boundaries that give me peace of mind. I really want to be with him and he really thinks I’m the person this would work best with, but we’ve come to a standstill where we don’t know how to move forward.

He told me we should take some time off to think about if we’re the right person for each other. I can’t help but feel guilty thinking there is no solution so I feel like it’s ending, or already some what over. I tried sort of breaking it off over the weekend but it didn’t exactly work, we always find a solution but this seems to be one that’s too difficult. 

He’s being nice now, it’s been a couple days since we spoke about that topic and now we just say our good mornings/night and light banter. Our texts are minimal, still caring but I feel like he’s just waiting till he sees me this weekend to end things in person rather through a phone call or FaceTime call but I’m not sure. We’re a bit long distance so I only see him on weekends usually, he’s about a hour commute away. 

I kind of want to text him or call him and tell him if he wants to break up that I’d rather not do it in person, is that childish? My fear is that I’ll sob and it’ll make him feel guilty and make him stay. I also feel like seeing his face in person would shatter me and I won’t want him to leave.

This is the 4th relationship where I’m treated as not enough for different reasons. And I always blamed it on the guys. Like, I am smart, cute, independent and mature (or that’s what thought). Why can’t they just see that? Why do I have to prove myself and yet never be enough? 

I used to be really angry at them and hope they would see back in time the big mistake they did by mistreating me and losing me eventually. But now I see I WAS THE PROBLEM ALL THIS TIME. And not with them but with MYSELF. 

Why did I put them in such pedestal? Why did I have such big expectations for them (but such low standards for me)? Why would I justify their actions? Why would I be scared to say what I truly wanted and needed? Why would I rather be somewhere that made me feel inadequate rather than alone? 

Because I felt like I always have something to prove, because I wanted validation, because these men excelled in their professional life and I mistook that as an adult that knows what they want in life. WROOOOONG don’t let their successful careers fool you. I settled for two that couldn’t forget their ex but wanted my company (took me a long time to accept they were using me), one that cheated on me and one that was embarrassed of me being his ex student in college. And just as them, there are MILLIONS of emotionally unavailable men and that HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 

In my case, I was attracted to them because their professional success somehow meant to me that was a “validation card”. As if they were qualified to validate who I am as a person. They have such credentials in other areas, don’t they? Also, I realized I was begging for such validation because my own father abandoned me without saying goodbye even though we were really close. I, for a long time, felt I was inadequate, incomplete, because not even my father could see the brightness in me. I had expectations for him, but my father was not only a parent, he was a sick man in other aspects of his life and I was just one of the victims, to call it somehow.


Getting back to it, what’s the freaking point of dating someone smart, handsome, funny, polite, successful, if their company makes you feel inadequate, not enough, with self doubts? No amount of good assets could ever be enough to make that feeling of worthlessness be ok. And they are not in the wrong, we are if we already know and yet decide to put up with it, stay with them and EXPECT a change. 

THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN. Expectations are set up in the future, not the present. Take what the present is telling you and realize he is the one deciding for both of you, not you. The moment you decide for both is when you put yourself first and realize he is not that worthy.

No person is THAT special. Believe me, no one. Let’s be responsible of our lives and be held accountable for when we are putting expectations and idealizing someone.

I am 26M in a relationship of 2.5-3 years with my SO 26F. We were friends initially and then started dating. Even before getting together, we knew it was a tough task since we both were complete opposites. But still went ahead anyway, since this is my first ever relationship and she wanted me no matter what.

Here are a few incidences/points that i have observed over time:

* She doesn't accept it if its her fault/mistake or rather never realizes it or her actions. She never apologizes (i don't want apologies, i just want her to understand/realize her own actions) But when i try to make her understand, she goes 100% into denial and turns it on me.
* She says hurtful things when she is mad, looses control over her anger/emotions and says later that i was just venting shit out. (in these cases, apologizes but idk) so when she vents shit out, she can excuse herself, but if i ever get angry, i need to calm myself down? what joke is this?
* She is a pampered child, brought up in a very soft environment. Immature most of the times and oblivious to most things in the world. Do pampered kids ever grow up?
* recent incidence where i didn't text her back for 4 hours, only later when i did, she says, ""now you remember me"" (point is i have had serious discussions with her wrt to texting that if i am not able to reply you back in some time or by eod, its ok and the sky doesn't come falling down without me. its ok when people dont text back whatever the reason maybe, i am sure if i dont text back there must be a good reason behind it) it seems she has completely forgotten our serious discussions about this.

Being a fair person, i don't want anyone to think from just my perspective. I shall answer any question which you may think relevant to my issue here.
