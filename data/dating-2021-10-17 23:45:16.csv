0,qafoul,1634532867,I'm 32F and panicking that I'll never meet someone to settle down with and start a family,"I've been single since late 2019 and that relationship was disastrous as he lied about everything (his age, job etc) and this really scarred me  and I feel like I've had to work a lot to trust men again. Not that it made much of a difference because the global pandemic hit a few months later and so dating was off the cards completely until around April this year. 

2020 also proved to be a traumatic year of loss for me. Since summer this year I've been really trying to date and put myself out there. Some of the guys are lovely but we have no spark. If I meet a guy I like then I don't usually feel the same signals from them. 

I've been on a few demotivating dates and now I am worried that I'll never meet my future husband lol I am very aware that I have a biological clock ticking and I feel like 18months of my life has just disappeared (as we all probably do). All of my friends are in relationships and getting married etc and I am feeling like confused why this isn't happening for me. I know you can't force these things but I'm fully open to being in a relationship and having had 5 boyfriends in my past, I have experience in being a girlfriend in a committed relationship. 

I am quite independent as I live alone and have a good career that pays well, I can afford what I need. I just feel I'm ready for that next chapter (marriage and kids) and it's difficult making that happen. Am I just being a Debbie Downer or is it justified to worry a bit?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qafoul/im_32f_and_panicking_that_ill_never_meet_someone/
1,qafzah,1634534016,Feelings of inadequacy with mentally stable dating versus whirlwind toxic dating,"I’ve been getting a bit more serious with the guy I have been casually dating now for 4 months. We are not exclusive but I’d rather take things really slow to see if we are the right match to get into a serious relationship. 

The thing is- I am so nervous around him. He’s totally chill and welcoming, very sweet, and good vibes all around. He’s also the most attractive guy I have ever dated, and also incredibly smart and ambitious.I feel like a tongue tied teenager around him so to a degree I feel like I haven’t been able to put down my walls as much as I would like. 

I actually feel like I may be an inadequate match. I’ve never felt like that before, actually usually it’s the other way around. I’m at a point in my life where I am still questioning the direction, meaning, and purpose of my life- the last 4 years was a bit of a mid life crisis for me- I’m not currently in it anymore but that’s probably another reason I’m intimidated by him.

I mean, we are lovers and friends, spend time together, and have continually been getting closer. So he must think I’m sufficient enough? Lol. 

I guess another one of the big differences between this “relationship” and my past ones is usually I’m involved with relationships that move in super quick and intensely - being love bombed.  Kind of can be addicting even though they NEVER end well.So part of my nervousness is the slower pace I suppose…

Has anyone experienced feelings like this? Or began a relationship like this? Is this mentally stable adult dating? Lol. 

After my last relationship I am trying to be more conscious about my romantic energies given to people, and being for sure about proceeding forward with my heart. He’s also very self aware and good head on his shoulders.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qafzah/feelings_of_inadequacy_with_mentally_stable/
2,qafzcq,1634534023,Pretty sure my gf cheated on me,"My gf was flirting with men over Snapchat and FaceTiming some since we’ve been in a monogamous relationship, I found out while she is in navy bootcamp and wrote a letter saying what I found and how I’ve been devastated. She sent me two letters. The first one said she is sorry, and that she didn’t intent to cause any problems or disrespect towards me, the second letter she sent seemed more bitter and it said she wasn’t “mad” but “disappointed” I went through her Snapchat and asked me to stop. Does anyone else feel like she initially felt guilty and felt bad in the first letter and owned up to it in a way, but the second letter was a day later and she seemed like over time it pissed her off. Not a good reaction IMO. Also, don’t most if not all cheaters not intend to hurt their partners? Like they aren’t really thinking about anything other than fulfilling their own needs at that moment, whether it be physical or emotional. Her stating she didn’t intend to hurt me doesn’t help cause it just makes me think when she was chatting up these guys she had no intentions of me finding out. She told me about a lot of guys hitting on her and her rejecting them but none of these guys. I’m about to go see her at her bootcamp graduation and tell her how I feel and how much hurt I’ve been in.

4,qag27i,1634534358,What does “baseline attraction” actually mean?,"So I agree attraction is important-it’s a key ingredient that sets apart a romantic/sexual partner from a friendship. But what do people actually mean when they say “we need to feel a baseline level of attraction but it can grow?”  How can we break down what the phrase means?  


Is it when you are aesthetically attracted/mentally recognize someone as your type looks-wise, but don’t feel sexual or romantic attraction yet? 

Or is it when you recognize a specific personality trait, whether or not someone is your type looks wise, that can create a mental/emotional attraction which will lead to a physical attraction? 

Is it when you feel initially lukewarm but let a romantic/sexual spark develop through getting to know their personality? 

Does baseline attraction mean the spark/chemistry start as a small ember and slowly starts burning more intensely?  If so, how does your perception of someone’s looks influence the existence of the spark? 

Or does it mean someone who is “cute (about 7/10) at least but not hot” by society’s standards? Someone who’s hot (like 10/10) to you, irrespective of society’s standards? Or someone who ranges from 7-10/10 personally to you, irrespective of society’s standards? 

And in any of the above  cases (in second to last paragraph), do you feel, and need to always feel, aesthetic and sexual attraction simultaneously? Or does a sexual attraction/spark grow from the initial aesthetic attraction?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qag27i/what_does_baseline_attraction_actually_mean/

8,qaghri,1634536239,So i broke up with my girlfriend(at the time). Long story short I want her back. (More info below)," 

So it all started with me and this girl meeting at the start of school. I develop a crush on her and best comes to best we start talking, then holding hands, then hugging/cuddling, then came the question, ""will you be my girlfriend"". She says yes. Things go great for about 2 weeks until one day she stops holding my hand, hugging me, stops kissing me, stops calling me, stops making an effort to call at all, changes my name in her bio from ""my name&lt;33"" to just ""my first initial"" , takes me off her wallpaper, changes my highlight on her insta page from ""my initial&lt;3"" to just a moon emoji. Basically just acting as if we werent even together anymore. This happened in a span of just one week. That week was the worst of my life, because I was stressing that maybe i wasnt good enough for her and that i had maybe done something wrong.

When i finally confront her 4 days after she started changing, she says "" I need to be honest with you. i haven’t been feeling myself I know that i like you and I thought i was ready to date but ive been reflecting these past days and im not. Im terrified of getting hurt and im terrified of hurting you. I feel so many emotions and its eating me up i’m so confused about dating again. I thought that I was healed from what had previously happened to me but clearly im not. I don’t know how to tell you for what is seemed the longest week but i need to focus on myself. I hate to do this to you especially since you are so perfect and i hate to hurt you it aches my heart.. the reason i’m telling you now is that i’m really hurting myself and I don’t want myself to hurt you in the future. I hope you understand me and dont bash me for how i feel but i’m not okay currently I need time to heal and find myself and love myself again. "".

I reply with blabber about how she didnt tell me anything and that I was upset that she didnt let me know about any past relationships.( So i didnt know anything about her past basically) Worst then comes to worst and i brake up with her because of the stress she caused me that week.

The conversation continues and to sum up the paragraphs and paragraphs we wrote each other, she is basically dealing with too many emotions and she is overwhelmed and is scared of being hurt or hurting me( because of past relationships apparently)

Now that thats over and explained, now to my point. I want her back. We really couldve been something amazing. She was perfect for me.(notice how i didnt say perfect, I said perfect for ME) She understood my humor, talked a lot, cared about me, showed A LOT of physical affection( up until the week of course),was attractive, funny, and much more.

Now, my biggest paradox, im not really sure if im being blinded by emotions or not but im having trouble seeing exactly what she did wrong to make me break up with her. (Which is why im asking reddit) I love her, and I cant stand looking at her, thinking about her, or being at places where we previously had a date.

She said she had mentioned it to others and they said we were in a situationship. We've gone out for dinner, hikes, tonight we began discussing ""hmm, I think I'd like to travel with you sometime 😊"" her words not mine. When she said the ""situationship"" thing her sisters called it.. We spend the rest of the evening just talking as well as kissing in her car. It was sweet. Before that we had just been talking for hours. We haven't gone beyond that, nor been to one another's place yet.

She had gotten out of a serious relationship in 2018.. It was very long and the only person she'd been with.

16,qahhdm,1634540744,In a relationship but guy not feeling 'in love'?,"Hello fam! Thanks for being around when I've needed someone to lend an ear :) I appreciate this community and the insights I've gotten from it!

I am a 29F in an exclusive relationship with a 35M for the last 6 months. It has been fairly ok - a few bumps here and there as we both came in with unhealed wounds (as is normal), but are working through them. We both have long standing histories of **obsessing** over people that have by and large turned out toxic for our mental well being.

Some background about us - we are both simple, grounded, caring people, committed to growing and supporting each other. The sex is great, but we both don't quite feel 'in-love'. For him love means 'that light-headed / airy feeling over the clouds'. For me, I think love is partnership - a conscious choice made to build a life together, to learn together and to commit to continuing to choose each other. Although I have felt a strong surge of emotions in the past with my toxic exe's, I do understand now that 'love' is NOT obsession, love is not what's shown in the movies, and by my definition I think this is love.

What I find strange is the fact that it's been 6 months and he hasn't really confessed feeling 'in love' with me. We continue having great sex, spending time / effort into nurturing this relationship but he doesn't quite think it's love. I am feeling off about being intimate with someone who really enjoys the sex but isn't quite feeling it. It's making me feel low-value coz I wanna feel wanted, and not with someone who's 'not feeling it but doing it anyway'.

I am thinking of expressing how I feel and also maybe drawing a boundary, perhaps telling him that we work to continue nurturing the friendship / relationship without being intimate and see if any 'romantic feelings' come up as those are important to him, but I am not sure if I am on the right track.

Would love to hear this communities thoughts on this. TIA!

I spent a few years healing from that and my next relationship ended up being 2 years with a toxic, manipulative cheater. When I met my late husband, I had healthy boundaries and a low tolerance for emotional manipulation. Looking back, I believe that because I had some residual guilt over my husband committing suicide and second guessed whether or not my boundaries were too ""harsh"" and that is what led me to stay in a bad relationship after for as long as I did.

I have my first date Wednesday since my last relationship ended with a man I met last week. I'm worried that I won't be able to find a healthy medium between feeling too strict and too lenient. The man (41m) I met is polite so far, carries himself well, and although he's usually pretty busy because he's a doctor(heart surgeon) he does seem to call/text promptly and be respectful of my time. I just don't want to spend the entire date overanalyzing and not enjoy the moment.

I was not looking for anyone to date just yet, but I was doing some advertising photos for an upscale hotel/rooftop bar and he approached me as we were finishing up.

37,qak68w,1634554067,I want another chance,"I've posted (and removed) details about this, and I'll try to keep it short here. The general consensus was that she should not be dating right now...

31m met 29f online. We went out 5 times and, as much as I hate to be that guy posting this on Reddit, we are a great match. At least on paper. We hit on pretty much every big relationship thing.

First 2 dates were great, and it became obvious that I would be interested in pursuing a relationship with her. I subtly hinted at that, but she was hot and cold. 3rd date was a trainwreck of awkwardness. She finally admitted that she had only been single a few weeks when we first me, and that she was having trouble. Her relationship was only a couple months long, but sounds like it was full of drama and moved and ended fast.

I got out of a 2 year relationship where we were living together 4 months ago. And even though I'm ready to mentally invest in a new person, I'm finding I'm still rusty in the dating game. So at least part of this awkwardness is on me too.

We agreed to go out again. This time she drove 45 minutes to my place. We went to dinner, which went smoothly. So I asked her back to my apartment (I live alone and she knew this) and she agreed. She seemed very nervous once we got there and things got awkward again. I walked her to her car, she gave a tight hug, and I went in for a kiss. She accepted but it still felt weird given the dynamic.

So I texted her a couple days later. I explained that I felt like she is unavailable right now. And that she should sort things out and then let me know when she does. That I like her and my door is open.

She blew up my phone explaining her past relationships have been different. She dates an abusive alcoholic for 4 years. And her most recent ex was depressed and their relationship revolved around ""fixing"" eachother. And that her mother is twice divorced to alcoholics and that's what she knew growing up. She told me shes not used to ""mature emotionally available men"". I mean, I'm a nice human being but I don't think I'm too ""nice"" in the sense that I'm a people pleaser. I never made any grand gestures to her or anything over the top. I'm just a mentally healthy adult with my life together and I'm not an asshole to strangers. I dont like taking advantage of people. She asked for another chance and invited me to an amusement park with her female friends and their boyfriends.

Against my better judgement I accepted. I like roller coasters too much (so does she) to turn down an offer like that. But given everything going on between us I knew it would be awkward, and it was. The day came and everyone dropped out except for her one female friend. 

So a couple days after, now she basically texts me the same thing that I texted her after date 4. She ends it with me. I'm like uhh what, I just suggested that and you texted me your autobiography and practically begged for another chance, just to end it with me when I give it to you?? I'm so confused.

The back and forth with this girl has caused me a serious headache. Normally I would move on, but I do really like her.

I go no contact and she drunk texts me after a couple days ""Yo"" ""I had 2 sour monkeys and I'm like drunk"" ""What is this life lol?"" 

- Sounds like she's confused about her dating life and still has me in her thoughts. I just said ""lmao"" the next day and she didnt respond.


Have no clue what to do. I'm talking to other people, and I'm sure she is too. I was detaching a little but her drunk texting me makes me wonder what shes thinking.

He reached out in September so we went on 3 dates in a group setting with mutual friends and one with just the two of us. It was casual and we were not exclusive. We agreed on another date last Sunday.

Last Friday unfortunately I got really drunk and hooked up with a guy, which unbeliveably turned up to be a friend from a guy I was dating. I didn't know they were friends and I haven't met him before.

Guy im dating didn't reached out on Sunday to confirm our date so I knew he found out. I decided to just move on from this messy situtation but he reached out on Tuesday with a pasive aggresive comment to let me know he knows everything. I apologised and told him I feel really bad about everything to which he replied it's all good and that it is a really funny story so he had to comment on it. He also said that I fucked up but that it's fine since we weren't serious anyway. I didn't reply to that.

I don't know if he really doesn't care or just acting like it because I fucked everything up. Do you think there is a chance he forgives me since we were not exclusive or anything? I liked him and wanted to get to know him better but I feel like this is a situation from which we cant recover.

49,qanbn4,1634565812,I feel like I’m losing connections because I’m too quiet.,"I recently downloaded hinge. Excited to see what’s out there. At first I wasn’t optimistic about getting matches, it’s not like tinder where I would get over 100 likes in the first couple hours.

 I had some serious reservations about trying to keep up with multiple people at once. But I’ve matched with a good amount of people and I’m doing my best trying to engage and interact. 

My problem is that I’m a fairly shy person and I have social anxiety. People in general are not my strong suit, meeting new people for me is hard, more times than not I’m just misunderstood. 

I can be a little more outgoing than normal over text, even then I’m still not the most interactive. Texting people all the time feels more like a chore. There’s one guy I’ve been texting and he’s the one that reaches out everyday. I’m used to getting absolutely no notifications so me keeping up with a conversation it’s not normal for me. I feel bad because I want to try, I want to meet new people and see where things go. I try my best but my best isn’t always good enough 

The other half of the problem is meeting  people in person, it’s kinda like I shut down, sure I talk but I’m not that open. It takes me a while to open up to people. Besides talking about the basics I get quite and don’t have much else to say. I feel like this might be a turn off for people. I can’t tell you how many times I talk to someone and they lose interest and stop talking and I thinks it’s because how quite I am. 

I hate it and I sometimes wish that they knew that if they would have held on just a little while longer they could have experienced the real me. The real me is outgoing, loved  to laugh and have a good time. What people might see is someone who is shy with a cold demeanor. Unfortunately I’m always trying to protect myself in that way but I’m capable of being myself. People are so quick to judge and  it’s based solely on a couple of conversations. Im currently in therapy but outside of that  I’m not sure what else I can do. Any advice? 

TL;DR: I feel like people lose interest in me because of how quiet I am",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qanbn4/i_feel_like_im_losing_connections_because_im_too/

Not even about a first love. Wtf?","I ""met"" him on Tinder over a year ago, but I never actually met this guy in real life. Every few months he would send me a snap, I wouldn't reply or I'd reply with my view. I never removed him from Snapchat but I removed everyone else I talked to before. I have no idea why I didn't remove him, but I just didn't. He is a very beautiful man, and I wonder if part of me was scared of rejection. 

I broke up with my boyfriend last week because I never felt really anything for him and he has some severe mental illness I'm not willing to deal with.  I actually went and met this guy I blew off, and holy shit. I'm not sure what this feeling was, but he described it before I did, so it wasn't just me. We met and all he said was ""Wow!""

At the bar we went to I couldn't stop staring at him when he was talking, and it felt unreal. I've never once felt this before. I never said any of this outlook, but he did. He also said he felt compelled to keep me on snapchat even though I ignored him and blew him off. 

We did end up making out in his truck, and he stopped me from going any further. I have never done that on a 1st date. He makes me feel comfortable. He said he feels something, and doesn't want to mess it up by being too sexual with me, so he told me he wants to wait.

He has called me every night after work though, he asked me on a 2nd date before we even left the first date and let me know how excited he is to see me again. He did notice how I was looking at him in the bar and he said most people think he looks angry, and he never had anyone look at him like that before.

52,qanh6z,1634566304,Do I hold out or just move on?,"Apologies for the long post, I have let this occupy my mind way too much.

I (24F) recently met someone (22F) through my town's martial arts gym. It took about two months from our first ""hello"" until it dawned on us that something was up. Lots of ribbing, sarcastic flirting, but also feeling like we've known each other for years. I felt close enough to confide in them about having feelings for someone of the same gender as me for the first time in my life but lied about meeting them through work. A couple of weeks later and after a few drinks, they asked me if I wanted to talk more about it. I fessed up that my \*crush\* was on someone at our gym to which they said that they also like another woman at the gym (a surprise to me as both of our dating histories only involved men). Turns out we both had feelings for eachother! Similar to me, I was the first woman they had any feelings for that wasn't a celebrity or fictional character. But...after giving ourselves a day to think on it, they told me they didn't want to pursue anything because they wanted to keep the gym a safe space - they didn't want both the good and bad of dating a training partner ruining that environment. For more context, they were involved in a pretty toxic relationship \~2 years ago and found martial arts as a way to escape it and the gym as a place that felt like they could be themselves. Every part of me knew that this was perfectly reasonable given their past and also knowing that gym relationships can be iffy (but if both parties are mature enough, it shouldn't be that big of an issue, right?). I tried to play to their emotions and asked why they wouldn't want to figure this new thing out with someone they trusted - they pretty much defaulted to wanting to keep the boundary they set for themselves. But beyond that I had nothing else to say because anything would come off as me disrespecting or pressuring them. 

We pretty much tried to go back to normal as soon as possible...back to still seeing eachother 4 times/week at the gym and also spending HOURS on weekends together or with our mutual friend. 

About two weeks after deciding not to do anything, I subconsciously acted a little weird one night and they noticed and called me out on it. I admitted that my feelings for them were still there and they admitted the same. Apparently they had spent a lot of time trying to see how they could make this work but decided that not dating was ""non-negotiable"" for them. Their friends that had seen them through their previous relationship also agreed that this would be a bad idea. Even with that, we ended that convo by agreeing to talk about things if it was on our minds, as long as it will be a productive discussion and not one spent lamenting. This was the last time we've talked about all of this. But we've talked about dating in general with them once mentioning that they don't know how to know when they're ready for a healthy relationship. This reminded me that they are pretty damn young and still have a lot of growing to do, as do I...which lodged the desire to keep hanging onto this in case something changes in the future as our friendship evolves.

I've talked to my close friends about this. I've semi-joked that I think something may just \*happen\* one night, but I'm afraid that will spell disaster for our friendship if we don't handle it well the next day. My more optimistic friends think I should hold onto hope. My more logical friends think they same but also to protect myself and not stop myself from dating other people (as if meeting people is easy for me). My more pessimistic friends noticed that our friendship is essentially us dating without calling it dating, which is not a good situation for me because they were the one to set this boundary. But all of my friends agreed that the other person will have to be the one to initiate anything because any of my attempts to do anything would be disrespectful to them and their wishes...leaving me to just wait around for them. 

Now it's been a month since our first convo (which I know really isn't that much time) and I've noticed my feelings for them comes in waves. Days will go by and I think staying friends will be a good/okay thing and then I fall into a deep hole constantly thinking about them, our time together, and how sweet it would be if we could make something work. I'm not looking through rose tinted glasses thinking about how magical things would be or how good we would be together, I just think this would be a beneficial thing to explore together. 

Shoud I actively try to hold onto this in case something changes? Should I move on and forget it (this actively occupies my mind on the daily and it would be nice if it didn't)? Should I just let these waves of feelings hit me as they come and hope that one day they won't hit me as hard or as frequently?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qanh6z/do_i_hold_out_or_just_move_on/

On our first date, he told me I was the first person he had gone out since he started his Tinder account three weeks prior to our first date. And for a while he made it really seem like I was the only girl he was dating, as he acted super boyfriendy, made an effort to see me as often as he could and would often make comments that hinted that I was the only one he is seeing.

57,qanxc4,1634567749,"Here's why you NEVER cancel dates, even if you think they've lost interest","I've seen several post on here that go something like this:

""Me and so-and-so have a date next week, but I'm not sure if they really want to go on it. I don't want them to feel awkward about going out with me, so I'm thinking I should text them and (a) tell them they don't have to go if they don't want to, or (b) cancel the date.""

And it's so sad because I used to feel the same way back when I wasn't as confident of a dater as I am now.

Be mindful that dating can feel like a high-stakes game at times, where losing feels catastrophic. We can often end up putting so much pressure on ourselves to be perfect, or say the right thing... but we also put pressure on the other person to have to show us a high level of like at ALL times.

That's not to say the person we're taking out shouldn't like us a lot, but the intensity in which they show that like to us will change from day to day. They might be consistently texting us back one day, then be slow to do so the next day. When you're getting to know someone, it can feel in those moments like interest is waning, but you haven't spent enough time with them to know the ebb and flow of their emotions, their work schedule, or other things that may make them not be so enthusiastic about you all the time.

I say this because our feelings about a situation can make us feel like one thing is happening when it's actually not, i.e. that the person we've asked out doesn't really want to do it when they actually do, in spite of how you're viewing it. I've had many times where I asked someone out and thought they were just doing it out of pity, only to find out by the end of the night that they were DEFINITELY in to me.

So, if you've set a date with someone, you have to let it play out. Trying to preemptively cancel a date isn't necessary; if the person you've asked out doesn't want to go out anymore, they are more than capable of finding a way out of seeing you, usually in a respectful way. Yes, it will still probably bruise your ego a bit (that's the ""feelings"" part we're all trying to avoid), but you get used to it over time. Point is, it's better for it to happen that way than to cancel a date with someone who may have actually wanted to go out with you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qanxc4/heres_why_you_never_cancel_dates_even_if_you/
58,qao3ji,1634568281,Nobody ever seems interested in me (F21) and when they are I lose interest in them,"There’s very little to say besides what the title already states. It seems I can’t get people (mostly girls, guys overall seem easier to approach) interested in me, even those who approach me first (like messaging me and stuff like that) always end up being not that interested. When finally someone shows interest in me, I lose it immediately and have to have this super long talk about how I don’t feel like dating at the moment (not true at all, but I can’t tell them I don’t like them).

I mean at the moment dating seems legitimately impossible for me, I’m starting to lose all hope… my self esteem is at a new low and I just genuinely feel horrible about myself. I completely changed my appearance just to be more conventionally attractive and now it feels like I am hopelessly ugly. Man this sucks, it makes me not want to even try because every time it’s a blow to my self esteem.

59,qaob7t,1634568942,Why didn’t he tell his friends we had broken up awhile ago?,"Quick backstory:
I (25F) was dating this guy (23M) and after a couple months of dating we mutually broke up because he was moving for school. We both agreed long distance was going to be difficult and it would be better breaking up. I tried setting boundaries with him after but he kept crossing them. He introduced me to his friend group (all friends from high school) and coworkers. They were all considering me his girlfriend which I found odd but kind of ignored it. 


His last week home we spent every day together and he had me keep our blanket from our first date. After his moved we spoke basically every day and his friends invited me out quite often. 

Recently he told me that he spoke to his mother who I never met and she wanted to offer me a job at her location. I found it interesting she even knew I existed cause I thought he never spoke about me. 

After that he went a bit MIA for a couple days and called me to motivate me to take this job opportunity. Then told me he was actually on tinder now and he didn’t want me to feel weird working with his mom or being with his friends since they all liked me. I was hurt by this because well I had hope he’d want to work this out even though I knew it was going to be difficult. 

Flash forward to this weekend!
I had lunch with one of his friends who I am close with. I was open and honest about how I was feeling since I didn’t want to make things weird. But found out she had no idea we were broken up. Apparently none of them were aware and thought we were doing long distance. She was in shock and so was I since I found it weird. Why wouldn’t he tell his friends we weren’t together?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qaob7t/why_didnt_he_tell_his_friends_we_had_broken_up/

However, it seems like most apps nowadays force you to go Premium for even the most basic features. If you’re not willing to spend money on the apps it feels like you shouldn’t be on them at all.

Things are pretty new and although I think I know her really well, I know there’s still more to find out. 

I think I’m falling in love with her, but I can’t figure out exactly how I feel. It feels too soon to fall in love. I’m able to differentiate it from when it was just a crush because I feel more secure and less obsessed, but that could just be because I’m confident my feelings are reciprocated now to some extent. When I’m with her and I’m holding her, I feel so much affection for her and she makes me really happy. To an extent, I consider her when planning my own future, but honestly I do that while fantasizing about crushes anyway. My crushes tend to be intense, so it’s hard for me to tell for sure.

I’ve only been in one other relationship and it was long-term, and this is making me doubt whether I was really in love. I had doubts about the first relationship and while I loved her, I’m not sure if I was really in love with her. Also, she was my best friend prior to dating, so I was very comfortable with her and cared for her a lot. Meanwhile, with this relationship, I haven’t had serious doubts yet even though we’ve had conflict a few times.

I’m not sure exactly how to tell if I’m in love. I wouldn’t tell her now anyway because this is a new relationship. I know for sure that there was an exact moment where I looked at her and thought that I was going to love this girl one day, and things have only gotten stronger from there.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qaohmh/how_can_you_tell_when_youre_falling_in_love_vs/

We've talked on and off and when I came to work in her city about a month ago, I added her on snapchat. We eventually had sex 2 weekends ago. I didn't expect much but tried to keep it going. She told me that she was had just seen her ex over the weekend and was thinking of getting back with her so she offered a platonic friendship. I was skeptical but I said yes. And she actually made plans to hang out with me. She even invited me to go out with her brother and friends last Friday. 
The night before, I went over to hers to read while she was working on a school paper. She didn't do much work and talked to me the whole time even though I was okay with giving her space to work. We ended up being honest and laughing at the fact that we both decided to have sex because we thought that's the only thing the other person wanted to begin with. We also talked about making Christmas cards and costumes. She's really good at sowing and crocheting. I didn't think too much of it.
Then the next day, she asks me to stay the night and says that it took her everything not to snuggle up with me. She said that she thought it was adorable that I wanted to make Christmas cards and that I had invited her to get coffee and go to a used book store after the first ""hook up"". 
We go out and have a fun time. I was in her snap story and she was laughing and all. But then I blacked out, we got separated. I ended up texting her later not knowing what was going on asking where she was. She said that she was home and falling asleep but that she could give me the code to get in.
The next day, she didn't seem angry or anything but not super warm either. To be fair, she had to leave early and it was her first time ever blacking out. She admitted that she was feeling out of it. I asked her if she wanted to go shopping, and she said yeah but not the next day (Sunday) since she was busy. 
She's been really honest with me so far, and we haven't known each other for too long. I don't want to exaggerate but is it appropriate to ask her if there's anything going on? I don't want to be clingy either. I hope I didn't do something stupid while intoxicated. She's not thaaat cold. Just takes longer to answer so she could genuinely be busy.

Most guys my age ask for coffee dates.

Long greasy Covid hair, flip flops that show off their long yellow toenails, hoodies so old you can’t make out the logo anymore, dirty track pants or jeans that keep falling down exposing his boxers. One guy even came straight from the gym and smelled terrible. 

I figured that since coffee is so casual and low-effort I could just do the same. I would shower but show up with my hair in a lazy bun, glasses, zero makeup (no I don’t have perfect skin), faded grown out manicures, loosely fitted t-shirt, jeans and sneakers. Did this 3 times and every single guy has been disappointed and complained, even though I was at least clean and my clothes fit much better than theirs.

There’s one problem… I am not physically attracted to him, at all. My mindset was that I wasn’t going to be shallow and I wanted to give him a chance based off of his personality. But I cannot shake the fact that I am simply not attracted to him. He mentions sex and what not. I kind of cringe every time. 

Back in February, I made a big life change. Without giving too much information, I changed my life for the better and conquered my addiction problem that I had for two years. (Now 8 months sober!) So there was a good chance that I jumped into this too fast. I haven’t loved myself in quite some time. I haven’t given myself a chance to do so.

I am not asking for analytical dating type advice, just to get the actual translation right:

When someone says "" WE are a good catch (male Name)""

Does this mean we are a good catch ""individually"", for someone else one day

OR

Does this mean we are good catch ""together"", meaning we match well together.

I know the definition of ""being a good catch for someone"" but never heard the expression ""we are a good catch"".

I just laughed it away and kept talking about different stuff, just to make sure. I am stupid about this stuff. I just want to be sure so future calls and messaging dont get unnecessarily awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qarcjm/what_does_it_mean_if_a_girl_says_i_think_we_are_a/
92,qargcn,1634578025,Why am I getting a lot of female attention suddenly?,"I am a 34 y/o single white man. I have all of a sudden gotten a lot more attention than usual from the ladies.  I just recently was dumped by a girlfriend who I was in a long term relationship with. I have consciously decided that I am not going to jump back into the dating pool for a while. I am not currently online dating either. Nevertheless, women of all ages have been showing me a lot of interest. More interest than I have ever gotten in my life. I can't think of anything else in my life that has changed dramatically. I feel like I look the same, have the same job, dress the same, am in the same physical shape as I was, etc.

95,qarw58,1634579297,Deleted my dating profile last night.,"After dinner with a man I have been seeing for over a month, we decided together to delete our dating app. I have never laughed so hard and often before. Or felt the feeling of a person truly wanting to understand me and fully appreciate me. 

Guys, it’s been a long time since I’ve felt remotely close to the way I feel now, and it all happened so suddenly. I’m just overly excited and calm at the same time. Excited for what can come from this, and calm bc I truly believe I have found my person. 

I know we have a ways to go but he’s so far everything I have been waiting for and more. I have settled in the past and now I’m glad I finally allowed space for someone who seems to be meant for me. I just had to share. Never settle or feel pressure to be with someone when your person may be out there! ❤️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qarw58/deleted_my_dating_profile_last_night/
