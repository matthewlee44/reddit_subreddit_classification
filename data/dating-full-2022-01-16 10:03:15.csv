So last night we were planning on meeting up after work. I called him and text him and he wasn’t responding. He finally responded and said his car had been broken into and was dealing with it. Didn’t hit me up or tell me what was going on at all. I was waiting around hoping to hear from him. 
I text him today saying hey hope you’re ok but i feel hurt that you blew me off. 
He told me he was really upset and I said i understand let me know if you need anything. He didn’t respond.

People talking about sex while I am distracted also spirals me back into it. People in happy relationships are also upsetting me and talking about their great sex lives. Please shut the fuck up, etc. Sex is everywhere and its importance and relationships is constantly being drilled into us, and for whatever reason this sort of thing is causing me major distress at the moment.

I am making an effort to get out more and improve my anxiety and looks and confidence but I don't think that I am very attractive, though I do put some effort into making myself presentable. I also recently got friendzoned for the first time by someone that I really like and that has upset me a lot and made things worse.

I am suffering physical issues now aswell.

I have not recieved any helpful advice on this issue and am not sure what to turn toward. Ideally the best solution is that I find a sexual partner, but I don't know where to look or how to do that, and honestly perhaps some help mentally dealing with the issue is the best thing to do.

Long story short, she thought about it for days, and told me she had also considered it but has one worry: “We have diferent views about life, politics, etc (she is more conservative)… She knew this so casually dating someone this diferent felt “safe” to her, but that she has come to like me a lot, too”. 

She’s suggesting that for the remaining 2 weeks before she leaves we see each other with more frequency: from 1 time a week to 2-3 times a week, so we can see if we could fit for something more serious in the future. While at first thought this seems reasonable, I think it goes against most that I have learnt in seduction: Not giving her space to miss me and coming off as “too boyfriendy” could stress her.

It felt very boyfriend/girlfriend like to me, so I decided to leave and didn't sleep over, also because we have seen each other one time weekly and if I stay at someones overnight, I need to see the person 2 times a week before staying overnight. Also this feeling happened to fast (around 5 dates I think).

Everything seemed fine afterwards, but I made a suggestion to meet up and the answers were kinda dogy, no suggestion came back like she did before. She also said someones name 3 times in a row that she is busy with him bouldering on sunday, but I could join in. Before this she didn't use this name or any other names really and it felt weird, because it felt like she wanted to provoke a reaction. She is generally a busy person, but when I left she said she'd be more free the coming week, but I thought we should talk about it when there is no alc involved anymore.

The coming week I asked again and this week she had no time again, because she would be in an other city this weekend. I told her it seems she isn't interested anymore. Usually I write ""ok just say if you have time"" and then I don't text anymore, but because of the ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" like feeling the date before I felt like it was more a talkout thing already. She said it seems like it, but she didn't deny it as well (didn't say it is true). I wrote something afterwards so she could make it clear and nothing came back - I was pretty pissed at this point. 2 days later she wrote like there was nothing. I thought ok, maybe she smoked weed or so and is a bit lost, but I didn't reply for 3 more days until sunday. I messaged her back and said that chatting is boring and she can write if she really wants to do something.

She said the plans were cancelled this week because the other person was ill and she wanted to ask me if I had time, but I didn't reply. I am not stupid and this felt like she would write something around my reply. Maybe she already expected this and said she wanted to do something. But this would be really fucked up imo.

So I decided to do one last attempt as I write this here. I messaged her on wednesday night because she said something about her getting a new vaccination. She replied on friday not answering my question exactly how it went, just that she got it the day before. She asked what my plans are on the weekend. I told her I am in an other city drinking - the same she was supposed to go last week. She said she would join drinking, if she would be there on friday as me and not on saturday - again like she knows how to deals with such replys.

We exchanged some more messages since then and sometimes she sends a pic relating to our dates, e.g. when she found something in the supermarket I told her about.

Maybe a side info: She is into bdsm and had already a sub or more. We talked about this on the 2/3 date. She made some signs and I knew she is intro bdsm. But it felt like she wanted to get me go into this direction. So I said we should talk about some stuff and she said for me she would be my sub and would teach me some things because I am new to this stuff. But the whole thing was ""unexpected"" for her, which I don't believe.

This to me seems really really fishy, like she tries to hold me warm or something else. But it also seems way to fishy to be fishy somehow. Or she tries some bdsm stuff on me and tries to get control over me, so I would be her sub lol. Or maybe she wants me to go into control and thats the learning she means. But that would be really fucked up to play with someones emotions before like this.

I don't know what to think of this. My take is that I want to meet up with her and talk about this. I want to make my standpoint clear and we can part ways in a consensual manner. But I need that meetup to get closure. I hate it if something like this happens over text, also because she goes in the same nightclub as me in our city and we would definitely see each other again and I don't want to get a bad vibe if I see her there.

Honestly the connection I feel with her doesn’t compare to anyone else i’ve dated/gone on dates with since.

Context: We broke up because shes finishing her last year of college at a university out of town. While away she wanted to explore herself as she was bi-curious and we opted for an open relationship. I didn’t mind as I love her and I wouldnt want to hold her back from finding out about her true sexuality. Our boundaries were to not emotionally cheat on each other and no penetrative sex with men. Out of nowhere she broke up with me, our last FaceTime before that was great, rainbows and sunshine nothing weird at all to me at least. She broke up with me through text and went no contact.

She came down for the holidays, and we spent 2 weeks together. It was the happiest and saddest I felt since we were together. I found out that she did little to nothing to explore her “bi-curiosity” besides go on a few coffee shop dates with girls. She made out twice with her guy friend while drunk whom she admits that after she broke up with me she realized she was emotionally attracted to then tried to hookup with him but that lead nowhere, she did assure me though that it was just a crush. Then she hooked up with another guy 2 weeks after we broke up. This information hurt me, I feel like I was emotionally cheated on. The whole sex thing is meh as weren’t together anymore, it just bums me out that I spent the whole time grieving our relationship while she was out not even thinking about what we had and hooked up with someone.

But after she left to go back up to finish her degree, she’s been talking to me again and wants to date again but in an open relationship, but she promises to exclusively only see women and not men.

I guess I just feel really insecure as she goes out partying every weekend and the guy friend that she had feelings for will be there and alcohol and drugs will likely be involved. While we did LDR I didn’t have a problem with who she surrounded herself with or what she did for fun, but when I brought up not being comfortable with her hanging out with emotional feelings guy friend she said i’ll just have to trust her. Its unfair of me to ask her to not be friends with people but this just fucks me up. I told her wait till the end of February as I don’t trust her to keep her promise.

I don't believe anymore I can fully recover from it and live the life I wanted. How do I cope with it? 

I was always imagining my future love life to be plain easy: I meet a woman I match with, we love eachother, move together, have kids and live happily ever after.

But that didn't happen. I was a kissless virgin until I was 26. I felt I missed a good part of life, had an impressive amount of awful experiences trying to date women, did a depression, started therapy.

I finally met my first girlfriend, it didn't work for long. I had a couple of short stories. I was still most of the time single but I won some confidence, felt a few times loved and desired and that was enough. I had 2 long relationships which weren't that long and good in the end (I have been cheated on after 8 months of being a couple, the other one developed a huge crush on my best friend after a year of relationship)

2 years passed since the last relationship and I am again single, without much things happening. I mean I found quite some women I felt compatible with but they weren't interested in me. 

The thing is that the people around me are all enjoying their love and/or sex life, having kids, a house... 
Even when my single friends tell me about their single lives, it is almost like reading some utopian fiction to me: they meet frequently people they match with, have FWB or hook-ups... it is looking like it is easy. But all these things are not even happening once a year for me.

I started a depression soon after being rejected another time last year. I took months to get over it with my therapist. Now I feel much better, I focus more on myself and the other things I want from life beside dating/girlfriend...

But I can't manage to fully turn the page of my dream of a fulfilling sentimental/sexual life. I am still kind of obsessed with the fact that I am alone, that I missed and am still missing a huge part of life. Every book/movie/talk with a friend is reminding me indirectly that I am single and that it isn't my choice. So many nights I just wished I had someone in my arms.

At the same time, I feel more and more damaged. My mental health, confidence in myself, in life and in future relationships are not at their best. Right now, I am not even sure I still would like to have kids, because I am not sure I would stay mentally strong enough and I am not sure someone could stay with me for more than a few years.

I more and more want to isolate myself from these aspects of life I could only hear about but not experience. I don't want to be perpetually happy for the others and sad for me when something good happens:
Beginning of a new relationship, wedding, kids..

So we talked at first over Instagram and Snapchat and we really got along so we set up a date and met last Friday. We had so much fun and we also share the same interests and music passion. We had a lot to talk about and we grabbed a coffee walked around in clothing stores and later on grabbed a beer. Of course I paid. 
Then we sat down to watch some live music and had a good time. I followed her to the bus and we actually held hands. 10 seconds before the bus came we had eye contact and kissed each other.

Later that evening I thanked her for the super good date and it was fun meeting her.
She replied that she felt the same and later asked me what I was up to the next coming weekend. She wanted to visit some music related stores and buy me coffee haha. 

She’s beautiful and she have had relationships before but she said that the guys she had met were very toxic and I have been the “best guy” she have dated so far even tho we only have seen each other 1 time. 

I also met her friends and she said that they liked me a lot and the same evening they started to follow me on Instagram.
One of her guy friends mentioned to me that she have talked a lot about me and said only positive things about me like “he’s really good looking and generous”

I know that there are a guy who likes her a lot but she said to me that she don’t like him at all neither her friends.

So as you see things have went great with this girl so far.
I just don’t want to lose her or make her push me away.
So what should I do and not do from here? 

How often should I text her? 
She replies pretty slowly and I guess that means she don’t want to appear being needy etc. Sometimes she replies quickly sometimes it’s a couple hours between and I do the same.

We eventually agreed to meet eachother, I told her she could come to my place and she agreed. Problem was I had to go to work (I work 4 weeks rotation offshore), so it had to wait until i got home.

We continued to have contact through snapchat all the time I was gone for 4 weeks, she seemed really interested and I was too. 

When I came home, we met up for a walk. Date went really good. Good chemistry and all. Next day she came to my house and we chilled and made some dinner etc. We kissed and was intimate/made love

So basically from here we where together almost every other day for 2 weeks. I was at her place alot and she was at mine. Kissing and being intimate/made love every time .

Im leaving for 4 weeks soon and the last week I have gotten alot less snaps and feedback from her and I seem more interested in than she does (maybe I overthink) I dont know if she is too busy or not (she recently started working alot)

So I asked her if she wanted to meet up when I come home again. She said yes to that. 

I have started to get feeling for this girl and now I'm terrifed of losing her. I am constantly thinking about her. I fear that me being away for 4 weeks will make her lose all interest. 

She strikes me as a honest girl. And I get the feeling she dont want to rush anything and take it slow.

I (21M) had been talking to my neighbor (23F) via text (we were spending the holidays in different states) for about a month. I like her and wanted to ask her out when we got back to where we both live, which would happen yesterday. She had a boyfriend until some point in 2020. I asked a mutual friend if they were still together and he said they had broken up, but he was unsure if they got back together at some point.

I figured I’d just start flirting with her, without trying to hide that I was interested, and see how she reacted. She’d just tell me if she was still in a relationship, or just not show any interest. She seemed pretty interested in me, though. I threw quite a lot of hints (“can’t wait to see you next week”, tons of emojis, emotionally charged language, etc). She responded in the same way.

Last week I asked if she wanted to go out when I got back in town (yesterday). She said yes. It was pretty unequivocally a date: I built a cute conversation around the invitation, showed affection, blablabla.

She started answering less and less often, though. Said it was because of a tough work week. Saturday came and I texted her to try to figure out the details and she just wouldn’t read my messages. I figured she gave up for some reason.

I went to the mall to buy some stuff and the first thing I see when I walk out my Uber is her walking along with her ex.

I’m not sure I can blame her for the awkward situation. I assumed it was possible that they were still together when it all started. I knew the risk. I kinda wish she had just brushed me off instead of letting me find out the hard way, though.

I feel fooled, tbh.

One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother (???)

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him.

I just moved and wanted a fresh start so I turned to online dating (partly out of boredom, partly because I feel super lonely). 

I matched this guy and we went on the first date after a week of texting and it was the best date I’ve ever been on. We grabbed a coffee to go and just walked around my city. We ended up spending 9 hours together, talking about all kinds of things, getting along great, the whole nine yards. We also kissed and just overall had a great time. We took the very last train home (each individually) at like 2am. That was on a Thursday. 

I had to take a work trip for a week on the Sunday after, so I asked him if he wanted to come over spontaneously on Saturday and he agreed and we again had a great date. I had the feeling that we were generally compatible, it just felt really relaxed and comfortable and nice to spend time with him. 

Then I had the work trip and we still kept texting - a bit sporadically but I thought we were both busy and I am not a big texter either so I didn’t really think anything of it. At some point I asked if we should see each other on the weekend when I’m back and he replied asking me what exactly my expectations were. I told him that I was interested in getting to know him better etc. and he didn’t really answer my question about the next date until I nudged him but then said that Saturday would work for him. 

So he came over again on Saturday and it - again - went really well. At some point I said that when I asked him for another date and he said “What exactly are your expectations?” it made me feel a little … unsure? and I asked what HIS expectations were but he kind of dodged the question by making a joke about it. That was the only tiny moment something felt “off” though (at least in hindsight). When he left I told him to text me when he’s home and he did. 

Eventually I started overthinking that moment a little bit so I ended up asking what exactly he’s looking for to make sure we’re on the same page and he said “he’s more of a relationship guy but I don’t really know” and I again said that I’d like to get to know him more to see where it goes and I asked if he’s interested in getting to know me more as well. To this he said “Yes I am. I think you’re great but I have a feeling that you deserve better” which came out of the blue and made no sense to me? So I said that that’s for me to decide, not him and if he’s interested we should just continue to spend time with each other. To that he said “Trust me, I bring along a lot of issues…” and he never replied to any of the messages I sent after (I texted him twice over two days) - it’s been almost a week now.

Again, this came out of the blue and I was really confused. Now, I have no idea what kinds of issues he’s talking about but I made clear that that doesn’t necessarily scare me off. I’m really trying not to take this personally and believe that he was honestly not ready for some reason - but I just keep wondering if I could have done something differently or if he is just using this as a cheap excuse because he wasn’t that into me? 

I never would have assumed he would be the type of guy to just ghost but here we are. I just wish he would have given me an actual explanation because I just feel thrown for a loop. He seemed to genuinely enjoy our dates as well and he said so over text as well.

Was just thinking about my relationship and wanted to say thx for the advice I received on a deleted post around 6 months ago.

I (22M) posted here last summer about an issue with a younger girl (20F) from my club I was having which was about her body count.

I grew up in a more socially conservative environment so the idea of a girl just sleeping with like 10 guys already by 20 was sort of off putting and my friends also drilled that idea that I should avoid her also or just hook up with her for some quick sex.

So I decided to come to this sub for advice just to hear some opinions from an outside perspective.

I received some advice that her body count doesn’t matter since she’s with me at the end of the day and that I don’t know her backstory so I shouldn’t judge. So with these perspectives from my friends and this sub I decided to just trust my gut since I really liked her and ask her out.

Now 6 months later I’m in the best relationship I’ve ever been in. Just thinking back if I listened to my friends how I could have missed out on this relationship is crazy.

For some reason with her higher body count I thought she wouldn’t want a serious relationship. But now after being with her it just makes me mad hearing her talk about all these guy “friends” who used her by pretending to be into her and dumping her when they found someone else.

She’s so smart, caring, beautiful and just everything I wanted in a partner to be in general. To see her improve every session that I attend with her therapist for her anxiety is such an amazing feeling. Just seeing her succeed in general in school and everything it makes to happy that we’re a part of each others lives.

So thats all I just wanted to drop by and talk about.

So been on dates with this girl, as you know from my previous post about not having an attraction for people until months pass.

But anyway first two dates was like any other girl to be honest, nice chat but that's about it. For the third date she kinda invited herself over on the guise of needing something I went along with it. 

Anyway went out on a spur of the moment dinner,the date went well and we were really having a wonderful time. 

At the end of the date opened up and gave her a hug and kiss (to let her know I would like to get to know her more and develop the relationship - it does take me a bit longer for attraction as from my previous post but besides the point)

Anyway on the fourth date she invites me over to family dinner (I thought it was a bit fast but anyway) we have a lovely time and we've been over each other's house a few times, with respective families.

At this point we've even had the ""deep and meaningful"" conversation basically about where we want to take the relationship and we're on the same page (the standard serious relationship with marriage and children) and including some questions about past relationships e.g. why you broke up with ex how many people have you dates before - might have been red flag for them to ask?

Anyway I don't think any of my answers were red flags to her, I literally only have had two exs in all my years and the reason was moving to another city, or one or another losing the more than friends spark. No fights or messy breakups. No sleeping around or anything. 

Over the last few days I'd get one or two sentences responses for the whole day. I guess it correlated to when she started work again - I know it's a stressful time for people not being able to WFH - so I let it go. 

Without giving too much away she's getting a vaccine on Friday which will cause her to be unwell for a few days so I packed up stuff that I thought would be useful for her to get better and was trying to organise a time to meet to give it to her.

Unfortunately this sometimes happens mid conversation she'll just stop reading it doesn't get red until the day later literally one message read and the next message not. And then just goes off grid and uncontactable.

He commented something about me looking pretty in my story and asked what I was doing. I then remembered he was someone I matched with on a dating app when I first moved to my city 2 years ago.  It should be noted that this is a really big city and I didn’t know anyone before moving here so I used to be more lax about giving my Snapchat out so I could meet and talk to people. Now I never do.

The conversation was really casual, but then he kept asking me what part of the city I lived in. I gave very generic answers, such as popular restaurants in the area of the city that are well known, as well as other very touristy buildings and parks that could be a large range of area if that makes sense. I am very careful about not telling people where I live for safety reasons. He kept pushing for more information but I switch the topic to our favorite restaurants in the city to avoid giving away where I live. 

A few hours later he messages me that he’s walking in one of the parks I mentioned earlier on his way to grab food from a sushi place I mentioned that was my favorite. He asked if I could join which I politely declined, but provided him with some recommendations. He kept pushing, which I found off putting, and he started talking about getting drinks or bringing a bottle of wine over and chatting. After my fifth time declining I was over being polite and said I wasn’t interested in having someone I do not know over to my apartment and the answer was no so stop asking. 

He then goes, “I get it, you know what would happen if I came over and you’re trying to pretend that you’re a good girl 😉” 

I’m sorry sir, WHAT?🤢 I immediately felt the ick. It’s that moment when you are completely turned off after a comment or action and there is no coming back from it.

Anyway, she tone immediately changed from ""You don't have to do this"" to ""I need this. Why are you being so difficult?""

She then asked for a picture of my ID so she can apply for ""family maintenance""

This was when I ""broke up"" with her. I explained that this whole situation reeked of a scam and I wanted no part in it and blocked her number. 

Out of morbid curiosity, I checked my phone's spam folder a few weeks later and found several messages from her calling me ""cruel, selfish, naive, broke and a lier"" among other things. There was a wall of text about how she loved me and wanted to spend her life with me, needed the money to do so and accused me of leading her on.

I feel bad if I genuinely hurt her but I have no intention of contacting her again. She said she was going to spread my number and picture around so that ""no one ever falls victim to you again"".

As said above, I have had some experience with long term relationships. However, neither previously hit me like this. This is also because I'm at a stage in life where I consider to have no friends (I wanted to reach out somewhere just now, realised I genuinely don't have anyone) - so coping is obviously harder.

I'm now sitting in a different apartment, waiting for them to be done loading and moving. Haven't eaten a bite all day, nor do I feel like it. I guess my question is pretty simple:

How do you deal with the first night? Not too ashamed to admit I cried pretty much the whole day, so crying more isn't a feasible option at this stage (not sufficient liquids left I reckon).

Hey all I’ve just been on a date with a guy who I’ve been talking to daily through text for a few weeks. I’m not used to dates but am quite sociable and I’m unsure of some of his behaviour. Perhaps you experts could enlighten me. Independently they seem like nothing but altogether I get a weird vibe that he doesn’t like girls who make an effort when going out.

Before the date he was telling me how his friends are unfaithful to their partners, but he’s been single not with anyone for 5 years and has never been like that. To the date he came in tracksuit bottoms and a baggy hoodie and tatty sneakers. I don’t care about this, it’s more important that he’s comfortable and he is good looking with tidy hair and neatly shaved.

I’m not overly girly but I do dress decently for dates, and wear a bit of make-up and perfume. I very occasionally curl my hair which takes a long time, I told him I was going to curl it since it was a special occasion and jokingly said to be aware that it may not look this nice all of the time.

When he picked me up he said I looked nice, but immediately offered me a beanie - like before even looking at my hair. He said “I’ve bought you this to borrow for the journey because it’s cold.” I said thanks but I’d just done my hair but I’d wear it on the way back.

He then asked if I was wearing perfume. When I said yes he commented that I “didn’t need to wear perfume.”

During the date he mentioned how some girls wear loads of make-up and he likes that I “don’t wear any”. I was a bit confused as while I don’t wear much and he may have thought the foundation was just my skin, it was obvious I was wearing eyeliner and lipstick. I corrected him and he said he just assumed I wasn’t girly enough to.

We paid 50/50 for drinks which I like. We got on well but he would mention things like he liked that I drank beer, and also he briefly mentioned he doesn’t understand why girls wear push-up bras and that he isn’t keen on it because they’re out to get attention. When he dropped me off he gave me some gifts that made me a bit uncomfortable. A brand new £50 soup-maker (we’d been talking about soup briefly prior to the date) He also gave me a bag of dvds of movies we had mentioned. I really didn’t want to take them but he seemed really hurt when I said that.

The last thing, when we got home I sent him a meme about the joker, and he replied that “I can imagine that’s what you’d look like if you ever wore make-up” I was like ???? I literally told him I wore make up when he said that I didn’t the first time lol.

I get the impression he hasn’t got much experience with women? Or worst case he doesn’t like women who make an effort?

What do you think? He’s really nice and funny but I’m not sure if there’s red flags here. I spend a lot of time with other people and his behaviour stood out a lot as seeming abnormal.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152878,public,self,"Had a date with a guy who doesn’t seem to like women who make an effort, but I may be overthinking it.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5gz1g/had_a_date_with_a_guy_who_doesnt_seem_to_like/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,

And they’re often accompanied by wives/kids.

I have dated men that I wasn’t attracted to at all - essentially because I thought I should and they were the only ones who asked. It ended badly for all involved. I thought I could be one of those “slow burn” types - but it’s never happened to me. I’m either attracted soon after meeting someone or not at all.

I used to think I failed to get the attention of men I liked because they were out of my league and I wasn’t pretty enough. But now that most men I know are married, and have been mistaken for some of these men’s wives in casual social settings, I’ve realized many men I think are men physically attractive actually are in my league. I was just so terrified of available men I liked (back when that was an option) that I would go out of my way to avoid any sort of non-school or work related conversation.

Unfortunately, I just don’t meet anyone who’s single that I like anymore. I also find it hard to be attracted to photos and a vague description of someone.

I already have a rough time trying to date. I am an immunocompromised cancer patient whose cancer is incurable. I may live a full life but unless a cure is found I will be dealing with on and off treatments for the rest of it and somewhat chained to the research center I am a patient at. I am usually upfront about this on dating profiles/sites or when asking people out. Because of both my situation and Covid I have been using online dating apps/sites (Primarily Bumble, Okcupid, Match, CMB, and Tinder) the last few years... and I have noticed something.

The expectations of what I call ""communication pursuit"". That is to say in my case, the expectation by women for me to drive the conversation 24/7 and pursue them even beyond simply messaging first (I am sure for some it works the other way). Every time I match I seem to run into the same problem. I have to push and prod them to talk to me. I have to ask repeated questions for them to answer 1. I have to write paragraphs to get 1 sentence answers. Inevitably it fizzles out and a large part of it is because I am simply EXHAUSTED at trying to get them to talk to me and so I just stop when they don't respond to a question and don't keep pushing and then one of us inevitably unmatches later.

You matched/swiped right, why won't you participate in a back and forth with me? (*I wonder*). If you liked my profile enough to match with me, why can't I get more than a few back and forths into a conversation where I have to give so much more effort/information to get responses before it dies when they stop responding. I would rather they not swipe and match with me and give me false hope if they are not willing to put in the effort to converse. Why won't you just unmatch if you don't want to respond?

I understand I am not the best at making conversation. I am shy. I am introverted. I am not the most experienced in the dating world. I know I have baggage. But I am also actively trying, am loyal and supportive, and certainly willing to learn and change to make a significant other happy. But I simply don't have the energy to literally drive communication forward non-stop in the ""pursuit"" of a woman. If you really do like someone enough to match with them, then there should be an expectation of effort put into on both sides in a back and forth conversation. One side should not be needing to pull their hair out to get responses.

In online dating, all we have is our words once matched (at least until a physical date is agreed upon). There has got to be a willingness on both sides to share those words and actually put in the effort to explore each other in that way. If you matched you should be curious enough, interested enough, and excited enough about the person you matched with to actively converse.

I am mentally done. Thanks for reading.
