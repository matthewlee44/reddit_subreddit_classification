We ended things after 2 months and then a month after that, I starting dating someone else. That guy told me he wanted to date me and didnt wanna keep just hooking up so we started dating. We dated for a year and decided to breakup (our relationship was getting unhealthy). It’s been almost a month since we broke up and I just recently went on a date w some guy. It went super well and I filled him in on my situation. He said he’d b interested in dating me but gets that I need time. Our first date was the best first date I’ve ever had and we were really vibing. I don’t wanna lose this guy but know I’m not ready to date. 

So my question... how long do you think I should wait before trying to start a relationship with someone new? How long does it usually take to properly heal from a breakup? Has anyone else ever experienced this? The worst part is that things were rocky with my recent ex so I wasn’t even that upset after the breakup.

I had boyfriends, long term relationships, guys trying to harass me, anyways I've seen enough. I still have hope and I'm still dating. What I don't understand is why are guys being such morons to girls who are genuinely nice and treat them good? Like what's up with that? I met couple of guys in a past 6 months. With one of them I had such a great connection and vice versa. We texted, went out on couple of dates, he was acting like he wants something serious. And idiot me believed him just so that he can start ghosting me and texting again, saying that he's very busy but posting on snapchat how he hangs out with people and when we met he would hug the shit out of me, kiss me like I'm the last women on the Earth and all those mixed signals were leaving me so confused and angry so I decided to end it because I was feeling stupid. To the next guy I gave second chance because he was persistent in seeing me again and promising that this time he will treat me better. We went for coffee and to catch up and he was all hype about how happy he was to see me just so he can text me day after to guess what? Ghost me again. Now at this point it's just funny for me but we have a third guy in the game. This one actually replies and but he is more into texting and is not very keen in making time for us to hang out. Couple of months we were texting before meeting each other and we live literally 10 mins apart. Not to say I asked him out few times before we actually went out. Well no matter the situation i still like him but if only someone would see how much effort I always put towards anyone I like, and they don't even have the bare minimum for me. And to mention, the last guy actually got angry when he saw that my tinder profile was still active but we never got to the point of knowing each other or even discussing us being in a relationship. After reading all the comments and subs about dating in Covid times, my dear redditors I seriously give up. I deleted tinder, will not put any more effort into anyone who doesn't gives me back the same because this shit people do, is just so lame and reflection of how insecure about them selves they really are.

Life was very busy and we didn’t connect right away.  Finally met up after following each other and messaging for a bit through social media.

Text and talk regularly, get along great and enjoy each other’s company.

My feelings about what I might want from him, at least currently, have changed.  He has been divorced for less than a year or two, and I think he needs to take more time to heal, and even date around if he wants.  The deciding factor for my change of heart was the amount that he talks about his ex, and how friendly they still are.  It’s great they are amicable, but he even mentioned that he would buy her a house if she wasn’t able to herself (he is not even close to being wealthy or in that position).

Just tonight I was thinking about whether I’m being to harsh, when I get another text about “My ex and I.....”.   

Because I really like him, I’m happy to be his friend but that’s all at this point.  I no longer want to purse anything romantically, on any level.  Waiting for the right opportunity I guess, before I tell him, but afraid of how it will be received.  Also pretty bummed out about it.

There's a 4 hour difference between us with me being ahead. I was in class studying it was about 9 and she messaged me asking to video call. I told her that I'm in class and couldn't talk to which she said that she's been up since 7am it was 5am the next day doing an assignment.

I responded saying ""awww your poor thing Hahaha"". She got upset by my message saying that her struggles shouldn't be funny to me. I was confused because she's never really got upset at me before. I apolgised and she said that was fine.

The next day though I went out drinking and got pretty drunk and decided to message her. Telling her that I'm sorry, that I like her and that I can't wait to meet her. She just read my message and that was it.

It's been 3 days and I understand that she could be really busy but I think I've ruined it. I'm honestly upset at myself mainly because I feel like I've ruined everything. 

We've been talking for so long and to think it's finished by me doing this sucks. A few friends say that I'm overacting to this but I don't know.

Comminucation has been the pain point. Texts are far and few between with me always being the one to initiate. She and I have busy jobs so that's understandable when we don't text/communicate during the work day, but in the evening, there's maybe 1-2 exchanges and thats it. I get not all people like to text, myself included. But throw me a bone here... either I initiate a text that dies after a few exchanges or its radio silence (today for example).

 I'm out of town for work right now. I spoke with her on the phone yesterday and invited her out for a third date next Friday when I'm back. She sounded unsure but said yes... not solid though so I simply told her to get back to me. 

I havne't heard from her today, probably because I havne't texted her. What sucks is I know she had the day off, and she knew that I did as well. So I was hoping for at least a ""hows your day?"" text at least. 

Anyways I'm not going to text her until she gets back to me. This isn't to play any games. I just need to see her put in some effort here. If she gets back to me about the date, then I'll know she's still intersted. If I don't hear back, I'll know the answer.

This is geared mostly towards women that embody the traditional feminine energy. Women can have more masculine energy, but it's not nearly as common, this is about women with a feminine essence. 

Women are emotional beings, you can never forget this. They are not like men, men think logically and rationally. If a man has a track record of being a hard worker, and we can see it on his resume, we accept this fact and know this ""Bill is a hard worker...PERIOD"".


Women on the other hand are emotional beings. A man's track record of past performance means absolutely nothing to them. Women live in the moment. If you have children with a woman and three months ago she told you that she loved you, and you have done things that caused her attraction to you to lessen, The fact that she had kids with you and told you three months ago that she loved you means absolutely nothing.


Men can never understand how the woman could go from stating that she loved him to cheating on him within three months, in his mind, 'She said she loved me, so I don't understand"".


You ALWAYS have to be gauging your woman's attraction level to you and monitor it. If it drops, you must revert back to doing the things that attracted her to you, this never changes, not even after 20 years of marriage. After 20 years, her level of attraction is just as likely to drop and disappear as if you had been dating for 1 year, and with the same consequences. Kids, land, a house, finances and time mean nothing to her.


Many women will stay in a relationship after they have completely lost attraction and cheat till they enter the next one. They will know for certain for a year or two that the current relationship is un-salvageable and be lining up the next guy. All the while, the man is cruising along thinking everything is exactly the same as it was one or two years ago when she said I love you. Hell, she'll just continue to say I love you straight up till D-Day, it's just how women are.


So you can NEVER make another person or a relationship your purpose. Your purpose must be the pursuit of your freedom through your career or entrepreneurial endeavor.

TL;DR: never project your own attraction level onto your partner, always be gauging it and maintaining her attraction to you.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,774631,public,self,A word to the uninitiated about maintaining your partners attraction to you.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ncp0t1/a_word_to_the_uninitiated_about_maintaining_your/,all_ads,6,,,

I’ve been told I’m ugly by A LOT of girls, all throughout school, and hundreds of comments telling me I’m ugly when I asked in the RateMe subreddit.

I’d highly prefer to have a girlfriend and sex life, but it doesn’t happen for everyone, and I’m not entitled to anything.

Sometimes I get so upset I don’t even want to touch myself, as it just brings emotional pain and loneliness.

I’m not traditionally masculine, and I have no desire to be. Yet, I’m still romantically and sexually attracted to women.

It pains me everyday that I missed out on my youth (in more ways than just not dating or having sex, but that is a significant part of it) and I feel undesirable and ashamed to have romantic and sexual desires at all, because I’m not entitled to anything, and I’m unattractive to most women, apparently.

As for other aspects of my life, I’ve fallen behind as well, and it’s hard to have any motivation to do anything, having nothing and nobody in my life now. My own parents don’t even seem to care if I do anything with my life, and for some reason it’s hard to care about myself.

Obviously older adults have sex and romantic relationships, but I’ve seen lots of guys online claim that making it to 30 as a virgin, your desires REALLY start disappearing. While that should be relieving, it’s actually more depressing to me.

I don’t ACTUALLY WANT to lose my desires and, functioning, I just feel like I’m too unattractive to get any women as romantic and sexual partners.

Sometimes I just wish I had friends, but my being behind in life makes me too insecure to even be open to getting closer to anyone than on a “coworker/acquatience/workbuddy” level.

I’m not ready to get serious about paying for my first experience, I’m not desperate enough to do that immediately.

But if the desire dies out in 5 years, and I’ve never been desirable to the opposite sex that much, then why not just wait it out 5 more years?

He asks for my opinion on things and sometimes the opinion is on his appearance (like maybe 3-4 times about his appearance, others are if he did a good job organizing something, etc.). He’s mentioned how my hair looks a couple of times as well (for example, I work at 8 am in the morning and I’m a waitress so I just dry my hair because it’s going to be put in a clip anyway. He’s asked more than once if I did my hair before I came in). I’ve started paying attention on whether he does this with other girls as well. So far I noticed he does joke but not as much as he does with me. He also make more of effort to come talk to me while I’m in the break room. He also doesn’t comment on their hair. One time I told him  I was not having a great day and he did stuff literally just to cheer me up (which worked, he did cheer me up).

I try to combat these feelings by going on dating apps or getting to know different types of people that I could potentially form a relationship with but the downside of this is I HATE small talk and I just get bored so easy of the simple questions and answers and if you try to talk about something deeper than “what’s your favorite color” then I feel like the conversation gets even more stale because the responses are weak. This puts me in cycle of feeling like maybe I’m just not ready for a relationship since I get bored and can not force myself to develop a connection.

I was a virgin at the time and my goal was to get laid at least once since I was getting older. Luckily for me, I scored a ton of times in the course of 2 weeks.

So here is the infamous formula I invented that gave me a 85% win rate with getting laid:

Step 1: 
(the hardest/longest step)

Dm them some bs about how pretty they are. Ask what’s their favorite movie and then look up “best movie summary for [that movie]”

Reply to them and say “wow that’s my favorite movie too, because [sophisticated and intellectual reason why I like the movie based upon that googled summary].”

I’d then ask “what’s your Astro sign”

Whatever their reply was I’d say “ohhh nice, that specific zodiac means you must be fun to watch movies with” -sounds stupid but it works (for me at least)

I’d then weasel my way into convincing them to watch a movie together and then arrange a time that they’d come over.

Step 2: 
When they arrived at my place I’d bring them into my living room and I’d ask them a ton of questions about fun things they’ve done (travel, parties, sports, etc)

Step 3:
After about 10 minutes of chatting I ask if they wanted to “relax and watch a movie?” Most times they’d say “yes”. (Since that’s why they were coming over originally)

Step 4:
I’d then say “oh the TV is in my bedroom, if you don’t want to watch it in my bed I can try moving the TV into the living room?”, and almost every time they’d say it’s fine. (This was the whole purpose of the tv in the bedroom)-so I could pose that question

Step 5: I’d say “one sec I’m gonna grab a bottle of water real quick, you can head to the bedroom, it’s down the hall”. 
So while they started heading towards my room ”I’d turn the thermostat down so it was extremely cold. -this will be important later

Step 6:
Once we’re both sitting on the bed I put on the movie and we start watching.

Step 7:
I wait for the expected “WOW it’s cold”, of which I’d lie and tell them “the thermostat is broken and the temperature keeps changing but if you’re fine cuddling we can become a lot warmer.”

I guess all of them were expecting sex or something because they’d always say yes and then as we started snuggling we’d slowly start making out. And about 10-20 mins in we’d end up fucking..

Anyways, one of the girls who I brought over during that time was a chubby girl. After getting to step 7 we started making out and then she pulled away and asked “am I only here because you want to kiss me or are you actually interested in me?”

Me, the asshole I was at the time, made some bs up and convinced her she was extremely smart and funny and that “it was the sole reason I wanted her to come over”. I also went further and said that “the reason we were getting passionate was because of how pretty and attractive she was”. 

That statement led to me fucking her. 

After she left for the night she would text me non-stop asking if she could come over again because “nobody has ever made her feel special before like I did” and “she is deadly in love with me especially after what I said”

Fuck...

So I’d always lie and tell her “I’m so busy this week” or “my job is making me work extra hours” or some bs like that. 

—-

I’m pretty bad at explaining things so hopefully this entire thing made sense. For those who aren’t appalled or disgusted with me I need some advice of how to tell her no without hurting her. 

For those who genuinely hate me for this and think I’m an piece of shit, rest assured because karma already caught up with me! -every girl I scored with ended up ghosting me, I guess I’m bad at sex or something lol 

But anyways that disgusting 2 weeks of my life is over and the experience I had made me realize that I was seeing women through a misogynistic lens hence why I stopped trying to get laid once a day and am now trying to become a better person. Please help with this specific person though. I don’t want to play with people’s emotions to this scale and this one may be fragile.

I highly regret sending one certain picture, and I could’ve had a hookup last Sunday if I had opened his message sooner, but in hindsight I’m very glad it didn’t happen. 

He asked me if I wanted to go there on Wednesday night, but later left me on opened so once again I was asking if it was still on. He basically asked if I was ok with getting there late, staying for a couple hours, and leaving after that. I left him on read for a bit because it finally clicked that I’ll only ever be the girl to go to for a  “hookup” or some quick sexting.

I recently posted about my fiancé. She has put me through a lot emotionally this year, and it disrupted my mental health. I feel a lot better, but I’m still not “over it” because I worry if more is to come. Possibly just paranoia.

It started by me finding out about guys trying to hook up with her the whole time I’ve been with her, but she’d say no. I had to ask for them to be blocked. Then, I found out about her saying “I have to lock in this trust fund baby” to a friend. It took awhile, but through asking around I learned she’s not a gold digger. It was just rude and disrespectful. But I still worry because why joke about being a gold digger for months. Next, she kept a guy around that she used to flirt with. Normally I wouldn’t be bothered, but it was only on Snapchat and they’d mutually talk to each other more than everyone else they knew (red heart). The volume was all day, and I’d hear about him 2-4 times per week. Even though they’ve never met. She got rid of him to make me feel better. Lastly, she spoke to her cousin and unintentionally set her cousin off on me. I gave her the ultimatum of you don’t have to stay with me if you don’t want to, but I can’t be involved in this. She chose me and cut her cousin out of her life. My fiancé’s friend and therapist determined that her cousin was trying to sabotage us out of jealousy. While presenting me with potential legal problems. Her cousin made it sound like I was beating her, but in reality I was standing my ground and expecting the basics of this relationship we have. Her cousin then told the lies of me being “manipulative” etc to my fiancé’s family. So then my fiancé had to damage control. Then I learned about my fiancé’s rough past of using people, and just overall taking part in things I don’t line up with. She said she used to have a sugar daddy, helped a guy cheat on his girlfriend multiple times, would use people / lead them on for money, and would sell pictures to about 8 people. Essentially it just made the existing situation look worse.

Now I’m to the point where I love her so much still, and would do anything for her. But I don’t care to end it if things keep happening. She just doesn’t recognize problems she creates. Her and her therapist agreed to help her work on these things and she’s trying. I’m just scared more annoyances will pop up, or worse.  I’ve given my all to this woman, and she said herself I’ve not done anything bad to her to deserve this.

I have never dated thoughtful, respectful, or nice men before. So this caught me off guard. I’m not sure where he learned to be so sweet but I love it.

To put things short and sweet, I don't have much confidence in my attraction of women.
I've had girlfriends but all throughout high-school, I was told that I am ugly, etc and never had a girlfriend until my adulthood. So I never really developed the ability to know if someone is flirting.

Anyway, I went to the arcade today and I play one game. Pump It Up, it's very similar to DDR.
I'm really good at it and I do it for the cardio.

An hour in, this woman comes up and asks if she can play with me. I can smell a little alcohol on her but I think she's still in mostly the right mind.
She asks if I can teach her all the secrets of the game. She does that classic thing where she puts her hand on your shoulder or arm, like 3 times.
Entire time we are talking we have strong eye contact. So I subtly pull it in that direction and ask if she's from here. She tells me she's visiting with her dorm mate. Fast forward more-so on her last game, she says she'll see me around but maybe not cause she's not from here. There's like a 7 second pause and I felt like I was supposed to ask for her number and feel stupid now. Thinking back, I think that her telling me about her dorm buddy may have been saying she didn't have a bf but I was unsure.

Thought I’d [M25] post this after a half-discussion-half-argument with my best friend tonight. 

For context, although I am outspoken, honest, open, comfortable, and very close with my best friends — I am *incredibly* private when it comes to my sex &amp; dating life. 

A couple of my friends rag on me &amp; think it’s odd, but I literally do not mention who I’ve had sex with (unless we both know the person) or who I’ve been dating unless it’s been *months* with someone &amp; I feel it may be sustainable. At that point, I’ll show 1-4 of my closest friends a picture and maybe provide a first name, and ask them to please keep it private. 

Because I rarely ever talk about it, they assume I literally get 0 play and have even questioned my sexuality.... but here’s the thing, I don’t give half a fuck - I find it funny, and think their raging curiosity as to where my penis has been is odd. 

I think the way sex is socialized amongst men is a little stupid and bizarre in some senses tbh. 

For example, at the beginning of this month I did tell my friend, using very vague terms, about a girl I’ve been seeing since early February. Shortly thereafter, she ended things with me - so a few days ago I also told that same kid, noting that I was super bummed.

He comforts me and offers some great words &amp; advice,  makes some *jokes* about how she “has to be a hooker” (she’s very pretty), and then *actually* seriously questions whether I’m just making these things up or not, considering how little I speak on it. 

He said something to the extent of “dude when I hook up with a girl, close with a girl, or even start talking to someone hot - I can’t wait to tell my boys about it, it’s like the 1st thing I want to do- that’s what homies do, you’re just weird”

I happen to disagree entirely. It’s not like a “it’s not your business” thing - it’s like, dude..

I don’t engage in sex and date girls to score social points in my friend group or impress anyone. I do it for my enjoyment &amp; to meet people I click with. Why is the location of my penis at any given time so important? I have sex for me and the lady involved. 

Some male friend groups legit spend *all fucking day* talking ab hookups, and to me that shit lacks any substance or amusement at all. 

I don’t fucking care if my friend is a kissless virgin or a slayer with 80 bodies. Changes nothing about our friendship or what I think of them

Sorry for the rant - what are y’all’s thoughts on this concept? Are you private w your sex life?

*note: please no comments on me needing new friends lol.. I literally love the friend I write about here.

I’m a 28 year old guy. Recently was broken up with after a year long relationship. I have consistently dated for 1-2 year periods over the last decade. I’ve noticed that I have a terrible time enjoying being single. I commonly hear that spending time working, being social, reflecting, pursuing skills/hobbies, etc. is an antidote to loneliness, but I typically end up back on dating sites within 3-6 months and repeat the cycle. Unfortunately, I think there’s a much deeper issue going on with feeling desperate for a certain outcome - kids, wife, etc. In other words, codependency.

It’s pretty unattractive to me, so I imagine it’s probably even more unattractive to the women I’ve been in relationships with. 

I’m curious if many guys or girls of reddit can relate. If you can, and have had success in this area, would you be able to offer some advice? I’m pretty self aware in most areas of my psyche, but for some reason I feel like this need for validation is operating on a subconscious level, making it very difficult to address and control.

But, now his communication has dropped. He said he is always working and is extremely stressed. I told him to take a break.

He replied that he will take it slow but even after that, his texting has not picked up. I don't know whether I should continue to text him or not?

I noticed he’d been distant over the last 2ish weeks so I mentioned that I felt like he was pushing me away. Then he dumped me. Over text. This is going to get jumbled and confusing and bits will be missing cause there is just so much. 

He gave me this long reason about not being ready to be in a relationship. Thought he was but he wasn’t. He had to instead focus on his 4 year old daughter. This didn’t sit well with me. Only a week or so prior he was talking about all the things he wanted to do and show me. He’d told me I made him the happiest he’d been in years. Then he was telling me he couldn’t be in a relationship with anyone right now and be happy, he couldn’t give anyone what they wanted right now. The way he acted and the reasons he gave me just didn’t add up. The more I pushed to try to understand he said we didn’t have things in common.. which is completely false and he knows it. Then says maybe in the future we could work, but wants no contact. He has reached out once to ask if I was okay.  

Now I’m left with so many questions. And part of me believes I have connected some dots. Around the time things went weird I noticed he added a girl on Instagram. From there, I also noticed his snapscore sky rocketed it, always going up by 2, and then once he broke up with me, a week or so later, he also added her on Facebook. It all just adds up too perfectly to me and the people I’ve talked to about it. (Maybe a little crazy but I never mentioned this to him). 

I feel like I have no peace. I’d rather be told he met someone else then the bullshit reasons he gave me. I’m wrestling everyday, all day long, to text him and say something along the lines of “Can you do me a favour and stop trying to spare my feelings and just be honest and admit to me that you met someone else in the last few weeks.” I just want to have to have a reason to hate him.. because I loved everything about him..

I feel like at least if he was honest then I could be mad! Instead I’m sad thinking he’s the one that got away. And you may say, 5 months, that’s nothing. But we hit it off instantly. Only a month or so in and he was asking to be exclusive. A little over two months in and we were calling it bf/gf. We were GOOD, we never even got a chance to have a single fight or argument!

And even with all that I feel like my complete inexperience with women only makes me even less desirable. I can’t imagine many women wanting to be some mid 20s or older guy’s first. Which is partly why I lament missing out on teenage love so much. Probably doesn’t help that I was watching some romcom anime and reading manga that made me feel worse.

My immediate thought was to not embarrass myself in front of them. Maybe 2 seconds later I realized that they wouldn’t care anyways. They’re so out of my league they probably wouldn’t notice I existed if I tried to speak to them. 

Then I started thinking about how I’ll never be able to be with a woman I’m attracted to. I’m just too short, dark, and ugly for any of those girls to consider me an option. And why would they? They can have guys that are handsome. Why would they settle for some weird looking, sub 6’, dark skinned black guy.

The rest of my night was ruined and I went home and sulked. I’ll never have a chance with a woman I think is physically attractive and it’s so depressing.
