Over the next few months, I would spend practically every day talking with her, laughing with her, playing video games with her, everything. I felt like we became really close. She struggled with depression and self esteem and I was more than happy to be there for her best I could. Embarrassing to say, but she struggled with money, and I helped her out many a time there as well. It all made no difference to me. I really liked this girl. She felt like the closest thing I‚Äôve ever had to a girlfriend. In my actual life I had never been on a date, or even kissed a girl to this day. Having her around was a feeling I hadn‚Äôt had before so maybe I was disillusioned. Anyway, come March she had started to become distant and wouldn‚Äôt call me anymore. Next thing I know, I wake up one morning and she sends me a message saying ‚Äúsorry for being a huge burden in your life, goodbye‚Äù and that was it.

I told people that if you like a person, just tell them. I grew up with all kinds of people and I noticed early when people were interested in each other and helping those to take the first step were much easier than taking care of my interests in people. I grew and on those years I noticed when there were those who liked me more than as friends, I were scared, flustered and shy. ""How should I respond? I like that person but not in that way.. how should say it without hurting them"" deep down i knew it was more on both ways, if they get hurt I will get hurt. But a selflish thought made me confused at the same time. ""I dont like him/her""


Background
A flash through my life I saw many times that my parents werent lovey dowey as others, my parents didnt have any real common interests with each other either. They were yelling at each other alot and many times it escaleted to whole family yelling. They talked nicely and cordely when they were out, making the facade that everything was great. When my mother told me ""You children are my everything"" I thought to myself ""What about father?"" 

Both of my parents are great, do not think otherwise. In my whole life they were strong and were as human they should be. It was just at this moment I began too see my mother as an enemy that I both respected and feared. My father were idolized as the more funny and easy going and I thought he deserved better. I still liked my mother but not as much. But as life dicates in the years older you see the layers of grey.

Still I vowed to never be like them, if I were to find a love interest we should be friends as a top priority. A vow who sounds lovely and sound.. but as life is complicated a vow can make life more complicated.


People liked me when I grew up, I knew when people liked me and knew when my actions made others my enemies. I made  people feel more worth in themself and others the latter. I saw myself as great, on top to greatness yet I didnt want it. Just imagining that I could do it was a great feeling. Life could made me into player but loving to observe and try to understand the layers made all better. At a point it can be a weakness, when growing up you want see were you fit. Where you can use what you are as a person to thrive as a living being. 

It became several weaknesses for me that I began too see and slowly turn the hate to myself. 

I began to move, using this as an advantage and I noticed the strong feelings could make me change. I began to loathe myself and uplifting my family and friends on piedestals. ""I may be the worst but I must get better because they are the best"" at same time I could look down at people. An unhealthy habit that both did the worst and the best into me. Still people liked me, they couldnt see it but if they were happy with me, thats okay. 

The strong feelings for others and loathe of myself was made to my own desire. Attraction and love were to those made me change most. I have a very shy nature when it was about the feeling expressing love to another person. I also had several chances in my life for a real romantic relationship. But it was especially one who made me see ""Is this what I want be for that person?"" 

At that time my strong feelings of love made myself more dangerous to myself. I wanted to tell about how I struggled, but I couldnt. The person I were in love with struggled with its own struggle, that I knew of but my clouded mind made me stop in motion. A part of me wanted to run and another to stay. I couldnt talk, couldnt express the layers I had. I couldnt give what the person deserved, because I were scared. Scared to truly love and love myself. I wanted always to run a quality not desired for a long term relationship.

I did my mistakes and learnt more of me and others, but learned the most to love myself so I can use it for others. I believe I saw truly what they saw in me, it was my unstable and mind they liked. Nowa days people still like me, but the social circles is smaller and im content in living by myself. And I spend alot time alone and loving it. I see fascinating eyes on me as now i have embraced my insecurities and confidence I have. It can also be the funky hair they look at.

Now Im looking for a person as a long term romantic friend that I love for all the layers they are and what I am. If not im not finding the person, then its okay.

Recentely I' ve been thinking about giving up with all this 'dating' thing.  I am 26 m,  I've had 2 girlfriends in the course of my life, one was a short relationship (some months) and the next one was even less, like  some weeks. 
I've  got dumped without even knowing the real reason. The girls never explained it to me. Maybe I am just not made for this, maybe I am  not fit or worthy for a fulfilling realtionship. 
Although I had 2 gfs, I am still virgin. And not by my choice. 

So, if I may not be made for this, I'll concentrate on starting bussinesses instead and  I hope to become very very rich.

It's the exact same behavior from the male. The only difference is that the woman happened to like him. I wonder how many girls the guy had creeped out before he met the right one who found him attractive.

Meanwhile during the trip her entire friend group is hinting that we should be together. I guess on some level I began to agree. 
 
After the trip we hang out all the time. She invites me over the sleep in her bed every other night it seems. I began to grow feelings for her. Then outta the blue she texts me saying she doesn‚Äôt want to date anyone right now and needs to work on herself and be more independent but she loves our friendship. Which is fine it just doesn‚Äôt really match up with her intentions for the entirety that I‚Äôve known her.

So, there's this trainee that joined the company about 4 months ago.

In the beginning, we hit it off very well; I can tell she was very comfortable around me, given how she was willing to talk about anything and everything. She would greet me enthusiastically every morning, and check up on me whenever she was working from home. I would do the same to her whenever I knew she was stressed out from work, or just feeling down in general. We would always wait for one another after work to go back together, and even after parting ways, she would text me random stuff to keep the convo going. We could talk until the wee hours of the morning at times, only finally going to bed cause we got work the next day.

We went out for dinner twice, and each time we did we would spend hours just talking; until we just barely catch the last train home. During said conversations, we would talk about very deep topics that we couldn't usually talk about at work; at times, they can be pretty heavy.

All was going fine until one day our convo happened to be about gender inequality (i.e. She mentioned how the bar for women has always been high, to which I asked her ""from her POV, how is it so?""); to which she straight up told me ""let's not discuss such ""controversial"" subjects. if you'd like to learn more about it, the internet has lots of articles and opinions on them, all of which have been articulated better than mine could. my opinions on these are not essential to our current work nor our friendship. there are lighter subjects we can always chat about.""

Even after offering my sincere apologies to her, things haven't been the same since. Our conversations nowadays aren't as exciting/natural as it was before. Her replies have become one-liners at best; most of the time, I'll just be blue ticked. Even at work, she actively avoids me now, when before she used to seek me out to keep her company.

Wanting to try and mend our friendship, I reached out to talk to her via text - couldn't do so in person due to heightened COVID measures in my country. However, instead of communicating what the real issue was, she just told me the issue was because I asked a controversial question and I was getting too comfortable with her - how this was disrespectful to her. Furthermore, she would just give very vague and emotional answers. She ended the convo by saying how she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

Typically, I would just move on but for some reason she just means a lot to me that I just can't accept the way things turned out. To further add to my conundrum, my colleague (whom she would confide to sometimes) just told me that she has possible feelings for me as well. 

Should I call her up and tell her how much she means to me and how I don't want things to end just because of this one small issue, or should I really not bother anymore ??

The usual goes something like this.

\- Ask an interesting girl out after some courtship that feels like a job interview for an unpaid internship. They'll almost always say ""Yes"" but only around 5-10% will actually stay true to their word after a few annoying weeks of sorting out logistics.

\- Go on the actual date. Be forced to guide the entire conversation as charismatically as humanly possible as the date is way more often than not, too shy, dull or lacking pratice to carry a conversation themselves, but if you can't make up for it, you won't get a second date. The few times she takes the initiative is to ask boring interview-like questions, or logistics. Still, you gotta pretend you're having a good time and keep a smile. 

\- Pay for the entire date, regardless of how well it went, or if she intends to go on a second. You could ask to go dutch but then you guarantee yourself not getting a second. (Yes, I'm aware some women are okay with going dutch, but most aren't, and even the ones who say they're okay with it will still think less of you for it)

\- Kiss... maybe? Try to read the non-existent body-language or communication skills to guess whether or not you should because god-forbid your date actually expresses what she wants, and if you pick wrong you're not getting a second date. 

\- After doing everything perfectly, and getting lucky enough that another fellow didn't do everything perfectly as well but used the right perfume or had a more compatible zodiac sign (this isn't a joke), set up a second date and do it all over again.

In the beginning, at least my heart was racing from nervousness, now I just find myself bored with the company, and seeing dating an uninteresting chore. Even the potential of having sex isn't keeping me infatuated, because of how much effort would be required to get to that point, and if sex even comes around (which is also a guessing game like kissing because god-forbid your date show any initiative or be upfront about what she wants), it'll still be a performance show, focusing on her pleasure, where she'll probably just starfish, to even hope to get a second round. 

I used to spend a lot of time analyzing potential dates before asking them out, but that was a surefire way of getting hurt and being taken advantage off, so I've limited the time I take to ask someone out. I've also been selecting dates based on their initiative before we even start talking as well as how our first few conversations go, but even then, their initiative dies the moment the date starts, nerves I'm guessing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,803676,public,self,Is any point of Dating Fun for Men?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nntinm/is_any_point_of_dating_fun_for_men/,all_ads,6,,,

I'm a 35M from a well-to-do family, only child of immigrants from the middle east, and grew up on the west coast in the US. I have had 4 long-term relationships in my life, none lasting longer than 3 years. The first 2 i met in college, the second 2 i met through friends of friends. I have a lot to offer a woman, mainly the fact that i actually want a life long partnership and family. I've also been in therapy for nearly 8 years now, and in the last year (Since my ex and I split) I have put the ""petal to the metal"" so to speak on personal growth. Took a good hard look at my issues, identified them, started attending online groups, starting drawing, reading, took stock of my values, faced issues with family head on, started caring more for body, and though i can't say that all my ailments are ""cured"" I do know i am making progress. 

Even with all this work OLD has been a 0 for me. I recognize that i am not the best looking man on earth, I do cary extra weight, but by no means am I hideous or disgusting. In fact, all the long term relationships i've had have been with beautiful women. I also understand that when woman swipe or receive messages from guys, they're looking at dudes who have better bodies than mine, so the competition is fierce. 

I also understand theirs a great deal of nuance thats lost when meeting people online. Often time our smile, or way of speaking, or energy of how we hold ourselves says a great deal about us when we meet people through friends or in person that you just can't tell in online dating. 

So, the pandemic is ending. Let's just assume OLD is a no go for me. Bars where i live are still not open for ""Mingling"" and approaching someone at a Dog Park, or grocery store, can either go really well, or you can come off as a total creepoid (So chances are slim but possible). And let's just take the workplace off the table (Mostly because I am working from home, and social gatherings with new people are still at a zero)

My question is: If you're not successful at OLD, what are your other choices in this time we're living in? Women, where do you feel most comfortable / Approachable IRL? Do i need to take classes again to put myself in more acceptable situations?  I feel like i'm the most ready I've ever been to welcome someone into my life, but seem to be continuing to strike out, and am willing to accept this is my fault, but i'm just at a loss for what to do.

I am also leaving out names, just going to be initials.

So I met this girl on tinder over a month ago and we were getting pretty serious, we've gone on 3-4 dates and stayed together (no sex) a few nights ago. I'm 22 and she's 19 BTW (E).

So last night I was out at the bar with buddies and she showed up with all of her friends, (we knew we were both gonna be there and planned to see each other there). she shows up about an hour later than I do and I'm seeing her walk in the door as im setting next to it, I saw her but I'm not sure if she saw me, she immediately goes outside with her friends. I give it a bit then go outside to say hi, shes in a circle so I just walk up behind her and give her a hug and a hello. I just get a grab on my arm and a ""hi"" before she goes back to the conversation with her friends. (ill save some time here) it's now about 1 am and I'm headed home, so I find her tell her I'm going home, she says okay they are leaving too. (I got maybe 10 words out of her the whole night). I go home and they all go to another bar and enjoy their night, I'm sitting at home chilling when I get a text from her just saying ""I'm drunk lol"" I just respond with ""just be safe and I guess we aren't seeing each other tonight"" and she replies with ""I gotta talk to you when I get home"" 

It is now 3:30ish AM and I get a text from her ""So (S) is upset that we're talking and I didn't realize y'all were like that and I cant do that to her"" (S is one of her sorority sisters I used to be FWB with but she caught feelings so I ended that cause I didn't want that with her).

The conversation continues as I explain what we were and how (S) shouldn't be upset with her but with me if anything. Yada Yada. she then goes on to say ""I don't really know what there is to explain, I mean I like you but I can't really do that to her so I think we should stop here."" \*boom heartbreak\*

I tell her I really like her too and that it can easily be worked out. she says ""I mean it could but I don't want everyone having a problem with me""

This is where it gets saucy, I text (S) saying don't be upset with her and I know I cut you off in an asshole way so be upset with me not her because she didn't know what were or at least the full extent of it. Where she says ""I'm not upset with her, IDK where she heard that from"" I just say okay and she goes "" Just to let you know I overheard that (S) doesn't like you. so just some advice you should probably leave her alone :)"" I told her I don't believe that one because of just the way she acts around me and is wanting me to be her BF.

Come today she (E) opened the last message I sent last night around 8 am-ish and hasn't responded at all. I was actually going to ask her to be my GF today but then last night happened.

obviously, someone is lying here I just don't know who, I would guess (S) is. so I guess I need advice on what could I do to patch this up and should I message or call her so we can actually talk about the whole scenario.

I don't know if I should just wait to see if she reaches out or try and explain my side of stuff before my name gets tainted.

I asked for her insta and she gave it to me to only have her never accept my request(ok???).... Didnt think of it as a big deal because half of the office follows me and I follow them back.  A few months later she brought her BF to a work function and after that I decided to pull away from her and be professional. For around 4 months I would never approach to talk to her, only respond to work related questions and be distant. This actually made HER approach me a lot more, flirt and tease around with me and she even added me on social media... I kind of started interacting with her which made her flirt even more (she started texting me more, started touching me a lot, amped up the teasing). And the touching is no friendly touching: She would slide her hand across mine and explore my tattoos or hold my hand and say she is cold and so on....

It's depressing to see people getting on with their dating lives, it's not worth mulling over this. Though, I do have to admit that it helps me to acknowledge this. 

Not after words of encouragement or advice, just venting for the most part.

There's also been a shallow feeling lately personally about the state of modern dating and also because the start of my 20's has been very lackluster. Combating the incessant insecurities and social anxiety just puts the cherry on the top. 

At this point I thought I'd finally get an epiphany of dating, that I'd suddenly realise how I've been doing everything wrong but dating just feels like a chore for me whether it's because of a surface level attraction issue, personality issue or aspirations/goals issue. 

I think I'm just not ready to date and maybe I never will be, in any case, it's just not worth my time to think about. I have nothing to offer right now and I don't believe it's because of the fact that I'm a guy as most would try to imply guys have to have something to offer and that's because everyone has some that they can offer to a relationship whether it's known to them or not. 

Working towards a goal will get me to where I want to be, if anything, because this just isn't something that will happen as easily as I think it will and maybe others here feel this way too.

I've dated around and had a girlfriends but I'm still a virgin as I have messed around and done everything except PIV

Now ironically my entire life outside of dating has been pretty great

High school and college we're all right as I got super involved with the community and extracurriculars.

I was leading at least four clubs.

And apparently I was so impressive that I got hand-picked out of a bunch of students to go to France

I get complimented all the time and I'm even noticing interest from other women but something that makes me feel weird is this idea that if you have a horrible dating life in the rest of your life must be horrible.

I've always had an equal measure of male and female friends. I'm not perfect but I've gotten along quite well without getting arrested or getting in trouble or anything.


Of course no one life is perfect le and not everybody is going to like you, but I think it's too far fish to say that a guy must have negative trait X y and z just because he struggles with dating

Right now at this moment you probably passed the perfect guy or girl up because of whatever reason.

This person could be the best person ever but because we only can take in an instant of a person especially when we're out in the world, we tend to judge quickly

So many girls have thought I was a thug until I had to tell the otherwise and their reactions are really telling and they go from being turned off and turned on

This is my first post in here, and at this point, I can say I really need some help with what to do with this longtime crush of mine. 

I‚Äôll start with some context. We both work together in a grocery store (different departments), and we both go to the same university. We met last fall; it started with a simple hello and some small talk and I don‚Äôt know how or why, but I fell for this girl faster and harder than any of my crushes before. She would always compliment something new I did with my style, would calm me down if I seemed stressed, and after almost a year alone in quarantine it was nice to have someone that made me happy. I ended up working passed my anxiety to ask for her snapchat, and she would steady swipe up on my stories and vice versa. One day I post a picture of my breakfast, and she swipes up and asks me out to go to breakfast with her too. The catch is, I thought that this was a date. I thought I read the signs that she liked me, like we would both blush when talking in person, she laughed at all my jokes, complimented my style, and occasionally flirted. 

We go out for breakfast one morning before we both worked, and I could start telling that it wasn‚Äôt a date to her based on small subtle hints. This is where it gets bad. As I get into work, one of my coworkers who I told about the ‚Äúdate‚Äù tells me, ‚ÄúI think I screwed things up with you and so and so.‚Äù For some stupid reason he thought it was ok to ask her how the date went. She proceeds to tell him, ‚Äúyou know, I‚Äôm always so nice to boys and they think that I like them.‚Äù I proceed to message her and she tells me it was just a breakfast between two good friends. I was so shook by the situation and stressed out that I ruined things between us that I was in a very bad state for a long time. She started leaving me on read a lot and treating me differently at work.

Fast forward to now, we talk like we used to at work but thats about it. She almost acts as if nothing happened. I‚Äôve been trying to get over her for a while, but the more I see her at work the harder it gets. Like she‚Äôs still in my dreams from time to time, it‚Äôs that bad. 

I guess my question is what the heck do I do. When I talk to her in person I just get so nervous because I think that she hates me. Should I give her an actual, honest apology about my honest mistake? How would I approach that? Or should I just give up on her all together?

I know pictures are insanely important and i have friends that help me with them, so ive got that covered. The thing that i really struggle with tho is my Bio. Should i focus on being witty/ funny? Im guessing i should explain what im looking for? And most importantly: How far in-depth should i go with my hobbys/interests and how much is to much? 

Edit: Maybe some info about myself might help: As i said im 22/M and i go to University. Im decent looking and in great shape.

When he came back, he texted me right the next day if I want to meet him. He seemed to be excited to see me and we arranged a meeting on the very same day. (He even came earlier then we agreed). 
Everything was like before. The sex was very intimate and romantic and after that we talked about his recent family struggles. He even mentioned another meeting. 
A couple days later I DMed him, he viewed it after 3 hours and never replied. I messaged him the following day asking if something happened (I was thinking something may have happened in his family) but again, he viewed it after a couple of hours and never replied.
