I‚Äôm getting older and the opportunities to meet new people seem to be shrinking rapidly. I‚Äôm worried I blew my 20s and that the best years of my life are behind me.

4,mshu5k,1618625117,Should I (27M) still try to ask her (26F) out?,"So I live in Ontario, Canada. Our premier, just today, announced new tougher restrictions to our current lockdown/stay at home order that started at the beginning of this month and it has now been extended to at least May 22nd. So basically no outdoor gatherings, playgrounds and golf courses and things like that are closed, no non essential businesses, restaurants only doing delivery, etc. etc. shit like that. Police can now even stop you and ask your purpose for travel and your address and can ticket you if you don't comply. 

The thing is, I work as a technician at a college for the film program there and my contract there ends on Friday, April 23rd and then I return back there in August for the next semester. There's this girl that works at the college (also a tech) that I have really strong feelings for. She's just so amazing in every way possible in my eyes. She just started working here last August and she's a year younger than me. Back at the beginning of the previous semester (around September til October), we got pretty well acquainted. We would often invite each other to get a quick cup of coffee during our shifts at the colleges little coffee shop before it closed down thanks to Covid and we would just talk. It was really nice. Then, back in October, I asked her out and we went out for coffee one weekend for a couple of hours and it was a really nice time. At the end of that, I ask her if she'd be interested in getting together again, to which she says yes, even suggesting a few restaurants. A couple weeks later, I try asking her out again and she tells me that we should hold off on our hangouts until the whole Covid situation gets better. I asked her out maybe like twice more after that while the Covid situation was getting better at the time where I live, both times unsuccessful as she was busy with family matters those weekends. I haven't asked her out since then. Nowadays though, we hardly see or speak to each other anymore. Just a couple of ""hellos"" and ""how're you doings"" in the hallways when we pass by each other and that's it. It's kinda depressing to be honest. Plus we're both busy anyway, her especially. She's super hard working, great at her job, and clearly takes it very seriously.

So I had plans to try asking her out one more time on my last day of work to go for a walk at the waterfront that weekend. But now with these new lockdown restrictions, I'm not so sure if it'll even work out now. And if I don't ask her out, then I probably won't see her again until August. Theres this piece of advice a friend of mine gave me a long time ago and it's stuck with me ever since, and it's that time will always be against you. If you don't go after the girl, someone else will and he will get her if you don't make your move quickly. And that's something I've been thinking about in regards to this girl for a while now. I don't even have her phone number and, at this point, I'm too afraid to ask. Don't know why, just am. There's even the question too of if she's even interested in me or not. If not, then why did we enjoy getting coffee on our shifts so many times before? Why did she agree to go out to coffee with me that weekend, laugh at my jokes, and open up about herself so deeply to me? I just don't know anymore. I thought we had something there between us. I really felt that she was the one. Still do to be honest.

So I would really appreciate some advice here because I'm just feeling so lost and uncertain right now. Should I ask her out? Am I naive idiot or something? What should I do? Because I really just don't know anymore man. And I'm just tired of all the mental and emotional pain that this has been causing me literally everyday for quite a while now. üòî",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mshu5k/should_i_27m_still_try_to_ask_her_26f_out/

Finally I‚Äôm like umm ehhh hey, I kinda need to get up!? He moves and I go to the bathroom. He follows and comes in all chatty and happy. I use the restroom and he can tell by my demeanor that I‚Äôm annoyed. He ask me twice ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù and I say ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. We both lay back down and he crashes again. I get up, leave the house to go get food. He wakes up and text me saying ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd ya go?‚Äù. I told him I was hungry so I went to get something to eat. He ask what did I get him and I replied ... ‚Äúwell being that you decided you only needed to take care of yourself during sex, I figured when I got hungry I only needed to worry about me‚Äù. He reads the messages, doesn‚Äôt respond, and when I return he acts like NOTHING HAPPENED. Comes and cuddles up next to me. Never brings it up and goes back to sleep. üò≥

A little background ‚Ä¢ We have been together for 6 months. He does many things to show me that he loves me. BUT we have had many conversations revolving around sex. How he turns me down, how he is extremely selfish, how he acts like getting me off is a chore, how he never wants to go down on me but always wants me to go down on him, how he rushes straight into sex and i have no time to get warmed up. Regardless what I say or how I say it things rarely change and if they do it‚Äôs for a couple days max. So this is why I said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù when he asks what‚Äôs wrong. HE KNOWS.

How long did it take to feel the spark for you?,"I want to preface by saying I actually have some intimacy issues, I would say a fear of emotional intimacy. I rarely like anyone but when I do they are usually living in another state and/or they are an fboy or someone I could clearly never be with. Because of this, I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and I never actually had a boyfriend. 

I set the intention to really try and be open to finding someone I can be serious about and the minute I finally let go of this one boy, a man came along and he ticks off all the boxes, he‚Äôs kind of perfect even in the way he treats me.

He‚Äôs kind, hardworking and intelligent. He‚Äôs my age and already owns his own home, he takes his future seriously, he‚Äôs surprisingly so honest and open with me. Physically, he‚Äôs tall and also very fit. He‚Äôs actually the most handsome guy I‚Äôve ever talked to. And all my friends like him a lot.

He‚Äôs also really respectful and doesn‚Äôt cross the line with me, he told me it‚Äôs important to him that I‚Äôm comfortable. And he also always wants to talk to me, and yet he‚Äôs not clingy! 

And you know what I hate? I have no feelings for him yet. Like sometimes there‚Äôs a moment here and there where I have that warm feeling for him, sometimes I think about him before I go to sleep.. but it‚Äôs been three months like I should have feelings for him at this point if there will be any feelings in the future. Am I right? 

I can‚Äôt tell if I don‚Äôt have feelings for him because I have intimacy issues (my issues are not as bad as they used to be) or if it‚Äôs cause this really isn‚Äôt meant to be?

20,msjr7n,1618632693,Some advice for me,"Alright. So - this is a bit ghetto in some areas, but I'd like some opinions on this:

I met a girl, and we clicked. We dated for a while, eventually moving in together. We were together for months. She started receiving phone calls from an old f-buddy. I knew the guy and had a history with him.

So a few months before I met this girl, I got into a fight with this guy at a motel on my birthday. He crashed it; I didn't invite him. He was out of line, etc. We fought. I got the better hand of him.  We were alerted police were coming. We're a bunch of underage intoxicated people, so we got out of there. I was a while out from my house, drove, and got a DUI 30 minutes later. (Wasn't over .08, but was under 21, and it was 3am)

I get out of that whole mess, and like a month or so goes by, and I was trying to score some pot at the time and came across someone I knew at a local convenience store. He was with two other guys. My acquaintance informs me I can ride with them to go and grab it. These are some little gangsters, mind you. But I get in the car, and they bring me 30 minutes away to some woods and try to jump me. I get away; an hour later, the acquaintance calls and says it was for their ""brother,"" the guy I beat up at the motel.

So at this point, this woman and I have been together for a while and allegedly have deep feelings for each other, yet she refuses to stop accepting his calls and won't abandon their ""friendship"".

22,msjw0u,1618633224,5th date woes - sleeping together for the first time,"I‚Äôve been on 4 dates with a man I met on Hinge in February. My interest in him has slowly grown over time ‚Äì to be honest, I‚Äôm really glad I kept going out with him even when I wasn‚Äôt feeling any sort of romantic interest because as time has gone on and he‚Äôs gotten less nervous (or at least I think that‚Äôs been the main change) I have come to like him. It takes me a long time to develop feelings for someone, and also I called off my engagement with my ex of 5 years 6 months ago, so if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôm ready to seriously date. We haven‚Äôt really spoken about what we were looking for. When I first met him, I thought he was a bit like Peter Pan ‚Äì he‚Äôs in his late 30s and seemingly still a partier with no sense of what he wanted from life, but as I‚Äôve gotten to know him, he‚Äôs actually pretty well-adjusted, cares about his career, is good at planning, very observant/high EQ etc. 

Our dates have been mostly eating meals together with a random hike thrown in there. He‚Äôs planned and initiated most of the dates, and we‚Äôve been meeting every 10-14 days or so, with infrequent, but thoughtful, texting in between. I guess because I wasn‚Äôt super interested in him to start with I didn‚Äôt care if he messaged me, didn‚Äôt really mind the lag between dates. I myself would sometimes take a couple days to get back to him. Now I find myself trying to gauge his interest - on dates he‚Äôs very affectionate and flirty, but was initially almost like... nervous to initiate things like holding hands? We didn‚Äôt kiss until our third date and it was really quite chaste. I don‚Äôt have much experience dating but usually I find men to be a little more passionate at the beginning - usually there‚Äôs some tongue involved you know? We kind of made out on the fourth date, and he asked me to come back to his place with him, but I didn‚Äôt feel ready for that yet, so I politely told him I needed to be up in the morning, which he took in stride, though later he asked me if I thought I would like to see / be ready to see his place sometime ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù I definitely am very attracted to him, and I can see how attracted to me he is, and I think I would probably like to sleep with him, but to be honest there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs giving me pause. 

I have to go out of town for a few weeks in about ten days or so, so rather than wait for him to ask me out, this time I asked him out. We are both busy people, so his only night free is Saturday (tomorrow) but I am not free until after 8:30 pm, so we are just going to grab drinks (his suggestion). 

This gives me a bit of pause, because I feel like this kind of is a demotion(?) if that makes sense? At least compared to the rest of the rest of our dates. I really don‚Äôt mind grabbing drinks, but when sex is on the table, I just feel like maybe this suggests he really just wants to get laid? I‚Äôm a bit concerned about turning him down again - it kind of feels like the right time to maybe have sex, but it also kind of feels like a booty call almost at this point and that‚Äôs not really going to get me in the mood for this guy. 

I‚Äôd love some guidance. I kind of would like to get to know him better, because I find that I am actually really starting to like him as a person, and I know if I have sex with him, I will get attached. I don‚Äôt really want to have sex, travel for 3 weeks, come back and never hear from him again. I also don‚Äôt really feel comfortable *not* sleeping with him before I go, you know? I feel like I *should*. 

Should I ask to reschedule the date for a different day when I‚Äôm not rushing? Should I see him and play things by ear?

39,msmaic,1618644267,new scam alert,"I encountered a new scam, thought I'd share.

A very attractive Asian woman matched with me on Facebook Dating (of all places).  Her profile was thin and some was in Chinese, but that's not super unusual for my dating market.

The attractiveness and age put up some red flags--her profile pics were a 9, and I don't pull 9s.  She also wanted to chat off platform, which is also generally a red flag.  So I was prepared for the usual bot attack stuff and was lackadaisical about responses.  Often I just like to see what the tactic is, ime cons usually give up if there's not a lot of engagement.

Eventually ""she"" passively aggressively asked for more attention, so it didn't appear to be a bot, it wasn't a scripted response at least?

Through chatting her English wasn't great, some of her idioms were weird, and the description of her work was unusual and little thin.  She ever so indirectly mentioned that her work was ""businesswoman, I am engaged in the export trade of textile raw materials, and I am also an angel investor and token analyst"".

What's a token analyst, you ask?  Well I did and guess what.  She says she makes $$$ on crypto futures trading.  I'm aware enough of crypto, but not futures trading etc.

Long story short the conversation over the last week has been natural enough, even some personal exchanges and photos--except it keeps getting turned back to how much money she's making as a side gig on this crypto stuff, and wouldn't I like to know more?

Tonight she tried to have me download an app that's too top tier and exclusive to live in the Google play store, apparently, and I could only use that specific platform cause it's the only one she knows or some shit.  I said no, don't think so, then she got tired went to bed and I promptly blocked and reported her.

I'm sure that eventually the racket would be for me to transfer some $$$ up to this wallet, convert it to BTC, share it somehow, and then she'd steal the wallet password/crypto token and disappear into air.

moral:  women that are out of your league, demand attention, appear to have the time to give you lots of attention even though you haven't really earned it, and are pushy about their fast money schemes that lucky you she'll share with you because you are just so nice, are not really real people.  Don't do business with them.

I was sketched out almost immediately, but asking for more attention was a new one on me, so I played along.  And the amount of actual communication and time that was put in was unusual for a normal con ime.  But the repeated turning back to crypto futures trading on a dark platform was a bridge too far.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/msmaic/new_scam_alert/

I‚Äôve recently given her access to my social media accounts to giver her more reassurance and to show her I‚Äôm very serious about our relationship but I‚Äôve noticed that when I comes to her, the situation becomes a problem. 

On multiple occasions she has accused me of contacting other girls and flirting with them. One incident involved me catching up with a old friend from high school who recently found me on Instagram. My girlfriend did not take it lightly that I was invited out to eat by someone who, to her, was a complete stranger talking to her boyfriend. 

Another thing to add is that while I‚Äôm sleep. I‚Äôve noticed she goes through my phone and looks for things to argue about and the proceeds to wake me and demand we talk about what it is that she found which, 9 times out of 10 ends up being either a discord friends or someone I no longer communicate with. Although she claimed in her words she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt do it to find stuff. She just happened to see it‚Äù I find it completely false. 

She has as of recent, peaked an interest into my past relationship and found that my ex girlfriend and her used to be friends from high school which was completely unbeknownst to me; and on multiple occasions has asked me various questions about our relationship which all have been answered truthfully. 

I thought I would ask the same questions like, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your relationship history‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat have you done‚Äù and she went really in depth and gave me some really reassuring answers but when I asked about it as of recent has changed the story regarding one guy whom she expressed to be a friends from high school who she used to talk to during the summer they graduate. It‚Äôs always a different story when it comes this guy. But after prying she finally told me she had a FWB (Friends with benefits) relationship with him. 

She has claimed she doesn‚Äôt believe in soul ties and has had no feelings for him even after they did what they did. After going through her social media (which I rarely do) I recently found out that he contacted her about 4 weeks ago in Snapchat but I have no idea what they discussed. According to her they only ‚Äúcaught up and talked about me‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt sound like a story I believe. Do you guys think she‚Äôs hiding something? Or should I just forget it and move on.

So I (20F) am gonna be honest here, at this point in my life I really feel like the problem's me. 

I'm F20, living with my parents due to pandemic and because I'm still in college. Tehnically speaking, dating shouldn't have to be a problem for me. I'm working alongside studying, I like to hang with my friend group (not as much rn due to covid) and I'm pretty outgoing. Since my teenage years I was told that I'm too picky, that I can't let myself go with the flow and such things. Now this is where the problem starts.

Not gonna lie, I have standards for a guy who wants to date me. No messing with other girls, no acting like he's 12, is somewhat on the same level of emotional maturity as me, knows the basics of personal hygiene (yes I know this one's funny but you'd be surprised how many guys I know don't even brush their teeth), is respectful to his family and friends, actually respects the fact that he has a girlfriend. All these things society expects from me, but then why was I told that I'm way too picky because of these 'standards'? Am I really to picky because I don't want to be a mother to a grown man?

I get that I may come off as intimidating, and I really can't help it, but I'm not gonna act like I'm
this submissive and undecisive girl (which it seems is attractive to most of the guys and I'm not in any way shaming girls that are more submissive), because this isn't me. So why am I only attracting guys who are obviously terrified of someone confident and outspoken? Because like I said, I want someone on the same level as me, which includes standing their ground and defending their point, not someone who doesn't realise that us girls are just as much human beings as boys?

48,msnm83,1618651446,As a society are we becoming too picky for dating and relationships?,"I was reading an article about a year ago about a man that used bots on dating sites to get enough hits on his profile to get dates. He also worked on crafting as good of a profile as he possibly could. 

In his months and months of work turning online dating into a measurable science he ended up going on about 150 dates out of likely many thousands of women that seen his profile.

In the end he did meet a woman that they mutually seen a future together but even after all those dates and effort his writing was pretty ambiguous about their future. From what I recall it read more like they were going into a business partnership than a relationship. 

I know that is an extreme example but it seems to be the way things have gone. It's like everyone is looking for ""perfect"" and that any slight issue or minor boundary concern is enough to move on and just assume there is someone better out there even though that person would have still made a great partner. 

It seems strange that these are the lengths we have to go through for relationships these days when only my parents generation ago they just randomly met in the local area and they both get on very well. They didn't need to spend hundreds of hours crafting perfect profiles, matching and talking to hundreds of people to get dates. And even if you do meet someone in the same way my parents met then there is still the effects of online dating and social networks that will no doubt have a negative impact on it.

I‚Äôve expressed everything that I‚Äôve felt to him. I‚Äôve told him I feel like I initiate all the messages, and I don‚Äôt like being left on read when I‚Äôm literally answering a question he asked me. (It‚Äôs happened enough to where I‚Äôve become frustrated by it.)

I‚Äôm in a dilemma. One one hand, he does this, but when he does have conversations with me, he asks about me, how and what I‚Äôm doing, seems like he cares about me, and wants to hang out. We haven‚Äôt gone out yet because he‚Äôs in another state visiting his family, but says he will come back to our home state at the end of April.

I‚Äôm seriously annoyed by his poor texting habits. I‚Äôm in the middle of finals, so I don‚Äôt expect to chat up a storm, but at most he only sends one message, which almost always is just a reply to what I‚Äôve said to him. We rarely have longer conversations. He leaves the conversation or leaves me on read even when he asked for my opinion on something. Questions that can be answered simply are even left on read, such as how are you, what are you having for lunch etc. They are not answered unless hours later I return and ask the same question again, like a ‚Äúhey, you never told me this‚Äù statement. 

He explained that he is introverted, and that he only responds when he is invested and ‚Äúsometimes just doesn‚Äôt want to talk.‚Äù (I‚Äôm also introverted but I‚Äôm not here to say there is a correct way to be introverted, just that in my experience, people‚Äôs introversion refers to public situations and not online interactions.)

He also explained he is too occupied with his job (working from home), but to that I think, why even check his messages to begin with if he has no intention to reply? I‚Äôve even told him that I‚Äôd rather check my messages just to see they are not read yet, instead of him leaving me on read and ignoring it. But he still did this.

It‚Äôs frustrating to the point where my enthusiasm for getting to know him and meeting him is waning. Even though I hate this, I didn‚Äôt jump to  cut ties because if I take him at his word that he‚Äôs not doing this on purpose/maliciously, then I don‚Äôt want to risk not getting to know a person who isn‚Äôt abusive.

In the past year I had a few matches updated my profile tried to make it interesting to the girls I  was aiming for and even was able to get a job finally after college and still I can'teven get a date. I'm not even that bad of a guy, I'm  a little  weird and I  love making jokes a lot and even don't  mind lending a sympathetic ear to someone how needs to vent. And every girl I  matched with just opened up to me about past traumas and showed interest but went quiet. 

I'm pretty sure I  didn't show myself to be an asshole and even one girl said I seemed like husband material. Each said I  was cute and while I'm  short, I didn't  harp on it like a lot women that don't date shorter men say we do. I didn't  show myself  to be thirsty I  just showed initiative and that I'm eager to get to know them. 

All of this has basically killed what little confidence I had in myself before but I  somehow have to feign confidence and hope that no ones sees the cracks. But they always do because I'm not a guy that plays games I  will   be upfront with my intentions and wants and though I'm not really alone I  feel so alone because I see a girlfriend as my equal and as a mutual  giver of comfort someone to be open with. So right now I  have no one to really open up to because I  feel the need to hide behind my jokes with others.

It seems as though my ex  cursed me to repell women, especially online, which is the best way to not only meet women but usually the best way to meet the women I aim for. The gamer/ anime loving women seem to almost never leave their houses especially now because  of the rona. I just don't know what to do or how else I could work on myself to improve.

It started over me telling him my concerns about his feelings towards me. I brought this up because he was constantly on his phone when I went over to visit him. We both live in a different country and it‚Äôs been half an year since the last time I got to see him so I was really looking forward to spending quality time with him. But whether we go somewhere shopping, or go out to eat, he takes out his phone and starts playing video games, or starts texting... and when we get back to his place, he turns on his video game and starts playing. When I told him I wanna cuddle he tells me he doesn‚Äôt like it because it makes him feel strained... and I started noticing how he doesn‚Äôt say I Love you as much as he used to. 

These things never used to happen before long distance started.  

After I flew back home and brought all this up, he explained that he just doesn‚Äôt like being touched in general, and he‚Äôs just the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt say I love you first, and says video game is the only time he gets to communicate with his brothers, and it‚Äôs a guy thing. He then said that it was selfish of me to want him to change his actions just because I didn‚Äôt like it. 

I didn‚Äôt even tell him to change it, all I wanted was for him to be present just for the few days of my visit... and I wouldn‚Äôt say all this if we weren‚Äôt in a long distance, but even for those few days of my visit, I felt distant from him. I told him all those things just made me feel like I didn‚Äôt need to be there. He told me I was complaining over miniscule things and making it a bigger deal, even mentioning how he‚Äôs never had these problems in his past relationships. 

From that point I started feeling bad not because of his actions, but his lack of empathy towards my insecurities. I laid out my concerns just to feel even more bad about myself talking honestly about how I was feeling. and I don‚Äôt know whether I want to continue this relationship or end it because despite this argument, time to time I reflect back on all the good times we did have. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is just a natural part of a relationship or his feelings towards me changed but he doesn‚Äôt feel like saying it. He told me he‚Äôd tell me if he was feeling different.

64,mspbea,1618660274,"Why she doesn't give you an outright ""no""","I've seen a lot of posts recently about men complaining when women won't give them an outright ""no"" and even urging women to do so if they're not interested. So I'm here to give some explanations as to why women don't (and often shouldn't).

1) Safety: too many men take outright rejection very badly, with responses going from yelling (I've experienced this one) to threats and outright assault. It's also very difficult to tell if a seemingly nice, stable guy is going to flip out on you, so playing along and then dropping off the face of the earth is often considered pretty much the safest option.

2) Social conditioning: Women in most societies are expected to be caring and nurturing, which makes it psychologically difficult for them to reject someone to their face. An unenthusiastic ""yes"" or ""maybe"" is usually as harsh as some women can get.

3) ""No means yes, yes means anal"": As this Yale fraternity so eloquently puts it (links not allowed but it's easy to google), even when being told ""no"", too many men interpret this as ""try harder, she's testing you"". So what's the point? Just say yes and ghost. (See point 1.)

Yes, being ghosted sucks. You know what else sucks? Fearing for your safety. So next time a girl stops answering your messages after agreeing to a date, don't be mad at her. Be mad at the assholes who taught her that this is the safest option.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mspbea/why_she_doesnt_give_you_an_outright_no/

We may have been a bit flirty while texting, but I can still change my mind about them during or after the date! However, they don't seem to accept this and act in an entitled manner.

I'm sure lots of people would be happy to be on the receiving end of the first message.

67,mspvom,1618662795,A harsh reality about dating men,"After years of rejection from men and being treated horribly by men: none of my (25F) crushes have ever liked me back (or even found me attractive enough for a drunken kiss), guys in clubs and bars always hit on my friends but ignore me, men on dating apps have matched with me SOLELY to insult my appearance, etc, I've come to realise something about men:

Whether it's for a serious relationship, casual dating, or one night stand, men ONLY want beautiful women. And I'm talking the face of a supermodel and body of a porn star, simply being ""pretty"" isn't enough for them. They want perfection. The only reason why some of them do date women who aren't perfect is because they're settling. If they could get more attractive women, they would. That's why so many men cheat: they're constantly on the lookout for a more attractive woman to come along. And even with the women they settle for, you have to be at least a 7 or 8. If you don't have a good bone structure, big boobs, or aren't skinny, forget ever finding love. The most you'll get is desperate creeps who want to have a one night stand with you and never contact you again after.

All that crap about how men say they want ""natural"" woman is nothing but a bunch of lies. They don't find you beautiful and sexy with no makeup on and wearing sweatpants, they want an 18 year old Candice Swanepool lookalike in a tiny dress and heels and plastered in makeup. They just say those things because they'll do whatever they can to get sex.

Don't bother replying to this post saying that ""women are shallow too"" because that's bullshit. All you have to do is leave your house and take a look at all the straight couples around you: 99% of the time the woman is the more attractive one, and often significantly so. Attractive women give unattractive men a chance all the time, but the other way round? Literally never happens. Men are the shallow gender, not women. A few women saying they have a preference for tall guys does not compare to the 123456437286 requirements that most men have for their ideal woman.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mspvom/a_harsh_reality_about_dating_men/

69,mspy7c,1618663092,Should I tell my brother about his girl trying to kiss me?,"Background info: my brother has recently stated seeing this girl let‚Äôs call her Emily. Emily is part of our friends group, and she‚Äôs always been quite forward in the way she acts around my brother. So it‚Äôs not a surprise to me that things have developed into something more than just a friendship. And got to say that If my brother and Emily are happy I‚Äôm happy for both of them. However, there‚Äôs a little problem with Emily. She acts in the same forward way towards me too, but I would never entertain it as im not sure Emily is what I‚Äôm looking for. 

Emily recently hosted a BD party where all of us, her friends including me and my brother, were invited. As we arrived I went to her room to leave my coat in there and of course Emily came with me, got extremely close, and looked deeply into my eyes. For me that was an inviting signal to kiss her and I‚Äôm sure she would have maybe done it herself if I wasn‚Äôt much taller than you and my face was out of her reach. Later in the evening, I had to attend the toilets and she was ‚Äòso kind‚Äô to offer to show me where the toilets were in the house. And the same thing happened again. She literally glued her body to mine, was touching my legs and chest with her hand, was looking me deeply in my eyes and was literally waiting for me to kiss her. I didn‚Äôt.

What would you do in this situation?? All I am thinking about now is that I should probably tell my brother about this. I have no idea what his intentions are towards her and what exactly is happening between them, but honestly I feel the right thing to do is to tell him what happened at the party.

73,msqunw,1618666502,Help. I‚Äôm kinda confused. Bi girl here.,"Hi,

It‚Äôs my first time posting here. 

Fellow redditors, I have a question because I am just confused. My gut feeling tells me that this girl likes me but I don‚Äôt wanna over step boundaries and ask her if she does. (Fyi. We‚Äôre both girls and I‚Äôm bi. )

Ok, so back in 2018 I confessed to this girl that I liked her but she said that maybe it was just me being new to liking girls. Then in 2019 I confessed again but I was so scared and awkward that I said it when we were about to go home after hanging out. Then we talked about it on chat and she said that her priority is her carrer and she told me not to wait. I agreed. Anyhow, we still remained friends. But unlike before where we‚Äôll probably hang out if there is a common event or activity that we like, this time (months after I confessed to her in 2019) she‚Äôs the one initiating hanging out and doing activities.( Though, this time I tried briefly dating someone else, and we live far apart so I didn‚Äôt really tell her and we‚Äôre just friends and I don‚Äôt really wanna tell her)


So, we‚Äôd see each other. Traveling is really an effort given that we live far apart that the most common points for us to meet are 3 hours least from our own individual homes. She‚Äôd plan and ask me out. Though there are times I‚Äôd ask her if she wanted to watch a movie or go see an event that base on our hobbies is common for us. But I just find it that she‚Äôs asking me out to places I really haven‚Äôt considered but I do like. Pre covid we had plans of go seeing other states. And she‚Äôs talked about us going on a trip abroad, and we should save cuz if it‚Äôs safe to travel then we‚Äôll do. 
(And there are occasions when we hang out that when casually walking she‚Äôll wrap her arms around my arm. And from 2017-2019 we‚Äôd talk every day to almost every day. And these past years due to covid , I‚Äôm not really in the mood of talking so, but we‚Äôd briefly talk every other day and if I haven‚Äôt replied and just seen it, days after she‚Äôll chat me and we‚Äôd have long conversations.)

Sometimes I think that she likes me but I don‚Äôt wan a misinterprete it by thinking that maybe I‚Äôm just a friends that‚Äôs easy to ask out wherever. Or she‚Äôs just comfortable, or out of convenience. 


I still like her as a friend but it‚Äôs been a year of not seeing her so idk if I still like her that way. I‚Äôm not sure if seeing her my heart skips a beat. I really keep conversations friendly cuz after confessing twice, I don‚Äôt want to be falling again or think she likes me. I wanted to ask her but then I‚Äôve been honest about my feelings twice and I‚Äôm telling myself that if she does like me, she‚Äôll make a move. 


I‚Äôm just confused cause her actions pre covid to now , if I were to entertain thoughts of hope will really make me hopeful. But then, she‚Äôs said she wanted to focus on something else and I shouldn‚Äôt wait. 

I‚Äôm so sorry for the long post. But what do you think I should do? Are these hints or it‚Äôs just friendly?

75,msrgvd,1618668746,I Stopped Dating,"I‚Äôm turning 30 (F) in a few months and since this year started, I was kinda pressuring myself to meet someone special to settle down with. It‚Äôs not about getting married, it‚Äôs about having children. Almost 4 years ago, I broke up with my long term boyfriend and since then I only had 1 relationship for 10 mons. and didn‚Äôt work. I had few dates though but I think my personality is too strong and the men I dates with didn‚Äôt like. Some of them, including my recent ex boyfriend, ended up being my good friends. I met them through dating app since I really don‚Äôt go out that much and I just find it weird to meet someone somewhere then ask my/his number. Before, I wanted to be in a relationship with someone that I already know, like a friend. However, my guy friends are my friends and I don‚Äôt want anything from them but friendship. 

So, after a series of dates, I liked some them, met them some a couple of times, looked like going well but that‚Äôs just it. I think, it‚Äôs me, my personality, I tried different approach (like a lot - love to experiment), I tried to change myself yet the real me would just appear because that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a bad person, I know I‚Äôm respectful, thoughtful, I have the right manners (saying sorry, thank you, you‚Äôre welcome), sweet and I know where to put myself, I don‚Äôt assume anything otherwise stated by the guy, I just go with the flow, so I think it‚Äôs my other personality why I always end up not being with someone. 

Then, few weeks ago I decided to delete my account on a dating app, stop thinking and pressuring myself on getting married and just be me. I‚Äôm not giving up, I‚Äôm still hopeful, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm not gonna worry about it anymore. Now I‚Äôm thinking to just freeze my eggs so if time comes that I am capable (financially) to have one or even more, it would be really from my DNA. 

However, today I just feel sad listening to music at work, I feel lonely and thought that I don‚Äôt know what love is anymore and started asking questions if love really is unknown, how would I know if I love someone already, would I love again? 

Still I stick to my decision of just letting go of that worry of having someone and I think I am having progress, lesser worry about it and not thinking about it that much anymore.

I have found that all the good qualities I shared; such as being good with kids; was one. She was insecure about that. So decided to downplay her attraction towards men who are good with kids specifically with me. But when someone hotter gave attention to children; she was all over him.

I would take care of myself all the time and one week where I wasn‚Äôt she instantly called me out on it ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a state‚Äù.

87,mst4cw,1618674444,"""Why are you single?"" is a stupid question","""Why are you single?"" is a stupid question to ask someone because deep down you already know the reason why anyone in this world is single. 

There are only two authentic and honest answers to this question:

1. ""In the last 'x' amount of time, all the people that I have pursued have not been interested in me and all the people who have pursued me, I have not been interested in them.""
2. ""I have not had the courage to engage in interactions with people I find attractive, even though I frequently cross paths with them (i.e. cute people you see in your everyday life) .""

What is interesting is that these answers are time scale dependent. 

Meaning, if you ask someone ""Why have you been single for the last 10 years"", answer 1 would likely be the reason. If you ask someone ""Why have you been single for the last 3 months"", now the second reason is much more likely.

I am not saying that if you ask someone this questions you are stupid or wasting time, just sharing my thoughts. I will definitely ask this question as a form of making small talk.

90,mste7o,1618675338,Could someone help me figure out this OLD/LDR situation?,"Kinda OLD?

**Summary of the situation:** This week I (20sM) met someone (20sF). She seemed to like me. She is going abroad today and will only come back on August. **How do I keep things interesting until she comes back?** What are some things I can do? Are video calls good? Voice messages? How often could I text her without being annoying?

Additional info:

- Her best friend (F) is a friend of mine and she spoke highly of me to her;

- We only went on two double dates, being that on the second date I picked her up and drove her home;

- We have good conversation, and she even said she feels comfortable and safe talking to me;

- When I drove her home, there was no kiss nor a hug when we said goodbye, as I received a phone call at the wrong time and it ruined the moment (thank you, mom). She got out of the car and said it was a pleasure to meet me;

- She was the first to ever send me a voice message or a picture on instagram;

- Through some of the conversations we've had over text, she seems like she cares about my well being;

- It could have been out of politeness, but she seemed interested in knowing more about me (asking about family, hobbies, etc). Although through text, it's mostly me carrying the conversation;

- She is a bit shy, and yet she has made jokes about us kissing;

- As you can see, I overthink a lot.

91,mstev5,1618675395,I am drawn to men who remind me of my father,"wow i‚Äôve had this realization. After getting out of a LTR, in the past two years i‚Äôve dated 3 men. things go sour right away and I‚Äôve realized they all share the same traits. They‚Äôre grown men, who have irrational fears/ anxieties.  they all refuse to work on themselves (seek professional help) and prefer to stay stuck in their world of fear (they are all employed and have access to such resources). One of them has such irrational fears that he refused to drive on the highway and will not drive to my home taking local streets because he‚Äôs afraid gang members will jump him.  As a grown woman with baggage of my own, i cannot stick around and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù these men. I have worked really hard to feel better and overcome the trauma i experienced as a child. when i end things with them, they all give me the ‚Äúif you love me you‚Äôll stick around‚Äù. but why should i? why did it take for you to yet again fail at another relationship to want to change? let it be known that they say they want to change but make no effort to seek help. I know I myself can‚Äôt change people. 
this blows. these men are truly some of the kindest people i‚Äôve known, but wow when the fuse blows, it gets scary in no time. 
I have made it a point to not get involved with men who remind me of my father, men who have the same traumas and fears, manipulative men, who are selfish and only use others to get what they want, but it keeps happening.  at least i‚Äôm aware of it ü§î. I am now better at noticing red flags and don‚Äôt stick around for long. I hate misleading people.  I also feel like it would be an as$hole move to tell these men that they remind me of my father and their fears and depressing behaviors are not something i want in me life (because they won‚Äôt get help).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mstev5/i_am_drawn_to_men_who_remind_me_of_my_father/
92,mstflj,1618675458,"Is he not interested or does he think I'm not!? Maybe I take things too slowly? (28F, 26M) I haven't heard from him in a week and he revamped his OLD profile","Hi guys, so i met this dude on a dating app and we've hung out 3 times.

I am new to dating after taking a very long break and I am the type of person who takes things super slowly and casually. I haven't even flirted or made any moves with him at all, even over text. I guess I take time to warm up to someone. I also did not tell him this so he may have no idea. Andddd I stupidly told him two stories about other OLD dates I've had where I went out with the dude but when they tried to get physical I left.

I also insisted on paying for our first 2 dates, which may not have been the best idea.

For our third date (or whatever), he came over to my house, that was last weekend. It was a casual/friendly vibe, I asked him tons of questions about himself, I was super enthusiastic/bubbly, etc. But, we mostly just sat outside and then once we came in, I think he at one point mentioned moving to the living room (I can't fully remember, but he either verbally said that or implied it somehow), but I stupidly just kept things going in the kitchen, so we literally just stood in the kitchen talking the entire time.

I was on one side of the kitchen island and he was on the other and once he came out of the bathroom he moved to my side to stand next to me, but I don't know that my body language was really open and he might've been worried about making a move given those few stories I told him about past OLD dates.

He eventually left and at one point while he was leaving I thought he might try to kiss me because he seemed to be lingering, but he ended up not and we both mentioned maybe hanging out again tomorrow night. (I can't remember who initiated that).

ANYWAY, I had told him before I was getting together with a friend the next morning, so later that next day he texted me and said he was too tired to hangout again tonight (we had stayed up til 3am), but he asked if I had fun with my friend. We texted back and forth a little and I sent a final text around like midnight-ish and he read it but didn't respond (to be fair, it wasn't really a text you would say much more than ""lol"" to).

I haven't heard from him since and it's been a week. I haven't reached out either. But I noticed he like re-vamped his OLD profile and added some new pictures, changed most of the prompts, and wrote in there that he's looking for a wedding date for next month.

So, I don't know, what would you guys do in my situation? How can I show him I actually am interested in more than a casual friendship? I don't want to send a casual ""hey how are you"" text because I guess if he thinks I'm not interested, that doesn't really convey interest either.  Maybe I should text him and see if he wants to come over and watch a movie or something so he'd get the hint?

PS I do really like him, he's super nice and down to earth.

Thanks for anyone who read this and responds!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mstflj/is_he_not_interested_or_does_he_think_im_not/
93,mstfxz,1618675492,"A recent event that happened when dating, and i want clarification.","So i had been talking with a girl on snapchat right, and things are good we both send each other pretty frequently throught the days and we had been talking for like a month.

During that period, i had asked her several times to meet, not being pushy just asking occasionally, and in that month. One day i ask again, then on the same day, i send another snap that said something like ""i really want to meet and drink beers or something"" and she responds ""maybe"" with like an excited emoji face, i perceived that as a green light, so i use snapmaps to locate her because my phone was dying (6%) and i couldn't ask her because she wasn't opening my snaps.

Keep in mind it was late at night but she didn't comment on it being to late for me to visit.

So my friend gave me a ride and i try searching for her house and i spend a hour or something looking in the freezing cold btw. I end up not finding her because my phone died in the process.

And so i walk home took a while, but when i get home and charge my phone i open my snap and i see texts from the girl basically lashing out at me and berating me for trying to meet her, saying things like, ""you made us scared"" and ""don't you realize how wrong that was?"" And we argue a little. and She also takes a screenshot of the chatroom i don't know what that means.

Don't ask me what she means by all that she didn't elaborate futher.

Now after i read all that, i ask ""why is that wrong"" several times and each time, she just responed by virtue signaling me, failing to explain why that was so wrong and why i am a horrible person by trying to meet up.

Not gonna lie, i was extremely angry and frustrated after this and went into deppresion, not sure why.

I am trying to frame this in the most genuine way possible, because i am honestly not sure if i am crazy or she is.

I guess why i wrote this post is to try and find out if i am a bad person which i don't think i am for doing this but i still feel guilt? or sadness? i don't really know how i should feel about this.

If i think about it rationally, i honestly don't see why this is wrong, maybe it is and i am just maladjusted or something i dont even know, but i want some perspective and clarity basically on how to feel about this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mstfxz/a_recent_event_that_happened_when_dating_and_i/
94,mstkc0,1618675883,Is she interested or not? Hard to tell,"Two years ago, I met this girl in one of my classes and we formed a group for a project. We spoke her and I after class here and there but I felt like she wasn't attracted to me judging by the way she looks at me and acted around me. I let it go and focused on the project, eventually the team didn't work out as there was a lot of conflit, we got split up. We communicated through Facebook but it was mainly work related for the project. A few months after finighisng the class, we would see each other around campus, I'd see her around and she would say hi and so we were on good terms, but never really talked on facebook after the project ended. A week ago I decided to shoot her a text with 'are you alive ?..."" she didn't answer it. Two days later, I asked her to hang out and she answered 17 hours later with a 'Sorry I'm busy', I replied 'no worries, thanks for telling me' and thus conluded she wasn't into me. Now I'm wondering, should I have probed? Maybe she was testing me to see if I were going to ask her out again ? to see if I truly wanted her ? maybe she was playing hard to get ? Should I message her again to ask for a different time to hang out to show her I like her ? Is she even interested ?

98,mstyjn,1618677144,What is a high value woman?,"I don‚Äôt know if any of you have heard of Kevin Samuels or watched his videos but at times he does make sense and so agree with him but there are times where I get this weird vibe from him.

So he talks about high value men‚Äôs and high value women, still don‚Äôt fully understand what he means by that though. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this but I do agree that some modern women need to do better and modern men as well. You can‚Äôt have no ambition and look for someone who‚Äôs ambitious, it doesn‚Äôt work like that. Also, one thing that I feel like some people tend to take out of context is the verse in the Bible that tells women to submit to their husbands. Some men like to think women are to just do whatever they say, but that‚Äôs not the case. The Bible also tells men to love their wives and to provide for them. A wife who submits is a wife who listens, supports, motivates, etc. it‚Äôs a partnership where both equally give and take. And traditional woman? I don‚Äôt know if by their definition I could be a traditional woman, I‚Äôd lose my mind if all I did was tend to a house and have kids, it actually seems boring honestly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mstyjn/what_is_a_high_value_woman/
