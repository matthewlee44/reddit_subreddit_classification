0,rckyqd,1639066513,"Need advice on ""just staying friends""","I (25M) went on a second ""date"" with someone (25F) yesterday which was a really fun time and great company. However, it ended with me telling them that I am interested in them and would want to keep dating and see where it goes, but they responded by saying that not only did they not view our two ""dates"" as dates, but also that they only like me as a friend and want to keep being friends. Based on our rapport I genuinely believe them when they say this, and since I really value them and like them for them and not what they could be for me, I am totally on board with being friends and continuing to get to know them (like, I REALLY want to keep getting to know them, even without any future potential of dating). But I also have my reservations and confusion around the whole thing, and I was hoping to get some advice from anyone who has gone through something similar (but also feel free to chime in even if not). Do you think cutting back communication, like texting for example) is a good thing to do, or should I try to keep things going as usual (especially since they said they liked our dynamic and how we communicate)? What should I avoid doing so they don't feel like I'm still just trying to date them but actually want to take them up on the offer to be friends? And, despite me saying I believe them, should I believe that they actually want to be friends or should I take this just as a rejection and let them live their life? Any advice or encouragement (I am definitely disappointed and a bit sad) is really appreciated!

5,rclcra,1639067620,Does my friend like me or am I misinterpreting it?,"I 19F) met him (19M) a few months ago and since then we’ve been hanging out with the same group of people. There wasn’t a spark at first but I think he could may or may not like me now, but I don’t want to make any moves if it’s just friendship. 
- The main thing I think to mention is that he likes pain, not anything rough but he likes it when I punch them. He’ll do the same to me, I don’t mind it. We say merci when we want each other to stop. I kinda already knew he liked it but he told me one on one the other day. He does the same with the other people in our friend group but most definitely targets me the most by a long run.
- He ran to the car to get me his sweater and whenever we’re all going out (friend group) he’ll bring an extra sweater for me. He let me keep one of his sweaters too. And he holds my bag just because sometimes.
- I never wear my glasses, I said I don’t wear them because I look like a nerd. But he encourages me to wear them
- We went to an event his sister was in, another friend had attended as well. He brought his camera to take photos and while we were there I asked to look through all his photos. He said he had something bad on it, but I was persistent that I wanted to see it. He considered showing me but rejected the idea. He hesitantly said it was a nude. I implied it was going to one of our other friends (not another gal or anything). He said no that it wasn’t going to anyone.
- I don’t know how to drive very well, he said he’d show me if I’d like (I agreed).
- This is while we were with people but it is well known in the group one other person and I cannot drive. So everyone makes jokes that I should drive, I said I would. I asked to sit in the drivers seat and he said okay. I meant that he got out and let me drive but he had me sit on his lap and turn the wheel instead. 
- He used to talk about one of our other friends creating a dating account for him, but says he doesn’t want to rush into a relationship now.
- This was just in between where I kinda liked him but he probably most clearly didn’t like me. He told me and another friend who he masturbated to, the group needed a cum sock he was the chosen one. He didn’t wanna tell me though but I think that’s just because I’m a girl.
- He doesn’t let me see his room, while all our other friends can. I managed to see it though, all our friends had to pin him down and get him off of me because  he’ll nail me to the ground each time I try. But everyone else in the group are boys and it could really only be because I’m a gal.
- Yesterday was so weird it felt like a date almost. I asked if he could pick me up from school then we went to pick up some stuff, he gave me a driving lesson. Then we met up with his mom, sister, and a friend of ours and watched his sisters show, I met his sister and I already met his mom. But we all ate out then came back home to play a quick game on the wii.
- And he rested his arms on my leg and while we were out he rested his head on me. I was laying down so it was towards my legs/stomach. But he does do this with the other guys in our group.

Idk if he does it’s cunfuzzling, any input? Anything I should do to see? Any actions I can make?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rclcra/does_my_friend_like_me_or_am_i_misinterpreting_it/

About 10 years ago, I started dating a woman that I was flat out intimidated by - I thought she was way out of my league. I had trouble getting it up, and it triggered a cycle of being anxious about not getting it up and then being too anxious to maintain an erection. It hasn't been that way with every relationship since then, but I have noticed a pattern - the more I care about someone, the more worried I am about it.

i don’t know if i should keep on sleeping with him and just try to keep our socializing to a minimum, or if i should stop seeing him overall. i do enjoy his company and the sex, but it’s entering dangerous territory for me where i actually may have feelings. of course i have reservations about cutting it off entirely since i do enjoy spending time with him, i just want to protect myself and my mental health. any words of encouragement or advice is appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcmz47/fwb_is_getting_too_close_should_i_cut_it_off/

He seemed so about it, texting me everyday and asking me questions about myself. He was never once inappropriate with me, and seemed genuine so I was excited to meet him in person. We met up a week ago, and although I wasn't super attracted to him there was something about him that was sexy and I liked his personality. It was super easy to talk to him and we even extended the date by talking in my car for two hours until after midnight. He asked for another date and I said that would be nice. He tried to go in for a kiss, but I told him I don't kiss on the first date, plus I was sick with a cold. He said he understood so we just hugged and he said to let him know about Friday. He texted me as soon as he got home saying he had a lot of fun. I texted back saying I also had a great time and that I was looking forward to Friday. Come Friday, my cold had gotten worse and I told him maybe we should just go out on Saturday, thinking I would feel better. On Saturday I hadn't improved, but I was determined to see him again because I enjoyed my time with him and did like him. Halfway through getting ready, I just knew it wasn't going to happen. I was feeling sick and tired from my medication. He understood, and I hoped he would since he's a nurse. He said to feel better and that we would figure something out. The next day, he texted me asking how I was. But the conversation took a weird turn, because he started talking about how his friend was telling him I might be playing games and that I was flaky, and why he put up with me cancelling on him twice. Then he told me that he had explained to his friend that I was sweet and he didn't think I was like that. I assured him I wasn't and that I was sorry if it felt that way but that was not my intention and I really had been ill and did want to see him again. He even saw that I was sick on our date, since I was coughing a few times. He seemed to understand and accept my explanation because we talked the rest of the day.

But if this isn’t the right subreddit then pls delete. I’m just looking for some suggestions. 

Pretty much as the title says. 

My old childhood friends and I are in our early thirties but they’re just legit neckbeard types. They don’t excercise. Complain about everything, never do anything except work and then play computer games for 8+ hours. Every. Day. 

I’ve tried multiple times to invite them out and do other things but they just don’t budge. The only time they go out is when they go to bars. But they won’t go to bars for people our age. They only go to old folks bars at like 4:30. They won’t go to more happening bars and if we do end up going then they just complain how everyone is so stupid. 

Any time I’m in a group chat and I try to get them to do something they just shit all over it. Calling it dumb, trying to start an argument or debate just so they can try and “win” by using facts and logic. Honestly, any time I even bring something good up going on or me even trying something new they just shit on it. Try to bring up facts why me feeling good is considered a bad or isn’t as good as it should be. Sometimes it’s just nice to have someone cheer you on or boost you up. Whenever they do something and post in the chat about it. I’m always in their corner and tell them it’s great and good job! But whenever I do it they try to start a debate or tell me all the negatives about it. 


I’ve known these guys since I was in 2nd grade. I’ve always hung out with them. We have similar nerdy humor but I’ve slowly realized that there humor is just anime memes, 4chan garbage humor and honestly some of it comes off as really incely and neckbeardy. I used to be like that but since I’ve grown personally and don’t find that funny anymore and find it really cringe for men who are in their 30’s. 

I’ve started to also go to meetups but I’m having a hard time opening up and being myself. I sometimes have a dark sense of humor like my old friends but I don’t feel comfortable really bringing that up with new people. On top of that. All I know is internet humor and memes and have a hard time connecting with new people who kind of outgrew that. 

Does anyone have any suggestion on how I can be more comfortable around new people who don’t share the type of personality that I’ve been accustomed to for many years? It seems everyone is normal but me and my old friends were just the weird ones and now I wanna to be normal like everyone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcnap2/need_to_ditch_old_friends_but_not_comfortable/

This summer I met a girl at work, and we instantly became close. After a couple of months she confessed that she had a crush on me, and we agreed to talk about it after she left our job for school. We did and we started dating. 

We dated for a while and things were going great, but then she got really busy with school. She has a hard major so this was expected. But it got to the point where I was putting in much more effort than her, and she decided that it wasn’t fair to me. So she chose to end things because she “wasn’t in the right headspace” for something that serious and she didn’t think it was fair that she couldn’t be 100% “in”. She kept saying that it wasn’t anything I did and that it was just the wrong time. She also said that if she returned to work (for a couple weeks) during her Christmas break she’d understand if I wanted to avoid her when we worked together. But she did say she’d look forward to working with me again if she came back.

Of course I was hurt by it, but I figured that we wouldn’t actually have to work together again because my job can be very selective when it comes to letting people come back. Since she broke things off we’ve only texted a couple times about generic work stuff. Well… she text me last week telling me that they were putting her back in the schedule, and her first day back is next Friday.

I’m not looking forward to it at all. She’s coming back with another coworker that I was friends with, so it’ll be awkward if I talk to the other coworker but not her. But I also don’t wanna be too friendly cause I still have feelings for her and joking around with her like old times will end up hurting me in the long run. What should I do? Should I just avoid her?

My (28F) boyfriend (32M) admitted to me that he cheated on me with his ex. In the fist week of our relationship. Like he asked me to be his gf and two days later slept with her. This was months later that he admitted it. We broke up. He told me it would never happen again and said he wanted to work to gain my trust back. We have been hanging out as friends again and last week kissed for the first time in months. He got distant after that. We usually FaceTime for hours every day. He told me he was going skiing this weekend and I asked I I could join. He revealed to me that the ex will be staying with him in his cabin.

English isnt my first language so excuse any mistake. 

So, there is this guy we already had sex a few years ago and it was a-ma-zing for both of us I guess. 

We got in touch again recently and he asked me if I was up to see each other again. I said yes. 

For the profile, he never asked me to meet directly. Never. Even when we used to see each other several times a month for a year. He gives affirmation until he is SURE I am ok and he can go further. It's like he is scared of the ""no"". 

We are both working in the event field means we are always away. 

I asked him three times if he was available. Three times he said no because not in town and the third time he said ""but I will be here from this date to this date"". I refused as I was the one out of town. 

I gave up with him as he was too busy and I thought that was too much effort to have sex. 

This was a month ago. 

A few days ago, he messaged me and asked me if I was still working in my company. One of her friend applied and they wanted me to help her. 

I was REALLY happy to help. She is young, covid isn't helping for work, if I can help anyone, , I just do it. 

So, I asked him about her as I cannot just shout ""hey! Anyone has an interview with a girl tomorrow? "".

He wasn't confortable giving me his friend info. Not even her name! (How should I talk about someone I don't even know her name??). 

After several messages, He finally gave me her FIRST name only lol and the name of the manager she was doing the interview. 

He wouldn't help me to help her. 

I said ""listen... If you really need my help, text me again before 6 tomorrow and tell me what you want from me"". 

He said ok but I already knew what he was gonna say. 

"" Hey, it's ok. She will do her things. She won't need help..."" 

I feel like it was a good excuse to talk to me as he knew his friend was applying in my company. Anyway, Do you think I should jump on that to ask him again or shut the door forever?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcp6pe/should_i_ask_him_again/

Went on my first date for a long time.. like 2 years and I am a single mom so I’ve been preoccupied. Last night, was a good date, good conversation, he seemed into me and I was into him, we didn’t have sex but we made out etc. He seemed really interested and he wanted to see me again. He was really attracted to me, he kept complimenting me and there was a lot of eye contact and chemistry. 

I always wait for the man to text me afterwards, I know it’s extremely dated and probably wrong on some level, I’m just an anxious person and I hate bothering someone who doesn’t want to be bothered. I’ve just been out of the game for a long time and so I don’t really know how to chase. But from a mans perspective and as a man do you text the woman the next day? Or is it normal to let things settle? Or is it not even on your mind as a courtesy? Or are you waiting for her? 

He hasn’t messaged me since yesterday our first date, and honestly normally I would just take that as a hint that the person is not interested and I wouldn’t pursue it any further.

34,rcpre2,1639079832,Am I doing something wrong?,"So I’m a 26 male, I live near Toronto. I’ve never really been on a real date or really had much luck even getting the opportunity to go on a date with a girl. I’ve now settled into my career and am working my way up through the company, so I have disposable and steady income. I’ve tried expanding my hobbies but it has been hard with the pandemic and everything that has been happening it has been hard however to get out to try new things.

Looks wise I’m told I’m not bad looking. Im 5’11 so I’m not short, I’m an average build weighing around 160 pounds, I’m not muscular but I’m not really overweight either ( I was only 130lbs before COVID started) I have blonde hair and blue eyes, I work in finance so I’m required to stay well groomed and presentable because of the clients I meet on a daily basis.

I’ve tried dating apps which leads me to no matches and will often times go months without getting any likes no matter how much I use them or spend on them. When I do finally get a match I often feel like I’m carrying the conversation and the girl has no interest and ultimately get ghosted after an hour. I understand people get busy and don’t always have time to response so I’ll leave them alone for a day or two before trying to pick back up the conversation which either nets me an unmatch or just no response.

I will admit my hobbies are a little nerdy as I spend a lot of my free time at home playing video games and hanging out with people in discord channels. I do like to watch and follow sports (I’ve been in fantasy leagues for hockey for the past couple of year) I play sports and want to learn to snowboard this year. I’ve picked up building gunpla (model robots if you don’t know) and I’m trying to be more outgoing and trying to do more stuff with friends.

I do live with my parents still for the sole reason that moving out in my area would cost me more in rent than buying a house or condo with a mortgage would and I haven’t saved up quite enough to buy a condo for 500k on my own yet.

My conversations generally start with me talking about something I noticed in there profile and asking them questions about themselves to understand them better, usually I’m met with one word answers and very little contribution to the conversation which just leads to me asking more questions to try and get something going. This tends to lead to them not responding anymore of just in matching me.

On a few occasions now I have gone on a first date with a girl and noticed VERY obvious positive signals on the date e.g. stroking my arm, saying how keen they are to see me again, making out with me for ten minutes plus. Then, bizarrely, when a few days/ a week later I ask if they fancy going out again they say no, usually coming up with some bullshit reason which is clearly a lie - the true reason must just be that they lost interest.

Has anyone else experienced this? It seems like they’re into me in the moment and then with time to reflect feel like there isn’t actually potential. It’s just a bit weird to me. I also have theories that I may seem slightly too keen with messaging after the date (I’m not cringy keen by any means but I might message too quickly or whatever).

52,rcr6gw,1639083729,Is long hair unattractive for a straight man in dating?,"When I was a kid, I dreamed of having long hair. Unfortunately over the years, I could never go through more than 2 months without cutting my hair. It was mainly because my parents thought it was unprofessional and unattractive Now fastforward to adulthood at 25, I have now gone through 2 years without cutting my hair. Thanks to the pandemic, I was able to freely grow my hair and even went through the ""male awkward stage"". Even my friends think I should continue having long hair. They think it's more ""mature"". When I compared to my old pictures, I look better with long hair. This is because my old haircuts were pretty bad and I didn't know what head shape. The main reason I'm keeping this hair is because I can't think of a good short hairstyle suited for me.

However, I did google up long hair men on dating apps, and from what I heard, they do worse. Even women on Reddit commented (in honesty) saying that it's unattractive and unprofessional. I don't want to share a pic of myself but my hair isn't super messy. It's not straightened out either though. I was really debating over the last month whether I should cut it or leave it. I really want to cut it but at the same time, my pre-covid short hair pics didn't look that great IMO. And if I were to cut, I can't get it back for at least another year+ of growing hair. But not gonna lie, it's a bit more time to wash/tidy long hair than short hair.

As for what my success is like on dating apps, Bumble/Tinder zero real conversations. But Hinge was when I started seeing some success as I was getting some quality matches and conversations even leading to a date. The catalyst towards me getting likes is from sending good messages/comments on either prompts/texts. I have not received a SINGLE first-hand like from women so it's likely whoever responded was cool with me having long hair OR preferred it.

I used to think, I actually still believe in this, that the better you get, the more you learn, the better you look, the better you treat people, the better you live your life, more and more women will appreciate you.

But apparently dating has nothing to do with being awesome, looking like a greek statue or living a great life, because self improvement does not equal sexual attention. This may sound obvious to most of you, but in my childish mind it's mind blowing!

64,rcsy4j,1639088665,Torn between a potential long distance relationship and a friend who may turn into a fwb,"Warning in advance: Most of this is probably just me overthinking, and getting attached too quickly when there's finally someone I like who also shows some interest in me.

So I met some this summer, let's call her Chloe. We agreed from the beginning that we are not looking for a relationship, but only for friendship and possibly fwb. I liked her, but didn't have romantic feelings, though I couldn't rule out that might still come after learning more about her. My impression was that she felt similarly.  
We had also confirmed that we find each other attractive. Though we never did anything sexual. However we started cuddling pretty soon.  
One thing about her confused me a lot. While we met her body language said she's happy with being close, but that she doesn't want to go any further. Which then suddenly changed to the opposite when we were already at the door to say goodbye (she was always the one saying it's time to stop). I once asked her afterwards if she wanted more, which she declined. And once commented how she was making it hard to leave during such a goodbye, which she didn't react to. At the last time she actually gave me a short kiss on the neck.  
I had planned to talk about that confusion at the next time we met. Though before that she told me she just started a relationship with someone, and she would only be able to see me in a platonic way from now on. Then acted really surprised when I said I'd still like to see her as a friend. After that her communication got quite erratic, and I was the one to be surprised that she didn't let it fade out. At one point she even asked to meet again, just to go completely silent before we could settle on the time.  
Fast forward 1-2 months when she appears again. She had sudden health issues (related to a condition she had told me about before), was depressed and the relationship is over. Now she's eager to meet again, actually more eager than the times before.

On the other side I started connecting with someone else, Max. We only know each other since 1.5 weeks. It was completely by chance, but we felt at home with each other right away. The problem is our distance - think different continents.  
We joke around a lot about getting into a serious relationship, but didn't talk about it seriously and in my opinion that would anyways be much too early, except maybe making clear whether that's an option at all. So far the rational side. Emotionally I already REALLY wanted to try it with her.  
Now we were very open about what's going on in our lifes. So I also told her when Chloe contacted me, and that we may be meeting again. At that point I thought chances of actually meeting her are rather low, and even then we might be cuddling but nothing else. That night it dawned on me that if she had similar feeling, then it would be a big asshole move to consider meeting with another woman who I might get sexual with. I wrote her that and asked to have a serious talk.  
She answered that I should meet Chloe, and that I'm stupid to even consider putting an online thing over something IRL. It feels like she's avoiding voice calls since then, as if to avoid \*the talk\*. Also the following day she seemed less cheerful. Then the day afterwards she was pretty much gone due to ""non-specific"" depression. Next day (today) we returned to our normal conversation, but it still feels off.

The meeting with Chloe is set up for tomorrow. I want to meet her, but think I have to make up my mind beforehand on whether I'd be ok with anything sexual happening. Or if this time I should be the one to decline if she indicates she wants to.  
In reality I'd want to first clear up things with Max before even seeing Chloe. But she's avoiding voice calls, and I think pushing it via text isn't the right thing to do. Delaying to see Max is also bad, since she does seem to need the emotional support, which was a big part of what we (mutually) did before.

Now I'm going back and forth between:

1. I'm reading way too much into the whole thing with Max. And should simply do what feels right with Chloe.
2. I'm destroying the possibility for true romance with Max. Make clear it's strictly platonic with Chloe, at least until the situation with Max is sorted out.

Sorry for making this long, probably confusing and vain :)  
Any advice from the collective?

65,rcsycw,1639088683,"What's the most considerate way to dump someone? I have limited experience and many concerns about logistics, details, etc.","Obviously there's no easy way to do it, but what's the \*best\* way to do it?  And in a way that is as mindful of the other persons feelings as possible?  I've been dating this person for about a month, and we've really only gone on 3 dates.  But we did have sex on two of them/spent the night and I can tell she really likes me, as she says things like ""I missed you"" when she sees me, and is VERY affectionate.  Which I think is really sweet, but I'm not quite at that level, and not sure if I will be any time soon - and after three times hanging out, I'm not entirely sure we have enough in common to proceed.

I have a loose idea of what to say - something along the lines of how I think she's wonderful, but I'm just not feeling the relationship chemistry that I know I should be at this point, and I'm very sorry.  But I guess I haven't fleshed it out yet, and don't know what is supposed precede this conversation.  

Like, I have concerns about whether I need to text her and say something like ""hey, can we talk?"" to sort of warn her... but anyone who gets a ""can we talk"" text should know what's coming; will that just stretch this out longer than it needs to and fill her with dread?  Do I schedule a time to hang out with her like normal - get coffee, a drink, etc - and then do it then?  This feels misleading, and I feel awful knowing she would think we're going to have an actual date and just get dumped (personally, I'd be REALLY pissed if someone did this to me - I could have made other plans!).  She'll also try to kiss me when she sees me, which will be awkward - do I kiss back, do I cut the kiss short, do I reject the advance?

I've mostly only ever been dumped myself in these situations (after 3-6 dates) via text, and frankly I sort of prefer it because it's so clean and easy even if it comes as a shock.  You look at your phone, get irked, send a ""thank you for letting me know, best of luck!"" message, don't have to have an awkward convo, and move the fuck on.  But that's just me, and I know other people don't appreciate that.  The only time I've dumped someone else I did it over the phone, and she cried and got sort of mad and then eventually hung up on me when I tried to explain myself.  That felt very bad!  I am of the opinion that people don't deserve to be flagellated just because they don't want to be dating a person anymore, though I understand the person being dumped could be experiencing a lot of disappointment - which I think this girl will be, unfortunately.

**Anyway, TLDR**:  Dumping is always hard, and it's always going to feel shitty for both parties in the moment of the dumping.  What's the g*entlest and most considerate* way to do it?  What are the appropriate logistics?  What's the *best way* you've ever been dumped?  Have you ever been dumped and thought, huh, that was not bad?  I have limited experiencing dumping and just want to do it correctly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcsycw/whats_the_most_considerate_way_to_dump_someone_i/
66,rct4je,1639089170,Is it pretty safe to assume I did something to offend her or is this standard?,"I went on a dinner date with a Hinge date girl last night. Good conversation, she seemed really into it and was really nice and said she planned on watching movies I recommended right after our date. She said it was getting close to her bedtime so I walked her to her car, we said our goodbyes and went home. Shortly after getting home, I messaged her ""Hope you got home ok and chose a movie by now."" No response. I figured she may have just put her phone away for the night and went to sleep. But then today still no reply. Ok I get maybe she wasn't interested and doesn't wanna go out again but I'd think she would at least let me know she got home ok and say thanks for dinner. The fact that she won't even do that makes me wonder if maybe she was offended by something I said, although I have no idea what it could have been. Is this a reasonable thing to assume or is the no response a normal whenever a girl just isn't super interested?

What's ironic is that I actually wasn't super into this girl before from the beginning but we had nice conversation on the app and she seemed very interested so I decided I'd give her a shot since I felt bad about turning her down.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rct4je/is_it_pretty_safe_to_assume_i_did_something_to/

The dates have all been great, lots of fun and laughs and a good intellectual connection imo so getting ghosted were both shocks and devastating to me.

This is the first time I've ever dated and I always hear men only want sex, I'm beginning to think that the women I connect with are the same way. I'm not interested in sex before marriage and would never kiss a woman before establishing a connection and commitment. I'm reading advice and it seems like most people say its impossible to form a relationship without escalating the sexual component.

68,rct7h9,1639089402,Is my coworker flirting with me?,"Is my coworker flirting with me?

I have this male coworker and I think he’s being flirty with me but I need your opinion.

This is a new job and we currently work from home and rarely go to the office. 

Why I’m not sure he’s flirting:
- He calls/messages me ONLY for work related stuff
- We never discuss personal stuff other than occasional small talk. I only know a few things about him.

Why I think he’s flirting with me:
- When we meet in person I actually feel this INTENSE energy and I get butterflies in my stomach. It’s weird because I don’t “like” him because I don’t know him as a person but when we’re around each other the attraction seems unreal. I get the feeling it’s both ways but I have no idea.
- He always tells me that my work is great 
- When we meet in the office he seems happy to see me and he gets really touchy - he gives me a handshake and then holds my hand a few more seconds he hi fives me multiple times (he does this to other people too but when we interact I feel that he does it frequently), sometimes when he passes by me he squeezes my shoulder upwards the neck area and smiles, often he winks as a “greeting”
- He gives me compliments like nice dress, nice hair etc
- He’s extremely friendly although we barely know each other
- When his girlfriend is around (yes he’s in a relationship) he acts VERY cold around me

Am I over interpreting this or is he actually flirting?

them: i knew you'd like that one \*winkey face\*

................ and youre supposed to say what back exactly........? there's almost nothing you can say without being all cutesy and inauthentic.

a better response would have been ""your personality type would seem to be one more drawn to documentaries""

then, this opens the door for me to say ""oh what made you say that"" or ""oh, i guess it seems obvious""

but to reply with these little cutesy ass statements with winky faces, meaning i now must reply back with another cutesy statment (what if i dont want to..?) just stonewalls the convo. 

i see it as going from logical, learning-about-each-other type of conversation, to a sarcastic one, thereby forcing the other to match wit with a sarcastic reply, which to me throws off the whole energy because what if they arent in that ""zone"" or mood yet, and what's there to say back to ""i thought you;d like something like that ;-)""

Hi, so little bit of background, I am a 19M(And non-binary) alternative person ; Goth if you will, but I have a wide range of different types of Gothic, Grunge, Vkei, etc depending on how I’m feeling. And I’ve always come across posts on Reddit, Insta, blue bird app, you name it memeing the hell out of how Basic looking guys are getting a chance with Alt girls. Not gonna lie I kinda found it funny whenever I see those kind of memes but then it hit me, “Wait- This might be actually true with me” Now of course it’s 100% not about the looks, it’s about the heart and the communication and last but never least personality! But I’ve realized that through out my dating history I’ve been with Nerdy quiet girls and I’ve been more drawn to Nerdy, Gamer, and kinda dorky people. The ones I’ve met have always taken a liking to me and I end up liking them back, especially when we’ve known each other for a long time and have a chaotically fun friendship or connection. Like- idk how else to explain it but they’re always just the vibe. Even if we end up not pursuing a romantic relationship together their company is very cool enough and they always know how to lighten the mood. I’m a gamer myself too and it was always fun whenever my past gamer nerd gfs invited me to have a play date with our friend groups or just between the two of us, we’d make some awesome memories through that connection. Even watching them play games is wholesome enough for me to spend time with them.  

TLDR; I discovered that gamer nerds are probably “my type” and I have a lot in common with people who play games as much as I do. I appreciate them a lot and I’m grateful for the ones I’ve met through out my dating life and even my friendship life :,3",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcu1oo/so_about_the_goth_x_gamer_stereotype/

After that, he got a girlfriend who he was together with for three years but they broke up about six months ago. I never pursued anything with him after that. Recently, though, he has said some things that make me think he has developed feelings for me. We don't see each other often as we go to college in different states, but we talk on the phone almost daily, and every time we do see each other he takes pictures of us. We are both currently having roommate issues and he brought up the prospect of us living together one day, and he asked if it would bother me if we had wildly different sleep schedules, and I said I wouldn't care if we didn't share a room. He seemed surprised by me thinking we would be in separate rooms, but I also live in a way more affordable area than he does and pay less for my own room and bathroom than he does for a shared room. Whenever we play Stardew Valley, we share a bed on the farm. He also recently told me how he would like to get married and have kids young, but to someone he has known for awhile. But, he also regularly talks about how much he misses his ex, and I feel like he must have been referring to her there. He did once refer to my hypothetical children as calling him ""Papa"" though. He talks to me about the girls he dates, but that he just doesn't click with them. Honestly, I think I just really want him to have a crush on me because I've had feelings for him for so long now that he's single I'll see anything as a sign he likes me.

The other point is that I got out of my long relationship (4 years, engagement) 1.5 months ago.

I'm aware he could possibly be taking them from a private social media profile but I guess I'll never know that. 

I really wasn't very concerned until I asked to have a video call and he said he ""I'm looking to meet you in the near future. I don't want to ruin my excitement of seeing you in person.""   I get that everyone likes to build up anticipation, but it seemed bizarre that he wasn't open to at least one call. Wouldn't he have wanted to see me too?

Shortly after that, he video called me out of nowhere for 12 seconds. The video panned from his face to his dog's, and then he hung up. No talking or anything. I was a bit taken aback by it but let it slide bc I know Japanese are generally shy, and I figured I would ask later on for an actual call. 

I've been sending him small videos of me talking and he has my IG so he he knows I'm real. But he doesn't have social media and so I can't really go off of anything to verify him. He pretty quickly started talking about how much he likes me and wants to be with me, and I know those are all potential indicators of being catfished. The reason I've been so conflicted is because a lot of these red flags also line up with Japanese dating culture, so it's hard for me to tell if he's legit or not. That's why I approached him again to have a video call. I told him we don't have to sit and have an hour long conversation, even just 5 minutes where I can see his face and see him talk is really all I need. I told him it's just for my safety and peace of mind. This happened two days ago. 
He immediately called me when I sent him that message (phone, not video) and we chatted for about 30 mins which was nice. At the end of the call, I asked if he would be okay with a video call in a couple days and he agreed. 

I thought we were good after that but holy moly, his attitude did a 180. His texting tone instantly changed, he went from being really cute and nice to very formal and distant. I messaged him asking if he was okay, and he insisted everything was fine. Obviously that wasn't true, but I wasn't going to try and push it out of him. 

Come today, he still sounds bland and disinterested. At this point I'm like dude, why are you still talking to me then. His attitude has started to make me feel uncomfortable and bad about myself even though I did nothing wrong. 

Here's the kicker...out of nowhere AGAIN he video calls me. I think ""oh awesome! We're gonna have this chat now and then we can move past it.""

Fucking nope. It's him showing me his dog lying against his leg. He doesn't speak a word, and then after 14 seconds he hangs up on me. I lost my shit after that. I firmly but politely told him what he did was rude, and also immature. I told him I understand he is shy, but at the end of the day, we are two adults on a dating app trying to get to know each other. I explained that asking for a video call is a very reasonable thing to do, and I am forced to come to the conclusion that he's a catfish if he's not willing to have one short call. I sent him this well thought out message and he just says ""you always ask to see my face which makes me uncomfortable.""

At this point, I don't know if I'm being catfished but I feel awful. It's hurtful and his attitude has become mean. It's confusing as well. I've read a ton on Japanese culture and even though they go about things differently there, I can't date someone that isn't willing to meet me halfway. It's not like I'm asking for regular video calls. I asked for ONE. 
Sorry I suppose there's no exact point to this post except that I'm venting! I'm grateful that this was only 3 weeks of talking to this guy and not 3 years. I cannot imagine what it feels like to be catfished for that long",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcvcgf/i_think_i_got_catfished_and_wow_is_it_hurtful/

92,rcvuhm,1639097216,"Are my gift ideas ""relationshipy"" enough?","As we all know the holidays are fast approaching. This year and I (F30) have the pleasure of getting gifts for my special someone (M28). We have been seeing each other for about 4 months and will be 5 months once the holiday rolls around. We are exclusive, taking things slow (at his request), so no labels or “I love you” yet and I am experienced relationship wise than him (I am his longest relationship).  

While talking about each other’s wants for the holidays, he expressed that when he mentioned to his mom what he was thinking of getting me for Christmas, or at least one of the things, she told him that it was not “relationshipy” enough. Apparently it was something I mentioned. 

That got me questioning and second guessing what I have in mind for him. It’s not anything he has mentioned, since I wouldn’t even know where to begin with what he has mentioned. For him, he suggested concert tickets, things for his house based on his Pinterest boards, and hand carved wooden games from an Etsy shop (he wants to collect all the games the guy makes). I know what bands he likes and concerts he wants to go to, but I don’t want to purchase tickets and the date not work out. As far as getting things for his house, I don’t want to get him something and it not be exactly what he wants. As for the wooden games, he has already purchased some for family. I don’t know if he is trying to collect them all within his family, or as a personal collection. In addition, I don’t know which ones he has or doesn’t have and which ones others may have already purchased for him.

Anyway, this is what I have come up with so far. To start off, I am getting him a Ravenclaw facemask because he’s a Harry Potter fan and that is the house he was sorted into on the official Harry Potter site. I was sorted into Hufflepuff and will be getting a matching one. For his birthday, he wanted to do a White House themed Escape Room, but showed up at the wrong location, and that location did not have that room (we did an alternate room that was entertaining). I was going to get him a gift certificate to the escape room (a value for up to 2 people) for him to use when he does the White House themed escape room and then he can invite anyone else he wants to join (the room can accommodate up to like 10 people I think). I am also thinking of getting him a Lego set that will make Boba Fett’s helmet since he is a huge Star Wars fan and Boba Fett is his favorite character. He likes to debate and have his views and beliefs challenged (mainly in politics), so I was thinking of getting him a game called Debatable that gives slightly less serious things to debate and discuss, such as: showering in the morning vs. sleeping after showering, Which is obviously better to be? Too hot or too cold, or Which is the superior piece of a brownie? An edge or a center. 

Another idea I had right before I typed this was to make a coupon book with coupons for some of his favorite things that I have noticed so far, like a coupon for one pizza since he really likes pizza and some other ones that could turn into cute date ideas.

Are these gifts “relationshipy” enough? Anything else you would suggest?

\*For suggestions he is a Harry Potter fan, Star Wars fan, gamer (League of Legends, Epic 7, etc. I am not a big gamer, lol!), loves Legos, likes pizza, pasta, steak, and ice cream, loves cats (has two), EDM, games that require strategy and/or luck (i.e. Backgammon).\*

There's this very fit girl at the gym that I've talked to before and figured nothing was there.

But the other day I was using a squat rack, there's 2 other empty ones near me and she comes up to ask if she can grab some plates.

At first I didn't think anything of it but then I realized she could have grabbed plates from anywhere but chose to ask me.

I thought maybe I was being delusional because I'm arrogant at times. But then she came back for more and we joked around a bit and I playfully punched her in the arm.

Then later I passed her and she smiled at me.

In person, we have prolonged eye contacts and we smile at each other everytime, she is touchy generally, I caught her staring at me several times and so did my friend, but we never had a long conversation that could establish a report, when I told her that, she said that she gets shy everytime she meets me, then she left me on delievered 6 days ago.
Yesterday, when we finally had the chance to talk face to face, she told me I seem off  ( not gonna lie, I react badly to mixed signals and still no answer) I told her I was having a tough week, then she told me to joing her friends lol, so my chance was pretty much missed or she did that on purpose avoiding having a conversation with me.

98,rcwcez,1639098750,"How can someone be pursing me so hard, now I’m the one who caught feelings?","29F 29M

And then he tells me he's dating in a weird way?

We’ve hooked up before, but ended up distance for nearly 2 years. He started talking to me when he was overseas just before Covid hit. He wants to come back to Melb (he got stuck in Perth) but doesnt know when he can. I know he wants to, but his band is in Perth and its easier to do shows from there and hes got family there. Covid/border situations don’t make it easy rn. He was meant to come to Melb a couple times this year, but borders closed/lockdowns and he couldnt.

I can’t stop thinking about how initially he wanted to see me. “We don’t have to catch up, but I would love to see you x” That was before that show got locked in (and I know that’s the truth, I work with his band)

It got very intense and sexual last year, he didnt even start it for the first few months, it felt respectful. But I was still holding back going too deep talking. It came to a tipping point in Jan where I questioned his intentions, but I honestly thought I revealed feelings at that point. I thought he might run. Or if he had a bad response, I was gonna end it there.

He ended up going “You have to talk to me more!” I said “Woah ok, I thought it was just sex? But I can talk more” Since he knew I was going thru shit too (separate to covid) he said stuff like “Are you ACTUALLY doing ok?” “Were you crying this morning?” He seemed genuinely concerned.

Saying shit like “I feel like this has brought us closer” (what does that even mean if you don’t want anything?)

“I think you’re wonderful, I obviously wasn’t treating you amazingly”

Why is he pushing to connect so much, finding all these things in common, telling me when he’s sad too. He compliments me like crazy, which has been consistent the whole time. I moved into my own place this year and he was like “Do you like it or is it lonely” You don’t get to ask me if I’m lonely if you don’t really want anything😭

But then...he tells me this

“I just downloaded Bumble!!No matches and it’s hitting me in the feels hahahaWho knew it could hurt your feelings 😂😂”

The wishful thinker in me was thinking maybe he’s saying he doesn’t want to date cause he’s thinking of me instead. I doubt it. Otherwise he would have said it.

I just said, “haha really, I kinda hate the apps”

Then a bit later “I would swipe you”

He goes “Haha that’s so cute of you to say!!”

That doesn’t sound like a good response, and I shouldn’t have even boosted him like that??

These interests are things that help me feel like myself. There’s a reason I was guarding them last year, I wasn’t sure what he wanted anything more. This year I thought it was safe to let my walls down. Now I associate these things with him, which I was trying to avoid.

You can’t get the emotional stuff from me without the strings. Why do they do that :(

If he wants to bond over common interests, he can stick to his friends he’s not sexual with.

I know this doesn’t make sense, cause of course we are allowed to see other people if we can’t be there in person. But why tell me like that? It’s given we can be dating, but is that weird? It feels like he’s setting some kind of standard to make sure it's not gonna be anything with us and it’s really upset me now.

I need to let go of this. I just feel fucking stupid for thinking we were connecting, for thinking something might be building.

I really wanted to have the next conversation in person, cause you cant REALLY tell over text anyway. I want to know what Im like too in person. But it's been too many times not knowing when that will happen.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcwcez/how_can_someone_be_pursing_me_so_hard_now_im_the/
