But some days ago we were at a family gathering with my family and my siblings having dinner together and the topic of the type of noses that men have came up, and everyone was talking about what kind of nose is ugly or nice or whatever, and they started talking about the nose of one of my siblings (M24), and in the middle of the conversation my GF said something along the lines of I like your kind of nose, that way looks more masculine and my brothers GF laughed at me and said something like ""lol she thinks youre femenine"" and I laughed it off and a few minutes later my GF looked at me and quietly said I like your nose, its pretty, like she realised that she made an unconfortable moment because of her comment

Mind you, in this conversation there was both my parents, and both my siblings (both male and older than me) with their respective GFs, and to clarify, my GF have never cheated (in any way) or even talked to another guy in a suspicious way and never told nothing like that before to anyone of my siblings or other people (im 10000% sure, its literally impossible for this to happen, i say this because ive been noticing that in most comments some people jump inmediately to this conclusion but in this case is simply not possible)

Im overthinking this and maybe for some of you may sound ridiculous to worry about something like this, but this is making me think that maybe she doesnt find me masculine? But that is weird too because I do everything that society expects for me as a male (except some things like being open to her, example: venting some of my problems to her (and she likes that) or even cry sometimes which i know doesnt bother her either or other small things like wearing pink tshirts or facemasks because i dont really care and i kind of like pink tshirts and I know she doesnt care about me wearing pink at all), I drive her everywhere, pay for her food when i invite her, im average height but big, and i dont wanna sound like a pretencious fucker but i have taught her things, and i read and study a lot, im responsible when going out or drinking, and we are compatible with most of this stuff, she likes and accept the way i am, and we agree in most political topics, except for me being a little more openminded in some topics

F19 M21 We weren’t together long but I ended up falling in love with him. We ended things as he was moving and long distance didn’t seem like it would work. We both agreed although I didn’t want it to end. It was more of his decision. I was so heartbroken still kinda healing from this every time I think I’m completely healed he would message me trying to flirt or responding to my Instagram posts. I would reply then he’d ghost me? So I just ignore him now and mentally I’m completely over him. He doesn’t even message me happy New Years or anything. When I post a pic he would send it to me and say something like “Marry me??”. I didn’t responded then he messages me asking how I am. Why’s he doing this? We agreed to be friends, friends don’t flirt or ghost. I’m so confused. He’s never had a girlfriend before me so I’m thinking he doesn’t know how relationships work😂.

Just curious what people think is the winning attire to really impress the date.

I'm thinking of wearing smart black suit shoes, black socks, dark blue stonewashed jeans, black belt and a smart long-sleeve white shirt with the sleeves rolled up slightly and with an open collar.

Deodorant: Paco Rabanne 1 Million

Eu De Toilette: King of Seduction (Antonio Banderas)

I'm also quite well groomed.

The clothing seems like a nice smart casual option but wondered what you ladies and gents think?

Is it too casual?

Do I need to change anything to make it pop?

I'm M20 and there is that girl in my university i think is cool. I don't know if i like her yet, but we're on a project together so I'm gonna get to know her either way.

Now because of lockdown we had never actually met before so a few weeks ago i ""asked her out"" just to get to know her. I didn't think of it as a date, since like i said we're currently project partners.

Anyway, we were totally on the same page and agreed to meet again to work on our project. That would've been tomorrow, and i had planned to ask her on a real ""date"" once we were done with this project and didn't have any obligations towards one another. Anyway I asked it tomorrow was still on and she told me that she had forgotten we'd made plans, but she would be able to come the day after tomorrow. 

This can happen, of course, but it still bugs me. I value my time alot and i don't like it when people disregard that. And even though i really like what I know of her so far, this is a personality treat I can not tolerate. When we first met she postponed too, for about an hour.

Now how should I handle this? 

 &gt;Should i stay cool and tell her that the next day is also good

&gt;Should i tell her how i feel and that i don't like it if my time and effort isn't valued? But accept

&gt;Should i just tell her nevermind and finish the project on my own without her help (she'd still have to do her part on her own) 

&gt;Anything else?

I’ve made some progress this last year in my social skills (even while taking online classes) and have better confidence so I’m really working on getting experience. Here’s a story of my first real attempt to get close to a girl.

I [M22] met this girl [F20] online last March who goes to the same University as me. We chatted online for a month and a bit. I somehow ended up promising her cheesecake during finals (She said I owe her some, can’t remember the context lol) and eventually we got busy and didnt speak for the rest of the summer.

Just before we went back to in-person classes in September she messaged me and we started talking again. We talked about meeting up and she suggested catching a movie, me being scared I didnt follow up on it. We tried meeting up but things kept coming up (She was busy, I had a bunch of stuff going on with classes and friends drama). Eventually we ended up meeting in October, albeit for like 2 minutes since she had to go home.

The following week we got together and roasted marshmellows at the school’s firepits, and then went for coffee. We sat and chatted for maybe an hour in the cafe and she told me how she loved being able to talk to someone here in our mothertongue. I made her laugh, and her smile was seared into my memory. I walked her to class and we said goodbye.

We talked for a little bit and then in another couple weeks we ended up getting coffee again. I met her and her friend and she and I went for coffee. We talked and talked for an hour till she had class and we said our goodbyes. I had so many questions I wanted to ask her, but I didnt want to come off too intensely.

Fast forward to the end of November, I remembered that I “owe her cheesecake” and ask what her favourite flavour is. Oreo. I think about it, maybe its time I ask her out. I’ll take her for a movie like she suggested way back then, and then a nice Cafe for food n cheesecake.

I read a post her about someone making cheesecake for someone, and the idea floated into my mind. I asked for suggestions for Cheesecake places from two of my female friends, and with one of them jokingly said I should just bake it myself. My friend immediately pushed me to do it, saying it was a cute gesture and my other friend approved. I was a bit unsure if it would be weird or not but they pushed me to try it and gave me recipes.

The cheesecake. I hadn’t baked cookies for years, and never tried making cheesecake. So, I decided to make mini cheesecakes instead since they’re easier. I found a couple recipes, shopped for the ingredients and attempted to make mini oreo cheesecakes. 

She knew I was bringing her cheesecake, and the next day I brough a box with me to school. I was nervous, based on her reaction I was prepared to ask her out. For the first time in years I found someone I genuinely attracted to on multiple levels. I got a haircut, dressed up decently and drove to school with the cheesecakes in tow.

I attended my first class, letting the cakes soften after chilling overnight. Afterwards we met up and I gave her the box. She looked at them and was surprised. She proceeded to eat all 5 of them over the next 3 hours as we sat and talked about a myriad of things. I felt amazing, and was so ready to ask her out.

We we’re talking about something, and as she goes on while I listen to her, she mentions “and my boyfriend back home…”

I’m lucky I was wearing a mask, as I couldn’t hide my reaction. I immediately fixed my expression and continued talking and laughing, though I was shocked. Eventually we finished up and she walked me to see my other friend before she went to class.

I took the last couple of cheesecakes to my car and on my way I slipped and fell. Dropping the last two I had after giving some to my other friends. I then went to my car, and felt heartbroken. I broke down and cried for an hour until I steeled myself to carry on functioning and study for my finals.

She thanked me the next day, but I couldn’t help feel empty and depressed for the next three weeks. Eventually I came to a breaking point in my self worth and made the decision to improve myself whatever way possible. I knew that I would never be happy until I tried working on the things I can change about myself. 

And now here I am. We talked every one in awhile, but I have difficulty talking to her. I really do like her and want to stay connected but knowing she’s taken I don’t think I can bare being “just friends”.

The experience changed me fundamentally and has motivated me to give a shot at self improvement and self love.

tl;dr

For the first time in a long while I put mysef out there and met someone I connected with on multiple levels. I baked her favourite type of cheesecake and felt heartbroken after learning she already has someone. My overly emotional response to this signalled something is really wrong emotionally and the experience has pushed me to want to improve and love myself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1145448,public,self,Cheesecake: A Story of Putting Myself Out There,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rujigd/cheesecake_a_story_of_putting_myself_out_there/,no_ads,0.0,

Hello. I'll try to make this brief.

I took a step back from dating years ago, but about two months ago, I met a beautiful woman who I really connect with and we have a lot in common. We're both into fitness, our Christian faith, and we both live very independent lifestyles. We also both like to volunteer in the same volunteer group. We have a common friend circle. Our birthdays are only four months apart (I'm older). I think she's very sweet, kind, and mature. She comments about being inspired by my fitness and weight loss journey.

I like our conversations, and to be honest, I'm starting to wonder if we're running out of things in common. I'm trying to avoid developing feelings that are too strong too fast since I don't want to come across as desperate and needy. I'm not even looking for a relationship right now. **I'm just interested in getting to know her better.**

I've had some very bad experiences with dating in the past and felt like I was taken advantage of and not doing enough to improve my own life.

Anyways, this woman **never told me the specifics of her past and childhood**, but she told me she suffers with C-PTSD and had to get therapy because of past experiences. It sounded almost exactly like therapy and counseling I got two years ago. I had a pretty bad childhood myself, via school. She also just got surgery back in the last week of November and it will take her eight weeks to recover.

Clearly, I don't know the details but I have a very strong suspicion that she was abused in her childhood and teen years (possibly even sexually abused). She also told me she does not date due to trust issues arising from her past.

So, any advice before I pursue this further? All I'm interested in right now is getting to know her better but it seems like both of us have huge trust issues and walls that are six inches thick. If anything were to happen, great. If we date for a while and it ends, I know we'll end amicably.

I've always preferred talking face to face, which covid kinda ruined, so it's not exactly easy for me to meet new people online. I get bad vibes from social apps and there's just too many creepy men on the internet. I'm fine not using them, but I feel like I come off as untrustworthy when I tell guys I don't have insta or that I'm just not really into using my phone all the time.

We have met up just the once. She has told me she’s busy during the holidays which I don’t doubt as the texts are much more frequent when she’s at college. She usually visits families during the holidays. 

Our date was nice. She was touching my hands and complimenting me. However, I have noticed that she hasn’t said much in regards to our date and I have only had a few short exchanges with her through text. She did remind me that she’s busy and that she can’t wait to talk to me “tomorrow”. Today is “tomorrow” and she’s watching Netflix and not actually talking to me and leaving me on read (note: I don’t double text her. I only respond when she does and don’t act clingy). She sends me videos via tiktok but doesn’t read my messages for hours on end or even until the next day. 

I would also like to note that I did pay for both of our meals and a few items she wanted when we passed the shopping mall because she asked if I could pay for it as she had no money. I felt bad saying no. I’m kinda getting the feeling she might not like me as much and probably is interested in what I have to offer superficially? 

Overall, she is sweet and nice but I guess getting Reddit’s judgement of this would provide some clarity on what this is exactly.

I'm open to spending some money on dating sites (like match, eharmony, etc.) to find more of the motivated people, but am hesitant because I've never spent money on them before.

during the end of 2019 i joined the gym  to work on my self, after covid it i got into freelancing and helping other students in their coursework and exams and made good money, o chamged my hairstlye and clothing style to something im comfortable and confident in, started learning to play guitar in mid 2020,

Today i use my instagram as a way to give people an idea aboit myself, im. able to play thr guitar really well, im gonna graduate this year with a degree in engineering, and i made great progress physically and mentally.

What i tried, i asked out alot of the girls i was attracted to and connected with in 2021, i asked out girls from engineering classes, i asked oit girls that i went with during highschool, i tried approaching a cute girl at a coffeeshop, a random girl from a party that i made eye contact with, i even tried my chances with a girl that also plays the guitar, all led to the same result, some excuse as to why they ""can't hang out"".

I am M32 and the girls i am dating is 26..we met on bumble 2 weeks ago swiped and matched..we had a good chat and it kept on going for 2-3 hours decided we should totally go out.So we went on a coffee date next day..we liked each other and she looked beautiful and cute much better than her pictures and she told me the same..texted after date and i asked if she wants to meet again.

Date 2 i took her out for dinner and after spending time eating and having conversations about life and all..we went back to my car and I kissed her..somehow the kisses didn’t stop and we had a full make out session for an hour i dropped her home and said goodbye.

Date 3 we went for a movie i was so totally into the movie but couldn’t keep my hands of her and we made out and touched each other while i tried to semi focus on the movie after the movie we ate some street food and said goodbye.

Date 4 This happened 2 days after the movie..I had a busy day but decided to invite her for dinner but she said she will grab something for me on her way.she got me and her sandwiches we ate and chilled and later on had the most intense sex session i have ever had it was just incredible..we cuddled after talked about life stuff.

All of this happened in the last 2 weeks and somehow we cannot stop texting or chatting with each other and she wants to hangout again soon but i am occupied with work.

We are both looking for a serious relationship.she broke off her engagement one year ago and have stayed away from dating she only went out with one other guy before she matched with me.

Now i don’t know whats going on but she just understands me,we both have same sense of humour and like same type of stuff in general when it comes to movies and tv shows..somehow i feel like i have started developing feelings for her and like her very much.

Is this normal ?? like we just met how come i can like her so much and she also likes me too??

I understand if you get to know someone and then you say ehhhh I am not into this person and end it, or a match and never respond. But to message for a day or 2 and have semi fluid conversation and start to get to know someone and then ghost when you are the one that said you wanted a good communicator is just rude.  

I use to be the type of texter who would respond within moments of getting a message as that's how I am with friends and anyone outside of dating apps etc. But I have been told by friends that are women and been told on reddit that I shouldn't be so responsive in the dating world as it makes me seem desperate. Additionally I have been told if I haven't gotten a response in several days then to take the hint and let that match go. so I have learned to limit myself and regulate how quickly I respond because that's what I have been told.

But that seems to be that isn't the answer either it just seems that if they are searching for a ""good communicator"" then it is them who is not and its just a red flag.

Also I want to add that if you say that you ""never respond"" or ""reply in your head and never hit send"" then I am immediately going to swipe left.

I'm(32m) very insecure and an overthinker. I've been open about this with the girl (26) I've been dating. We've had extremely long talks and long-form text conversations. And she seemed to like me because of these. She's the first person I've kissed and been physically intimate with (which I wasn't expecting or mentally prepared for at the time). I'm also a virgin still and only have a few months of total dating experience. I really like her and want to keep this healthy and long-term.


I think about her all the time, but I don't know what love is or if it's an obsession or an attachment thing. A friend told me this isn't an actual relationship yet, so I need to chill out and just keep suppressing all these feelings so I don't come off as needy and desperate. But it feels like I'm trying to kill my feelings.

I felt we had amazing chemistry on the first 3 dates. I just went on my 4th date yesterday morning and I felt I was quite boring since we didn't have a chance to sit for a long chat. I also asked I question that she already answered previously, which I think she noticed,  just to make small talk. I also made a disgusting comment/joke during the date.  I'm terrible at small talk but have been trying to push texting to touch base every day even though she said she enjoyed having long conversations instead. I also accidentally phrased a question via text with a negative vibe which she read but didn't respond to. I really want to apologize for these things at the moment, but I feel this could just be overthinking, and bringing it up would indicate more of this behavior in the future and I would come off as annoying.

After the third we just kinda... Chilled in my bed, hung out, cuddled, talked for a couple hours... She fiddled with my beard, kissed me, all that sappy stuff. After the whole covid dry time, it was incredible, and I just can't get it out of my mind, I want to spend as much time as possible with her. I'm scared I'm catching feelings, and I don't know what to do.

Since we've only been on three dates I don't know if she's dating several guys at once or what her intentions are. I definitely wanna keep nurturing this. I like her a lot, but the 3rd date feels so early to try and advance things and I'm scared doing so will push her away. On the other hand I'm scared that not trying to advance things gives a window to one of the other guys that she might or might not be dating to take that step before me.

I'm reading way the fuck too deep into things now, we celebrated new years apart since we had plans in place since long before we met, so of course my mind is telling me she met an ex or someone new at her party. We've texted briefly roughly every 2 days or so between dates, I've been trying to ramp it up a bit, but she's still a very inactive texter, which she did tell me in person. My gut tells me that's a bullshit excuse, and that she's just not that interested, but on the other hand she's extremely into it during our dates, asking questions about my life, getting into deeper topics etc etc, haven't had a single weird silence with her so far, we always find things to talk about. It's a really goddamn weird feeling to me since I'm usually able to be pretty straight forward and blunt, but I really don't wanna fuck this one up. She's gorgerous, smart, shares so many interests while also having just enough differences for us to complete eachother and keep things interesting, I fuck this up and I have to deal with a ""the one that got away"" to keep me awake at night.

Do I take the plunge and just tell her I felt something really special when we laid there, ask her what kinda intentions she has for our dating, try to find out if the feelings are mutual or if I'm more of a fwb to her?

I've been fighting for the marriage for the last year and it has felt like I've been the only one who gives a damn for pretty much the whole time. I love this woman with all my heart, and this whole long drawn out process has had some pretty serious damaging effects on my overall well-being... I don't sleep for shit, I've lost a ton of weight (always been thin but anymore I'm straight up skinny), and my emotional health is... let's say shaky, at best. The kicker in all this is that, while she's certainly gung-ho about ending the relationship, she's been in exactly zero rush to actually make any progress in terms of packing, finding a new place, and giving either of us the chance to move on with our lives. I'm a self-employed woodworker, by the way. My shop is in our garage and frankly to hell with packing it up and moving it because of a decision she'smaking, and our two roommates are effectively ""my friends not hers"" in that they would both much rather I be the one to stay here than her - to the extent that they would find a different residence if I were to move out. This all means that I have no way of escaping what's happening in all this... I'm steadily deteriorating mentally more and more each passing day. How do I impart to her the importance of actual separation in a timely manner? And is there a way to increase the odds of her actually caring? I don't want to end up hating the woman I've loved for this long and planned to spend my life with, but the mounting resentment is getting exceedingly difficult to ignore...
Part 2] This bit will probably be seen as a much more shallow issue, but it's also really wearing on me... we haven't had any (and I do mean ANY) intimacy in 6 months. No sex, no making out, no hand holding, any attempts I make at flirting or being at all physically or emotionally intimate have been blatantly ignored at best and ridiculed or snapped at at worst. I (somewhat) adhere to the school of thought pertaining to love languages, and physicality is very much my primary. I feel like I'm starving after this long with no intimacy, particularly in the physical sense, and I'm kinda losing my shit about it... I'm not generally big on the whole one night stand concept as it feels very surface level-y and I crave a much deeper experience than just throwing a few thrusts and then rolling over to pass out. I absolutely love foreplay, and I'm very much one to spend as much time as is allowed exploring and pleasing my partner's body. But at this point, after this long, I have been thinking about it just to get the experience of connecting with another person again. I can't shake the thought of a girl with a nice bum sitting on my face for an unreasonable amount of time (ha) and just... having that feeling again. My wife and I used to have what I considered the perfect sex life. No judgment, very open, very communicative and honest, I've always been much more of a giver but that was always ok cause it's kinda my thing. I got off in getting her off, if that makes sense. This last year there was a steady decline up until the last half of 2021, at which point it completely ended. I've been trying everything I can think of to find that spark again with her but she's been incredibly resistant and I've obviously had no luck. So I guess my question is... How do I put myself out there again? And is what I just described as far as my sexual predilection going to be seen as too much? I'm not necessarily a bad looking guy, I don't think, but I'm a bit awkward and often have a hard time with casual small talk in an attempt to forge a hook-up sort of interaction. How can I go about this in a way that won't put women off and/or leave me feeling gross and hating myself for not being genuine?

P.S. There are obviously a lot of details in and around this development that I'm leaving out here.

So expressive on what it meant to him. Now we message everyday. He said he keeps everything we talk about private so I don't get embarrassed to our friends... I recently mentioned I was single and changed my picture on discord to my face. He mentioned I looked good. We talk about so much about ourselves. He says subtle things like if we went skiing he would never leave me alone. Or how we should take a trip together. But nothing feels definitive. It's not aggressively flirting...

 I don't know if he's just being nice to me. My sister said a month ago he mentioned a GF and all this is him being a good friend. But he's been more talkative the last month, he wanted to play video games with just me. Messages me the next day saying I hope I'm having a good day. It feels so flirty but not direct. So I don't know what to do. I don't wanna flirt more directly if he has a GF. I don't want to ruin this amazing bond by telling him how I feel if he's not interested.

Backstory: I grew up in abject poverty to an alcoholic and abusive father who beat my mother, (didn’t really know about financial literacy - no good examples growing up) worked right out high school and through very hard work I was able to get a full scholarship and go to college and get my degree. But met my ex husband at college (who was controlling, insecure, financially abusive, made me give up wanting to work to be a stay at home wife who cooked and cleaned for him - I hated it, spent way more than we had and ran up so much debt. I was left with it after I couldn’t take it anymore and asked for a divorce - spoiler; he cleaned out what little savings I kept and took my dog and everything I had while I was out, and would only sign the divorce papers if I agreed to give up trying to get my my dog back, the only thing I wanted back). 

I worked hard for a year straight paying off his debt (didn’t want him to ruin my credit as I was joint and since he refused to pay it). Hated debt way before him but after that I learned more about being financially secure and became debt free. I’m thankful I have a wonderful job (kept the job my ex husband wanted me to leave yet again for him, did this twice for him) that pays me very well. Because of this I’m cautious about who I date. I’ve only dated one guy seriously for a year after it, we were very compatible in our thinking and a lot of ways, ended things as he’s avoidant (also learned about attachment theory after him). I’ve been thinking about getting back into dating. 

Which leads to my question. I’ve had a few coffee dates and talked to a few guys, but I’ve found they have a lot of debt, don’t care about being financially responsible, they have a job but seem complacent about how their life is. That’s fine for them and I’m not judging. This just throws up some red flags for me. My question is, how would you feel when dating when you meet people like this and seem to be okay with how their life is? Should I let them know their reasons of how their life is as to why I don’t want to pursue things? Is that wrong, should I be diplomatic?

Here’s what I sent him:

“Hi, Good morning :)
I hope you’re having a good first day at work! I just wanted to reach out to you and apologize. I had a really good time yesterday—and the last few days—with you, but I just felt really bad about yesterday. I was embarrassed about the fact that I couldn’t get you off. I’m not really experienced in stuff like that outside of occasionally watching porn. So I overreacted, felt weird about it, and unfollowed you, which was stupid and immature. I just wanted to say I’m sorry, and that I didn’t mean to make things confusing if I did. You’re a great guy, and I’d love to keep talking if you’re open to it. Or if you want to be friends or acquaintances or Instagram friends...lol. I’m open to any of it. I wish you a great first day at work and rest of the week! I wish you best if we just remain friends or acquaintances. Happy Sunday! :)”

His response:
“Lol yeah no worries, that’s completely up to you.”
“I’m still down for whatever and trust me I always have trouble getting off. With anyone so don’t think that was because of anything you did”

I’ve been dating the same girl for almost two years now (we are in our 20’s, have talked about being together long term, etc.). She had dated a guy previously who was a serious jerk to her, and occasionally he requests to follow her on social media and even dm’s her.

I always usually let it go because I know he really hurt her and it still effects her. The last time he did it was over the summer but it wasn’t a big deal. Today, he did it again and she explained that she wanted to let him follow her so he could see her resent post and “how hot she still is”. I told her I thought that was weird and it made me uncomfortable, as we’ve been together for so long, not sure why she still even really cares about him and that’s how it seems to me when she still says things like this about him. 
I tried to explain this to her but now she is sad/upset with me and won’t talk to me about it.
