29,raxjm3,1638878173,Cutting things off over allowing oneself to be vulnerable,"I find myself in a unique position where my career is built upon supporting very vulnerable individuals. I like to be the one who these individuals can entrust with their care and know that I’ll do my best by them. In my own life, I always hold my cards close and am not one to ask for help or support. This has been the biggest burden to my dating life, as as soon as I begin to develop feelings for someone but suspect (sometimes falsely) that the other person doesn’t feel the same - my immediate response is cut them off before having my suspicions confirmed or allowing myself to be in a position where I could become hurt emotionally. I try my best to be kind and do good by people, but I don’t hold the expectation that this will be reciprocated. This has meant that I don’t get very far when dating, only if I’m seeing someone who is seeking that supportive presence from me (due to their own unresolved issues) and then things get intense quickly and they’re very invested early on (so I don’t have to be vulnerable). Issues always arise later on with the later due to them having reservations about commitment, other drama, baggage, etc. I should add that I’m very low drama and essentially baggage free. I wonder if anyone else who goes through the same process of cutting things off rather than taking the risk of being hurt has ever managed to get past this, and strategies (beyond therapy) that have helped?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/raxjm3/cutting_things_off_over_allowing_oneself_to_be/

32,razh46,1638884526,Knowing when to deepen a relationship,"I've been dating a guy for about 6 weeks now (both early 30s) and I'm really struggling with knowing when to get ""real"", so to speak. I've only had one relationship in the past (very toxic, borderline abusive, cheated on me, etc.) and that was many years ago. Since then, it's rare that I even get past a second date. So this is all very new to me. 

I think so far I have presented myself as very chill, cool, agreeable, and unbothered. He's a wonderful guy; haven't seen any red flags. There have been a couple of things I've brought up that I'd like him to do differently, communication-wise, but I was able to say it in a pretty light-hearted way and it was no big deal. So it's been smooth sailing, at least on the surface. 

But UNDER the surface, I'm a total wreck. I'm incredibly anxious, scared, and resentful for no reason at all. If he mentions a female friend I get the familiar pang of discomfort. I'm always overanalyzing his text messages to see if the tone is ""off"". When we're together and there's a quiet moment (there's plenty because we're both pretty quiet people), I wonder if he's mad at me. 

We hooked up once (no intercourse) and I was an absolute basketcase the next day. He'd been completely respectful, a great host, and we had a lot of fun, but I was so embarrassed by the intimacy and vulnerability of it all and afraid he'd never speak to me again. I even considered that maybe I should never speak to HIM again! I was like, ""this is just too much and I can't handle it.""

So, with all of that anxiety in mind, I'm really having trouble with how to proceed here. Sure, I could keep just ""letting it flow"". BUT, at some point soon I will need to tell him that I'm not dating other people and ask where he's at with that. It's getting to the point where sex seems like the next logical step, and of course I want to, but I don't want to have sex with him unless we're dating exclusively. I want to tell him that I'm absolutely terrified and that dating brings out all of the worst parts of me and that I'm really struggling to just act normal and not sabotage or run away. I want to tell him that this is because I've had terrible experiences with men and I'm sitting here waiting for the bad things to happen because they always do. I just don't know how to bring any of this up, and when. Is it too early for him to know how crazy I really am? Where do you draw the line between healthy communication and trauma-dumping? How in the WORLD do I tell him that I want him to stop dating other people (if he is; I don't know, of course). I have an incredibly hard time expressing my feelings to people and every time I think I want to bring up something serious, I just can't get the words out. When I do say something vulnerable, I feel embarrassed about it later, even when it's received well. I'm a mess!! My advice from my sister was to ""stop being so available and make sure he knows you have other options so he has to lock it down"". I'm pretty incapable of playing games like that so I don't plan on taking her advice, but then again, she managed to get married so maybe she knows what she's talking about, LOL.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/razh46/knowing_when_to_deepen_a_relationship/

34,rb088v,1638886841,Tips for boosting confidence and self-worth getting back into the game?,"Previous relationship ended about 9 months ago (broke up in Feb 2021). I \[30M\] suffered from lack of self-worth and dateability from the latter parts of the relationship and the breakup.

Major contributor to this downfall was our lack of intimacy. We slept on the same bed for a total of about a week in our 1.5 year relationship. Sex seemed like a chore for her and most of my advances were rejected. This has left me with a feeling of being ugly and not worthy of intimacy,

Since then, I've hit the gym, gotten into a better shape, eating healthy. I've also worked on my mental health, especially on my desperation when it comes to pleasing women. I have recognized my tendency to fall head over heels for a woman and doing anything to make her happy, letting go of any personal boundaries.

I would like to believe that I'm not that bad a guy to date, but my feelings don't seem to agree with it. In terms of other stats; I'm 30, Asian, 170 cm (5' 7""),  have a PhD in a STEM field, have a well paying job, in good shape and am considered generally above average looking. However, I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm not good enough for a woman to want to be intimate with me.

Anyway, now I really want to kiss him, but our dates are dinner dates (not much else to do with covid restrictions). Once we finish eating, masks are legally mandatory.

Despite this, I hate talking about my job to others when I’m not on the clock because I simply see it as a job and not something to be praised to a comical degree. I don’t want to talk about the worst call I’ve ever been on, I hate the hero worship, and I *loath* hearing “thank you for your service”. Because of this, whenever I see someone’s interest pique whenever I mention my job, my interest in them nosedives, both as a potential partner and even as a potential friend.

On the other side of the coin; I spend a lot of my time cosplaying (if my username wasn’t enough of an indicator). Unfortunately, finding people who share this interest outside of conventions has been much less than successful. In fact, it often feels like people are put off by the knowledge that I cosplay as a hobby.

71,rbhtkd,1638935114,Personal style and deal breakers?,"I’ve been on 5 dates with a guy and he’s great. He’s attractive, funny, we share a lot of interests. The only problem is I really can’t stand his hairstyle. It’s unflattering and the more I see him, the more it’s starting to bug me. He’s becoming less attractive and sliding into potential-friend territory. I made a subtle comment about it and he seemed to brush it off. I hate to say it but this could be a deal breaker for me. He could very easily cut it but I don’t want to be that person who forces him to change. Especially if he likes it that way.

Can something as simple as a hairstyle be a deal breaker?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/rbhtkd/personal_style_and_deal_breakers/
72,rbixtf,1638938646,Why did he unmatch after our date? Was it just an accident? And is there any way I can find him?,"So I (39F) matched with a guy (37M) on Bumble about a week and a half ago.  He was great, and we chatted pretty much every day for about a week. We had a lot of shared interests like psychology, languages, cultures, and current events.  We talked about a lot of different things and he seemed very funny, smart, and engaging.  He was respectful and seemed really kind.  

We agreed to go out on Friday night and I picked a restaurant that we had discussed and that I thought we.would both like.  The date started out a little awkward, since the restaurant seated us separately and we had to find each other.  He also hated the restaurant, which I found sort of cute and endearing, since he’s from the same country as the cuisine that the restaurant serves.  We warmed up pretty quickly and ended up talking for about an hour after we finished our food. After the date, we both said that we had a good time and enjoyed the conversation.  A couple of times during the date, I mentioned possible activities that we should do next time. I later realized that I was the only one doing that, and he didn’t really talk about any future activities, but that’s not unusual for me because I am a very chatty person. Anyway, he dropped me off at my place and I told him again how much I enjoyed meeting him and that I had a great time. I hadn’t given him my phone number yet so I told him I would put my phone number in the chat.  I went upstairs and I fell asleep before I had the chance to put my number in the chat. When I woke up, I realize that he had already ended the chat!  I am not sure, but I remember when I told him that I would put my number in the chat, he repeated “in the chat” and he sounded super surprised. I later realized that in the chat sounds a lot like “end the chat”.  Did he think I was asking him to end the chat? Maybe I am reading too much into this and he just wasn’t interested in me for some reason. We didn’t exchange numbers during all of the chatting, which was probably stupid, so now I can’t contact him directly.  I feel terrible, and I’ve been trying to think of ways that I can find him again, preferably without appearing to be creepy.  I tried re-creating my profile on Bumble hoping that I could possibly rematch with him, and I saw his profile and swiped right, but either he didn’t swipe right for me or he hasn’t been on the app because we have not matched.  What is your take on the situation? Why do you think he unmatched? And do you think there’s any hope that I will ever find him again? I live in a major metropolitan area in the US, so the odds that we run into each other again randomly are slim.  Any suggestions you can offer are greatly appreciated.

75,rbk6gj,1638942874,For those of you who send selfies unprompted what is the end goal?,"Let me set the stage. Person A and B match on Bumble. You exchange a few good messages, and decide to take it off the app.  The conversation is flowing with lulls for work hours, it’s day 2 of having each other’s number. At the end of the day , person B completely without any requests or any hints or any suggestions sends a selfie of themselves at the end of their work day. And now person A Isn’t sure how to respond because they are an overanalyzer and the only 3 things they can think of

1) this person is insecure and needs constant validation , so validation is the the goal 
2) this person is so full of themselves that they think person A wants to see a work selfie from someone they have , spoken to for two days and haven’t even met in which case validation is the goal 
3) this person wants person A to reciprocate with selfies but doesn’t want to outright ask because pre meeting and chatting that comes off gross, so receiving a selfie is the goal 

So none of those are positive interpretations. Therefore I ask you the people of DOT, so I can understand what would prompt someone to do this in this way pre meeting , right in the early stages of getting to know each other.

I fully leave room for the fact that i have trauma from being a validation seeker in my early and somewhat mid 20s. It is something I worked hard on improving, so to potentially see others reflect that trait back at me upsets me and is a turn off. I also leave room that I am projecting motives and goals hence the  question. 

PS - I love getting and sending selfies to people I have actual established bonds with, so it’s not an opposition to selfies, more the timing of them.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/rbk6gj/for_those_of_you_who_send_selfies_unprompted_what/

85,rbrilk,1638970591,Breaking up over text acceptable after 5 dates/ 2 months of contact? Abandonment issues triggered,"I’m posting this because I’m struggling emotionally after a guy I was casually dating ended things. I need some rationality, or at least objectivity, so that I don’t end up romanticising him and can move on.

I’m 36/f, he was 28/m. I had told him from the start that I could only casually date right now. For context I ended a 6 year relationship over a year ago and am enjoying my own space and freedom. Have since realised casual dating is *not* for me, as I have abandonment issues from parental absence throughout childhood and I’m clearly not resilient enough yet. (I am working through these issues with my therapist alongside dating).

Relationship dynamic: his communication was clear and direct throughout our connection, I never felt triggered or anxious and his words met actions. Though we were probably both incompatible lifestyle and age wise, I was enjoying the dynamic and really liked getting to know him more each time I saw him. The relationship was physical from date 3 onwards.

I had to leave town for 3 weeks for a family trip and though I had zero expectations, he made an effort to stay in touch (every 3-4 days plus a few calls) which was a pleasant surprise. I don’t think I’d “caught feelings” but I was really looking forward to seeing him again. During that time I saw that he had changed a few photos on his Hinge, but so had I and it genuinely didn’t bug me seeing as we were casual. 

Cue to me getting back to town and 2 days before our date I get a text at 11:30pm at night saying something along lines of “I’m sorry to do this over text. I don’t think we should continue seeing each other anymore. Enjoyed our time etc. The honest truth is I have to prioritise other responsibilities in my life right now and as much as I’d like to keep seeing you, I can’t afford to spend my free time casually dating. I genuinely wish you well”.

I was floored. Trigger response. Whole body goes into shut down for the next 5 days. I can’t sleep or barely eat and I feel almost out of body. A totally overblown response I know - but welcome to trauma, my friends! 

We had a long phone conversation about it, which I appreciated, as I was mystified as to why he would bother keeping contact with me whilst I was away only to change his mind when I got back? He said he had a realisation about his career and that he was going to have to work 2 extra days a week in order to train to go into another specialty. He didn’t want things to feel on his terms and that he couldn’t give much right now/ we were in diff phases of our lives (I am much more established than him, particularly financially). Towards the end of the chat he reneged - it was almost as if he’d forgotten we had this nice connection. we agreed to sleep on it and talk again in a few days to see if there was a way to keep seeing each other. 

A few days after our phone convo my spidey sense tingled and I checked his Hinge. He’d changed one of his question prompts on there in that period since we talked. This contradicted what he’d said about not having time to date full stop - maybe he just wanted to date more intentionally or it was the age gap, but he obviously couldn’t be fully transparent. I texted him saying I had thought about things and felt it better not to continue/ that it seemed obvious it wasn’t about not having time to date, but the way he felt about our connection. it made me uncomfortable to continue communication. I now feel really embarrassed that I sent this /  like I’ve been too Intense. Ugh. Not the way I wanted to go out of this.

I have a habit of pedastalling people and thinking the best of them. Can you guys just tell me what you think? Not asking anyone to villainise him. It’s just my brain isn’t connecting those dots for me right now to truly feel that he just didn’t want to date me anymore. 

Tldr; is it acceptable to end things via text after 2 months of contact, sexual relationship etc? And how do you approach dating when you have abandonment trauma? I don’t want this to happen again.


*EDIT*: Thank you very much to everyone for your thoughtful advice. There's a lot of kindness here and I'm really grateful for your input. I definitely feel frustrated with myself. I gave myself permission to date 'freely', however I didn't give myself permission to develop interest or feelings. And yes, this approach was likely a protective mechanism. I wish I could have expressed that to him earlier, as internally I liked him but was trying to play it cool. Trying to chalk it up as a lesson learned plus something to work on in myself going forward.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/rbrilk/breaking_up_over_text_acceptable_after_5_dates_2/
