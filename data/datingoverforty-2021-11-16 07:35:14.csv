There is a 44M in my dance class that I fancy and I am not sure if he is just being friendly or is actually interested. I rarely go out and meet new people due to my job and this person seems kind, educated and a gentleman from what I have seen in the past 4-5 weeks.

This Thursday will be the last time I see him before Christmas and I cannot figure out or think clear what I want or should do. 

I tried dropping a hint to him last time and he didnt get it/ wasn‚Äôt interested and at the same time my friends in the same class tell me he seems to be only talking and being friendly to me. We dance Bachata and touch each other pretty much everywhere and constantly, analyzing body language doesn‚Äôt work in this situation.

Is there any way to get into his head without embarrassing myself and avoid awkward moments in classes starting 2022?

6,qvlu76,1637107099,Felt a vibe with someone,"So I‚Äôm 42M and four months post broken engagement, which freed me from an awful situation. Will spare the details for this post, but my ex 38F was emotionally abusive, and i had coped with it for years. When I look back, I realize how much true affection and intimacy were really missing. It had also been an enormous struggle in the sex department, for obvious reasons. Someone belittles you, makes you feel like shit, you don‚Äôt exactly want to hop in the sack with them. Or at least I don‚Äôt!

I spent four interim months in a limbo where, I guess, I never interacted with available women at all. Just married friends, family, and coworkers. This last Saturday I ended up out with a family member and met a friend of hers who I know is single, around my age, and whom I‚Äôve interacted with a bit already over text. I felt the whoosh, the vibe, whatever you want to call it, and I‚Äôve been thinking about her for days. Then lo and behold she texts me and I feel this rush of excitement, and then the usual ‚Äúwhat do I say? Be cool, be cool,‚Äù like a nervous 10th grader. Haven‚Äôt felt this way in a long time.

But I wonder about this. Is it common for the newly liberated to fall on their knees before the first available, attractive person they come across? I guess the way to test this is to get in front of others. I worry that I could start down this road but it‚Äôs not this person, but what she represents: freedom, possibility, something new.

Almost officially divorced (it's amicable) , from the horror stories I have read I am not even going to attempt OLD. I am no Time man of the year (but not a leper either lol). OLD seems to be all about looks. I just don't even want to deal with the wondering/matches, blah blah blah. I am actually in a really good place emotionally, we should have divorced 5 years ago, but hung around for our teenage boys. 

The one thing I have always loved is traveling, I will literally jump at the chance to go anywhere with little notice. Wasn't my partners view, everything had to be planned to the hour/day. 

On a recent trip I took with a buddy, I met a great lady, we had a blast, yes we kissed but did not shack up. That's fine with me, honestly didn't even try to see how far it would go. But I realized how much fun I had with a lady again who wasn't nagging at me the whole time :) It was just so relaxing to have fun for once!

Besides Meetup, is there any way/sites/groups to connect with potential travel partners? I am not looking to hook up, but if it led to that so be it.

16,qw21wj,1637163856,Love bombing or Paranoia?,"On 11/03, I started texting with a man I found on Tinder (I use a burner and only send pics wearing sunglasses). He has messaged me at least twice every day since. That seems like overkill. Because of my schedule we haven‚Äôt been able to meet yet, but we have plans to meet for drinks on Friday. 

Some red flags are:
Texting me on a day that I had already declined to meet up, asking me to meet up that evening. 
Asking for another photo after I said no. 
Lots of love emojis etc. 
I asked him recall a time he regrets because he was to blame, and he said he gets angry and yells like his father. When I said that is not a regret, his follow up answer was similar to the regret I shared with him. 
I told him I meal prep, and he did not say he did too, but two days later he sent a picture of prepped meals. 

I haven‚Äôt even met this guy or spoken with him yet and I feel uneasy. He hasn‚Äôt *done* anything wrong per se, and I should add that my last LTR was with a narcissist who had an entire FAMILY hidden in the wings! I was foolish and lied to myself when I had suspicions because I didn‚Äôt know such people existed and the truth would hurt.

We said we should do it again. He Text me the following day and asked how I was and mentioned again about doing it again.

Now I have been ghosted. Haven‚Äôt heard from him since and I did reach out once just telling him I hope all is well.

48,qxjrqo,1637339170,2 schools of thought,"Okay fellow Redditors. I need to ask your opinion.
I‚Äôve heard 2 schools of thought, and I can see it both ways. I‚Äôm referring to ghosting v. being direct with tact.
I‚Äôve heard people say that a response is not obligatory if there is no interest . I‚Äôve also heard that providing a response is a responsible adult-like way to handle these kinds of situations. 
Having experienced both, I prefer to be informed. 
With that being said, I figured I‚Äôd offer the same courtesy. But HOLY MOLY!!!! It has seriously backfired. Instead of no response or a response of ‚Äúthank you, and good luck to you,‚Äù I‚Äôve been getting a string of texts of how men and women generally don‚Äôt have anything in common, there is an increase in lack of sex by women, and women just aren‚Äôt motivated. WTF?!!! I‚Äôm starting to think that ghosting may be the way to go.

64,qxuett,1637371173,How do introverted homebodies meet people?,"45 M. I'm an introverted homebody, so meeting people locally is a real challenge. Coupled with the fact it seems I live in an area where people couple up and stay coupled. So there just aren't many singles available at all.

When I've sought advice in the past, the general advice is ""get out and meet people, go to bars, do hobbies, get active, socialize, etc"". But do these people truly understand what it means to be an introvert? Or homebody?

To be clear, I'm not a prisoner in my home due to circumstances or debilitating social anxiety. I'm able to function in day to day life and hold my own when needed, but the true reality is I'm still an introverted homebody at heart. It's just who I am. I like working around my house, yard, and garden. And evenings and weekends are spent relaxing and reading or doing inside activities.

I routinely get the impression that being an introverted homebody precludes me from being in a relationship and I essentially need to become someone else to find a partner, but this simply can't be true. This is especially evident online where you're being superficially judged on a few pics and some writing and I simply don't show well in that way.

Does anyone have insight into dating for introverts?

84,qyjs74,1637457830,Some guidance on the rational slow burn vs. the instant spark. I don't know what healthy dating looks like.,"I (39f) went on my second date with a man (49) last night. 

We both chatted for almost 3 mi the prior to meeting because of Covid and my health issues. We both know we are seeking a relationship, but have both expressed a sense of feeling a little defeated after attempts at building relationships in the past. 

We get along well, there are a few awkward silences easily filled, we seem to have a lot in common so far and share the same values. I have complicated life/work/health circumstances and he doesn't seem to mind. I also have 2 younger kids, his are adults now. 

While we're in different stages of life, we are both in quite similar positions in a lot of ways, when it comes to our own goals and making changes to better ourselve. 

I am attracted to him, and I'm sure he's probably attracted to me, but I've never had a relationship that didn't begin with flying sparks and intense attraction, or where a man hasn't spent a lot of the time telling me how amazing/beautiful/awesome I am. Where sex wasn't rhe obvious goal/hope/intent from the start. 
While this seemed great at the time, all of these men later turned out to be quite toxic, dishonest, and none of these relationships ended well from where I was sitting. One was a flat-out love-bombing from a man who already had a girlfriend for the year we were together. 
I've been ignorant and too trusting, 100%. Now I am very cautious. 

This man is quiet, a little shy, has never complimented me, hasn't tried anything sexual (I went in for a hug and a kiss on the cheek last night), and this is not familiar to me at all. 
He appears interested, but in a quiet and patient way. 

This is EXACTLY what I need, but at the same time it is unfamiliar and uncomfortable for me. I'm almost conditioned to believe that if it isn't glaringly obvious from the start, then it's not there. I feel like men want sex, and it's unfair to continue dating a man for too ling if I'm not ready for that yet. I don't know what's healthy in dating, to be honest. 

Is it reasonable for me to continue dating this man without being sure how I feel about him? 
How long is too long? 
Do men expect something on a third date?

Yes I'm employed full time with a good job.  Yes I have money.   I just live in an excruciatingly expensive city. Rent here is Legit $3,000/month.  That would be half my monthly budget.  So I car dwell.

So, I met a wonderful woman through yoga class like 3 weeks ago.   There's this excellent group of us who get together and do yoga on Sundays, we're like a community.  We got to chatting one day, I asked her for ice cream I was craving &amp;  we've since been on a couple of dates.  Had a coffee date in the park and a nice restaurant meal last week.  We have also been intimate once before as well; she invited me to hers last Saturday night, we had some wine, some food and yeah next thing we were taking our clothes off and got horizontal.

Anyways, we ended up hanging out again tonight.  Got some pizza from a local shop here, she had a drink.  I won't drink because you can get a DUI in your vehicle even if the keys are somewhere else like the glove compartment.  Really hitting it off and it's very clear we're going to get sexy again.  Also to note she was quite aways from home.  There was some events today out on the west side of our area and she was there and then I met up with her.  It's about 16k back to her place.

So she's heavily suggestions we go back to ""mine"".  So full disclosure: I haven't told her about my situation but I said I stay out on the west side and I ""live"" walking distance from work.  Reality is because parking is insane where I work I park two blocks away and walks every day. 

I said it would not work out tonight why dont we try again tomorrow at her place.  She said you live right around here, also your car is here and we could literally go to your house in like two minutes, right? I was making up excuses like my car isnt running well (lie, I work in automotive and my car is a custom built job) and I just felt bad.  I don't even have two seats in my car anyways so it's not like she could ride legally in the car.  I started mumbling and kinda just started running away from her.

Yeah I messed it up bad.  She's blowing up my phone asking questions alike what did she do wrong and everything and what's going on I thought we were having a great night etc. I haven't responded to her yet.    I just feel terrible because this is like, the one.  The.  One.   She's incredibly beautiful, amazingly nice like she volunteers with street people and does all of these great things with her life.  I'm perfectly normal I'm just in my vehicle to save money.  I legitimately have $185,000 in the bank because I haven't paid rent in so many years. - I've been living like this and traveling for nine years long story for another day. I've done hammocks tents hostels all of it.

I'm not even looking for advice I just feel terrible.  Like eventually she would've figured out and then kept asking more questions about why I don't pay for a place when I can afford it.  I just enjoy it, it's peaceful, I have it all built out for my comfort and yeah, I legit live off $450/month.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qyphjl/bailed_out_on_snuggles_tonight_because_she_wanted/

I‚Äôm not sure if I just need to vent or perhaps I‚Äôm thinking about this situation all wrong ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think I am. Thank you in advance if you read this whole thing.  

I (47M) dated ‚ÄúA‚Äù(44F) for a little more than a year, when we broke up. She said she couldn‚Äôt give me what I wanted from a relationship because, she has 2 children, 50% custody with their dad, and my kids are adults. At the time she was right, I was still discovering the ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù that many people that have been divorced told me to find, and I wanted a relationship where I could be a part of her life, not an every other week boyfriend.  

However, because we really have an incredible connection, we ended up being ‚Äúphysical‚Äù friends a week later. We agreed that if we were physical with someone else, we‚Äôd have to be honest and it would end. That lead to hanging out ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and spending the night after. It also led to my being more a part of her life, and her life with the kids (They like me). At one point she told me that she is not on dating sites anymore, cause she‚Äôs happy the way things are. I got off dating sites after a week ‚Äì but not just because we were being physical, there was another reason at the time. The common conversation that we‚Äôve had has been my asking ‚ÄúIs the door closed for us?‚Äù, and her replying that she doesn‚Äôt know the future, but it‚Äôs not closed. Very non-committal, except that she's ""not ready for a relationship"" right now.  FYI - she's been divorced 5 yrs to my 2.   

Things were going great; I was invited to an out-of-town family event with her and her kids. We made plans with another couple to go on a long weekend vacation. I‚Äôm invited to her moms for Thanksgiving. She had gone away for a girl‚Äôs weekend and when she came back spoke to me about how different, better, the relationship felt. I told her it was because I was in a better spot. I stopped putting so much weight on the relationship and just enjoyed my time with her. She stressed that she still wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, but didn‚Äôt know what the future holds. It was on that night, I actually started to allow myself to have emotional feelings for her again. 

About a week and a half after that conversation, things changed. She wasn‚Äôt texting (our main form of communication when not together) as much ‚Äì always replying to mine, but just not reaching out. Something happened and when she told me I understood and I assumed that when that improved her communication and the way I was included in her life would improve as well. It has improved, but not to where it was a few weeks earlier, where I was ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù in the relationship. I have no doubt that she cares about me a lot, but, just isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. 

We went to the family event this weekend. It was fun. I was simply introduced by my name, no title ‚Äì which is how we basically keep it.  

We‚Äôre going on that vacation in 2 weeks, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I want more. I want what she was giving me, and if she can‚Äôt, then I need to move on and find the relationship that can. 

**OPINIONS:** Am I obligated to tell her if I start dating? Once again, if I‚Äôm physical with someone, I would certainly have to. I would like to tell her I‚Äôm going to start, because perhaps she will realize she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. I know she is capable of giving me the relationship I want, so why not give her the opportunity to ‚Äúbe ready for a relationship‚Äù?

I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm kidding myself here. That after this vacation, we need to have a serious talk and she might actually come around and be ready? I read about Attachment styles and perhaps she‚Äôs just an ‚Äúavoidant‚Äù. Very frustrating.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qz6rth/shes_not_ready_for_a_relationship_after_being_in/
95,qz6tqm,1637535705,Is he really even interested in me?,"I am 67F. He is 72M.  

I am retired. He is semi-retired. He has an orchard that takes up quite a bit of his time and also is an avid hunter/fisherman who takes trips in his 5th wheel for weeks at a time during hunting/fishing season. 

We met in 2015 online dating. I thought we hit it off well. I haven't met anyone I like as much as him. We had some great dates. We tried intimacy in 2015 and although I did my part, his ED affected his performance. He couldn't do it. He emailed me the next day and broke up, citing politics and religious differences. I always believed that if he had been able to get it up, he would not have broken up with me. 

May 2021 he contacts me again on the dating site. I still hadn't found a keeper. We went out in June. He told me he had a new procedure for ED. Also said he had been kicking himself many times for breaking up with me.  We tried again and.... success! He said it was the best sex he had in 20 years. He lives an hour away. We were going back and forth. We took a weekend trip in August. We had fun, we had wonderful conversations, good sex, and he was very supportive of my personal struggles. 

He went on a six week hunting trip about six hours away. He did come home once during that time and we went to a party for his friends. We talked about me driving up to see him, but with weather issues and his hunting time and his meeting up with friends to hunt, the timing didn't work. So I haven't seen him since Oct. 30.

He said he was coming home Friday, Nov 19. I thought he would call and set up a date for today, Sunday, so he could cook me a pheasant dinner at his house. But he hasn't called or texted since the 15th. He will be going to his son's house for Thanksgiving, out of town, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday and I am going to my mother's home on Friday to give my sister some respite time. So neither of us are available at the same time for the rest of the month.

He did have a prostrate cancer scare in July and was on some heavy duty meds. Now he says he has to take them for life. These meds affect his libido. I was still willing to keep our relationship going. I thought he was too. We made plans for some winter getaways and talked about even a few overseas travel plans. I like to travel, but it gets difficult as a solo. 

But he hasn't talked to me in six days. I am not some middle school girl who expects a boyfriend to be at her beck and call, but I feel like I am just an afterthought to him. When we do chat, it is great, but it has never been as much as I would like. I am just someone who he fits into his schedule when he has nothing better to do. And now, we may go through all of November without seeing each other at all.

I know that I am the only one who can answer my question, but I would like some opinions.  Is this the best I am going to get from this man? I don't want to be the typical female who is always bringing up the ""relationship"", but it is on my mind all the time. Do I end it with him? Do I go back to online dating hoping to find (in that vast online wasteland) someone who is a better match? I told him that I would not date anyone else while I am dating him. I don't think I want to keep him just as a travel buddy because I really want a man in my life, regularly, who wants to see me and wants to be with me as much as I want to see him and be with him. I can work with his ED issues, at least I think I can. This guy is the best I have found, but his unwillingness to make time for me maybe should be a dealbreaker for us.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qz6tqm/is_he_really_even_interested_in_me/
96,qz7wdh,1637538938,Red flags,"I‚Äôm curious, after reading so many posts, what are everyone‚Äôs top 3 red flags? I realize that red flags are different for everyone so I‚Äôm always a little amused at the posts asking if whatever their date did/said is a red flag, because it‚Äôs really going to vary. I also think that flags can be different for different people I‚Äôm dating (for me if I‚Äôm super attracted and feel a lot of sparks I might bend some of my ‚Äúrules‚Äù. For me, 43/F, my top 3 (and ones that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd bend) would be:
1) Dads who share custody with anyone other than the bio mom (so grandparents, etc.)
2) A felony that involved any bodily harm to another person (sexual, assault)
3) Recovering addicts or regular hard drug users
Obviously any one can set their own ‚Äúred flags‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think any are really wrong, but it‚Äôs interesting to get other peoples perspective.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qz7wdh/red_flags/

99,qz9ovz,1637544517,Movie Musical Love,"It's so hard for me to believe that I am single at 57 years of age.  I have been in love before,  or so I thought,  however it must not have been true love since I have ended up alone at this point in my life.   
Maybe I am meant to be alone.  However,  for someone who believes in love as much as I do,  I find that unacceptable.  Hopeless romantic?  Maybe.  I do believe there is true love out there though.  That movie musical type of love that makes you smile, melt and feel like both singing and crying at the same time!  
If only I could find her........",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qz9ovz/movie_musical_love/
