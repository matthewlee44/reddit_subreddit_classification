Okay so I’m kind of embarrassed about this and it was only my third time doing anal. I don’t know who else to talk about this with so here I am! I am a 22F and the guy I was with was a 27M. We have hung out before a few times and done anal once and it was good. It had been a few months since we had hung out and we got food and were hanging and things were going super well so we fell back into our usual ways of not being able to keep our hands off each other. 

He asked if we could do anal and I was a little hesitant but said yes. It hurt a bit but he was considerate and gentle and caring. We did it for a while switching positions until he said he was close to cuming. He was taking a video on my phone, I was in doggy. He came inside me and when he pulled out there was a medium sized drop of dark stuff and a little fleck of dark stuff that dropped out (poop and maybe a little blood-gross I know!).. he wiped it off quickly and got a towel. so he didn’t say anything was sweet and gave me a towel but I kinda worried about it anyways cuz it’s anal. When he was setting alarms and stuff I watched the video and saw it and was mortified. He was sweet and we cuddled and fell asleep and the next morning we had vaginal sex and it was great. 

We never addressed the gross dripping that  accompanied his cum. I am still so embarrassed though! Is this normal? Am I super gross or something? I guess if he was gonna cum in me and I hadn’t cleaned out earlier (I didn’t know we were gonna do anal) then something would’ve come out. Do you think he was disgusted though? I feel bad and gross kind of but I really wanted to please him and it was mostly enjoyable.

And we had the discussion of where we stand in the relationship and she said that its best if we stopped seeing each others.

Monday I ask her how she feels and that im ready to change this neediness, and I have to understand that she has a life outside of me etc, she says ""Do you rly think it can work then""? i say i think so.

Here’s the story:

Im a 20M and a couple of months ago (coincidentally on my bday), I met this girl (20F) over an app online. She lives about 6-8 hours away by drive. We clicked pretty easily and imo, we had a decent vibe going. We texted a little on the app then I asked for IG. I was new to online dating so I wasn’t sure about procedure and ended up asking her out  or for a call pretty much after getting her ig. She said she wanted to take things slow and that it wasn’t a “no”. I totally respect that and told her and we ended up chatting pretty much everyday after.

At first, our exchanges were a few hours apart (I took about an hour at most to reply while she often took 2-3 hrs). Gradually, it became 2hrs for me and 15+ hrs for her. I know, possible red flag. 

About 3-4 weeks ago, I get her number cause I’m using ig less (and I wanted to get her number). But I know she’s a double major and doing a bunch of other stuff, so she’s super busy and I get that.

Anyhoo, two weeks ago I send her a reply and boom... no reply. I was worried about her and decided to give her a week before following up. The last day before I test her, she posts a pic (arguably her at her cutest imo) on her story. I think to myself that maybe she’s still busy so I give her a few more days. A couple of days later, she posts another story about some awareness thing. Next day, I can’t find her account on ig. I use my other account and see her account so my assumption is that I’m blocked.

Over the next few days, a few minor things happen: I lose sleep worrying about why all this happened, I look back on old texts to see if I said something wrong, and I give up on the idea of dating.

Yesterday, I decide that I need to know what’s going on and text her asking her if everything’s ok. Again, no reply... yet.

As I write this, I’m eating my breakfast and trying to watch a lecture online, or a lack thereof. I’ve been thinking of why this would happen and this is what I’ve come up with:

1. She’s fallen for someone else.
2. She wants to focus on her studies/work rn.
3. I said something I shouldn’t have.
4. She’s working for the CIA undercover and can’t make contact.
I know that last one sounds a little unorthodox but I can’t figure out anything else. 1 and 2 don’t make because we previously talked about how she would reject someone (it came up in a convo about her friends) and she would be straightforward. As for 3, our texts are largely “fun-filled” and a lot of jokes. Not to mention that nothing I could have said  would even make her do this.

My plan thus far is:
1. Give her a couple of days to reply to the text I sent yesterday.
2. Call her if she doesn’t reply by then.
3. If she doesn’t pick up or if I’m blocked over text too, then I’ll text her sister asking her whats going on or if the my girl is ok.
4. If this still doesn’t work, I’ll have to go meet her in person somehow.
I need closure about what’s going on because I can’t stop thinking about her and that’s messing with my schedule.

If you guys have read this far, please tell me what you think. I’ve never been in this situation and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, I know this may not count as dating but it’s a pandemic and I really like her so yeah...

We hadn't spoke in over a year. We didn't date that long but we were friends first. There was always sort of an attraction there but I always detected red flags with him hence I friendzoned him. 

When we ended things it wasn't on good terms &amp; there were some harsh words said mostly on his end. He was being a jerk to me which I dont know why &amp; I was trying to come from a place of understanding. He basically pushed me away even though he was the one who pursued me &amp; went after another girl. 

After that I moved on fast &amp; started dating someone new. I quickly began developing feelings for the new guy &amp; I soon realized he was a better match for me &amp; wanted to pursue a relationship with the new guy. 

Even though I was happy with the new guy there was a part of me that still wondered about the ex. Also, my new guy got out of a relationship not too long before me so we were both healing in a sense. We were together almost a year when our relationship came to a sudden halt mainly on his part. The new guy I thought was potentially my long term partner walked away from the relationship.

I felt devastated &amp; still am somewhat. After a few months of being alone &amp; not having the energy to go back to online dating I contacted the old lover. 

He responded immediately &amp; seemed open &amp; happy to hear from me. A part of me was curious about him but I think the other part knew deep down I was making a mistake contacting him again.

We met up for lunch a few times &amp; ended up hooking up, but I knew in the back of my mind I didn't want a relationship with him. He did apologize to me for the way he treated me in the past &amp; was trying to be more affectionate with me, but actually wasn't feeling it.

After that we made plans to hang out a few times but he backed out surprisingly but I was kind of relieved. Since then he's been giving me mixed messages &amp; trying to imply he wants something serious. He's asked me my views on marriage &amp; has sent me random houses for sale. I asked him why he sent me this but he said he just thought I'd like the post. 

I feel like I know what he's trying to do. I told him I decided it was best we remain just friends because I'm still healing right now. He knows I dated someone after him. Thing is I feel like he's hoping I'll come back to him eventually, but I don't see it happening.

I realized we're not compatible in the long run &amp; there's things about his personality &amp; lifestyle I don't like. Also, I know he still flirts with other girls. I've seen it on social media. 

But I feel he keeps pushing for more &amp; I feel is obsessed with me. But I feel he's always obsessed with who he can't have.

One thing has come up a few times that’s starting to bother me enough to ask for some advice. My boyfriend has trouble talking about his own and my past relationships/partners (especially sexual history), and he has gone so far as to plug his ears and physically remove himself from the room  when I was casually talking to his roommate about some random sexual subject that I related to. 

I don't like to linger on this subject either, but I am the kind of person that’s pretty open about my past history, because I think that sharing some things is important to show your partner what you’ve learned about yourself in the context of a relationship or sex. Again, I don’t mean going over the nitty gritty details or bringing up unnecessary stories to trash talk exes or things like that.

I have some things in my relationship/sexual history that I would like to bring up to him as a way to share a little bit of my life that I’ve learned a lot from, and to deepen the relationship by being more vulnerable with him. I want to feel like I can confide in him about things that have caused me trauma, but right now him not being willing to listen is making me feel even more shameful about it. 

I don’t know how to bring this up with him without him feeling uncomfortable or jealous, because I think he really struggles with hearing about this subject. He’s been cheated on in the past and has some trauma there for sure, which I can empathize with and understand why he’s triggered talking to his gf (me) about her past partners.

I took the plunge and on Bumble said I specifically wanted an FLR. I got a ton of matches really quickly, I think mostly from women being curious about what it was. The first one and I really hit it off and seemed to have a great connection just from messaging. She had never heard of it but said she always felt more dominant and the more she looked into it and we talked about it she really liked the idea. So we had drinks at an awesome super divey bar the next day and just beyond hit it off. We've been messaging constantly and I really see it going somewhere. We've even pulled the trigger on a trip together already.

Our next date is on Friday but since she wears the pants in our budding relationship, she's coming up with the date. Which is my conundrum.

My mind goes all over the place, I get excited and picture her as my girlfriend and then I go to, does she really like me? Has she rejected me? Why is it taking so long for her to respond? Whenever I get the text back and remain calm and then go into my ""manic state"" and then after awhile I crash. If she just ghosted me I crash and never go back to my manic state lol.

I hate being this way but I can't help it because I cannot contain my excitement. If the girl is really cute the worse it gets for me. I just hate playing the waiting game with texting or messaging. I guess its because I've been ghosted so many times and that I am kind of a hopeless romantic that I am susceptible to this than most people. I am also pretty conscientious so when I meet a girl I really like I feel like she really is the one.

I don't get anxiety to the point that I cry abnormally or go into extreme depression, but its like 1 level below it. Its not like I have serious mental health issues. I get sad when things don't work out, I cry, pick myself up and then move on. I just hate having to go through the phase of excitement followed by crashing with dating. It sucks but I don't know what to do, I like women too much and I never really had a girlfriend before and I always wanted one.

Could really tell we really clicked with similar interests and backgrounds/ upbringings. But the messages kind of died down as mid semester tests and end semester finals came around, and during finals it was sometimes just 1-2 texts per week. Being an introvert, I was kind of hurt and thought she was losing interest with such a drastic change in texting habits. She’s in com science and I’m a double major so we have really packed academic schedules and since I don’t stay in hostel, I’ve only had 1-2 study dates during the school term with her. Since exams ended, I did ask her out for dinner initially but she rescheduled for lunch and we had a great time a few days back, talked for three hours with almost no silence and she initiated walking about the area + dessert enthusiastically. Mustered a bit of courage at the end to ask if she wanted to go out next week and she said sure, and to arrange a time since both our internships are starting. From what I know from talking with her, I don’t think she’s the type to lead people on (she’s never had a bf before), but I’m just a little confused why the texts have become more sporadic. Should I broach the subject with her on the next date or just let it slide? Or are texts a non-indicator of interest at all because she always agrees to go out just that lengthier convos in text have kind of died since school started getting more hectic?

 when I was in math class, I was talking to one of my friends and I noticed her looking at me, she was looking me in my eyes and when I catched her staring she didn't turned away or something she kept staring and it made me feel a little bit uncomfortable and I looked away, then she smiled and talked to her friends.

When I was stretching in the gym class I caught her staring again, she gave me that seductive smile,I looked away again.

(It may sound creepy but I don't really get that creepy vibes)

I remember this time when I was crying bcuz one of my ""friends"" humiliated in front of the class (i'm really sensitive btw)and then she comforted me and told me that everything was ok, she told me it wasn't that bad, it made me feel better.

I usually pay for myself because I just don’t like the concept of money integration in a relationship, especially in the beginning when I haven’t decided if I like the guy.

So, the thing is, he ALWAYS wanted to pay for me. Every time I said that I would handle it he refused and insisted on paying saying that he just wants to make me feel good.

And after those dates I discovered some qualities that made us incompatible. I met him for the last time saying that it wouldn’t work out.  And he said “you know, when a guy pays for a girl, he is expecting something in return”

It was so offending! I was shocked that he viewed me as someone who would sleep with a guy because he bought me a burger😖😖

For relationships, one of the worst things that can damage or even destroy them is self doubt, and that might be the catalyst for the end of the relationship between I and and the most amazing woman I have met.
I have only met not even a handful of women throughout my 32 years, that I have felt a true connection with. 

I met my current partner through a dating app and has been going amazingly well, so amazing that I couldn't believe that there were no issues, until I started thinking about how this person couldn't be accepting of me. I showed my vulnerable ,anxious, shy side and she kept on telling me it's ok, that we can take as long as I want to go through the process of getting to know one another. Again the self doubt creeping in and saying""theres got to be something that isn't right"".

She has kissed,hugged and shown me love that I wouldn't have thought was possible. She has an amazing smile and a face I love to see whenever I get to hang out with her. She's very sexy, appearance, voice and her confidence. I love the way she carries herself. She's also a very optimistic person and happy and outgoing person and I love that.

This is me: Happy but have anxiety. I love to laugh and am outgoing but think too much about what to say and what I am doing. This id where my self doubt comes in- I WAS a 32 year old virgin with barely any experience in dating...and I had never kissed a woman before. 

So what I did is I started to doubt, even after we agreed to be exclusive, that things would go smooth. I also thought to myself,after someone texted me on tinder right before I was going to delete it, to just make sure I am ready to be committed. I'm not justifying this, I'm just expressing my thought process. I thought I would just text one girl and see if she could distract me. I texted her for 4 or 5 days and ended it, after seeing that I was only seeing her as a friend and nothing more.I didn't wish to meet up or see anyone, every time I saw my partner, I would forget about the girl from tinder. I realized that and stopped texting the tinder girl.

And that's another thing is that whenever I thought of my partner I would think of her as a woman, an adult, not a girl, not someone that seems like she needs to grow up. Looks like I have some growing up too.

What happened is that my partner saw my phone two times with the tinder notification on it. She confronted me and I told her about why it was still on my phone, I don't blame her for not believing me. It seems like she may believe me that I have not even met up with another woman, I would not do that unless things ended between us. 

My question is that how can this be fixed, is there anyone with experience with this same situation(emotional cheating) and how do you show that the person you cheated on,that you still truly love them and want to show comitment?

This has given me so much anxiety, that I can barely function and is definitely my biggest fuck up of my life. This just happened last night, so its hard to even function right now. It took 5 hours for me to start my day. I would be so happy if this worked, I would do anything to show her how much I care and wouldn't think about hurting her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,770443,public,self,I emotionally cheated on the most amazing woman,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb0hjo/i_emotionally_cheated_on_the_most_amazing_woman/,all_ads,6,,

Long story short :

Been going out with this girl for two months. We actually have been in contact for over a year after we matched on an app. Couldn’t go out before because of covid.
Everything was doing good. Actually I was a bit too intimidated because she was moving too fast with me. I mean she started talking about important stuff like if we were in a exclusive relationship or official. Wanted to meet my family, asked me about my ideal home or if preferred to rent for now, or asked me about ideal wedding. Asked me to travel with her. Actually she booked trip ( only three days ) that we were supposed to go this week but I didn’t go because of this “fight”. She went with her mother instead.

So all the things she was telling me made me think she actually liked me a lot . Only that I wanted to go slower because she wanted to do everything too quick.

Now let’s get to the point of this thread :

Last week she told me that she couldn’t go out that all week because she was busy with work- so I said okay and gave her space. She was actually busy as she was working a lot, so nothing wrong here.

Coming Wednesday I notice something weird: she blocked me from her Instagram stories. I come to find out she went out with someone else and posted a story and wanted to hide from me.

I was mad/upset/surprised not because she went out with someone else, but because she blocked me, especially  after talking about how we started to trust each other more!

So I confronted her, didn’t say anything mean , only that I was surprised and we needed to communicate better. Her reply ? She was actually surprised that I found it out, and that it was better to leave things like this because we are two different people. Then I sent her another message, and she got back to me in the morning saying she needed time to make a correct decision, too many things on her head. Haven’t spoken since then, she is on this vacation, she restricted me from her Instagram ( but still watches my stories), and actually went out with guy one more time. What’s going on here ? She wants to leave me for good but keeping me around to see if this other guy is any good ? Or she was impulsive didn’t want confront me and wants to think about her actions ?

I’ve had so many private messages posted on social media, I’ve been laughed at, “ew’d”, been told “I’m out of your league”, told that I’m too ugly, just insulted, and one time a girl posted on social media a few days later about how it’s shocking when ugly guys ask you out because it means they think they can pull you. 

I don’t think I’m that bad of a guy. I’ve been told by my girl friends that they think I’d be a really good boyfriend but I just can’t get any girl to give me a chance. I don’t get matches on online dating, and as stated earlier, trying with girls I know typically leads to painful rejections.

I feel so ugly all the time. I lay up at night questioning why I’m so inept that I can’t even get a first date. I’m still a virgin, I’ve never done anything physical with anyone, and I doubt I’ll even get my first kiss before I’m 40. It’s honestly so depressing when I think about it, it makes me not want to get out of bed. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I just want someone to think I’m attractive.

I’m missing out on so much. Everyone around me is experiencing what it’s like to be in a relationship. Everyone is experiencing sex. Everyone gets to experience young love but me. I’ve never told anyone this but I cry about this. I just feel so awful all the time.

I don’t want to be alone for the rest of my life but I know there’s a good chance I’ll never find anyone.

I wish I had someone to talk to about this, but no one around me can relate.

this, but I'll just try.

Okay, so here's my problem; I like a girl friend of
mine (from my friends group, we're all teenagers
and the group is formed by aprox 3 guys and 10
girls), but I think she's out of my range.

She's smart, understands and talks English very
fluently, she loves reading, and she's actually very
pretty. She's basically like me (except for the last
part), so I honestly think we're compatible.

But here's the thing; some months/weeks ago
discovered through other people that, if one of the
other guys in the group asked her out, she would
think and possibly say yes. This concerns me.
Luckily, that friend doesn't like her anymore.

So what's the dilemma? I don't know how to proceed.
Do l just ask her out and risk my reputation and
friendships with people on the group, do I remain
silent, do l try to give her little hints, etc.

I'm just looking for advise from more experienced
people, I've already had a couple of girlfriends but
I'm still not really ""comfortable"" in this area.

teenager, and please respond if you think you can
help.

I’m in college and a lot of the times people post group chats for different classes so a bunch of people can join them and just talk and have conversations about the class, ask for help, study together, etc.

Now class is over and there is this one girl that I find cute and want to just message and pretty much cold approach over messages since the class was all online.  

However, I don’t know if this is ideal and I feel like it could come off as creepy, weird etc. If by chance it works out I probably won’t see her until this fall when classes start up again since lots of people are going back home for the summer.

We started chatting last Monday and 3 of the dates I've tried setting up, something last minute came up, either 2-3 hours before. Same thing for our FaceTime which she didn't respond until after. 

Today was the same thing. I told I was coming to pick her up in 2 hours and she texts back saying she's unavailable due to something she forgot. It's a little frustrating at this point and I honestly don't know how to respond.

After the short 4th date when saying goodbye, I said ""stay in touch, alright?"" and she said ""obviously"" while smiling so I'll take that as a good sign.

Now, for the past 2 months that I've been talking to her, and even now, I ALWAYS get way too excited when I get a snap from her. I'll be checking my phone pretty often to see if she has snapped me or not. When she doesn't snap me for a while, it messes with my mood until I get a snap from her. I hate it. It's not healthy.

I just know that there are two outcomes this summer. 

A. She still talks to me by the end of the summer, and we start from where we ended before we left college. Here I'd be pissed because I stressed this much over her not texting me for nothing (because she's interested).

B. She ends things in the summer. Here I'd also be pissed because I stressed this much just for things to be ended.

For this story, everyone will have fake names. Because of Covid, my school’s drama department couldn’t have live theater and so we’d record radio plays and upload them to YouTube. This most recent one was a super intense and fun show with two parts, each one just over an hour. It was the same cast for both parts and one of the cast members, who we will “Samantha,” was this really cute and bubbly girl in the cast who would laugh at all my jokes, especially the more terrible ones. We got along great. We sat next to each other before and during rehearsal, we’d always joke around, we even traded books recently. I was seriously considering asking Samantha out. 

Before I did, I decided to ask her sister, Victoria if it would be fine. I only did it because I didn’t want to ruin the friendship between Victoria and myself, especially since Victoria is our main stage manager in my drama department. So, I texted her and was told that Samantha was already in a relationship, which was disappointing to hear, but better to hear from her rather than embarrass myself later. Well, a few days later, we finish and record the show and we’re signing posters and Samantha and I sitting next to each other signing posters. When I got my poster back, I saw that Samantha had written a note to me that basically said something along the lines of “I enjoyed this show with you but I have something I want to tell you. Too bad you won’t know for three years.”

Basically, she left a note that said she had something to tell me and she won’t tell me until around the time I graduate. She also hasn’t told anyone else, so no one else knows about this, just her and I. It’s also very important because she’s written it down on paper so that she doesn’t forget.

That was the first time we ever properly talked and we hit it off quite well, started calling regularly. 8 hour calls at a time just talking. 3 weeks later he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. So that's when we became ""official"" I guess. This is my first relationship ever, whereas he has had 2 previous relationships, so bear that in mind.

Because of the pandemic - we've met in person a handful of times - it was socially distanced outside. We video call every other day. We haven't kissed, most we've done is hugged. I'm fine with that honestly, because I don't have a lot of interest in being physical and consider myself somewhere on the asexual spectrum. Physical compatibility is very important in a relationship however, and I've told him where I stand. He seemed ok with it, but also said he can't help but get his hopes up for when we can finally meet up without social distancing. Seems like he's contradicting himself, but I didn't question it at the time.

Anyways, he's been talking about our upcoming anniversary. And he considers our anniversary to be 7th July, the day we first started talking. He's been talking about what  ideas for a gift he's going to get me and what we should plan for the day.  

To be honest, it feels strange using the term anniversary for our relationship. Even though we've known each other for nearly a year, we haven't been able to do any of the normal things that couples do. I sense he's built up an idealised version of our relationship in his head and imagined it to be something it isn't. We don't even know if we're physically compatible yet, and that's an area you can't really compromise without resentment building.

This may be a hard truth but women do not want something casual with you. Most women will not hook up with some Joe Schmo as they’re not exciting like a hot guy would be. 

Women risk A LOT for causal sex including their health, lives, and pregnancy. So they go after guys that are really really sexually attractive, which unfortunately is not most of us. For the rest of us, a woman has to actually be in love with us to find us sexually attractive.

They aren’t going to risk it the danger for some pudgy guy she meets at the bar. Women are going to have casual sex with the top percentage of men. The rest of us are relationship material.


Focus on what you’re good at. Cultivate your personality as that’s what’s needed for a relationship.

Man, these past couple of months have been a landslide. I had an opportunity with an awesome older woman that I met on Tinder out of pure luck and I ended up wasting it due to another unforeseen relationship which happened to kind of roll in out of nowhere. It was extremely hard to pick between the two (the other girl was my age which I had met at work), but I opted for choosing the other. That relationship ended mutually a couple weeks ago since I had to relocate for school and I'm now starting to begin to move on and looking at my options. I once again realized this dormant side of me which I pushed aside during the relationship with my coworker but I want to address the part of me which led me to choose her instead of the older woman. What questions should I be asking myself? Should I rule out my attraction to older women because of this?

She told me that I spent way more money than her, and that I should at least pay half (this was the gold digger’s response to me saying that I wasn’t paying). I told gold digger, “no,” but gold digger kept telling me to pay.
