We had the same life goals, talked for hours and I just had the best time ever. The only problem is he lives in a different state. I see him when he comes to visit maybe 2-3x a month for work and when we see each other in person it‚Äôs amazing. However, when we‚Äôre away from each other, we rarely talk. We text a couple of times a week and he usually messages me first asking asking me how my day was and what i‚Äôm up to, but our texting convo is always so dry and boring. We never facetime or call either because i‚Äôm worried we‚Äôll have nothing to talk about (even though we talk for hours in person). He posted on his snap story today and i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs on a date. It makes sense because it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre in a serious relationship so of course he‚Äôs dating around but idk if I should just give up on him‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since i‚Äôve last seen him and we‚Äôre both not sure when he‚Äôll be back in my state for work (we only see each other when he‚Äôs here for work). 
im honestly tempted to delete his number and unfriend him on social media. Although I really like him, I just don‚Äôt think long distance will work for us and it makes me sad knowing he‚Äôs dating around and i‚Äôm here waiting for him to come visit again 
I‚Äôm kinda scared to text him about ending things because it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre in a relationship or anything (idk what we are) so he‚Äôd probably be weirded out that i‚Äôm asking him to end things when there‚Äôs nothing wrong 

or should I just wait things out, date other people like him and see if him and I work? idk what to do:(

he‚Äôs a super sweet guy though, we‚Äôve been on 8 dates and didn‚Äôt sleep with each other until the 5th date and he told me he wanted to wait for me to be ready because he didn‚Äôt want me to think he was only using me for sex (when we first started talking I told him that was one of my concerns). there‚Äôs nothing wrong with our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù at all besides him being in another state and us rarely ever talking besides a couple of times a week

Well we wake up, I get all dressed to go in my semi nice clothes, ya know, nice watch, bracelet, necklace and a collard shirt, nice shoes. She walks out the bedroom and starts complaining about how dirty it is and that she expected me to clean it all by then. I did tell her I would take over the cleaning u til she is gone. I cleaned Friday, Saturday I went out with her the whole day, we came back Saturday night and it got a little messy, then Sunday our plans were to go right out and she started giving me shit. I was frustrated and hurt cause I was so excited to take her out to a nice breakfast and San Diego but she got sad and went back to bed cause I felt hurt. Like, where‚Äôs the logic in the feelings there? 

Next, we go out finally and have a great breakfast, a late one now, and we both ate so much we came back to lay down for a bit and she told me she didn‚Äôt want to go to San Diego anymore because she didn‚Äôt want to be in the car for long. Makes sense right? But then my plans for us went down the drain and I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I asked her what she wanted to do for her last day, and she said, ‚Äúwhat do you want to do?‚Äù Like what come on it‚Äôs your last day you‚Äôve gotta want to do something it‚Äôs like when it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs birthday you let them decide what they wanna do cause it‚Äôs their day!

But then she said she wanted to do something little first like take the dog in a walk, so I said ok, and put some clothes on. As I‚Äôm putting my clothes in she starts complaining about being so bored the whole day and it started to make me feel like she‚Äôs trying to make me feel bad and that it‚Äôs my fault her day sucked. 

This has got to be toxic behavior. Also, while we were home laying around we had sex, watched the new Rick and Morty that she said she wanted to watch, and I took a nap cause I got really tired.

He then becomes quite evasive and shows less affection towards me, which made me wonder if I should just break the tie, as I think this is just not going anywhere.

To give a clearer outline, the way I approach the  topic is that if he doesn't want it, it's fine too; as I am not like 100% sure either, I would be happy to see more people then. 

Another sign of red flag is that I noticed him texting people while we are dating, and I get the sense that he was asking other girls out. It is completely fine to date other people, but what I feel angry is the fact that he was using our date to do this, which means he does not respect my presence and my time at all.

My question is: should I wait a bit longer to see if he would give me answer? or should I just cut it off?

And if any girl has a similar experience of noticing your dates texting other girls while your dating, could you please share how you would deal with this situation?

34,pirdqu,1630898810,My boyfriend makes me feel guilty about a time I slept with a guy before we were exclusive ?,"So my boyfriend and I were in a talking stage for a while before making it official. Getting to know each other in a very open way. He knew I was talking to another guy at the time, (and him to whatever girl) but we agreed (and I highly encouraged) that whatever else we were doing we told the other person at least to be safe (health-wise). I started falling in love with my now bf but the other guy I was talking to was suicidal and depressive. It was the first time I had been in a situation like that and the last time I tried telling him anything about not wanting to continue our fling, or whatever it was, he had a panic attack over the phone (to which I panicked and immediately started looking up ‚Äúwhat to do when someone is having a panic attack over the phone) to which the only thing that actually seemed to work was reassuring him that we were okay. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the type to purposefully manipulate. The next time he and I saw each other I tried telling him again, for sure this time. Except to my surprise he started to have another panic attack in front of me and it was the first I had witnessed. Quite bizarre, if it was an act he overplayed it, otherwise panic attacks are pretty scary when you feel like you‚Äôre the cause yet you want to find the solution. What started as a truthful confession of wanting to cut things off turned into me taking 10 steps back into reassuring him that everything was fine. It went as far as us kissing and having sex. Only when I had sex with him I felt really disgusting with myself. During and after. Having sex with someone you don‚Äôt like (anymore) is not a nice feeling at all and I‚Äôm a terribly emotional being so I can‚Äôt seperate sex and emotions. Had nothing to do with him and everything to do with my emotional state. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about the sex part to my now bf at that time but I did mention the rest of the story (sex was permissible between us, it‚Äôs the fact that I lied about it that hurts him he says). I mentioned the kiss and not the sex. I didn‚Äôt tell him because what happened didn‚Äôt feel right, and coming out feeling discgusted with yourself isn‚Äôt something you wanna share with a guy you‚Äôre really into and want to get into a relationship with. Or at least that‚Äôs where my head was at. I recently told him what actually happened and anytime it‚Äôs mentioned he says he‚Äôs rlly hurt by it and kinda guilts me (unwantingly) but doesn‚Äôt care to understand my point of view. Not to justify a lie, but coming from your significant other I expected a little more understanding?

39,pirpkb,1630900152,What can I say to her now that I hurt her feelings by basically accusing her of lying about a sick relative,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pirpkb/what_can_i_say_to_her_now_that_i_hurt_her/

We both had feelings, but went our seperate ways after we both did some hurtful things and had a talk about not being ready for a relationship.  It was tough, but needed to happen.  She wanted to stay friends, I thought no contact was best.  I reached out to her after two months because I found myself thinking about her again and the hurtful things were no where near my mind.  I still wanted her in my life, but recognized a relationship wouldn't be healthy for me.

Intially, she asked me to meet her so we could talk, but hours later intiates the conversation over text.  We talk about what happened.  I'm okay with letting it go and say I'd like to be friends while we work on ourselves.  We're carrying a conversation of near instant replies until 2am that night.

I'll get instant replies when I snap her.  If I don't snap her within a day or two, she will reach out to me.  

Strange thing... She views my snap stories anonymously some how and I don't get what I means.

I know this because one day I posted a snap story I wanted her to see.  Waited all day for her to see it.  She never showed up as a viewer.  Right when it's about to expire, I get a snap from her and her name magically appears as one of the first people to view my story.

46,pissyg,1630904775,Should I leave?,"My boyfriend and I dated from 2017-2020. He dumped me TWO days before Valentine‚Äôs Day via text. Then proceeded to take his new girlfriend on our Valentine‚Äôs Day plans. That just really hurt because from 2017-2020 we had never done anything for my birthday or Valentine‚Äôs Day.  Yet I always pulled out all the stops for him on Valentine‚Äôs and his birthday. He went on to date another girl (different from the girl he dated one day after dumping me) during 2020. May 2021 we got back together. I was so happy. Because the whole year I missed him and just wanted him back. I never entered anything serious the whole time  because in my heart I knew I only wanted him. But now he just seems to keep hurting me every weekend. He is either lying about where he is; who he is with or who is texting. I don‚Äôt know how to believe anything he says anymore. We keep Having the same arguments we had in previous years. He never wants to take me out still! He never ask to take photos; and when I take photos of the two of us and I send them to him, he doesn‚Äôt save them. Yet he has all his photos of his previous ex (the one he dated in 2020. Who he was loyal to; took on dates &amp; took photos with and they only dated for four months). He still texts her. We‚Äôve fought about it so many times; and every time he says he will stop but I catch him doing it again. He says he loves me and will change. But I don‚Äôt know if this will be any different from the last four years. I caught him texting her again on Thursday; he let me go through his phone . He kept telling me as i was going through it that me being so insecure and having to go through his phone is the reason it‚Äôs so hard to be with me. He made me feel so shit and insecure and pathetic for ever doubting him. Then I saw his texts with her on archived chats and I felt so betrayed that he had tried to make me feel crazy for suspecting. 
When I ask him why he won‚Äôt do these things; he used to try manipulate me into thinking it‚Äôs my fault because in 2017-2020 I was not the best partner. But he wasn‚Äôt either; which is what I don‚Äôt understand? I get I fucked up,and was disloyal before but he cheated on me countless times ; and when we got back together I was willing to start a fresh and try be better because I love him.
I told him he was manipulating me by saying that because if anything I should be the one with doubts . I then asked him ‚Äúwhy was it so easy for you to want to do those things for her and why is it hard to do them for me?‚Äù 
He told me ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to with her it just came naturally‚Äù. That just broke my heart. Because i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm asking for much; I just wanna go on dates, have someone who wants to take photos with me, kisses me in public not only when he is drunk and someone who doesn‚Äôt lie to me or cheat. It is so frustrating because I know he is capable of giving me what I want I guess it‚Äôs just not ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. I left his place after that. I haven‚Äôt seen him the whole weekend. He keeps texting and calling saying he still says he loves me and wants to be with me and he‚Äôll change. But I feel like I‚Äôd be an idiot to go back after everything. But a part of me thinks me maybe this time he will change. I mean if I could change; why can‚Äôt he?
This whole situation makes me feel like all those mean comments and things he did in 2017-2020 weren‚Äôt entirely my fault. Because this time I‚Äôm diagnosed and I‚Äôm on Meds; I‚Äôm doing therapy; I‚Äôm opening up, I‚Äôm not lashing out; I‚Äôm learning to communicate, I‚Äôm being loyal and not impulsive when I get hurt. And he is EXACTLY the same. The whole year we were apart I blamed myself that my illnesses and toxicity drove him away. I told myself maybe that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt do those things I wanted. I spent the whole year trying to fix myself; so if he ever came back I could show him I can be the girlfriend he wanted and deserved. And now he is back; and I‚Äôm trying so hard to do everything right. He tells me he loves how I‚Äôve grown and changed. If that‚Äôs true why isn‚Äôt it natural for him to take me out? I fixed myself; why can‚Äôt he just  love me? Why isn‚Äôt it natural?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pissyg/should_i_leave/

Initially, it was really friendly and I had no thoughts of pursuing anything, but then we started to talk more and I began to like him (he's hard not to like since he's so charming). He also showed mutual interest, but then he stopped talking to me for a couple of weeks. I started to realize he was becoming more distant right before he ghosted me. I tried texting him and calling him a few times before I took the hint. I just assumed that he lost interest and started to pursue someone else. However, he came back after ghosting me. He pretended as if nothing had happened and didn't bring up the fact that he ghosted me until I confronted him about it; only then did he tell me his depression and life overwhelmed him to the point where he didn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't understand this as I've never experienced a situation like this and dislike ghosting people/value communication. After confronting him, he told me he was sorry and he wanted to continue talking to me. Following his return, I wanted to be a little more distant because I didn't want to get hurt again. I think because of this he tried to communicate with me more? I gave in and I started to talk to him more, while still being cautious. But I started to like him even more and my attachment grew. Right before he ghosted me, he told me he didn't like me as much as I liked him, but after coming back, he told me he did and was just afraid of the reality. He can be very confusing, telling me he wants one thing but then doing the other and it has always been like this. I believed him when he said this because his actions started to match his words: he started to spend more time with me, was more vulnerable with me, and acted very kind and understanding. But like all things, it came to an end. Over the last few days, he started displaying the same behavior as before and started to become distant again. I asked him about it but he won't go into specifics. I ask to call, he declines saying he is busy or has a migraine. I message him, he takes longer to respond. And when he does respond, it is very short and doesn't put forth the effort to continue the conversation. I don't know what to do or think anymore. Did he find someone better than me?

I‚Äôm a certified personal trainer but I have a healthy one pack, eat whatever I want and exercise simply to slow my descent to obesity / for injury minimization. I am not a fitness Nazi and I don‚Äôt have any such expectations for my girlfriend. 

However, she feels differently. Here‚Äôs an approximate transcript of a conversation we just had:

Her: ‚ÄúMy friend said that when I move in with you, I‚Äôm probably going to have a big glow-up.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúYeah, it will be a lot of fun. When you move in, we can go to the gym together or you can take classes alone doing something you like and I‚Äôll do my own thing my friends.‚Äù

Her: Why do you have to do that?
Me: Huh?
Her: I‚Äôm telling you someone tells me something nice and you have to tell me that I need to exercise and that I‚Äôm fat and ugly.
Me: I didn‚Äôt say any of those things‚Ä¶
Her: You just did. Why do you have to do that? Why can‚Äôt you just let me tell a story about someone saying something nice about me without telling me I‚Äôm fat and ugly?
Me: I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Her: You did. You said I need to work out.
Me: I never said that. I said we could work out together and become a super fit couple.
Her: But that means that something is wrong with me now. So you‚Äôre basically saying I‚Äôm fat and ugly.
Me: As I‚Äôve said many times before, that is not what I meant and that is the opposite of how I view you.
(Repeat ad infinity ‚Äî or for two hours)

Any of you deal with this behavior? It‚Äôs exhausting and I don‚Äôt want to walk on eggshells with my future spouse ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs my current girlfriend or someone else. We regularly have this type of conversation and it‚Äôs tiring. It‚Äôs also having a huge impact on my attraction towards my girlfriend. I just don‚Äôt see a future with this type of behavior in it. I‚Äôve looked into it and it sounds like this type of behavior from her is referred to as ‚Äúmanipulative intentional misinterpretation.‚Äù 

From a website:

‚ÄúWhy People Manipulate

For some people, manipulation may be an inadvertent strategy for dealing with a cutthroat world in which discussing feelings is often taboo. Manipulation is part of the normal range of behavioral tactics, and most people engage in manipulative strategies from time to time. People whose primary style of interaction is manipulation, however, tend to share some traits in common. These include:

1. A need for control or power over others
2. A need to raise their own self-esteem
3. Fear of abandonment
4. Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or hopelessness
5.A willingness to prioritize their own feelings and desires over the needs and well-being of others‚Äù

Points 2-5 definitely sound like my girlfriend.

‚ÄúHow to Handle a Manipulator

Many of us are highly aware when we‚Äôre being manipulated, but are still left unsure of what to do. Because manipulators often play the victim, some victims of manipulation might excuse their behavior or insist that the manipulator doesn‚Äôt really know what he or she is doing. Manipulators thrive on hiding their motives, so it can be challenging to get them to admit their true intentions, and many people will refuse to do so even under pressure. Instead, try the following tactics:

1. Avoid allowing yourself to be shamed or guilted into doing something.
2. When a manipulator makes a covert threat, ask him or her about the threat.
3. Ask the manipulative person if he or she can tell you directly what he or she wants.
4. Avoid sharing how the manipulation makes you feel, as these feelings can later be used as a tactic by the manipulator.
5. Be direct, clear, and honest, and refuse to participate in the escalating game of manipulation.‚Äù

I chose actions 1 and 5, ending the call and asking for her to recognize that she‚Äôs being an overdramatic drama queen who is intentionally misinterpreting to create drama and to apologize. I also asked her to promise to stop being a drama queen in the future and picking random fights like this.

But given I‚Äôm in the eye of the storm, any advice? Should I end it before things get too serious and it‚Äôs harder to break away? I am losing a lot of attraction and trust in our relationship / her every time she does this and it‚Äôs very exhausting to avoid triggering her temper tantrums.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pitdem/intentional_misinterpretation_as_a_form_of/

It was so funny that I chuckled and wasn't as hard anymore. When she noticed this, she gave me a bit of a confused look, which made me laugh even more and it actually made me piss myself while I was still inside her.

I tried to explain to why I messed up, but she didn't want to hear me and went back to her place for the night.

Fast-forward to earlier today, I knew I needed to make it up to her. So I bought her a chocolate cake (because she said chocolate was her favorite) and I wanted to surprise her when she gets home from work by showing at her apartment with me waiting there. I also dressed up as Batman too because she said a couple months ago that he was her favorite super hero. While I was waiting for her to get there, I was getting nervous, and when I get nervous I start to drink. I messed up and drank way more than I should have, which made me come up with the stupidest plan to not have any pants on when she gets there so she can see that I'm not peeing myself. I know it sounds stupid, but when I was drunk, It sounded like the smartest plan ever.

So when she arrived, she saw me walk towards her drunk with my Batman cape and mask with my wiener hanging out holding a chocolate cake, and she peppersprayed me. This caused me to drop the cake on my cock and roll on the floor uncontrollably with pain while also staining her freshly steam-cleaned carpet while I was rolling. It took me a couple minutes to explain to her it was me and my plan and everything. She got really mad and told me to leave.

61,pitrdw,1630909054,I (21 m) have had my confidence torn down and can‚Äôt trust women anymore.,"I‚Äôm not sure how to start this. I‚Äôm new to this thread and Reddit in general. Lately I‚Äôve been feeling very unwanted. I‚Äôve never been in an actual relationship or even dating territory. It‚Äôs not that I am unattractive or have a toxic personality (or at least I hope not), but women seem to always want to be ‚Äújust friends‚Äù with me. I am always the one people want to vent to or sometimes ask advice. I basically feel like a free therapist, and while I am psych major wanting to go into the field of therapy, I don‚Äôt want my social or romantic life to consist of only that. 

I‚Äôve been led on by women. Lied to. Used as a self esteem booster and then forgotten about, just to be picked back up again when she is feeling down. Used as a rebound guy. I can never be in any situation. That is normal. It is always complicated. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I have to tell women that if they don‚Äôt like me in that way, to just tell me so I know and I don‚Äôt have to make a fool of myself. And that only made her take even longer to tell me (went on for five months, decided she didn‚Äôt like me that way in February, didn‚Äôt actually tell me until May).

I have been on one ACTUAL date and that was the only girl who I got to be upfront with me. We are still friends but she is moving. 

I am tired of being used. I really want someone to actually care about me. I want someone to look at me and want me as a person, not just want something from me. But I can‚Äôt trust women anymore. My confidence is at an all time low, and I am severely depressed. I don‚Äôt know if there is something wrong with my personality. I don‚Äôt know what I hope to find by posting this. I know it turned into a bit of a rant, and I appreciate those of you who stuck around this far. I might consider posting full stories of some of these situations if this ends up helping. Any and all advice is appreciated.

62,pitzvr,1630910167,You'll never be able to change someones physical preferences re: Height / weight,"I see a lot of men posting on this sub complaining about womens preferences around height / fitness. In the last few days there has been a lot of posts comparing men demanding 'fit' bodies to women demanding 'tall' bodies. 

As a short man, I am used to being looked over (lol) for taller men. I have been tempted to come here and vent too, or bite back at women who say i'm too short. But i've realised there's no point. 

You can't change someones preferences. People will continue to act on their preferences in silence. Most won't tell you you are being rejected due to height / weight / attractiveness. They'll just say there wasnt a connection - and that's ok. 

Before posting on here, it's worth considering if you're actually going to lead to meaningful change - it's one thing to vent, but another to demand strangers change their physical standards for you. 

I recently reached out to an ex to ask why she seems much happier when her new boyfriend than she was with me, as I always suspected it was my height. She said a few things, but in the end admitted the attraction never came for her, even though she tried. She was careful not to mention my height but i read the subtext. 

I ended up taking a few days to think about what she said - she tried to build the attraction, but couldn't. Many things are out of our control - my height one of them, her attraction another. Who am I to demand another change their standards? 

The only thing I can do is become a better man with more to offer than my height.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pitzvr/youll_never_be_able_to_change_someones_physical/

This was not affiliated with my school by the way. On our last day working together I asked him if he wanted to get a drink with me to celebrate my finishing my program. He said yes. I should also mention that we'd mostly interacted over zoom prior to this, aside from once in early August when we did an in-person session at a Starbucks.

We decide to go to a bar and get some drinks and we split fries. We talked about past relationships, dating apps, etc. Things seemed to be going well, at least I thought. I went to the bathroom and when I came back, Dan paid the bill and asked me if I wanted to go on a walk with him and get a hot drink. Usually when someone asks if you want to go to a secondary location that means they're interested and want to spend more time with you, right?

So we go to a Starbucks, I get us some tea and we sit outside. We're sitting pretty close together on some steps for a while, talking for a bit. He indicated that he wanted to head home because he had some chores in the morning so I thought that it was my time to make a move. So I asked, ""should I make a move?"" To my surprise, he says no, that due to living with his parents due to the pandemic, he hasn't thought about dating and isn't something he's interested in right now. That it's hard meeting people now, especially people who live nearby who would want to go on walks and listen to audiobooks. Anyway I went home feeling incredibly dejected.

The next day I texted him that I'd be down to be walking buddies if it wasn't awkward for him. He said ""Great, glad to hear it,"" and we made small talk over text for a bit. A few days later I asked him if he was busy over the long weekend and wanted to go on a walk. He texted me, ""A friendly walk or are you secretly trying to change my mind?"" I said I wanted a friendly walk and then he didn't answer and I texted him 6 hours later asking if that's a no to the walk. He said he's not opposed to it but maybe not this weekend.

It‚Äôs rural round here and I don‚Äôt have any friends and work busy so I haven‚Äôt been able to join things to meet people. I work from home full time.
Anyway, I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend but as soon as I moved back I met the most amazing man. The relationship has progressed and now he‚Äôs my boyfriend and I am totally smitten by him and extremely happy.

I can‚Äôt move out either as he‚Äôs looking for a new job which is likely going to be London but I don‚Äôt want to move to London yet in case his job is somewhere else.

For example - fat guy complains he can't get hot women, gets scolded for being entitled and gets told to go to gym and get that muscular physique if he wants to date women... OK, fair enough, but then, when a guy talks about going to gym to attract women, suddenly that's also a BAD THING and he should not go to gym to become attractive and being hot doesn't mean he will get hot women... 

Another one - a guy says he's about to give up trying - people accuse him of being a wimp, a loser etc., then the same guy decides he will not give up after all and will try dating, then he gets told he shouldn't try since obviously there's something wrong with him and shouldn't bother women at all..

Guys always get told to be aggressive but also not be too ""creepy"" but do you know how hard it is to find the fine balance between these two? And especially on internet there seems to be this bias against men who struggle with dating - every time it is 100% the guys fault and he should do better but when he decides to better to get women, suddenly that's bad and he shouldn't focus on women but ""just be happy single""... and then get shamed for being a single loser who can't get laid.

80,piw3vb,1630920567,28 F dating 30 M. Am I a toxic partner?,"I'll try to keep it short. My ex and I date for about 1.5 yrs. Last summer (you can read my old posts), he tested my trust about a FWB. We continued to fight because I felt like I couldn't trust him, but somehow we ended up moving in together in May.

My background is that I was in a VERY abusive relationship for 4 years before this.. after moving in together, I would feel triggered by things he did (having his phone on silent, bringing it into the bathroom with him, working every weekend by choice..I felt lonely most of the time we lived together- I make triple what he makes salary wise, so I always had to pay for my own way. Every time I tried to talk to him about my insecurity, needing some reassurance, he would get defensive and angry.

The tipping point where I was so hurt was his best friend (that I've had overnight camping trips with) sends him a text of a girl they used to spend time with in a bikini. I was there when he got it, got upset and he told me that he wouldn't tell me about it if I hadn't have been there. I felt like my trust was violated again.

We only lived together for 2-3 months before I relapsed being 6 months sober. Before the relapse, I had extreme work stress with being on the front lines, my dog of 18+ years had to be put down...I needed extra love. He broke up with me following one of my last trips out to see my grandparents before they die.

After fighting, he decided to stay. But I felt like he wanted out. I tried to include him in my life with my family, and now everyone is saying that they could see he wasn't in it. This last week I texted him about a new job offer- he sent me ""shit, now you have options"" and then was out all night with his friends. I was so upset that my partner was not there for me, and when I tried to talk to him about it we ended up fighting.

When we broke up, he told me that he didn't see a future with me because he didn't want to end up like his parents that fight all the time. He told me that he felt we didn't have the same world view because my addiction took off where I had called out of work a few times. He told me that this was toxic and he needed to protect himself to be healthy.

Real kicker is, I was just offered 2 different job opportunities at work, I'm going back to therapy. But he didnt want to stay to see if things could get better. I left our apartment to stay with my parents, and I've been the only one to reach out. He's going to be in our apartment until Thursday and then I'm going back to move out my stuff. He hasn't tried to talk to me at all. I feel so poorly about the way we had argued, that caused him to fall out of love with me. I just wasn't being given what I needed. It was really hard. I felt like if I planned dates, asked for more of his time...it wouldn't be appreciated. Now he says he's the only one who put work into us.

I feel gutted, shredded. I wanted to be with this person at one point for the rest of my life. I guess I just need some reassurance that I wasn't the toxic one, and that I did the right thing by telling him we needed to break up since it was obvious his heart wasn't in it anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/piw3vb/28_f_dating_30_m_am_i_a_toxic_partner/

87,pix6qd,1630925797,Third time is the charm?,"Do you believe it's possible for things to work out if you have tried twice and it didn't work?

-----------------------------

During new year's eve I slept with someone. Someone I just knew through mutual friends. We discovered we have amazing sexual chemistry, like, out of this world. We tried to see if there was dating material, but we went too far too soon, she got scared and wanted to be just friends. I said I needed some time away from her to get my feelings straight. We stopped talking for 3 months. 

Late May we started talking again, some flirting here and there, and we eventually got in a fwb situation. We started developing feelings, and I may have went too far again and was too intense. Around late July she told some of her friends that we were kinda together. After this moment, she started to pull back. I guess this scared her again? From then on, things only got worse... I pulled, she pushed, we argue about needs not being met, being just fwb again but I wasn't having any of the benefits... Last week we argued about something, and I said I needed a short break. She was going on vacation so this was a good time for this as we would be spending time apart. Since then, we've texted once or twice, with a tiny bit of flirting but nothing extra.

But then I go on her Twitter and see that she's been liking this guy's pics and tweets, only his', and only her and her best girl friend like it, and my guess is that they're definitely talking and she's interested in him. 

Part of me is ok with this, and part of me is having a hard time accepting it. If this is true, I will probably have to get away from her again in order to protect myself, even though I really like her. But I don't want to close all doors for the future. I really do think we can have something amazing if we manage to get a grip on our emotions and expectations. 

I know that, when she gets back next week and we talk, she's going to say she just wants to stay friends. I want to make it clear that I can't hang out with her for a while so I can get my head straight, but that I also don't blame her for anything and that I still would do it all over again, and that I'm open for it in the future. But I also don't want this to make her take me for granted and lose attraction to me. Don't want her to think she can have me at any moment. I want her to feel that she really lost me and to rethink if this is what she really wants...

I know this sounds crazy, but I guess I would just like to try a third time eventually and was wondering if anyone has been through something similar",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pix6qd/third_time_is_the_charm/
88,pix7dg,1630925881,30M) dumped me (30F) and I feel like the biggest idiot.,"Hi everyone,

Just wanted to write all this down and get it out. 

I was in a relationship with someone that I met on Tinder for the last 3 months. I saw some red flags but kind of buried my head in the sand. 

He claimed that was was always broke, despite earning a lot more than myself. He would say he only had ¬£200 left after getting paid. But he never paid rent or anything like that as his dad owns the property. I would end up sending him money through the month, I also paid for everything while we were together. 
Which is fine, but the numbers didn‚Äôt add up to me and I figured he should have a lot more left over than what he was telling me. I would ask questions about where his money was going. 

He also has a female best friend, who is also friends with his ex. And they‚Äôre due to go on holiday together next year. Just the two of them. So I would ask if they‚Äôre sharing a room and a bed. 
They would text each other everyday and he said that he would tell her everything.  I would see how he would smile when he text her.  I would ask if he was texting her and if she was okay and apparently that was too much to ask. 
I did feel it would be inappropriate for them to share a bed while he was in a relationship with me. 

He told me that my trust issues are too much and that it was reminding him of his ex when she would question who he was taking to and where he was going etc and that it made him cringe. 

Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to told me that I was asking valid questions. They also think that he was using me for my money. I even bought him an Nintendo Switch on finance as his credit score is 0 and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it himself. 

I just feel like a big idiot and that I‚Äôm partly to blame. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have asked as many questions. 
I felt like I was in the right to do so with him taking so much money from me though. 

He didn‚Äôt even try and have a conversation with me about any of this. Just decided to cut it off and tbh I do feel like his best friend probably does have a hand in some of this. 

The last time he was here last weekend, we were talking about the future and then when he left last Tuesday, he called and dumped me later that night. 

I‚Äôm still just trying to make sense of all of this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pix7dg/30m_dumped_me_30f_and_i_feel_like_the_biggest/

92,pixjim,1630927363,Should I move on or is there a tiny chance to get to know her better?,"Some time ago I met a nice woman at work, we had a really nice conversation. Later I asked her out for a dance class and she agreed. I really want to learn dancing for myself and was looking for a fitting partner a while. In dancing, we both laughed a lot and and harmonized pretty well. She told me she really liked it and it was a cool evening for her. I made her some compliments - how good she looks, how well we danced together. We had a lot of fun in this dance evening.

She told me about her hobbies - she loves board games -  and so I asked her if I could join her group for one board game evening to have some good times and maybe I could form new friendships this way. So overall a good deal.
Then she suddenly answered it is too much for her - she doesn't like mixing private and business that much. She clearly did not feel comfortable about this and In didn't mean it that way - I don't want to harass her and treat her with respect. I think this is always important.

So I assumed this was a big stop sign. Or was I"" too fast"" or ""too clingy"" ? Did I corner her too much in my actions?
Now this went somehow bad. But do I interpret too much into this case? 
In the near future I will focus on my sports career and I already am in active search for a new dance partner. A hard task in covid-times, but I can and will do it.

But otherwise I really want to get to know her better.  Im not sure if I am into her, but she definitively has a great character and an interesting personality. She is really attractive too. We share some hobbies. She is clearly a good catch. Should I ask her for a date and tell her that I really want to get to know her better in private in a couple of days/weeks after holding my feet still or should I move on? From my point of view I should move on for now. Do you have any advice for me? Thank you all!

I‚Äôve been texting a girl for a couple of months. We immediately hit it off and have been talking about everything and anything. From our conversations I‚Äôm getting the impression she‚Äôs never had a partner before. She‚Äôs very quiet and assuming she doesn‚Äôt get much attention in that way, but I‚Äôm really falling for her. I‚Äôm also just fresh out of a relationship that gave me nothing but problems, and my girlfriend was the completely opposite of her. She knows about her and knows who she is.  


I started to drop some hints that I‚Äôm interested. I honestly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs had attention before and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. Worst of all she doesn‚Äôt seem to be on her phone a lot, especially if she‚Äôs around people. My message will be sitting there unopened for 3-4 hours at times. When she does reply, it‚Äôs always lengthy with questions in it so I understand it takes time to write it.  


She‚Äôs just started Uni today on a short term course so she‚Äôll be back home soon. Before she left, I messaged her to say I think she‚Äôs awesome and not to change a thing to suit anyone else. She replied saying ‚Äúaww that‚Äôs such a nice thing to say, thank you‚Äù and she continued to update me while arriving at her accommodation. Last week we talked about something we want to do together when we‚Äôre both free.  


I‚Äôm just really unsure how to go forward. She mentioned a few weeks ago she finds it hard to commit as she likes her independence, but also said it would be nice to be settled. I don‚Äôt want to do something else to show how I feel, in case I start pushing her away. This is her first week of Uni so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs better that I back off and give her some space? Overthinking everything at this point.
