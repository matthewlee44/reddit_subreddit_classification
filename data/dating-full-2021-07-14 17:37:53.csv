I'm now experiencing life as a single person, pretty much for the first time and have been seeing a few different women. In spite of body image issues carrying over from my childhood, I'm now in admittedly excellent shape with a good, muscular physique.

My question is, how do I stop doubting myself when a girl is into me or seriously coming onto me? It's such a foreign concept (given that I was overweight and then in a long term relationship for four years).

To  truly understand yourself and women you need to experience dating a woman who's completely burned out.

I found her via a Zoom dating group online somewhere locally. I would meet up with her about twice a week. 

Here's a background. I'm 22M and this is my first ever relationship. I've always lacked the social skills and confidence in the past. But over the last 2 months I've gone through a massive fashion, looks and especially confidence makeover. I've talked to people and joined various groups. And then I found this girl. I found her by messaging her after the Zoom meeting was over from the dating group and we exchanged numbers then talked. She liked how positive I was at thinking and how naturally good looking I am. I really only chose her because the dating group was for recommended (not required) for 25+. I joined that in the first place to hear the stories.

After we spoke on the phone and got to introduce ourselves about our background, I asked her to an official date and she said yes! We met up at an outdoor patio (most events are closed). Then she really showed interest in me. As we kept hanging out in person and going out for walks to the park, things were going better and we got to know each others hobbies. We would also add each other on Instagram.

My parents wanted to know her so they decided to invite her to our front porch for a picnic 2 days ago. I didn't tell them what she looked like since they didn't ask. When she arrived, what happened was my parents told her to wait outside and called me to come inside to ""help them out"". Then they took me to my basement and was shocked at me. They didn't support me dating her because she was not only taller than me but also looked stronger according to them. Oh not to mention she's White while I'm Asian. I had no problem dating her. I didn't care that much about what she looked like. She just happened to click with me.

Luckily we had a good time at the picnic and we were all happy without any arguments. After she left, I went home and started worrying. How could this relationship even last? It's just not a typical relationship you see on media. I really feared that this would become a problem.

1. She's taller and stronger than me. She's 6'1 while I'm 5'8 at best and she could deadlift ~200 lbs. Idk but height seems to be a common dealbreaker in dating sites.

2. She's 27F while I'm 22M. Rarely do women date younger. 

3. She's White but I'm Asian. I know there's this ""AMWF"" sorta thing but neither of us are like anime ""weeaboo"" fans. 

I can go into more details but I think that's more than enough. I was just building confidence this last few months only to be given a tough test.

I texted him an ""I had fun"" text after and he said he had fun as well.

Cue me stressing out about if he was genuine about getting together again! A few days later, he texted me asking if I wanted to go for a walk once the weather gets better.

Unless you are one of the few men out who is fortunate to gets a consistent, ongoing flow of new likes and matches daily, most guys eventually operate in a mode where they have no time to waste. By this, I mean that after they've realized how online dating works in terms of matches and conversations that seem promising and like they could turn into a date instead abruptly disappearing, getting breadcrumbed, having to wait days for a response, not getting a response after matching at all, etc., guys get into a habit of assuming that if a woman isn't responding in a timely fashion or is dragging her feet on meeting, she's just not into him, so it's best not to waste time and just move on. 

Meanwhile, women are more consistent with the amount of likes and matches they receive. If one falls through, another will likely be there to explore. Because of that, there's no need for them to rush into meeting up with a guy right away. If she's talking to multiple guys at once, which is always likely, she doesn't need to respond to every single one of them within 24-48 hours since she can just rotate her focus accordingly based on which person she's most interested in, while keeping the others on the backburner if need be.

To a woman, it's not really a big deal if a match falls through, but to a guy, it's usually viewed as a wasted investment in time since most men aren't juggling multiple match options at once who all want to meet up for a date. At best, he's got one strong option and one that might be as well, but in both scenarios, either could fall apart without notice. 

It creates communication chaos. Guys want to have a good feeling that conversation is going somewhere sooner than women do because they want to know they aren't just wasting their time on someone who is going to disappear on them, where as women are being laid back about it wanting to ensure they are talking to what they perceive to be their ""best"" option. Guys catastrophize the situation sooner than women do and give up, and women get annoyed when a guy sends them a graceful exit message after she left him on read for 3 days.

Her and I always got along and nothing ever happened while we lived together. I always had a tiny crush on her. She did have a boyfriend for just about the whole time as well, but i truly felt she was attracted to me. Anyway, her BF was a total scumbag. He was the type to tell her who she can and cannot hang out with. She was suffocated by it, so they broke up this past May. I think it really hurt her, she tried so hard to make it work. 

During the middle of May, our lease ended and we got our own places off campus. I asked her how moving went over the phone and it ended up becoming this long 2 week conversation after that where we would exchange texts, Snapchats, FaceTime, etc. After some time, she told me she really liked me and i told her i felt the same way. We started hanging out and it was perfect. She was everything I’ve ever wanted in a girl. We got along so well. 

After a few hangouts, we ended up making out a little bit and that was it. We held hands a few times too, so it was super slow in my opinion. Nothing too over the top. 

I notice she starts getting pretty distant, i was able to notice through text and decided to just ask her about it, she felt we were on two different levels. She said she really liked me but thinks it would be best to “be friends from here on out.” Which doesn’t make clear sense to me. I mean things were awesome, how could she just feel that way? Her friends closest to her have spoken to me about maybe waiting around for her, to start as friends and build that foundation and that maybe she’d come around. I’m all for it, but part of me feels she has other options, and she’s looking at everything else. Or maybe she wants a little freedom after her relationship in May. I don’t know. She isn’t the type to sleep around. She’s never had sex or anything like that and wants to wait until marriage. 

I really like her and I would love to wait. But it bothers me how she can just ignore my texts and move on after something so much better than her last relationship. It’s pretty discouraging.

Made a post last week about a guy that gave me flowers and how happy it made me. Just an update because of another thread I saw on reddit. TLDR at the bottom.

When I first started talking with this guy, there was not a connection through our messaging and we ended up not talking for a week. Well he ended up messaging me and asking what he did wrong and how he can self correct and I explained why I stopped messaging with him. The conversation went from there and I agreed to our infamous coffee date where he took my favorite flowers. There were very mixed feelings on this sub about it but I was happy he had done that in spite of us not having a great connection to start with. So I agreed to a second lunch date. Again, the connection wasn't too great but it was nice and it was a little more fun than the coffee date. I figured it was maybe one of those things that needed to take time and so I said yes to a Saturday night date. 

When I say that the date was perfect. We had so much fun, so much laughter and a great connection. He was a gentleman. We did kiss and WOW. I stayed out an hour longer than I had intended. But something just felt off, I picked up on some cues that stayed in the back of my mind and I went home and confided in my best friend that I had a feeling he may be a heavy drinker. Which is unfortunate as I've been in 2 relationships with people just like this and definitely something I want to stay away from. But it also felt too early to speculate so I pinned it in my brain to revisit over the next few weeks of talking. 

We messaged all day on Sunday and all night until I went to bed around 10pm and wished him goodnight. He was apparently at his cousin's house with his son. Then between 12 am and 1:30 am, he sent a bunch of messages, saying a lot of really sweet things but also stuff that probably shouldn't be said after just 3 dates (I'm not entirely sure because, well, I don't typically date) . As I was reading the messages, I could tell he was drunk and of course he confirmed this when he said he was in fact drunk.  He said goodnight around 1:30 am. I woke up to his messages at 6 am and responded with a simple ""you're very sweet, hope you have a good day"". Crickets. I messaged him when i left work that afternoon something along the lines of hope you're okay haven't heard from you. Crickets. And for some reason I was sitting at home eating dinner when the thought occurred to me that HE WAS IN JAIL. I went to bed at 9 that night kind of upset and also worried about him. When I woke up at about 5 am and he still had not said anything, I looked up his county's inmate roster and sure enough there he was. Booked 7-12-21 at 4:16 am. DWI with a child under 15 in the vehicle AND a city warrant already out for his arrest. 

I was disappointed, shocked, feeling sad for his kid, feeling upset that I attracted yet another person like this or maybe that I just didn't listen to my gut instinct when we initially began talking. And also upset about the flowers! I just kept thinking about everyone here who thought the flowers were a little off and cringe and a bunch of other things. I'm sad I gave it a chance after I felt something was off because after the 3rd date, I was actually really interested in him. I ignored all of my feelings just for the universe to have to step in and say this man ain't for you sis, we putting him in jail. I also feel guilty for feeling grateful in a way for this happening, because while it saves me the trouble of potentially falling for him and finding out later the kind of person he might be, this man's son is now alone and he's in jail. 

My emotions are kind of everywhere even though I told myself I'm over it. 
Anyway, next time I get flowers on a first date, I won't be going on a second.

My most recent date was last night. I went out with a 38m that I marched with on tinder. He works with the elderly in the medical field, that immediately struck a sweet cord with me. We had one great conversation and then moved the convo over to text. At around 2pm he inquired if I would be free that night to have a drink. I had plans for a different date so I tried to confirm only to be left with no response. I tell 38m “I have found myself available! What did you have in mind?” Cue radio silence for a couple days. Meanwhile a different tinder match asked to have a drink as well, to which I obliged (I will make a separate post for that;) ). 
Eventually, 38m reaches out with an apology for ghosting for a few days and an excuse that “he has been all over the place because a close friend was recently diagnosed with cancer.” My bullshit meters start going off here because even if that was true, why would you ask to go on a date if you are so distraught and distracted? But it might be the truth and well he’s cute looking so I give him another shot. 
He asks if I am free that night or the following. I am free and say as much. He responds that I should text him when I am done with work, to see where the afternoon takes us. Listen, I can get down with some spontaneity but why would I commit to an evening that you clearly are not willing to commit to yourself? I let him know that because he already “ghosted” once  that we should just make plans for when he knows he will be available. We make plans for the following evening. 
He did confirm the date, showed up on time, and treated me to a pizza. 
Unlike some many of my other dates, he seemed to weigh the same as he did in his photos! Tiny win. He did look a bit older and less fit in person though. 
He shares that he has a toddler aged son that he shares custody with and that with how busy his life is he generally only gets 5 hours of sleep. At the same time, supposedly his life is very flexible. 
There were many lulls in the conversation and I felt like I asked most of the questions. The waiter mistakenly thought they had already dropped the check when they had not, and it was a bit painful sitting there waiting for it to arrive. Wasn’t very quick to smile. We finally get the chance to leave and he just says we’ll text me if you feel like getting dinner again, shrug. It was so lackluster that I’m not interested in trying again.

While on the date, I saw a different failed first date walk by. He had judging eyes!! He still looked more appealing than the man in front of me tho..

The possibility?? So someone showers a person with love and the reaction is to get the fuck out? I'm sorry but unless expressing love is a crime, then jumping to the conclusion that the expression of love only can be the result of a narcissistic partner, says more about you than them. 

My point is that the existence of the concept of L-bomb should not and cannot make us cautious of real, genuine expression of love. Love is one of the most beautiful things in the world- dont let some fucktads from your past ruin the potentially pure people in your future ❤

I know I was not ready a couple of years ago and I am ready now. The only thing is that I am nervous how a guy would respond to this. 
For the last two to three months I have been talking to a guy I met online. We haven’t met in real life yet because I want to FaceTime him first. He understood this and we are planning on FaceTiming for the first time somewhere this week. We have been talking about what we want and he told me that he (just like me) is interested in a serious, monogamous relationship not something casual. I asked him what type of person he is in relationships and he told me that he has never dated someone or even been on a date. Apparently he is not great in talking to women. I am aware of the fact that this does not necessarily mean that he is a virgin. We haven’t really talked about sex and he doesn’t know that I am virgin. He seems like a nice, relaxed guy who has said things like “why rush things when you have plenty of time?” so I have feeling that this would not really bother him but I am still
nervous to tell him eventually.
I am not planning on when I am going to tell him. I think when the topic arises I am just gonna be honest. I haven’t had sex yet and I am not on birth control. I am going to get an copper IUD when it is necessary.

What do you think? I am overthinking everything so I need the perspective of an outsider.

Just to give me more time.”  So I decided to tell him some days at the end of this week that I think I might have time, and he responded something like “ok I’ll see what I have going 😊” 

In the past, he has given me more details (ie telling me he’s figuring a plan with family or friends and will get back to me) and especially if I told him I need to know by a certain day to better plan my week, he’d get back to me immediately the day after.  He also still texts me every day saying good morning, asking what I’m up to, and us both sharing details of our day and keeping convo going overall (and I don’t mean on that sporadic way that people who I believe wanna put you on a back burner will).  Even after I said “sounds good!” today in response to seeing what he has going, he asked me what I’m up to now.  

Basically he seems to be showing interest in me and in staying in touch, and he’s always been good about planning and eagerly agreed, but I’m not sure what to make of his response today.  It’s neither dry nor is it committal either.

Hope you're all well. I feel a bit stupid at the moment and I would like if anyone could offer some insight. 

I met this guy a couple of months ago on a work trip, we got drinks and hung out for a few hours - we didn't do anything but we added eachother's numbers and on FB so we kept talking. Things seemed to be going fine, he mentioned he used his tablet instead of his phone to talk to me because his work location was in the outback so there was no connection with one provider, can confirm the internet there is terrible. 

He works 3 weeks in the outback and then he's home in the city for a week at a time. First time we met he told me about his wife that broke up with him a year ago due to his working schedule and now she has a new boyfriend. He's a single dad with two kids. I'll be honest, I wasn't very interested and we weren't even flirting at this point so I see no reason to lie. When he was back home, he texted a little bit and called me (for like hours at a time) so it was fine. A week later he let me know he couldn't talk to me for 2 days and said he would call to explain, I didn't really mind but then he blocked me on facebook. He called me to say his brother had a breakdown, relapsed and had to stay with him for a few days. 

When I confronted about the random blocking, he said he did it by accident and he actually did it to a few of his other friends too because he's 'shit with technology'. Anyway, it's been like 4 weeks and he's not bothered to unblock me on Facebook but still talks to me on Whatsapp. I'm supposed to see him this weekend and he was going back home yesterday, he said to me 'I'm going to be busy with my kids for a couple of days so I'll talk to you in 3 days when you get here'. Now, I didn't get annoyed cos of the kids... I got annoyed cos that just seemed weird. So I said to him, 'I have to know, are you 100% not married?' and he said 'really, of course I am not'. 

Now, absolutely nothing else he has said to me has been a lie, he is a really honest person and he helped me out immensely when I was working out where he was. However, that message he sent me yesterday gave me a bad feeling in my gut I can't shake. I'm not sure whether I should take what he said at face value and be more trusting, or just cut this off.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,898316,public,self,Do I break things off?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/okhl7z/do_i_break_things_off/,all_ads,6,,,

I'm a good looking dude, in shape, and love meeting girls but my game sucks currently. Here are a few things I've learned that I think can help you if you're just starting out that I've noticed helped me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

1) **DO NOT BE THIRSTY** \- Desperation is extremely unattractive. Clingy and neediness are an immediate no no. I don't care if this girl is the fucking one,  the hottest girl that has ever given you attention, or has the perfect body and personality. Treat her like one of your home boys regarding attention. Don't give her too much attention and not too little. MISTAKE I DID: I would text consistently and craved attention from this girl so much that I drove her away. It's annoying when you're trying to live your life and people are just consistently blasting you for small talk, especially in the beginning! Try your best to keep most of the talking in person, where it actually matters.

&amp;#x200B;

2) **DON'T BE TOO SERIOUS** \- When ladies have a good time and can laugh freely they melt in comfort. Them being comfortable around is soooo important when it comes to building chemistry, either emotionally or sexually. When went on my first few dates I would take it soo serious, I was a boring mess. Honestly looking back I wouldn't even want to date myself . So loosen up, compliment them, dance, be cheesy, be weird, be cute, but most importantly BE YOU. Showing who YOU ARE is very attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

3) **IF THERE'S PLEASURE, THERE MIGHT BE PAIN** \- It's life. Dating is hard and emotions will take over when you have a deep connection with someone. When that person leaves or doesn't feel the same way it will HURT... It is normal to feel pain, don't run away from it. Allow yourself to feel what you have to feel but the next part is really important so pay attention.... YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE because it didn't work out. Relationships are so complicated and many things are out of your control. Don't identify with being a failure because it failed. . just as you wouldn't identify yourself as a plumber because you repaired your toilet. Same thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) **LEARN FROM EVERY DATE** \- I'll admit, I still suck at dating but I've learned SOOO much from every date. There is something to learn from every date. A girl did something you didn't like? Good, you learned. She didn't show up on time? Good, now you know what not to do to others.  A girl is texting you way too much? Good, now you know not to text people too much. My point is learn from everything. The interactions, the feelings you get, how someone else treated you, everything is a learning experience, even the FAILURES. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright that's all I got. If you got some tips drop them down there in that cute little box. All the best in your journey. Remember, have fun, have sex, be kind, sexy, but most importantly BE YOU.

He's always trying to focus on work, research, or setting up his business. Yet he's looking for a long term partner. At first he went all in emotionally way too far, talking about marriage, babies, living together. I didn't trust him, didn't react how he expected, and he dialed it back. 

But it seems like he thinks a relationship is just binding yourself to a person instead of really being intimate. 

A part of me doesn't care that much, but most of me has given up on dating in a large sense. It seems impossible to find someone emotionally, sexually, physically, and financially attractive at the same time. I also just am not that interested in building a life with a man my age either.

We have fun together, but sometimes it's really hard to hold a conversation. I know there's a lot more to her than this. But she also sometimes just doesn't text me back, usually when it's not specific to making plans - those are always quick responses. She's told me she thinks she's awkward and that she gets really anxious, and that she needs a guy who is very outgoing because she has trouble opening up. I used to just tell people it takes me 3 months to open up and be myself for people. Something I think through all my therapy I've gotten rid of and I'm now myself from day 1, but I recognize that in other people now too.
