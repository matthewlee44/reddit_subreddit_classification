11,ni7wq4,1621647427,This really needs to be a Hallmark Movie.,"True story: me, a Canadian who speaks no Spanish and has 5+ years of salsa dance gets invited to a venue up in the middle of nowhere during the pandemic where a great live salsa band is playing. I i knew the music. I didn't know the band. Not many of my other salsa friends went. So it was essentially me and a few others.

She noticed me first. She appeared out of nowhere. I didnt think much at first. As the night rolled on she definitely made herself known. Her girl friend danced her in front of me and then introduced us together.

She introduced herself to me with a very unique name, Raiza. Rolling her 'R's as she has done so. Then told.me that she did not speak English. And i said i did not speak Spanish.

She intrigued me. She is adorable. Up until that moment, no woman has ever gone that length for me to notice her. And she was around.my age.

Then i would not dance with no other when i saw her standing there (like the Beatles song . . . and the title of this love story).

That night, we exchanged numbers. I started using Google Translate for texting. She was doing the same. And we both started using DuoLingo to learn each others languages (there are the sponsors) thus taking communication to a whole new level.

We started dating.

Then one weekend, i was given a bombshell. She is here.on a work visa that was about to expire. Advice to me: stay in the moment. Always stay in the moment. 

Another bombshell. She left for home tonight, May 21st. Home for her is Chile. 

Every moment had to count. Tell her how I feel. What i desire. Show her my world. Show her my character. This built up to the point where we made love. Not sex. Not fucking. Love.

I dont.know when she will be back. She has never asked for money and she is the one who has.given me gifts. Lifted me up with positivity. She has more soul than some people in this country.

So the happy ending in my Hallmark movie? I want us to meet each other at the airport. Embrace. Begin a bachata. Fade. Roll credits.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni7wq4/this_really_needs_to_be_a_hallmark_movie/

I’ve had only one girlfriend like 9 years ago and I know what physical attraction looks like, I know there are signs of interest and physical reciprocation to touch etc, I definitely do not have  any of that in 9 years of trying with women.

22,ni9v5j,1621654614,Why do people often assume I'm in a relationship or even married when I'm actually (painfully) single?,"I'm 24 F and work in a healthcare setting with some patient contact, and just in the past week or so I've gotten several comments from patients/complete strangers asking if I was married or if I had a boyfriend. The word ""boyfriend"" is understandable, but I can't understand why people keep saying ""husband' or ""married."" One was even an assumption, not a question, in that I had laughed at one point during the conversation and the patient randomly told me ""I love your laugh...I bet your husband or boyfriend loves it too."" And then when I told her that I did not have a husband or boyfriend, she then told me that I would ""really like her youngest son"" who was (what she thought) around my age...19.

And that's one of the stranger things, because I often get mistaken for younger than my actual age. Most people think I'm a student in high school or college, so it's not like I look especially mature enough to be settled down. I'm also slim and dress pretty typical for someone in their early-20s (more casual/athletic clothing) so my style probably reads young as well. It isn't like I'm wearing some kind of power suit or something that would make me seem older, lol. But it's not just strangers- even my mom has said that she thinks that I will get married at the earliest age out of my siblings (there's four of us). But when I asked her what her reasoning was, she just told me she didn't know and ""just had a feeling.""

However, the painful reality is that I'm the only one in my family who is single while the rest of my siblings are either already married or in serious relationships. I've also only been in one relationship and that ended more than 3 years ago. I'm also pretty soft spoken and introverted, so it's not like I have a crazy social life or tons of dates lined up all the time. And if anything, I'm more of an independent/non-conformist type so I definitely wouldn't consider myself a traditional type who is eager to get settled down and start a family. I'm not even sure if I ever want to have kids in the future.

Is there a reason that people keep assuming I'm married/in a serious relationship/will get married soon or is it something that people just say/that is expected of most young women in general?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ni9v5j/why_do_people_often_assume_im_in_a_relationship/

25,nia1l4,1621655280,"idk what to do next. please help, relate or gimme your take on this situation.","i (27f) met a guy (29) on a dating app back in december and we had our first date at his place, we had great sexual chemistry as well as overall chemistry. we made each other laugh, spoke non-stop and hung out for 4 hours before he got me an uber back home. we went on a 2nd and 3rd date (both of which i initiated which i dont mind as long as the feeling is mutual) where it was the same thing and at the end of our third date he mentioned going to the museum together and i told him i was up for it.

2 weeks passed and he didn't text so i decided to text him to see how he was doing and maybe get an explanation. immediately he apologized for never getting back to me and explained that he ended up meeting up with an ex of his (they broke up a year prior) but that they ended it for good this time and it was just a mess and he felt bad about how much time had passed by and didnt feel like he could message me anymore. we met up for a 4th date where he went into detail about his ex gf and how she cheated on him and all of their issues and we spoke about what we wanted and he said he just wasn't sure what he was doing on the dating app. his friend had asked him to join the dating app with him and i was the second girl he met and he liked me but wasn't sure if he wanted anything at the moment and mentioned he was just trying to date around and see what was out there, which i feel is expected when you meet someone on a dating app. i told him that it was fine, but that i personally did want to find a relationship eventually.

we continued to see each other about once every two weeks just casually hanging, doing things together and having intimate sex. we get along so well and its always easy being together and the things he would say or do always felt like it was more than just a hook up. he would consistently tell me what he liked about me and that he liked spending time together and whenever we did hang out i was never the one to initiate anything romantic, he would always either kiss me or grab my hand. but eventually my feelings started to get hurt because we were still only hanging once every other week and he was bad at texting (he would reply here and there but also would randomly text me that he thought of me or sent me things that reminded him of me which is v confusing). he also mentioned that he wasn't sleeping with anybody else and asked me if i was, which i wasn't.

anyhow, 5 weeks ago i asked him what he wanted from me and he said he just wanted my friendship to which i said okay then we cant continue to sleep together if thats the case because my feelings were getting hurt and i was starting to feel used. he was apologetic and said that he didn't mean to make me feel that way but that he understood and he felt bad because he thought we were both on the same page of just sleeping together and agreed that it was super easy to be together and that he really enjoyed spending time together but still wasn't ready to date. i said i wanted to stop seeing him for a bit just to be able to separate my romantic feelings and be friends and he said he hoped i would text him whenever i wanted to hang again.

this past week i asked him if he wanted to grab drinks and we met up at a bar. it was a bit awkward at first but it was easy to get past that and we had a good time just talking shit for 3 hours and i thought we were doing well just being pals or whatever when he leaned over and kissed me. i was 3 beers in and clearly still like him so of course i just kissed him back and decided to go back to his place to have sex.

now... i just want to know why if i told him my feelings were getting hurt, then why would he kiss me? what does he want from me? i want to be friends and have him in my life and i know i have to talk to him about this now but idk how to do it so that we have a productive conversation. it sounds like he's an asshole when i type up the negative stuff but from what i have seen from him he's a sweet, genuine, open guy who doesn't seem to want to intentionally hurt anyone. i think he might also be confused? idk but i also know he's still on the dating app and possibly meeting other women and i'm 90% sure he's still talking to his ex bc her name came up on his phone when we were hanging and he was showing me something. so i just don't understand why he needs this from me specifically and how do i ask about that and about where he's at in his dating life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nia1l4/idk_what_to_do_next_please_help_relate_or_gimme/

34,niastn,1621658155,“I’m not ready”,"I went on a date with a girl that made the first move on me about 3 weeks ago. In her words, the date went really well. We kissed a few times, had some minor foreplay and she texted me after the date to say that she had a great time. This girl had recently stopped seeing this guy about 2 weeks before our date because he had basically used her for sex and then ghosted her. 

We texted for a few days after the date and when I saw her at work she’d be really flirty around me; however, after those few days the texting got a bit more infrequent, sometimes she wouldn’t reply to messages and it felt like she was avoiding me at work. I thought that I may have been over texting, so pulled back for a week or two and continued seeing other girls and living my life. 

Anyway, I asked her out again and she replied saying, “I’ve wanted to talk to you about this. You’re such a great and nice guy and I had an amazing time on our date, but the last person I was seeing has really messed me up and I’m not ready to go out again but in a few weeks time maybe I will be”. 

Now this may not mean anything, but this girl is always the first to view any social media content that I put up, usually within a couple of minutes. Yesterday, I went on a date to a Chinese restaurant and posted a photo of the table of food and she replied, “oh so who have you gone here with?🤔”, I replied “with a friend of mine” and she didn’t say anything further.

He walked me to my car, we hugged, and then ended up kissing. I felt like the kiss went well, and he asked if he could get my number. I gave it to him, and he immediately texted me his name.

Cut short to today (and still reeling fom my heartbreak), I got a text from her saying that she's back in town and would like to catch up.

Honestly, these past few months have been hell. Even today I still think about my ex-love interest. But then at times I find myself lonely and just want to have that ""someone"".

The problem is, I'm not ready to be emotionally involved again but still find myself feeling the need to find a partner... if that makes sense?

How do I initiate in that case? Do I come out clean about my expections to her upfront and risk losing out on her (I dont easily match with anyone too)? Or do I play out and possibly make her go through hell, just like I did?

46,nicm72,1621665783,Why does this even mean?,"Dated a girl I met on OKcupid. We dated 6 weeks about, then she dumps me and says I am not godly enough for her (I am, but she won't believe me and her ex of 4 yrs pretended to be a Christian). Anyway...she dumps me via text then blocks me on all social media. 

Later that day, she says unblocks, says she misses me, loves me, wants to obey God, etc. Can we be friends? I tell her yes. Next week she shows up at my door, invites herself to stay the night basically, and we are kissing, in each other's arms, etc. Seems normal. She gets all pissed the next morning. She then says have a good life via text. I go to sleep in the afternoon. My schedule is all messed up. She calls 15 times, leaves 13 voicemails, shows up to my door knocks and I do not hear it. I call her when I wake up and explain I was asleep. She wanted to talk about what happened. She says come to her house so she can fall asleep in my arms. I do so.  I come over, she wants a massage, I give her said massage. We kiss, etc. All seems normal again. I am confused as hell.

Next morning, things are super nice. We eat breakfast together, we kiss, say I love you, make out, etc.   
She has to meet her brother for brunch, so I leave after a few hours. She calls me after brunch around 3pm and is like, I am drunk, I am driving over to see you. We have sex. We say I love you, all seems nomal and fine. 

We talk online and on the phone almost daily the next week. I do not see her. Saturday she calls me and keeps me on the phone for 5 hrs. Says she loves me, misses me, says ""I am so attached to you!"", etc. All is normal. She invites me to come over to work out with her the next morning. She mentions coming with me to the movies, she says she might come over so I can help with her homework. She changes her mind on that last one. 

Sunday she is distant and barely talks online to me. Mon the same. Tues I ask her what is up...she is like, I am not mad at you for anything. I ask if I can assist w her homework bc I want to be nice. She says ""that is not a boundary I want to cross with you."" I'm like what does that mean???? ""Thanks, but no thanks."" she tells me. Ok rude....  


Wed, she says she is not mad at me, when I ask, bc she has been cold and distant since Sunday morning, when she was calling me pet names and wouldn't let me off the phone all day Saturday (I gotta do errands, I tell her....""noooo, don't go"" she replies.)  


She says, ""I'm not mad at you at all. I'm just done.""  I am like- why??? I am so confused. She says I am not godly enough of a Christian for her. She tells me this via text. I tell her she's nuts. This is the 4th or 5th time she's dumped me via text, and last year when we first started talking, before we had a chance to meet, we talked on the phone all week for 50+ hours in 6 days, and she is like ""you're not godly enough for me."" Then she comes back and talks to me a week later-- then in the middle of a conversation via text about jazz, she ghosts me! She ghosts me from Aug 2020 until Feb 27, 2021. She never did tell me why she did that. 

Anyhow, I post to Twitter the text she sent me where she said ""thanks but no thanks.""  I took her name out, and my Twitter has a fake name, is anonymous, etc. No one knows who she is. She texts me that she is very upset I posted that (I posted it bc I was confused as hell and wanted advice) and that doing this showed her no respect and that she was upset she ever gave me a chance and she's sorry she ever was with me. She blocks me and says leave me alone. I try to reach out and she says leave me alone. Now, I am blocked on all channels again and no way to contact her. I see on reddit, she posted a tweet I made when I was trying to find reasons not to like her and not feel so sad...she hid my Twitter info thankfully, but why is she even reading my tweets about her? Why is she posting them? She called me a clown in the Reddit post, but I am still blocked. I have not talked to her in 3 weeks now.  


If she doesn't want to be with me, why is she following my tweets? Why is she posting them as if the content bothers her? I only ever tweet about her bc honestly I am devastated and confused as hell. I saw this post and honestly, stupidly thought- maybe she still loves me and it hurt her to see what I said? I replied to her Reddit post and said maybe the guy in question was broken-hearted and wanted to find reasons to hate the girl and reasons why it was not a loss when in fact his heart was crushed. Just so she knew I love her and I do not think badly of her at all. I saw her posting about me as I stepped out of the movie theater and I started sobbing, thankfully I was in the back of the bldg and no one was around. Just seeing that and knowing she will post about me but won't even talk to me just killed me. I stupidly thought she cared and this was proof and she would talk to me...we could be civil and friendly and just catch up and just see what was up. I have no idea how to feel or what to think. I don't get any of what happened over these 6 weeks really. We talked of marriage and kids...it was so epic and deep and we felt so comfortable together and all of it was magical.

47,nicnvl,1621665984,2nd time hanging out. Spent longer time getting to know her and definitely felt more comfortable.,"I've connected with this girl on hinge 5 months back and I met up with her for the 2nd time. 

The first time we spent roughly an hour walking by the sea with tea together and just chatted. 

roughly 1 month later, I asked her if she wanted to grab dinner sometime this week and she was up for it. We grabbed dinner and talked while walking to the restaurant. Talked over dinner. Decided to grab up some non-alcoholic drinks after the dinner. So we spent about 2\~ hours talking to each other and getting to know each other more. 

I wouldn't really consider it a date, but I still can't tell if she is attracted to me or not. But I can tell she is quite open and more comfortable the 2nd time around. 

I'm thinking either the 3rd or 4th time when we meet up to hang out or eat I could slowly ease my hand towards her and look her in her eyes and see if she may be interested in holding hands and seeing where this goes. 

what are your thoughts? 

With my ex that's kind of how it happened to me as she just suddenly grabbed my hand to hold and I went along with it and was basically in a 2 year relationship from there. Wondering if I could make the approach this time around as I still cant really tell if she is attracted to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nicnvl/2nd_time_hanging_out_spent_longer_time_getting_to/
48,nicvq5,1621666941,I can’t help but wonder why I’ve never had an official gf yet?,"I went out with friends today and it’s two girls who are really cool and it nice to have like girl energy every once and awhile. And so we of course start talking about like relationships and stuff snd my friend was surprised that I’ve never had an official gf. It’s really until this year that I’ve started sleeping with girls snd I was seeing someone for 3-4 months, but she broke it off since she didn’t want anything serious after all that time.

It kind of makes me wonder if it’s something I’m doing or I truly just haven’t met the right girl. My friend mentioned how she doesn’t get why I’ve never had a gf and she’s genuinely surprised. I’ve known her for awhile and we’re simply friends (she has a bf as well) but it feels good to have like an attractive girl tell you that she thinks you shouldn’t be single lol.

It’s like having the ref say you’re good at basketball or having the professor tell you you’re good at math lol. I don’t really have a problem getting girls interested in me but I just haven’t met a girl who’s been willing to commit to something like a relationship or whatever. 

I guess I’m sort of feeling lonely too and I got really close to the girl I was seeing for 3-4 months but she broke things off like nothing over text which hurt me.

49,nid5g7,1621668161,second date tomorrow and i’m excited and nervous,"i am a 22 year old male and i’ve never been in any sort of relationship, or even been on a date up until last week. i met this girl, let’s call her liz (23) on tinder and we had a brief, but pleasant exchange, and that somehow ended up in her giving me her number. not really knowing what to do, i managed to ask her out to the zoo and from her words, she had a great time and we already have another date tomorrow at the local botanical garden. in my opinion, she seems extremely cool and the exact type of person i could really see myself with, just really friendly and a little extroverted which is nice because i’m kind of an introvert. we talked a lot about various things and i tried just relaxing and being chill, and it seems it worked out well enough. she hugged me when i first met her in person and then again after i walked her to her car, and that really caught me off guard because why does this really cute and funny girl hug me after we just met? we both agreed to seeing each other again the moment we reached her car after i walked with her. i was contemplating holding her hand or something while we were walking around the zoo but decided against it, as i wasn’t sure if physical contact was appropriate or not. i’m really uncertain as to how i could display interest in her because i’m afraid she may think i’m not into her or something like that and lose interest in me. i’m not really sure what to expect at all, but afterwards if it seems like she enjoyed spending time with me i’ve thought about asking her to go out for food or drinks because it’ll be earlier in the evening. any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nid5g7/second_date_tomorrow_and_im_excited_and_nervous/
50,nid848,1621668485,Should You Do it for the sake if it?,"I'm concerned about stereotypes associated with ""involuntary"" virginity. I have never felt that I don't have options. Most of the time I do not even take initiative to make new friends or speak with strangers. I understand that that would put me in a bit of a bubble. Now, and for a while, I feel pressured to break stereotypes. I've gotten to 3rd base a lot and that's enough to kill my curiosity. After that, I almost feel bad for them. I don't have a poor self image, but honestly, if I was a woman I would not find most men attractive. I'm thinking, ""really? With me? That's a shitty decision."" And as a matter if fact, many many many young women make a lot of poor decisions everyday, so it's not hard to get caught somewhere in the cross fire.

All you have to do is be intelligent, sociable, and emotionally available. Beyond that, delayed gratification and having some sort of status (within a group, institution, culture, anything) helps. It isn't complicated to me. I'm usually too busy making a fool of myself, testing people, or burning bridges so I'm not really committed to the whole dating scene. I've also recently dug a few ditches and have dealt with sever anxiety lately, so this is the last thing I would like to think about.

I just imagine other guys are gaming the system, gaining experience, and building a reputation. It can really tear you apart learning that by 19 an otherwise unscathed, perfectly content looking woman has been with 3-20 gross looking ass holes. Now I imagine I should be hook up just as much. What if later on in life I regret not working at this? I'll have an existential crisis due in 5 years. My problem is, if I'm doing it for the wrong reasons, people will be able to tell and it will just be shameful. I don't want to be a douche bag. My broader question is, what position should I really be seeking in this system? I'm starting to believe mine is completely wrong somehow. I used to assert that you don't have to actually do something to know it is possible. 

For some context, I tend to have a very hard time making male friends, so I usually just get busy with one of my female friends if I'm bored or insecure. Of course, it's completely respectful and it helps if I know she had something in mind before I did. I also have lived with mostly women my whole life and even when picking my first room/apartment, I almost went with all female roommates. I ended up with just one female roommate. That's my comfort zone and I think people can tell. I tried to explain that hooking up doesn't seem hard to me, and a male peer pointed out that is is different if you enter a relationship with purely sexual intentions from the get go. He's right. I don't really flirt or date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nid848/should_you_do_it_for_the_sake_if_it/

TL;DR: I (18M) am an elementary school librarian, and for the past almost 3 weeks now, I've been connecting with a sweet and awesome girl, same age as me, who's been doing volunteer work at the school. We went on a beach date last Saturday afternoon, and it went great (we had our first kiss watching the sunset), and tonight I took her out on our second date, and here's went.

This date was even better than the first! Okay, so to start, I cleaned and groomed myself up, put on a button down shirt, the one pair of long jeans I own, and a jacket, grabbed my wallet and phone, put on my nice black shoes, and headed out the door at about 5:00pm. I arrived at her place a short time after and knocked on her door. 

When she came out, she was in this pretty light blue/purple-ish dress, with her hair tied up in a ponytail with a bow matching her dress, and brown and white flat sandals. I told her she was looking absolutely beautiful this evening, and that made her smile, which always makes me smile. I walked to my car with her and opened the door for her as a nice gesture, and we drove off.

We got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm. It's a grill and bar that serves steak and seafood, and it's part of a hotel. We arrived and were brought to the table that I had reserved for us, and given glasses of water.

We spent some time talking story about what we did outside of work this past week while we were waiting for our drinks (I ordered root beer, and she ordered fruit punch), and we had a great conversation. I always enjoy talking with her, it's one of my favorite things I like to do with her.

When our drinks arrived, we ordered our food. We both ended up ordering the same thing: shrimp scampi. We talked story some more and then had our dinner. After we were done, we ordered some dessert. I got myself some ice cream, and she got a milkshake.

After we were done, I payed the check, and we headed back out to my car. At this point, it was about 7:30pm, and it had just gotten dark, so we had some time left before it got really late. We decided to go out for a drive to the other side of town, and I put on some music for us to listen and sing to while we were riding around. God, I love hearing her sing, her voice is beautiful.

Some time later, I ended up parking at the top of a hill, looking out towards the ocean, with a clear view of all the stars in the night sky. I told her that with how bright and beautiful her eyes were, they could switch places with the 2 prettiest stars in the sky, and nobody would notice a difference. That just made her go aww and she told me I was so sweet and that she was happy to be out with me tonight. 

Then we looked at each other with love in our eyes for a bit before we started kissing and making out again. It was even more hot than than on our first date, and we even got to second AND third base tonight. 

We spent the next hour or so just enjoying being so close to each other, and then around 9:00pm, we decided to head home. I dropped her off at her place, and we ended up spending about 15 minutes making out again on her front porch before I left and went home.

Well, that's another successful date in the bag. I'm really glad I got to spend this time with her, she's the most amazing, beautiful, and sweetest girl I know.This is an update to this post here, as requested by a lot of people: https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ngqdas/the_complete_chronicles_of_my_romance_with_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

62,nifd01,1621677890,Should I give him my number?,"Hi, I really needed some advice and there's no other place I felt I could go to than here. 

I'm a 21-year-old woman. My best friend has always been a grade younger than me in school, and there was a guy in her class who had a crush on me while we were all in high school. I never paid attention to him because I was dating someone else at the time, and he never told me directly, only through my best friend. 

Now, we're all considerably older. He recently followed me on Instagram. I didn't think much of it because I assumed he'd grown out of his crush on me. Some time later, I posted a story of my cat and he replied to it, and we started talking. At first, we were just talking about cats. But soon the conversation moved to philosophy and really vulnerable topics. I was nervous chatting with him like that because I haven't been romantically involved with anyone in a couple years and I don't want to involve myself with people who play games/mess with peoples' heads etc. However, he actually seemed really nice. I kind of think I'm starting to get a bit of a crush and I don't like it very much. 

But anyway, I didn't want to tell my best friend this as they were acquainted in school and now they don't talk anymore, but she would sort of freak out, she's a little dramatic. I instead just told her that he'd started DM-ing me-- and that's when she told me that as far as she knows he has a girlfriend. I was absolutely shocked, because by the way he'd been talking, it didn't seem like it at all. He doesn't have any pictures up on his feed either that would insinuate that he's taken. 

My responses to him became infrequent, and the conversation died down. However, just a couple of days ago, he messages something like ""I enjoyed talking to you etc etc maybe we should call sometime"" and I thought that, if I don't catch feelings, I would be able to have a nice friendship at least with someone new. (I haven't had new friends in a really long time-- we're still in lockdown here-- and the conversation was actually really nice!) So I said sure. 

Then I think the day before yesterday he asked for my number. But if he's really interested in me, and if he has a girlfriend, I really don't want to get involved. Even as a friend. He hasn't insinuated, either, that he likes me or anything, but he's made some remarks like ""i'm really attracted to x and y quality that you have"" and stuff. And thinking twice, I really really don't want to be involved in any capacity as more than friends. If even that. 

I haven't given him my number yet. I wanted to ask you guys what you think-- should I do it? And if I do, how do I put it across that I don't want to be romantically involved? 

Apologies if this is a tad annoying, I'm just confused and this situation seems weird. Thanks for reading, and please let me know what you think.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nifd01/should_i_give_him_my_number/

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always like this so it's not your typical teenage romance. In fact about two months in things were getting so toxic we decided to take a break and we stayed as friends but we still flirted. We got back together about 2 weeks later due to a funny incident and ever since then..things have been so perfect. We tell each other how much we love each other every day and every time I think it might get old it feels just the same as the day before, maybe even better. Any insecurities, we lay it on the table plainly and reassure each other. Any disagreements, we handle it calmly and come to a compromise.

This is horseshit, I have seen many uglier guys than me get dates, so everything you see about it in this sub is just not true.

Same if you're a woman, and you realize that a lot of guys are there for the sex/bragging rights/compensation of insecurities. This now makes them think that every guy just wants sex and nothing else when in reality is not true. Many guys are also looking for a partner.

So I came to this sub looking for advice, but I only found sad love stories with bad endings, or improductive facts that dont count in the real world. What if women care about looks? You also do, because you're going for pretty girls. What if guys only want sex? If you're a woman between 18-30 years old, you probably also want satisfying sex.

I'm just gonna block this sub and all the others like r/seduction etc... It's just filled with insecure men and women who want confirmation bias/sense of power.

Had a rough childhood . Suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts occasionally (don’t worry only when blows )Mom was drug addict always had diff men in our house . I bounced from foster homes until I ended up with my dad . Went to 6-8 diff schools as a kid always had fRiends but never joined any cliques always a loner .

Almost every gf I’ve had has ended in a dumpster fire . More recently a few years back ex/ baby mama of 7 years got caught cheating with somebody at work and I kicked her out . I’m still bouncing back from this whole ordeal and haven’t really moved on . Only had sex a handful of times in the past few years . Plus Covid through a wrench in that gear 

Since my ex I have been unable to take dating seriously or even attempt it . I have blown every single chance for something good I had subconsciously on purpose it seems . I’m on a path of self sabotage , destruction and loneliness but I don’t know how to stop it .

 I’ve managed to ruin several opportunities with good women because I’m so fucked in the head. I am handsome , romantic , I have loads of tattoos , I am funny and I look out for those around me so women seem to flock to me . 

I have 0 problem getting their attention , captivating them , sexually or anything . My problem It’s all mental . I overthink , overanalyze , and I’ll jump into the relationship head first like a bat out of hell . A few I have just out and out blocked when I couldn’t find a reason to not end it and the girl didn’t run from my red flags .

One girl said to me I love too hard but I hate harder , that shit hurt but she’s right .

I either want to marry her and run off into the sunset or everything she does is a problem and I want her out of my life for good . There’s no in between or time to process it’s 0-60 on an open highway or I’ll crash the car into a wall

Lately because of this I don’t seek out relationships or even women but I do crave something more and feel lonely a lot . It’s just exhausting because I know I will self sabotage it or fuck it up somehow . Some of the ways I’ve done so are comical to say the least .

One in particular I genuinely had strong feelings for her I was falling in love . She was gorgeous , funny , our careers aligned but in the end I pushed her away and blew it.  I think about her everyday still and It hurts I know we could have made each other happy if my rotten brain didn’t get in the way 

I’ve tried counseling , lately have been working out more to get rid of pent up anxiety and stress but I want to break the cycle .

I know I want something real , hook ups leave me desiring more and just throw shit in the game although temporarily reliving the loneliness .

I know this all sounds petty and dumb , I’m sorry . I just need help . What should I do to try and change my mindset on dating or women in general it’s all surrounded by such negativity  . I don’t like where things are going and at the very least while I work on myself  I’d like to feel content alone .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/niia0r/29m_looking_for_advice/

She's still on my mind and I want to send her a long text asking for a second chance.

3 years ago we met at college, we instantly became good friends, It was obvious that she was into me so after a couple of weeks we went on a date and it went pretty good. but it was the only date we went on because I simply never asked her out again because I was a dumbass. After that date, we started talking less and less to each other, we were still on good terms but we were clearly drifting apart, only talking to each other when we ran into each other on campus. Eventually I told her that I don't like how things are and that I can't be friends with her. She took it well and even after that, we still never fought or anything.

The last time we talked was February 2020, she was pretty cold with her replies.

Anyways, its been more than a year since we've last seen each other or talked, but she's still on my mind every day, I removed all her social media, got rid of all the pics I had of her in my phone, I even dated other girls. But it all didn't matter, at the end of the day, she'd still be on my mind.

So now I'm thinking of sending her a long message, telling her that she's still on my mind and that I regret not being straightforward before. The problem is, im afraid of sounding very creepy and pathetic. and I dont know what to do.

92,nikc7u,1621695271,How to Move On Without Closure?,"long story short. i met a guy online back in october. the whole situation started toxic due to mostly me, i made the mistake of dating him while getting out of a toxic relationship. i treated him badly, but we remained “friends”?. i had the thought he would start liking me again, because when we would hang out he would always kiss me and take me out to eat wherever i wanted. we would always hold hands. the last time we met was about a week ago, we agreed to not meet till june. i wasn’t OK with it, so i decided to text him after 2 days apologizing. he said Ok but that’s not gonna change the fact we are nothing and never will be. i made an IG account and i was following people on my recommendations and decided to follow this girl he follows i didn’t see the problem honestly. she’s pretty and looks like a model... he found out and i don’t know how he did. he texted me saying “ur going through my stuff” when actually i wasn’t she was on my recommendations. he blocked me on everything i pleaded all week asking why did this happen. he said ur blowing my phone up, my friend started to tell me he might give me a restraining order so i kept messaging on diff number to please don’t. he said goodbye leave me alone, i changed my number as i already had plans to do so, because i kept getting too many spam calls. i texted him asking about what park we went to because i thought he would have cooled down by then. he always does after days, no response i haven’t slept at all this week i feel stressed i feel lost he won’t leave my mind. we saw each other for 5 months, i texted him today again asking why he suddenly blocked me and decided to ghost me after 5 months of hanging out. i called him 2 and a half times i said please pick up the phone and NOTHING. i don’t know how to move on from this it’s clear he won’t ever come back. i wish things would have ended on better terms. he left and blocked me without an explanation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nikc7u/how_to_move_on_without_closure/
93,nikd3c,1621695341,Playing hard to get or not? Guy said it was really nice to see me again and was interested in seeing me again. Should I expect him to try and message me again?,"I don’t really understand why he bothered meeting me up. I’ve known him for a long long time and we had a fling around 2 years ago. He ended it because I (self-admittedly) was very very desperate. We’ve kept in touch but maybe only one small-talk conversation every couple of months or so (sometimes we wouldn’t speak at all for 6 months or more). Then he asked to meet up with me and was all flirty and interested again? I reciprocated somewhat but made sure to not be responsive to every advance he made as I’m now wary.


After our date(? I guess you could call it that) he said it was really great seeing me and then he messaged me saying how nice it was to meet me again. I responded saying thanks and didn’t continue the conversation on much longer.


A few days later I asked if he was free that night - I was unsure how I felt about him and wanted to test the waters. He said he was busy and I didn’t continue the conversation. He hasn’t shown signs of interest for about a week now and I’m honestly just a bit baffled? I have ADHD so I can’t really imagine speaking to someone on an evening just for fun as I find it unbearably boring speaking to people I don’t know very well but maybe he was just bored that night we met up and I just can’t relate.


With ADHD I know I’m incredibly vulnerable to the playing hard to get tactic (to keep a long story short - ADHD impairs dopamine regulation in my brain. So when a guy I’m attracted to shows signs of interest I have an overwhelming surge of dopamine which makes me attracted to him. When he then goes cold my brain craves that dopamine release and I become hyper-focused on him). Because of that, I’d like to know if I should brace myself against his playing-hard-to-get behaviour for my own benefit. Or if I should just forget about him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nikd3c/playing_hard_to_get_or_not_guy_said_it_was_really/
94,nikp5h,1621696282,Closing a chapter on meeting people online.,"I have long been browsing the app for news, discussions and entertainment. Because of the pandemic, the lockdown , I tried meeting up with people through various subs. With social gathering out of the picture due to COVID-19, it's hard to meet new friends online.

Throughout the months I have met great people and the time we spent made me happy. However despite my appreciation, I believe it's time for this endeavor to end. I can't point exactly what it is but there is something missing or unnatural when you meet someone in anonymity.

I would likely still keep in touch with people whom I have met in real life, but it's probably time to move on from exerting efforts to meet new people here. If I suddenly do not reply and you read this post, please be assured that it's not your fault and I actually thank you for your time. I just decided that it's time to move on from sprawling through the online world and to go back to reality.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nikp5h/closing_a_chapter_on_meeting_people_online/

I’m putting myself first of course, been making sure I’m not a total mess...

99,nil3gb,1621697418,"As a man, how do you have options like women do when it comes to dating?","Im 22 and I'd say I'm pretty attractive when it comes to looks. Personality wise i'd say my favorite personality trait is my patience, I've heard girls before tell me that they feel comfortable with me because Im really patient with them whether its with anything sexual, or teaching them new things like spray painting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of posts by men talking about having an abundance mindset, and that its the mindset that men are supposed to have to show that they have options beyond the woman that they wanted to date so that her rejection doesnt really mean anything to him. The thing is, I can tell that it would be hard to keep this mindset if, 

1. you dont realistically have options or women who would love to date you
2. you keep getting rejected

So my question is, how, as a man, would you ""have options"" like women do when it comes to dating?

i.e More women who would want to date you than women who dont want to date you?

&amp;#x200B;

And please dont answer your stupid ass responses like:

1. Be attractive
2. Dont be unattractive",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nil3gb/as_a_man_how_do_you_have_options_like_women_do/
