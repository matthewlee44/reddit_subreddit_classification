1,qqcyrb,1636491049,Why you aren't successful on online dating apps,"Me, OP, a 23m went undercover on hinge. Why, you ask? To scout out the competition of course, see where I really stood and maybe how I can improve my own profile.

Ok before I give you my scouting report, here's a little preface. I'm a decently average-to-good looking dude (i think). I've had some success in real life, and I do get a few matches a week. But I've never gone on a date from Hinge. It's usually: I open with a funny one-liner or comment on their profile, and we talk for a day or two, and then they evaporate into thin air and I never hear back again. Alright, fair enough, you can't make someone like you if they don't. But after a particularly rough few months of getting hinge ghosted, I decided to see who I was competing with.

Scouting Report: gentlemen, we're fucked

No, really. I won't butter it up. We all know these dating apps' algorithms promote the ""most desirable"" profiles to the top of the stack. I waded through a sea of greek gods with chiseled jaw lines, summer cabins, boats, the perfect hairline and on god every one of them had the cutest puppy. Look, I can admit when a guy is good-looking. These guys were fucking 10's. And not one of them was under 6'0. I don't have data to back this up, but there is now doubt in my mind the ratio of good/average looking profiles is way higher for men, than it is for women. 

My insecurity has increased by 110%, if only I could buys puts on my self-confidence. There was not a single ""ugly"" dude. I seriously only found 2 average dudes in an hour of searching. The guy she tells you not to worry about is literally fucking Apollo.

Moral of the story: Bros; the average-looking dude in real life is not average-looking on online dating apps. The average-looking dude on online dating apps is Chris Hemsworth.

Where do us regular folk go from here? Hopefully this brings some sort of closure, i guess, to those of us who've been struggling with online dating. It might be better for your mental health to know that, yes, you never really stood a chance, but also that this situation doesn't reflect reality. I know for a fact the average guy in real life doesn't look anything like these profiles. I'll sum up the online dating situation for you; a giant ocean of very handsome men with puppies vying for the attention of a much smaller pool of attractive women. 

I could tell you how to make your profile more like the ones I saw. Take a good selfie. Work out and develop a six-pack. Put pictures of yourself doing fun activities, especially if they involve your boat. Get a dog and throw him on your profile ASAP. Get that weird jawline improving chewing toy thingy. Go to Turkey and get leg-extension surgery for $5000 USD. No, wait I'm just reading off my to-do list now. 

My actual advice? Quit online dating. Get your ass out there in real life, and meet real people. Learn how to paint, or skate, or bake. Idk, anything where you can meet someone new. Take salsa dancing classes. 

Moral of the story: you're getting ghosted on tinder/hinge/etc because your competing against the entire ensemble of Mt. Olympus, but the good news is that's not the real world. Also, it was remarkably easy to make a fake and convincing Hinge profile, and I can't have been the first to do this, so actually unless your match is verified or has a legit social media page, she might actually be dude.

2,qqczqr,1636491128,Dating app without chatting. Crazy or not?ü§î,"Goal: Have a dating app that promotes real connection over chatting and discourages flaking.

Features: 
- no chatting
- after a match decide where and when to meet up by selecting/voting on options, the app then chooses for you based on mutual preferences and sets a date
- put $1-20 down as flake prevention (let people choose min amount?)
- Confirm on the day that you are still down
- Track location to prove that you don't flake. As long as you show up you get your money back
- give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating
- must verify profile to help people feel more secure

6,qqdf6v,1636492287,I don't wanna make our friendship weird.,"So I 18M and this girl 18F have known each other for a while from youth group stuff in the past, but recently I asked her to hang out. We had an awesome day: Boba, thrifting, talking in the park, mini golf, sitting in the car and listening to music... just an awesome day.

Over the next 2 weeks we have talked more and more over text, being REALLY emotionally vulnerable with each other about life.

Just this Sunday, we hung out again. We watched a movie over at my house, then we got food and hung out at a park after dark, talking on the swinging while listening to music, then going to the peak of a large hill to just look at the town's lights from up high. Again, perfect.

Over this period of time, I have started to develop a strong connection to her, feeling romantically connected. Here's the one problem: in our conversations where we get really personal, she has brought up that given her current circumstances spiritually and just in general, she wants to meet her soulmate, but doesn't know ""if she knows him just yet"". 

The thing that gets me is how date-y things have felt up to this point. I really value the friendship we have built, but I can't help feeling like something more is there. At the same time, I wanna respect her and her journey right now, and if she has basically overtly stated that she doesn't like me, then it would be wrong of me to try and continue pursuing her, right?

I haven't felt this way about a person ever before, and she has even said that if she were to date right now, it would be best to have a long talking period (something I fully agree with and want myself). I just don't want to get hurt, and I especially don't want to hurt her by making it seem like all of this was for nothing and I only hang out with her because I feel this way about her. I love our friendship, I just can't help but feel like there is more to how I feel, nd the atmosphere we've created. Any advice would be amazingly appreciated. Thank you for listening to my ramblings.

TLDR: ive been hanging out with this girl in a very ""date-like"" way, but she doesn't seem to see me as anything more a friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqdf6v/i_dont_wanna_make_our_friendship_weird/

11,qqdvj1,1636493535,Looking for Advice... How to Meet girls IRL? Did dating Apps just begin to suck in big cities? How to find a social circle in cities post-college while working? Please read and discuss.,"25M in los angeles here. I'm looking for advice and perspective. I just met a girl from bumble, and we were talking and having sex for a month but then she randomly decided to dip. I know what I did wrong and what to do better next time and tbh she probably just sucks and isnt meant for me. but anyway, I'm trying to rebound and I just don't know what the hell to do. I don't know if it's just me, but did all the dating apps suddenly become freaking terrible?  How do people meet girls IRL?

Like, tinder in college I would get a million matches (I consider myself pretty good looking). Even like 2 years ago tinder was amazing and would give you so many matches in LA. And hinge was killing it for a while last year + 2019 too, i was getting sooo many matches. But I went on it recently, even paid for a month of it, and all they do for the most part is show me hundreds and hundreds of profiles of unattractive women, and then the one attractive one burried in the rough I'm not matching with. it did NOT used to be like this. Did they change their business model to give men less matches to make more money? Could it be possible that I exhausted all women near me in LA? There's no way. or that the male to female ratio on these is just that terrible? Even after freaking paying for it i'm not getting a fraction of the matches I was getting a year or two ago, and if anything my profile is better. Maybe I need a reset?

But off the topic of dating apps, I would rather meet a girl in person if I can. I'm just in this shitty situation where all of the friends I have i'm not super close too. I'll hang with friends here and there but they're all separate social circles, and not in one cohesive friend group. And I love my friends, but even some of the closest ones I have don't seem to be my exact type of friend, who likes all the things I like (being social, drinking, going to parties/bars, playing/watching sports, hanging out with girls and guys.. I'm trying to find a way to enter a social circle somehow but I don't know where to look. All i've thought of is going to a new gym or playing basketball more often, or joining some club/volunteer/group (I dont even know what to join). Especially after this girl left me i've been lonely as hell, I'm not getting sex nor feel like I have close friends that still live in my city which I completely vibe with. Are there better ways to meet people online than the dating apps? Are there other online communities or ways of meeting people in your area that are actually good? I think i'm attractive and pretty driven, generally a cool and chill person so this shouldn't be as hard as it feels right now. From reading this you'd probably think i'm a loner or social weirdo but i'm not. I'm a social chill dude that somehow ended up in this shitty situation. Maybe LA just sucks. maybe I just need one opportunity or to meet one person and it'll change my life. but i'm just bored as hell right now and i'm working remotely so that doesn't help this cause of meeting people either.

I assume she takes time to warm up to people romantically? How do I know if it's okay to even touch her, let alone kiss her if she doesn't initiate any of it? Just wait until she initiates? What if she never does and is just waiting for me?

17,qqe2qm,1636494089,My ex contacted me after six months and reminded me exactly why he‚Äôs my ex.,"I dated my ex for nearly three years. I used to think things were great at the beginning of our relationship and only soured over time. Looking back with some hard earned maturity and perspective I realize things weren‚Äôt as rosy as I thought at the time. I was only 21 when I met him and he was 29. 

Maybe that should have been a red flag that a guy almost thirty was into me. But in my defense I was always the awkward girl with braces and acne in high school. I was a late bloomer who guys started to notice when I was about 20 so I wasn‚Äôt the most experienced girl when I met him.

Well we dated for almost three years. The last six months or so were just the worst. As  I started to mature I realized how much time I had wasted with him. I was just working up the courage to say fuck this, I‚Äôm out of this relationship. It was hard for me to do because he spent a lot of our relationship convincing me how lucky I was to have him, that he had lowered his standards by dating me and that I‚Äôd have a hard time finding anyone else. I actually *believed* him. 

Well I ended up getting pregnant. I found out I was pregnant in April. When he found out he immediately demanded to know what my plans were. He didn‚Äôt want kids he told me. How did I let this happen? It was all my fault. I honestly didn‚Äôt know what I was going to do at the time. But I decided I was keeping the baby. He told me that if I didn‚Äôt have an abortion he was going to break up with me so I called his bluff and told him to fuck off. He reminded me that I‚Äôd be in my own and he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with the baby. Man child. A fucking 33 year old man child. So yeah I made sure he knew I was fine with my baby not having him as it‚Äôs male role model since he wasn‚Äôt a real man anyway.

I knew being a single mom wouldn‚Äôt be easy but I also knew my parents and brothers and friends would support me. So my baby would have plenty of love from family and friends and a mom who would love him or her unconditionally. So yeah I went for the first time to hear my baby‚Äôs heartbeat with my mom and my oldest brother‚Äôs wife. My ex had no interest. 

Then in July I had a miscarriage. I don‚Äôt know why. It was a seemingly healthy pregnancy and one day I woke up in terrible pain and I had a miscarriage. My sister in law took me to the hospital and my mom and dad came and waited for me. And my family took me home and sat with me and were there for me as I cried over my baby. That was four months ago and I don‚Äôt even know if my ex knew I miscarried or not.

So he suddenly out of nowhere called me yesterday. From a number I didn‚Äôt recognize. I was waiting for a call about something from work so I thought it might be that. But it was him.

He proceeded to tell me all about what he‚Äôs been up to these past six months and how much he misses me. Yeah I really want to hear all about your new job and your new car and how you had a sweet trip to Las Vegas with your boys. I was quiet the whole time. Then I told him I was glad he had such a great summer. I lost my baby over the summer. 

Then he said oh yeah I heard something about that. I‚Äôm real sorry. I mean maybe it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. I asked him why the fuck he called me. He said he heard that I was dating someone now and was it true. I said yeah I am and it‚Äôs none of your business. 

He said I didn‚Äôt have to be so rude about it. He had been thinking about me a lot and realized he messed up really badly and wonders if I‚Äôd like to meet up for coffee or something. The balls on this guy. I asked what made him think I ever wanted to even be in the same room as him for the rest of my life. I really just laid into him. God how could I have ever been so naive to think he was worth my time? I told him never to call me again then I blocked the number he called from. I should have let my brother beat him up like he wanted to when I told him he wasn‚Äôt going to step up for his kid.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqe2qm/my_ex_contacted_me_after_six_months_and_reminded/

My best friends were always the ones jumping from boyfriend to boyfriend with people constantly fawning over them. I, on the other hand, was a late bloomer and looked like an tall, lanky 9 year old until I was 15. I have a pretty unique fashion sense and some odd/nerdy interests. That plus a-cups and a big nose makes me pretty much the polar opposite of what boys my age want.

Most of them make that extremely clear, in fact I‚Äôve been called more names than I can count. Squidward, witch without the wart, minecraft villager, airplane lander forehead. My favorite was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so skinny that if your eye bags were any bigger you‚Äôd look like a meth addict‚Äù. It used to really beat me down, I felt like complete shit about myself and hated everything about me. Over time, however, I learned to like what was different about me even if no one else did. I learned how to do makeup, how to dress myself fashionably, how to make friends. Other girls started to respect and befriend me. Even though guys still generally want nothing to do with me, I still felt much better.

But recently I‚Äôve been getting to know a guy (17m) who seems....different? He actually makes an effort to talk to ME. Not only do I not have to constantly fight just to get a basic human acknowledgement, he actually seems to enjoy being around me! He actually LIKES when I tell him about the things I‚Äôm into as well as talk about his interests. He actually asks me to hang out with him!

29,qqeui6,1636496269,Next steps given crazy mixed signals‚Ä¶ A true puzzle‚Ä¶,"Hey everyone! I Know this is long but bare with me. I met this wonderful girl at the gym 6 weeks ago and got her number. We‚Äôre both first year uni but I‚Äôm a couple years older due to taking a few years off. 

Long story short, we started off really slow. Coffee first week/date, brunch second week/date, dinner third week/date, then an entire week where we spent 4 nights together just hanging out. Everything was going great and we both got emotionally attached very quickly. I went into uni not wanting a relationship, but this girl has made me definitely want one with her, she checks all the boxes. For this reason I didn‚Äôt prioritize sex, I wanted to make sure she was 10000% comfortable and safe before we did anything‚Ä¶ 

Here is where it gets confusing‚Ä¶ We hung out Friday night two weeks ago and it was great. Saw her the next morning in the library and told her we should hang out later, she said she‚Äôd love to. I snapped her a funny pic mid afternoon but never got a response. Took her 24 hours to reply. I left her on opened and texted her that night asking how her day was, never got a response. Then called her Monday evening to see if everything was ok, was really thrown off at this point. She didn‚Äôt pick up, but called me back right away and we talked for 20 mins. Told her we should grab some food and hang at mine, but she told me that she might not be able to that week because of exams. I understood and told her to study hard. 

I reached out a couple days later asking how the studying was going, took her 5 hours to respond saying she was so so sorry for not getting back to me because its been a crazy day. She then spam called me4 times and she told me she wanted to call to talk and tell me that she wasn‚Äôt ignoring me. We chatted for an hour and the conversation flowed well. 

She texted me a few days later asking how I was doing, we talked and I told her I‚Äôd love to see her at some point. She again said she wasn‚Äôt feeling herself and that she‚Äôs been having some family issue so hasn‚Äôt been wanting to leave her house. Told her I was really sorry to hear it and that she should take the time she needs to feel better. She‚Äôs been depressed and her mother is sending her to a therapist and doctor to get things under control. 

Few days later (last Saturday) she FaceTimes me and we talk for a couple hours. Even after not seeing her for a couple weeks, the conversations flows so well and we have great chemistry. She promised we‚Äôd hang out soon.

Since the FaceTime I haven‚Äôt reached out, I am simply not sure what is going on. I truly believe that she is going through some tough times mentally, I‚Äôm just not sure if if I should keep asking to see her or if I should even keep checkin in. I can‚Äôt keep asking her to hang out and have her tell me she‚Äôs not feeling up to it, or that she has school. 

If she wasn‚Äôt interested, she would cut ties and not call, FaceTime, and text me‚Ä¶

From like 30 min in I could feel we didn't really click, we didn't have the same brand of humor and I just didn't feel that special connection. We went to get dinner and it felt like I was just trying to keep the conversation engaging but I was mainly just enjoying my food lmao it was just kinda awkward. We went back to our college campus that we met up at and sat down on one of the benches around one of the sports fields. I knew that he may try to take things further cause it was just the two of us on a bench and ig you could call it a rOmaNtIc atmosphere but I wan't interested in him at that point and was just willing to talk until his bus came. I sat a ways a way from him to communicate this. Midway through talking he starts to mess with the buttons in my jacket sleeve and I am immediately uncomfortable. I HATE being touched without my full consent, even something little like that. I didn't respond to it at all and leaned away to try to give a hint without being aggressive about it cause we were alone and men are uh...unpredictable...let's put it at that. We kept talking and then he put his arm like along the back of the bench which guys sit like all the time so I wasn't really paying much mind until he started to drum his fingers like along my back and I just immediately went into fuck this mode. It was clear he wanted more and I was NOT interested. I made up some lie about my stomach hurting and took the train home. Now thinking about it I know it wasn't like full groping or anything, I just was very uncomfortable with any touching. Did I overreact in any way or this normal first date behavior?

He agreed and acknowledged that too. He expressed feelings of being depressed and said that he couldn't give me what I deserve and didn't want to take me down with him. We both agreed time and space away from each other would be good and he even suggested being friends. He said really kind things about me and it was a really nice moment together. At the time I thought he was being genuine. However, I recently found out from a friend he updated his Tinder profile and he is still using it less than 24 hours later. That made me feel like everything he said to me was a lie, except for the part where I deserve better. 

Did he play me by using his mental health as an excuse? I feel bad questioning that but I am so confused by what he said compared to the actions afterwards. I also am unfamiliar with depression, so  I just do not understand his inability to give time to me but can spend his time on tinder. I would appreciate any insight.

I was too shy to really talk to him so i left early and didnt think much about it. In october i match with him on tinder by chance and he recognizes me and we hit it off. I assume things are going well we spend the halloween weekend together and he seems to enjoy my company. Last weekend i spent the night with him like i had the weekend prior. When i changed for bed i was wearing a random tshirt (poison band tee) and he made a comment about it which was a bit weird but i passed it off lightly thinking he was just joking. Fast forward to the next day i leave his room around 0540 for work but return to my room bc i was told not to come in. I text him that and then go to sleep. He texts me before he goes o work at 1200. The rest of the day i spend at the mall with friends.

 He gets off work at 8 and so i don't text him until around that time. I notice when i texted him he was being short with me. It was unusual so i asked him why. He told me that someone had gotten into his room and broken into his closet. Im trying to be consoling but its to no avail bc he suspects me. He tells me he isn't very trusting right now and needs to take a step back. I understand him being upset but i don't understand why he thinks i would break into his room. Im trying to tell him that i couldn't even get access to his room without a key (he lives in a dorm) to the entrance outside. 

He tells me he has no interest in rebuttals and has nothing to say to me besides some red flags (ominous poison shirt, choice in words, strange political comments). It just seemed very odd. I really liked him and I haven't text him in a few days (he hasn't text me either) hoping maybe he would calm down and be reasonable. I still have his hoodie and I know i should give it back but I was waiting for a time I knew he was off so I could possibly get him to actually talk to me.

40,qqft2i,1636499024,uh oh ( need some advice on a sensitive issue ),"So my GF and I started dating about a year ago. We have acutally been acquainted for some time but went on a date late Oct 2020 that turned into a relationship. I had not seen her for a couple of years and she had put on a few pounds which she spoke to on the ride to our restaurant referring to it as ' Covid weight ' from working at home and not doing much else. Obviously just a subject briefly touched on and left alone given that it was our first date. I didn't want to be overly superficial since we had been flirtin and talking before the date which lead me to believe she was the one to choose over a few other girls I was hanging out with or talking to on a flirtatious level... 

Fast forward about 2 months into dating and hanging out she was wanting to know if we were going to be a serious couple and I decided we would go that direction. 

At first she was gaining more but kept insisting she was going to get on track. She started making an effort to take off weight by exercising at home and eventually starting going to the gym on her lunch. I made sure to compliment her and do what I could to boost her confidence/motivate her.  She had a bout with some mental issues and stopped going. Then she gained so much weight a couple of people thought she was pregnant when we went out in public! 

I started to feel much less attracted to her and stopped getting physical to the point where she noticed and asked about it. Not wanting to crush her emotionally I chalked it up to "" stress "" from my high stress level job.  We still don't really get intimate often and I find it hard to be romantic / physical because I am less attracted with all this gain. 

She is truly a great person and my teen daughter loves her. My whole family really likes her. I like her friends. I like her family and we have a ton of mutual friends as well. 

I work out regularly even despite long hours at a demanding job. Although I am not super ripped people do recognize me as someone who is into fitness and works out regularly. So obviously I am somewhat concerned about health and fitness. The main reason I work out is for both physcial and mental health which I feel she would benefit from as well. Part of it is cosmetic as I want my partner to be attracted to me so I feel a little taken for granted in regard to my efforts there. 

I am not going to push her to go lose weight because that is obviously extremely rude. Women have so much pressure that men don't to "" look good "" so I am not going there at all. I will love her unconditionally but sometimes love isn't enough to be with someone...but I don't want to leave either. To make things more complicated I recently moved in to the 2 unit aparment building she lives in so now we live next to each other so its practically like living together...

43,qqg3zj,1636499932,Do you think she‚Äôs into me?,"So here‚Äôs the run-down:

Met this chick a couple weeks ago. I just randomly approached her and we started chatting and I got the number.

I broke my phone shortly after but I tried to send messages via Google Voice before I got another phone. She replied to them. She always said she was very busy when I asked about her schedule or free time but always said I could study with her. I tried to a few times but it didn‚Äôt work out. One day we did end up hanging out. She laughed at all my jokes, seemed high energy even though I knew she was tired, etc. I honestly had fun. I offered to take her out to the movies that weekend (the topic of horror movies came up) and she said she would go if she didn‚Äôt have so much HW.

Since then I haven‚Äôt seen her in person. We‚Äôd text a bit, she usually replies eventually. I‚Äôve hinted at hanging out once or twice but she hasn‚Äôt been able to but she always insists that I can study with her when she‚Äôs around. There were times when I wasn‚Äôt available either though.

Lately she‚Äôs been replying to my messages really late, like in the middle of the night, 2am type stuff. Always very polite. 

I haven‚Äôt really flirted or escalated with her yet as much as I wanted yet (which is part of why I‚Äôve been trying to take her out). We talked about dancing and stuff and she offered to teach me essentially. I like her energy, she‚Äôs pretty bubbly which is a sharp contrast to myself. I feel kinda silly sometimes with how seriously I take things when I talk to her.

From her vibe in-person and how she always offers the studying alternative even when she‚Äôs says she‚Äôs busy, I imagine she‚Äôs interested. She was obviously tired when we were talking too so I believe her on that end. I know there‚Äôs no way for you to know but from what I explained, do you think she‚Äôs interested?

From what little I know, I can see potential compatibility and that‚Äôs why I am a bit invested but if I am wasting my time I can put it on ice too. My plan is to get her out and up the ante. The first time we were out she accidentally bumped her shoulder and so I instinctively touched her and asked if she was okay. I kinda tested the waters a bit there and held it a bit longer than necessary. She didn‚Äôt stop me or even make eye contact, she just smiled and stared into space.

The thing is, I did mean it when I said I wanted to get out of the house, but not with him.

45,qqg8te,1636500340,How important is it to you that your date is on time?,"I'll preface this with I left a date before she arrived because I had sat there in an empty restaurant for 50 minutes waiting for her. She did communicate she was running a bit late, but I got nothing but mixed signals from her leading up to us meeting up. I had suggested 6. She said 430 would be better so I agreed. 430 was turned into, and I have to leave at 530 latest. No biggie I thought, just want to get to know her and see if a second date is in order. 

She Ultimately did show up but I was gone at that point. Now I'm not mad at her, life happens, work gets in the way with the boss asking you to stay late etc. But, how important is it to everyone here that your date is on time? 

Running a little late in my opinion is 10-20 min. Not 50-60 min. Is it an unreasonable want for someone to show up on or around the time they suggested or am I expecting to much?  This question partially comes from my last 2 dates, prior to the one mentioned above, the women I was meeting with was over 40 minutes late.

However, she showed up and almost immediately said she felt like she was gonna get a migraine. Our date was a little bit past an hour in, and I asked her if she was feeling alright. She said no, that she should probably get going.

Anyways, got a really good hug before she left, &amp; texted her after. She told me that i'm very sweet &amp; has told me i'm very cute several times. She even texted me the next morning first after I had already told her goodnight.

I made that mistake in my latest attempt to find a relationship. I‚Äôm not a big fan of going down on girls, not against it and definitely will do it, just not my favorite thing. I told her this and she laughed and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to change that‚Äù and we continued on to have great sex. But couple this with not being exclusive with her and her open to seeing other guys, I think my stance on the oral thing might‚Äôve been the reason she broke it off for another guy.

A lot of women seem to think having a short son is some kind of disease. . If you don't want to have a short son either abort any male child that you have or if your son grows to be short and ends up being short tell them to go kill themselves and repeat this cycle until you don't have a short son.

54,qqhc1p,1636503594,"This is why I only use ""hey"" as my opener now in OLD","I never saw myself as one of those ""hey"" guys -- I never wanted to be so unoriginal and boring.  But after much deliberation, I am now a devout Heyer.  A recent incident made me cross over for good.

I matched with a ""digital illustrator"" with an otherwise empty profile.  Two of her pics contained subtle rainbows that were added with deft editing skills.  My profile is pretty dry and to-the-point, but I like to keep things light, so I open with something like ""hey, did you find any pots of gold at the end of those rainbows?"".

Her reply: ""No, did you?""

My ""pots of gold"" line may have been unoriginal and unfunny, and she was better looking than me, but does that justify expressing condescension rather than adding info to her profile so guys can use better openers or simply ignoring openers she considers stupid?  I think not.  Also, this was not the first time a high-effort opener was met with pure condescension.

Now, let's talk about ""hey"".  Is ""hey"" lol-worthy?  No.  Is ""hey"" sent a million times per day?  Yes.  But what is ""hey"", really?  It's just ""&lt;user&gt; invites you to chat"".  That's the brilliance of it.  If you send it during peak hours and someone is legitimately interested in you, you can have a real convo for a few minutes based on a ""hey"".  And the results speak for themselves: I've never received a condescending reply to ""hey"", and ""hey"" has led to just as many good convos as my high-effort openers.

**TLDR**: ""Hey"" eliminates awfulness, leads to just as many good outcomes as high-effort openers, and it requires 0 effort to use.  You'd be crazy not to use it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqhc1p/this_is_why_i_only_use_hey_as_my_opener_now_in_old/

I jumped into dating fast, i‚Äôll admit, but I was mentally done with the relationship months before it ended so it doesn‚Äôt feel too rushed honestly. 

Im a relationship girl. I have a lot of love to give and nowhere to give it. I never enjoyed Tinder or took it seriously, but I was bored one night, and came across someone who intrigued me. We matched , messaged a little, got eachothers numbers, and set up a date. 

The date went AMAZING. This man is a unicorn. (so far) he is everything Im looking for in a partner. Obviously I know you can‚Äôt know someone after one date, but I am interested in learning more. We both had a great time and agreed on date number 2. 

I guess im a little psycho for this but I checked to see if his Tinder location had changed within the last day, and it did, which means he‚Äôs still swiping. I have to admit I felt kinda crappy, since I stopped swiping (had no interest in anyone else).

But I‚Äôve always felt weird about the idea of being one of many. i know my worth.

77,qqjgoz,1636510086,Dating after trauma - how do you open up to a new partner?,"Long post. Backstory, I‚Äôve been through my fair share of bad boyfriends, but my last relationship was pretty rough. I lived with my ex, who was an addict, and there were some years of gaslighting/manipulation/emotional abuse that really tore me down. I eventually left and decided to take a dating break; the pandemic hit around that time as well so I had a lot of time to sit with my thoughts, look at the parts I‚Äôve played in things, accept that what I experienced was abuse, and then sort through some deep rooted trauma.

I casually dated for a year or so while I found solid ground again. Being on my own was great and I‚Äôm now happy, stable, and at peace. Earlier this year I decided I was ready to try for more than casual so I‚Äôve been dating since then and it‚Äôs been fine, just the general ‚Äúdating sucks‚Äù stuff, but I‚Äôve been working on opening up and letting things develop naturally etc. And this is where the question happens.

I‚Äôve been seeing someone for a few months. He‚Äôs a solid person and is someone I‚Äôd like as a partner and he mentioned making it official a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm ready for a commitment and to start building something with someone... but part of me is also kind of freaking out because i haven‚Äôt ever been in a healthy relationship and I‚Äôm nervous about some of the things I might not have resolved that won‚Äôt surface until I‚Äôm in a relationship again. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs hiding things or using me or or anything like that, I‚Äôm just noticing things like‚Äîfor example‚Äîwhen he asked me what I honestly wanted to do and I told him and he said okay, I spent 20 minutes bracing myself for an argument about how I was inconsiderate/selfish/ruined his night/etc. I‚Äôve never been with someone who said they were okay with something only if they were actually okay with it, if that makes sense, so my guard was up. And I know that things like this will happen for a while and I want to work through it... but I don‚Äôt want him to be blindsided when it happens... but I‚Äôm also not sure how to broach the subject with him without sounding crazy.

For those of you who‚Äôve been in a similar situation, how did you know you were ready to take that leap of faith and trust someone to be there when those things came up? How did you navigate figuring out the baggage healthily as a couple, and how open were you with your SO about the things you might struggle with?

Met a guy off hinge saturday, i just noticed in all his oics he has a ring on his finger and did on our date as well, i didnt think much of it cause obviously if he was married i would assume hed take off the ring, plus hes on hinge, plus i went to his house after and no signs if a woman lived there, it very much looked like a single mans house. it was a small apartment that was messy and had no sign of female items anywhere, full closet of mens clothes only (had to pass through to get to the bathroom)
but my roomate says this is weird?  Should i ask him about it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqjkvc/guy_wearing_ring_on_his_ring_finger/

He understood that I don‚Äôt feel the spark at all (we never actually got the chance to call or meet up irl due to work commitments ‚Äî he works crazy shifts and I travel a lot ‚Äî but we always took the time to reply to each other every day) and he wished me all the best in finding my partner.

I acknowledged that I was still here for him. A couple days later all of a sudden a message. We carried on a good conversation after he tried to see if I was upset about the lack of communication. Of course things went well for a few more days until nothing. I inquired again and was told I was pushing him away because of my behavior (came on too strong). I apologized, it was accepted then nothing again. A few weeks go by and I pop in to see how he is after an unfortunate event. He‚Äôs fine and acts cordial but no more conversation. All the while still on my social media and even liked a post of mine. He comes back in October and apologizes saying he took me for granted and he was sorry for how he treated me. He also expressed a want to still see me when I return to see my family on Christmas vacation. We are a distance away. I accept and say yes we still can see each other as he asks and things go so well. Promises were even made to fly me out to see him if he decides he‚Äôs moving for work.

Me and this guy have been seeing each other for about a month or two, not every week because of work and not living in the same area and traffic being constant hell. But it was great, he told me some personal stuff about himself and maybe he‚Äôs backing off because of that? But we saw each other again after he told me and it seemed like we were both wanting to see each other again. 

Until this past weekend. We were both out of town - I went on an outdoor trip for a week and he went to some concert venue and when I had service it seemed like we were texting consistently - given the situation. Then I got back into town and our weekend plans got cancelled because he got a cold and it feels like I‚Äôve been iced out since. He texts which were pretty consistent and responsive and now he takes multiple hours and twice now over a day to respond. Meanwhile I can see he‚Äôs been active on other social media platforms. 

Am I actually getting ghosted or maybe he‚Äôs taking a step back? I‚Äôm texting him at the end of the week or weekend about it but I‚Äôm freaking out in my head and am actually pretty sad about it especially since we both talked about how shitty ghosters are - which that‚Äôs essentially how we met.
