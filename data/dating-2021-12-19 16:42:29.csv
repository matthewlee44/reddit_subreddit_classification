0,rk7u4e,1639953782,How to keep things casual?,"So, I've met this girl on one of the dating apps. We hit it off, and we met up for drinks a week later. 
The date was good, we had a really good time. We kissed a little bit at the end and made a promise to meet again. 

I've enjoyed our date, and even though I'm looking for a relationship, I don't feel it with her. 

During our date, we spoke about relationships, and we both mention that we are looking for a relationship. I wasn't completely honest to tell her I'm also looking for casual sex. 

I am attracted to her physically, and I would like to keep things casual and not take this to a serious relationship. Maybe like a friends with benefits kinda thing. 

Should I tell her that? How do I even begin to tell her that? I have no idea how casual dating works, and I want to be honest and not lead her falsely because I think she is really into me. 


Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk7u4e/how_to_keep_things_casual/
1,rk82gi,1639954458,Am I being unreasonable wanting more of a reason for closure after 2 months of dating?,"So I (29M) have been dating someone (29F) for 2 months. Things were going great, we connected really well on many levels and had lots of deep conversations, ironically one of the things we connected over is how awful ghosting is and bad break ups in the past.

Anyway the most recent time I saw her I could tell the vibes were completely off and we were just so disconnected. The texting slowed down and she became less responsive to the point she didn’t respond. I left it for a week and heard nothing from her (we both had some big things to deal with so thought best to get them out of the way before having that sort of conversation). So I text her again asking about and she tells me she just didn’t feel a romantic connection.

I’ve no idea if it is something I said or did or if it just happens but I feel after getting so close to someone you’re sort of owed more of an explanation than that, that’s what you’d say to someone after one or two dates.

I’ve said how I felt about it and need more for closure but she isn’t responsive so it’s looking like I’ve been ghosted. But I wanted to ask if this was unreasonable considering how long we dated? The spark was there for me but not for her which unfortunately happens sometimes, I totally get that, but that’s sort of why I’m questioning if I’m being unreasonable here because my feelings were stronger",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk82gi/am_i_being_unreasonable_wanting_more_of_a_reason/

13,rk97s3,1639957816,I saw my crush today and I felt nothing.,"I (29M) have had a crush on this (30F) for over a year now. A few years ago used to work at the same community college and now we currently go to the same church. Over the past year she's had such hot and cold behavior towards me. Eyemaster on two separate occasions what is the issue between us and both times she said there's no answer you but yet she still is passive aggressive towards me and cold and distant.

 Last month at chruch she just completely stared at me from a distance with a very unpleasant expression on her face. It was pretty rude so I stared back and we had a stare-off for about a min and a half in the end I gave up because I'm tired of playing this game of immaturity considering I've asked her what is the issue and she says nothing but then proceeds with childish and immature behavior towards me. When she's around other people she super talkative and happy at chruch. 

So today was the first time in a month we've been in the same room at church or in the same place in general for a long period of time. We noticed each other at church and looked at each other but didn't say anything didn't even say hi or wave at each as we passed each other. For a month I used that time to move on and get past her it seems like it's working because I didn't get that feeling of nervousness, excitement or happiness like I normally do when we're in the same room or when I see her in general. We were less than 7 ft away from each other and I felt completely numb and uninterested in her and what she had going on.

Things were going really well, even told me how much he liked me and all the stuff he was looking forward to. Talked almost every other day. Basically vibe on everything. 

We had plans to meet up at his place yesterday at 4. Confirmed it the night before. I get there and someone lets me into the building. I knock on his door and no answer or to my texts. I waited thinking maybe he was in the shower or fell asleep. Also my text messages were going through green so I though maybe my phone wasn’t working or something. So I messaged him on snap and insta. The light in his place was in but no answer. I kept waiting and knocking and called from a neighbors phone. Turns out he blocked me. Then I got angry and actually banged on the door twice.

Then he unblocked me and texted “Get the fuck out and stop beating on my door for real. Fuck off. Are you fucking psychotic”

Then my messages went green again like he blocked and then unblocked me. He also blocked me on all social media. I can’t think of anything I did or why he would do that. Of course I acted upset because he led me on made plans and then stood me up looking like an idiot. This is the third time he’s bailed on me but before he actually had a decent excuse I could verify and actually told me. I have literally never seen such erratic and crazy behavior. Is there any reason you could think of why a guy would do that? I mean I know he sometimes struggles with anxiety but to do something that cruel and manipulative I just can’t even imagine why.

I have one friend who is now engaged. When he was dating his fiancé, she told me multiple times that I would be her 2nd choice if my friend ever died or something like that.

Then, another group of friends and I went out drinking. I drove us home as I was the only sober one in the group and was able to clearly hear this whole conversation. My buddy told his wife that he knows she would sleep with me if they weren't married to which she just told him to shut up.

Finally, a third group of friends has a friend's wife that is very touchy when she gets drunk. I've noticed that she is this way with me and her husband (my friend). It is strange.

While all of these encounters are awkward and I don't care to have ever been in them, it makes me wonder why I've had trouble getting into a relationship or having friends hook me up with their friends.

I'm 28 and have never had an official girlfriend. I've seen people for a few months but it always ends because I'm agnostic (live in a religious part of the country).  There has yet to be mutual attraction between myself and another woman, though instances have risen where myself or them are interested but the other party isn't.

I (21F) will be meeting a man (28M) in person for the first time next month, assuming our schedules work out. We have been talking for about 4 months as of now, and I did confirm his identity and know that he is definitely who he says he is. He’s driving over 10 hours to come see me. He would love to stay at my place if I’m comfortable with it but ultimately I don’t think it will be a good idea since my parents will be out of town and just my brother (19M) will be home. We have gotten more intimate over the phone and whatnot, and although it would be nice to cuddle and spend the night I don’t feel ready for much physical stuff right away. Ultimately I don’t know how we will vibe in person. The plan is to meet in public and see how things go, we will just have a day together and see how it goes. He’d probably be here for like 1 day and a half. 

I’d rather him stay at a hotel but he wants to sleep in his car if we don’t end up staying at my place. He said he doesn’t want to pay for a hotel even if I do pitch in. He’s not broke from what I can tell, he’s just frugal and more rugged I guess. He says that he might just get a low temperature camping sleeping bag before coming, since he wants one anyways. I live in a very cold climate and I’d rather he not just stay in his car, but ultimately I don’t think it’s respectful to have people over when my parents wouldn’t approve of it. For my own safety and that of my brother’s, the dates should probably stay public. He says he’d prefer to stay at my house but if I don’t feel comfortable with it or it won’t work out, that he’s fine either way. He made it clear that he doesn’t want me to feel pressured into doing anything that I don’t want to, and that he has slept in his car before sometimes. Ultimately I’m just too empathetic. How can I stay firm to my boundaries while also making this work for him? He’s the one driving over 10 hours and I guess I feel bad for some reason. I’d rather he be in a hotel and have a nice place to stay after the date, makes it easier to end the day when we both have a nice place to go back to.

22,rk9w64,1639959756,Hi everyone! I'm a single man who is currently dating in my 30's. I'm trying to understand what others think about my concerns. Please don't be disrespectful just want to see some honest opinions/ideas about this topic. How can I be less rude/more polite when sharing such ideas with women I'm dating,"So one of my biggest turn offs as far as dating goes... Women who feel entitled when it comes to dating men, friendships, or meeting men in general for the first time. Specifically those who believe that meeting and spending time with a man is automatic grounds for that man who is also putting just as much time, energy, and effort to hang out with that woman; ""the one's who should be responsible to pay for everything"". When in these modern times everyone is fighting for more equality and fairness in all walks of life. Yet it's quite puzzling that in the year 2021 this is something most women I have met struggle with and find unreasonable to overcome nor comprehend. 

My rule of thumb and belief has always been that if we don't know each other like that yet, and we are just meeting for the first time, not seriously dating, nor in any official relationship. We both should at least for the sake of fairness and equality agree to pay for everything 50-50 or for each to pay for their own. Because just like in reality no man should be expecting any women to just ""open up their legs"" just because you are paying for their dinner, alcohol, tickets, etc.... just as equally I believe women shouldn't be expecting men to pay for all of the expenses if we are just hanging out, and getting to know each other. Specially without first making sure if it's alright for that man to pay for everything. Instead of just pretending like it's our duty take care of it.

Should I continue with the date?,"So I started a new job a year ago and would work with this lady from time to time. She is a very capable colleague and I learned a lot from her. As a person she is intelligent, diligent, and kind to everyone and anyone. I have a lot of respect for her. I finally had the courage to ask her out two months ago, she vaguely said we can grab a coffee some time. 
Since I had asked her out, we simply haven’t spoken much, let alone arranging a date. This is in part because we don’t get to see each other a lot at work anyway; but when we did see each other she seemed to be avoiding me quite subtly by busying herself with work, or just avoiding situations where we could have talked alone.
I had an opportunity to speak to her today and just gently asked how she felt about my attention and about going on a date. At this point she looked a bit uneasy and her eyes looked wet; and she explained that she has been quite busy the last month or so, and would ‘grab a coffee and get to know each other’ in the New Year because she was going to her parents’ for Christmas.

Here is my dilemma: my gut instinct is that she is not really interested in me but was too kind / polite to say no. But she has said she would go out with me, and indeed the situation has not been convenient for her. I don’t know how best to interpret what she had said and done - should I continue to try and arrange a date after she had come back?

Before you ask, I do have means to contact her outside of work but I thought it is too invasive if I did do so.

He reply really late most of the time. Knowing me, that kind of not replying as soon as possible would really make me annoyed and I would rather not talk. But I was not expecting anything to this guy (M22) I kinda just let him be. until One day we set up a date and met up. 

A sunday date that turns into a sleepover. I kinda have him to have sex. which I dont think is bad, I mean is bad that we had sex on the first date?  It was intimate though. It felt like it was intimate. we set up another date. 

Fast forward to the next date which is the whole weekend. We got high and we told each other that we like each other, I told him I want to date him and be my boyfriend. He replied late as usual, the next morning he said that he is hesitant about the whole dating relationship. He is also joining the army next year so we wont be seeing each other for a long time. 

He is not sure about when we will see each other again so it kinda made me anxious, and wonder,Did I messed it up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkaar2/i_f23_met_up_with_a_guy_m22_from_bumble_and_i/
28,rkabu7,1639961052,Remember the Power in Walking Away!,"I made this post after seeing multiple posts asking why someone takes a day or more to text back, why a guy slept with a woman but didn’t call her back, and so on.

If you’re putting your eggs in one basket with a person who is Lukewarm or early on isn’t exhibiting behaviors that show interest and respect, understand that you will save your heart and mind from struggle by simply walking away.

Regardless of how attractive someone is or what they say, we must pay attention to what they do, patterns of behavior, and the power we have as individuals to say “No, I will not be treated this way” and find someone who will treat you in the way that you’d like.

The majority of us have rejected someone, have given someone a lack of attention because we’re not as interested, and sometimes didn’t provide a thesis to them or held their hand.

If you have to question why someone isn’t as engaged or interested as you are, it’s best to walk away and come across people who are. If someone says no to your request for a date then changes their mind weeks later, you weren’t/aren’t their first choice.

If we don’t walk away early on, we set ourselves up to be mismanaged and mistreated. Every human has value and in dating we must TAKE CLAIM of our power to walk away from someone you’re incompatible with, someone who doesn’t share your communication style, or someone who simply doesn’t care as much as you would like them to as shown by their actions. 

You’ll avoid mental gymnastics, pain, and suffering by walking away.

Dating is a numbers game and involves good timing for both individuals. The only power you have is over yourself and your reactions to things. Stand strong in your worth, male or female. We are all worthy of a good love and respect.

Walk away at the first sign of disrespect, not replying for a day or days, someone being wishy-washy, someone who doesn’t value your time, a catfish, and other situations that do not serve you. Leave at the first sign! 

A guy who says I want a relationship but only wants sex (he will use you) or a woman who goes hot and cold (she is using you for slight entertainment or busy with others she likes most likely).

Don’t think people are unaware of how they’re treating you! Do you really think someone is unaware that they aren’t giving you attention, care or respect? No!

I’m gonna go extremely honest and without political correctness in what I say here. Many humans are selfish creatures. Some people live to have their desires fulfilled and fuck all. 

Sometimes we come across someone who is in the gray zone for filling our desires or we’re bored or it might be a good fuck so we stick around long enough to have our carnal or mental desires met without giving this person emotional investment. You are literally a pawn to be toyed with and there is little guilt from the issuing party! 

How do you protect yourself from this? How do you not waste your time? You walk away. Walking away starts with a decision in the mind to honor and respect yourself enough to not take the treatment or conditions you’ve been given from another. It is also a muscle.

We must believe that we are valuable, have self-confidence, and believe in abundance as part of our driving force to easily walk away. There’s so many people out here to date!

Date more than 1 person at once! Have flavors at the same time to see how different people truly are! They truly are.

Person A may not treat you like Person B. So why the hell should you stick around and wait for Person A to tell you they value you through their actions, reply to text, reply after sex, or show interest when there’s so many out there waiting to connect with you for something better.

Hold fast to the value you have as a person and walk away when shit is uncertain and the person simply isn’t there like you are. 

How many people have you met in your life up until this point? Did you like them all? Do you feel that every interaction was actually meaningful? Why not treat dating in the same way? 

If they aren’t interested, they aren’t interested. Don’t hope for the best but live in reality and be reminded of abundance and the value you have as a person. If you aren’t being treated the way you would like or have to question, walk away. Exercise your right to have what you need!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkabu7/remember_the_power_in_walking_away/
29,rkacwa,1639961136,Is my behavior the reason why this guy rejected me? Or was it just lack of interest?,"
27F Earlier this week on Wed, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We’ve been in contact via Instagram messages. Friday we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie yesterday. Fri evening I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. Yesterday before the movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on Wednesday, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. On Wednesday, we ended with a hug. When I spoke with him Friday, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but yesterday was so off, he sent a message after movie saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. He unmatched with me on the dating app and I stopped following him on IG. Bit soon to say but he’s still following me on IG and viewed my stories after saying he didn’t want to talk to me anymore. Hasn’t gotten around to unfollowing me I guess.

So here I am sitting at a lovely beach side airbnb on my last night of a brief trip I made to the coast. I had plans of going out with a beautiful girl but have been ghosted these last 5 hours.

Honestly, I can safely say \~70% of my dates get either cancelled for some lame excuse that day or don't text back at all. This last scenario leaves you in a weird limbo in which you risk being rude for making other plans and having them reply to you at last minute.

I checked in with my (male) friends and they totally have this happen to them as well. Is it just the expected casualness of dating at this age. If I try to recall, I can't say the same has happened when I dated women +30y/o.

31,rkamxp,1639961959,Treated me like a gf but doesn’t want a gf,"We’re both in our early 30s. 

I’ve been dating a guy for a few months who always initiated and planned fun dates, paid for everything and texted me every day. 

For the first month or so he chased me and then we settled into a very comfortable back and forth. He was always considerate and learned what I liked on dates and in bed and then made an effort to do those things without my asking. 

Everything was really fun and great until last week, when he volunteered that he’s not looking for a relationship. I told him that I had some feelings and that if he was not in a place to at least explore where things could go then we shouldn’t continue seeing each other. He agreed with zero pushback, saying he had feelings for me but doesn’t want a relationship right now because he’s been “focusing on himself” after a breakup. There was no equivocation like, “I’m not ready YET” or “I’d like to see where this could go.” Just “totally get it, wish you all the best.” He hopes we can be friends lol. 

I guess I just don’t get what went wrong or why someone would act like a boyfriend but then be happy to end things so easily? I didn’t ask him for a relationship because the truth is I didn’t even know if I wanted to him to be my boyfriend yet! I was maybe interested in exploring exclusivity. But once he said that I felt like what’s the point in seeing where things could go when I already know his limitations? Did I do something wrong? Did he? Why would he just let me go? I know that when a man tells you he doesn’t want a relationship, believe him, so why does it feel like I fucked up?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkamxp/treated_me_like_a_gf_but_doesnt_want_a_gf/
32,rkanb4,1639961990,My bf went to a wedding without me and I’m upset.,"Is it normal to go to a wedding without your significant other?

My boyfriend of one year has a group of friends that are getting married. I don't know these friends or really anyone that's going to be at the wedding other than my BF. 

I’m shy and quiet but it doesn’t mean I don’t like being around people. 

My bf is one of the best men and is walking alongside another girl who is one of the bridesmaids... so if I went to the wedding I would have technically be sitting alone watching this.

Anyways at the last minute my BF tells me he thinks I should not go because he thinks we would fight if I saw him walking with another girl (she has a boyfriend apparently).. but anyways he says I would have been uncomfortable at the wedding. 

I suspect he also did this because there’s another guy who has a gf and is not taking her to the wedding either. They are good friends.

He ends up going the next day without me and well I feel hurt and betrayed by him.
 I did not think I would feel so hurt but I do. I don’t feel important and I feel like weddings are good bonding opportunities for couples and he decides to not take me.

I known this girl for about 5 years. We were part of a group of friends. The group for the most part has now split a long time ago.

We are all in college and/or graduated now.

I saw her right before moving (6-7 months ago)for work. It was random and I didn’t know she worked there. We caught up just a little. 

Just last week I texted her seeing how she doing. I also told her that I was coming back to town for the weekend and if she wanted to go out. She said she was busy the weekend due to work and I said let me know about next week because my company is letting us work from home, she said she will keep me posted.

We did text a little bit more after that but not too much. I could had ask a lot of questions but wanted to save it for in person.

I texted her today about next (this week) and she said she’ll let me know and after a while she said she works all week during the afternoon. And she said if the week after Christmas is fine.

I’m not sure what to do or what to think. I know that if they wanted to that someone can always make time for you.

This could potentially read like I’m just insanely oblivious to girls hitting on me, which is probably the case lmfao. Basically, a girl I’ve had a bit of a crush on at work and I have been getting closer. I thought things were getting a little flirty between us over time but I was also pretty sure it was all in my head because I saw zero possibility she could actually be into me, she’s way out of my league. After work a few days ago she told me she’d need to message me later to fill me in on some work gossip. I thought that seemed like just a bit of an excuse to slide into my dms, but again, I’m oblivious, so I just told her I was looking forward to it and then promptly forgot about it. I thought she was joking in all honesty, a kind of half hearted ‘I’ll message you’ that people say and forget. 

Anyway, to my surprise, she messaged me later that night and we’ve been talking on and off ever since. We’ve both been working crazy hours but we soon both have a few days off, and today she messaged me saying ‘when we finally get to our days off we should go out and celebrate together’.

Now I’m dense, but even I’m not that stupid. I instantly assumed holy shit, she’s trying to slyly ask me out. That was this morning though and since then she hasn’t even opened my reply saying that we definitely should. 

So since she hasn’t replied or even opened the conversation since I am doubting myself.  My self-esteem is ridiculously low though so I feel like I can’t judge this well. So, was this her attempt at asking me out? Logically I want to say yes, because when I think about the kind of flirty vibes between us, her making an excuse to message me first, implying we should at the very least hang out, etc., it seems to much of a coincidence if nothing is going on. But the other part of me is saying she isn’t into you, she’s just being friendly, why would she really be into you, if she really was she would have followed up immediately when you said yes, etc.

We are close. We havent been in constant communication all of these years but whenever we do have it its great and fluid.

Backstory= i have been seeing someone (random) for 2 months now (that is when we met in massachusetts) and we got pregnant together. It is strange to accidentally get pregnant after barely 1 month dating someone. We handled it well (could have been better) and decided to abort.

He did say that in the end its my choice but of course he gave me his opinion on how he thought aborting was a good idea. I too had doubts on having a child while barely just starting to see someone. Well long story short: these last 2 weeks have been rough on the relationship and on my body (i got the abortion done 4 weeks ago). 

The guy ive known for years reaches out to me last sunday, asks how i am and what i am doing, and how is life etc. Well i tell him whats going on and he wants to see me so bad. Not sure what to do. Ive expressed my frustrations with current partner and he seems to be very passive or just not wanting to get hurt (or in denial) about how rough it has been (mostly because it was my body that went through it not his).

Plus, to make matters worst, i had twins and the second one dropped last friday. 27M reached out to me on sunday after 4 years. My current bf (we became exclusive after the pregnancy news) and ""father"" of the children has been feeling very unreachable for the past 2 weeks (i am always texting first and calling him or making plans to see him not vice versa). 

We are supposed to meet up on Tuesday in person. He has been in Boston for the weekend (to meet his fraternity brothers from the past for dinner). He came back tonight and doesnt want to talk on the phone. Maybe video chat tomorrow. I told him about this guy i know for years and how he reached out. He sounded indifferent. Plus, he isnt even here usually. He lives in massachusetts.

He is just back for the holidays and we have only met up once (1 night) since he has, and only because i took a train into the city to see him. His identical twin bro (yes he is a twin!) got covid and had to quarantine at their parents house in long island so for the past week he had to stay in hotels while they quarantined. He has been away since wednesday in boston.

Honestly, i feel like i know the answer to all of this but am super confused about everything! Might be all the blood loss (4 weeks going on 5 and bleeding on and off heavily plus the second baby drops last friday when i go to see him!)

One of which, that most women who are trying to flirt or explicitly hit on me, at work for example, are older than me. More on the mature side. It takes a lot of effort for me to ignore and act oblivious cause, you know, Work colleagues and professional etiquette and all… also, I’ve always had the fantasy of being with a white woman… so it’s a pressure from both fronts. I don’t know why, I guess because I’m also attracted to class, intelligence, sophistication.

The only family I have is my younger brother and it's because I had to look after him ever since he was a toddler. My parents are divorced, and we moved in with my mom, but she never really was present for us mostly cuz of work and even if she was, she wasn't a good parent. Now I live on my own and I have a boyfriend for the first time. He has everything, a great education, an understanding mother, great family and friends. I feel broken when I compare myself to him because he pops up alot of fun and amazing stories of his life and all I have is trauma..the worst part is I never had a single friend my entire life even now but I never let him see this part of me because I don't wanna be a bummer, or someone to pity. However, it's getting exhausting and him coming from a place of privilege while I'm not makes it difficult to talk to him about what I go through on a daily basis. Recently he told all of his closest family about me and I really don't know how to feel about that. I know I should be happy but it's just hard as I feel like he doesn't know me entirely. He's spending this christmas and new years with his family and today he didn't even text me all even to let me know that he'll be busy, I know I should be happy because rn he's enjoying his time with his family but why do I feel sadness?

My(27f) boyfriend(30m) and I have had a long and trying year as we both grow after lots of family drama (my side) and us moving apart. We still work on our relationship and I love him whole heartedly but not living together anymore and us both working 50 weeks has done a number on us. He has little to no trust in females due to trauma growing up and past relationships so what trust we have has been hard fought. He's always said that if I cheated it would be a deal breaker and I agreed the same to him. I would never cheat because I saw what it did first hand when I was young and my dad cheated. I think I destroyed his trust tonight.

Let me preface with a little back story. We've always called his member ""Alexander the Great"" or ""Alex"" in reference. For a few months, a couple years ago, he referred to it as Caesar - I think just trying a new name - and we decided it wasn't as good as Alex. 

I just bought a new car Friday, he was with me, and he went in half on the down-payment but today he asked why I was so dressed up to go buy a car. I wasn't really, simple makeup, jeans, boots, and a decent top but nothing at all revealing. Tonight I go over, we get busy and as we lay cuddling and teasing each other, something about children came up. We're child free and I jokingly said ""hold up Caesar, we don't want none of that"". He clams up and i know I fucked it up. We argued and I didn't know what to say because I would never, ever do that to him or anyone. I just don't know why I said the wrong name and I left. 

I don't know what to think or say. I think I'm going to lose him because if he had said another females name in that moment I would've been upset but I know he would never cheat.

I'm out with them at least once a week if not more. Pubs, bars, clubs, cafes, outdoors, events. Everything. I have zero issues in talking to people. I have both male and female friends.

For someone who is so social, you would think that I'd have no problem finding potential interests, but no. I have a big problem in getting someone to reciprocate interest in me. And to be clear, I'm not even talking about a relationship or sex here. I just want someone to want to flirt with me. I want to feel desirable.

My own theory is that I'm not being forward enough. In my mind, girls already have a ton of creeps after them. I don't want to be one of those. I also don't want to be the lonely person that I am and so I talk to women, I laugh and joke and show an interest and it just doesn't get reciprocated.

I'm not ugly. I'm not a 10/10 either. But man, when I'm on a night out with friends who \*do\* get all of the success, I feel like a 1/10.

It's gotten to the point where I've given up trying to chat someone up spur of the moment. The effort involved in showing an interest only for nothing to happen just isn't worth it. I've been friendzoned a lot because of it. I have a better time with my friends when none of this is thought about, but that doesn't solve the situation, it only pushes it to the side. It'd just be nice to feel like I'm worth more.

78,rke7d9,1639973134,Worth trying to date people knowing I'm moving away in six months?,"So, a bit of background on this situation. I currently live at home in NY and have been working at a new job for six months. I'm in the recreation field and I work for a municipality working a pretty decent job. However, in NY (Albany in particular), my field (recreation) is so much smaller than in other parts of the country. Ever since I started in this field, my dreams have been to move out west (Colorado, Utah, Arizona, etc.) to pursue a career in the outdoors. I really love doing it, and it's incredibly fulfilling work. And Albany is just not an area where I can really thrive in the field like I can out west. I've worked a few jobs out there the last few years and I can't see myself ending up anywhere else. I've had lots of conversations with my family (who is bummed to see me want to leave home) and they all support me in my choice to pursue it.

While I know I'm going to move out there at some point, I still don't have a job lined up yet nor many details about what/where I'd actually be doing. Doing some job hunting I've set my sights on Denver as the best spot for me having been there a lot and falling in love with the city. I'll be working this current job for about another 6 months if I can in fact get a decent job and place to live by that time. My boss is super supportive too and has done a lot to help me expand my professional skills in hopes of landing a good job out there. It might be 4 months or 8 months from now, but I don't see myself in NY more than another year max.

So now the issue of this post (sorry for a ton of backstory but I feel it's necessary to understand the context). While I know my goal is to leave NY soon, I still want to continue dating and meeting people until I definitely have a job out there. However, I don't know how to feel knowing I most likely wouldn't be able to keep a relationship more than 5-6 months before having to end it. Yes, I understand long distance is possible, but with the number of things I want to do out there part of me doesn't feel like trying to date while still home is worth it. I don't want to fall for someone (or have someone fall for me) just to know that it wouldn't be truly long-term. I went on a few dates with a girl recently and she basically explained that while things were good, she didn't want to progress with someone who doesn't plan on staying around. It sucks because I feel weird telling girls, I won't be around long term as I feel like that hurts my chances of getting to know someone better until then. Even if it was more of a casual thing, I feel like it can be a turn off even for more casual relationships.

What do you think? Should I still try to meet new women and not tell them I plan on moving? Just be honest and let them know my plans? Just don't bother at all and enjoy my time here with family/friends? I wish it were that simple, but I love to meet new people and foster new relationships so going that long without even trying is tough.

-



She 28 works night shift clinic/catholic school girl/sweet, me 31M

Our date seemed platonic, we met online and had texted prior to meeting for about 2 months due to covid reasons.  Her texting time frame is bad, she will take either a day to respond or 2-3 days.  But certain days we'd talk every few hours apart.

Our first date lasted an hour because of work and it went great, I went for a quick kiss at the end, but she turned and gave me a cheek.  However, she texted me back after a few hours wanting to see me again with heart eyes.

The second date we stayed for 3 hours, all seemed platonic, we played at the arcades, bowling, she tossed me a sexual innuendo regarding how we shared an alcoholic drink, which I only smiled and nod... then we played pool, but she looked frustrated/annoyed (looking at her nails) while we played pool and she said she's tired...  I walked her to her car and she hugged me and left.

I texted her if she made it home safely, and that I had a good time &amp; to see if she had a good time.  She texts me 2 days later saying she was caught up with work and she had a good time and is down for another date.

I scheduled for another date that Saturday, but she told me she works that night but could make it... however, she ends up canceling at the last hour and apologizes.  I told her it's fine, we'll reschedule and she said thanks for being so understanding.  After 5 days had past, I went ahead and scheduled another date, no response, so the next day I wrote something else, no response, the next day I sent a funny pic and mentioned I wasn't feeling all that great on the last date due to cough meds and drinks.. she then finally returns my message and told me she is off next Sunday and she'll be off the entire night.

A few days before the day she said she cares for me and sent me a kissy emoji face and said she will be off the entire night.

We went to play mini-golf, mainly was platonic, not much conversation but cheering each other on, we then played a few games at the arcade and when I said lets hit up the bar, she said ""I'm tired"" and as we walked out I asked how about I come over her place which she had a slight startled look saying ""What? Nooo""... and then I told her but hey, we wanted to watch a movie together (when we were texting before dating) and she said ""yahhh"" so then we changed the subject, walked to her car and she hugged me and left... 

So the next day I told her I had a good time and looking forward to the next.

6 days go by

Hey, are you open to having a date next week where we can sit and talk over coffee? The past game sessions were fun, but I want to focus on us. (2 big sentences)

The next day she writes back... saying

86,rkend1,1639974629,Wondering if there's any possibility a girl may be interested in me or is just being friendly.,"For some context about me I recently got out of a four year serious relationship. I'm not aggressively looking to get back into dating but am open to it if it were to happen.

Now for some context about the situation, last Friday I went out to meet some friends and there was introduced to the girl in question. We didn't start talking immediately but when we did we hit it off right away. I don't remember the last time I had so much fun talking to someone I just met. We both had a lot of fun and spent pretty much the entire night talking to each other. It was a nice refresher from all the negative stuff that's been happening towards the end of my 2021.

Anyway I'll list some reasons regarding why I think she may or may not be interested romantically.

### Reasons I think she may be interested:

1. There was quite a bit of banter going on that night. I'm not sure if it was flirty or not, but for example she would very frequently touch or ""hit"" my arm when she laughed.
2. My friends would comment on the two of us. This isn't really that big of a sign, but if the more subtle signs themselves weren't there to start with I'm sure my friends wouldn't be making such comments.
3. On Saturday the next day we spent the entire day giving texts back and forth. She would also mention that she felt like she's known me for years even though it's only been a day.

### Reasons I think she may _not_ be interested:

1. That night we hung out with everyone she did say that I'm not her type. From personal experience this usually doesn't mean much (e.g., most of my ex-girlfriends weren't my ""type"" either) but I still don't think it's exactly something you'd say to someone you're romantically interested in.
2. I'm not sure how to put this but it's just really hard to tell for me right now. Granted, it's only been like two days since I've met her but I can't tell if she just thinks of me as a good friend or not. And I kind of feel like the fact that I'm thinking this doesn't seem like a good sign.
3. When I said let's meet up again she was very enthusiastic but kind of just left that up in the air with a ""let's talk again soon"" kind of comment. Again, may or may not be negative given the short amount of time but I'll still add it in.

I guess that's about it but frankly I do think it's a little early to tell. I'm planning on asking her out for dinner sometime in the future (perhaps next week or the week after depending on our schedules).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkend1/wondering_if_theres_any_possibility_a_girl_may_be/
87,rkeo3w,1639974694,How do I bring the butterflies back in my relationship?,"My bf (18m) and I (17f) have been dating for 4 months now. We're very serious already, and are going to university together. We see each other almost every day, and it's been like this since before we started dating. We go to different schools so we intentionally make plans to spend time with each other. We're also very intentional with our dates - every week we do a special date night, and we regularly take each other on surprise dates. Usually we take turns surprising each other every month, but sometimes we'll do it more often, just for fun. The sex is great. We have so much in common, we go to the gym together, we're studying the same thing at uni, we have a lot of common friends, we share a lot of the same fundamental beliefs and core values. His parents always tell me I'm part of the family and he recently told me they want to take me on a trip. My dad and sister love him, and he genuinely treats my sister like his little sister. He treats me like a queen; he's everything I've ever wanted in a man. I'm so in love with him. We can manage conflict with compassion, and we're good at communicating. We both struggle with mental illnesses so we help each other navigate it. 

There's one thing that I would change though - I miss how it felt at the start; the butterflies and the rush of adrenaline. In my two previous relationships, that initial honeymoon phase lasted longer. We never really had the ""chase"" phase, we both knew we were interested in each other and we went straight to the dating. It was great, I wouldn't change a thing. I just miss the feeling of being excited to see him. Not that I'm not excited now, but it's just become part of my routine. I want to be even more intentional with how I love him, I'm just not sure how to do that. Any ideas?

Add on: my previous boyfriends were abusive (emotionally and sexually), and so my relationships were very stressful and intense. I don't have a lot of good memories from them. Regardless, I felt a lot of butterflies. I'm not sure if those were because of how anxious those relationships made me. All I know is that they didn't feel as mundane as this one.

88,rkep2m,1639974784,Should I have said this?,"I (26, F) had been dating a doctor (29, M) for a couple of months. The first couple of weeks were great, we went on dates, texted every day until one day I started to notice he was getting more infrequent with his responses. I told myself I was overthinking and that he was working nights and had been tired until that weekend he canceled our date because “he felt unwell” and want to reschedule for the next day. The next day we met up and he opened up that he had been struggling with depression and he didn’t feel like himself and this was something he had struggled with in the past. We talked about whether we should pause things and he told me that he wanted to be with me and that he’s glad he opened up to me. The next couple weeks we continued to text, with him mostly initiating, but never him initiating to see me in person or plan a date. We went from seeing each other once a week to once every two weeks, mostly me initiating. This was hard for me because I wanted to see him at least once a week, we live 5 minutes walking distance, and it just felt like he had put no effort into even seeing me. The only thing that maybe made me think he was still interested was that he would reach out and text me daily to say good morning and see how my day has been, but otherwise, there was barely anything in person. We never talk on the phone either. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we had planned (mostly me) to go on a date the next day that would a bit of walking around. He has been working 80 work weeks and I told him multiple times throughout the past week that if he was tired, we didn’t have to do this date. But yesterday he reassured me it sounded fun and he couldn’t wait to see me and I told him I was excited for the date too. Now today, about 2 hours before the date, he texted me saying he was too exhausted to go and that he was sorry, with no plans to reschedule, and then fell asleep for a few hours. 

After he woke up, I asked him to walk over to talk and it ended up with me telling him that I felt like he has given me really no effort the past couple of weeks and that I felt strung along, and that if he wanted to be with me like he said he did, there would be more effort in seeing me. When I asked him if he still had feelings for me, he said he never stopped having feelings for me, but they’re just “locked away right now.” He apologized and said that he’s going through things right now, but never said he’d try to be better or make more effort towards me. Since he didn’t offer to show more effort and to actually make me feel wanted or that he’d fight for me, I just told him I deserved someone who would walk 5 mins to see me, even if it was for a little bit, or someone who could literally show MINIMAL effort to make me feel desired or wanted. That discussion ultimately led to us breaking things off, which sucked, because I clearly still have feelings for him. It’s hard to walk away from someone that you want to be with and care for, but know that they aren’t good for you. 

But now as I lay here and reflect on today, I wonder if I had overreacted? Should I have given him more time? Let him finish up his inpatient duties since that was his busiest time? Should I have waited for him to get into a better place emotionally? Or was I right to assume that he’s not as interested as he said he is and move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkep2m/should_i_have_said_this/

Beforehand I honestly dated really horrible men. My first “relationship” (which only lasted 8 months) was with a compulsive liar who was extremely emotionally abusive and a cheater. Other guys I’ve dated (1-4 months) have always chosen another girl or they were just trying to use me or had really fucked up pasts that they lied about/hid from me.

My relationship now has honestly been amazing. We get along very well and I’m very involved in his family as I see them both every weekend. During the week when I can’t see him, I become very excited knowing I’ll see him soon on the weekends. For the most part he hasn’t given me any reason to question his loyalty or love for me. However, a few days ago in bed, he said the name of another girls name. I didn’t react at all or even say anything about it, but he became very flustered and even admitted how fucked up it was to hear another woman’s name. I never met her personally, but I do remember him saying how flirty she’s always been. Last year when we first starting dating he invited me to meet her but I had finals to finish and said he should just go see her since she was in town and I couldn’t make it. Something in my gut screamed at me to meet her and I’ve regretted not going ever since.

Outside of that initial worrisome in regards to that girl, he has been a great partner but I still can’t help these doubtful thoughts. Sometimes I question why I’m even with him or wonder when this relationship will end. I’ll just get these dark thoughts saying “This relationship won’t last very long” or “You should break up with him” even though he really hasn’t given me any reason to and I’m very happy with him. I think it is due to the fact my trust and ideas of love has been beaten down and twisted all these years.

We met on highschool (15M and 13F when we met, yes the ages make me cringe in retrospect, but we where kids and friends for a long time before I started getting feelings, didn't even kiss at the time) and were just friends but the time developed that into a crush, a weird and crashed crush.

First during highschool in like 2015, she told me she like me and I liked her back, that didn't last because she started feeling lke she was a lesbian so we cut it out.

Like a year later, a friend of hers tried to get us back together since the friend leard that Steph still had feelings for me. This kind of worked since both of us were too incopetent in relationshipa to do anything but just talk and laugh. This lasted a few months and then she started feeling like she was definetly a lesbian and we cut it out.

Bit sad, started joking with my friends that for some reason I feel atracted to lesbians.

Still she and I always wanted to be friends, even after the failed relationships, we still liked to be around each other, so we talked and joked, and greeted each other when we passed each other.

Then life happend, I graduated first since i was 2 years older 
I also got into a broke up with my first girlfriend (long story) and then in 2019 we re met by chance on the line for a astronomy presentation in our city, 19M and 17F at the time.

We started talking again, and god damn it, I liked her again, at this point I was annoyed and scared, I didn't want to loose her as a friend again, I didn't want to be hurt again, but whatever, I told her I liked her anyway, and god damn it she felt the same.

Now this period of like 4 months was happy as shit, we coudn't see each other that often but being together was super fun, I really liked her, but with time she didn't felt the same, she told me she coudn't really develop feelings for me, that she thought that I was great, and still wanted to be friends

And we tried to stay friends, now we talk every few months, if she is doing something to her hair she tells me, or something is happening on her family, I respond to her stories and tell her about my problems.

But I never really could get over her, whenever we talk, the feeling of wanting to be with her for as long as possible and hugging her on sight was still there, and it fucking annoys me.
She is super cool, and I want her to be part of my close circle, invite her to stuff with me and my ftiends, but my brain always goes to the ""maybe this time it could be different"" and it annoys me.

Even now, we talked today, and my brain goes ""its been 
2 years maybe she'll like you again"", like no dude I just want this really dope friend.

I'm sure in the time between dates, I played it up in my head that she was perfect and that no one else would ever compete. I have aspergers and have been scared to start dating until recently, despite wanting to for most of my life.

I’ve made sure to take care of my psychical and mental health and in the past few weeks I’ve been feeling pretty great.

More info below….

I have a platonic girlfriend and through circumstance/promise of free food and drink we ended up going on a couple dates and spending really great time together. The way I’ve seen love since then is this really intimate connection. I’m not sure how to best go about finding and establishing that connection I just know I want it. 

I’m not made of money right now so I can’t afford to take half a dozen girls out and hope one of them is gonna be the one. 

I consider maybe exploring mutual friends but I’m a bit private and I’m insecure about how my friends would see any potential actual relationships. 

Also while I’m able to have someone over for the night, it’s usually during a night involving alcohol and other stuff (bar, party, club) so I’m not really being myself, just tipsy and spitting recycled game from the playbook.

98,rkg24r,1639979591,What are we?,"(F), who’s been seeing this guy for two months now. He makes an 1.5hr drive every weekend to visit local family then (spends those nights with me). We go on dates, he always pays and we spend a decent amount of time together. 
I’m still unsure of where we stand though. He bought me bday &amp; now xmas gift. It’s been 2mos now and I am unsure of relationship status here. Should there be a conversation, should I wait for him to bring it up? Here and there I call him babe or baby, he’s never said anything about it but also hasn’t reciprocated. How am I to know where we stand? 
Would a night of casual sex elsewhere be wrong? Would this be cheating? I don’t really know what i’m waiting on but also don’t want to feel committed if nothing becomes of this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkg24r/what_are_we/
99,rkgcso,1639980633,I genuinely believe I’m a lost cause,"I’m just straight up not hot. I’m not looking for pity I’m just saying I’m not attractive. It’s not body dysmorphia, I’m not talking down on myself I’m just not a handsome man. I know this and I can live with it. I don’t need to be lied to. But on top of that I’m short. Not dwarf height, I’m 5’6 but still there are more short men than women who like short men. On top of that I’m unable to gain muscle mass. I don’t know why but I’m just unable to. I’ve tried a lot of things but I just can’t build muscle. I can’t find anyone who likes me. I don’t have a way to meet people in real life. I have no friends. I don’t know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkgcso/i_genuinely_believe_im_a_lost_cause/
