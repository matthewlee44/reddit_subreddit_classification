I met her on tinder and we had talked about going out a couple months into talking and she was all about it. We even FaceTime once talking about what we were gonna do, but fast forward a month and she told me she wasn't interested anymore because she was busy transitioning to college and work.

 She didn't want me to un-friend her because she really enjoyed the conversations we had. I left her in my contacts, but I didn't talk to her for about 2 months until she eventually started texting me again and things just kinda went back to normal because I was bored and also deployed overseas.

The flirting found its way back into the way we talked to eachother and she just talked about how she really wanted to go out with me when I got back from deployment. 

I got back and we just went out yesterday and I had a much better time than I thought I would. We went to the dog park because my dog was with us and I had just planned on taking her back to her place after a couple hours, but she clearly didn't want to go home, so we drove around for 30 min talking until I saw the lake and so we sat by the lake. 
As we sat down she faced directly towards me and didn't say anything. I should have realized at the time she wanted me to kiss her because it was the perfect setting, but I decided I would wait till I dropped her off at her place (and I was kinda nervous because I've never kissed a girl.)
I wasnt biting so she just started showing me videos of her making out with people on a party bus and showing me fun things she does probably to drop the obvious hint.

So now I take her back to her building and I expect her to get out, but there was just awkward silence and she stared at me, so I kissed her and all of a sudden her tongue is in my mouth and she's nibbling at my lip. I pulled away for a bit to see if she was wanting more and sure enough she was stroking my hair, touching me, and said she wanted to kiss me more. We were in the parking lot for two hours before she finally left.

So thats how the date went just so you get a feel for her personality. I cant stop thinking about her now and she's very affectionate so would she appreciate me still texting her or do I limit how much I talk to her for now to not come off as needy? Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR -
I talked to a girl for 1.5 years online before meeting her in person and we had already built a connection and when I went out with her finally, she seemed to want to be more physical and affectionate (kissing and touching).

So I was dating a girl for about 2-3 weeks and I would see her 1-2X a week. Everything was going great right at the beginning or at the first date she told me that shed like to take things slowly and I agreed.

So we dated and I realized I was taking a little too fast by texting and calling frequently but she would also do the same things too. Everything was going great and she would sometimes text me at night and say things like ""I miss you"" but no body stopped her to come and see me so I once reacted to her text message saying that ""if you miss me maybe you should come see me then and nobody is stopping you"" So I stepped back and stopped doing what I was doing since she wanted to take things slow. (less text messages, longer period to reply back and so on). 

Couple days after we meet and I sense this weird vibe from her and immediately knew something was off. Later I drop her off go home and I get a text message saying shed like us to stop seeing each other since we're not at the same pace. Me being confused at what she's talking about I agreed but I did tell her what she was saying does not make sense. (dumped over text) by the way I'm 32 and she's 25.

So couple of days passes by and I get a text from her saying that I wanted to let you know that I've been thinking and I didn't let the conversation flow (I guess she meant that she didn't hear my side of the story since I just agreed to it but I was also confused since what she said didn't make sense) and it wasn't an easy topic and that she was overwhelmed. also she said that not all comments were true and quite irrational (whatever that means), wanna meet and talk?

So me being me I have no idea where she's going with this I asked where she's going with this or asking me here? and she said it wasn't right to do this over text and we should have talked. So I responded by saying so now you'd like to tell me in my face that it wouldn't work out? anyways I agreed to meet her in person.

This goes on for about a week, and she says she isn‚Äôt feeling it, she said I was too into her and it was putting her off. I‚Äôm grateful that she actually gave me a legitimate reason so I just said thanks for being honest and moved on.

But this paradox men have to face when texting girls they‚Äôre genuinely into is bizarre. If you show some effort you come across as too needy, but at the same time you like them so you want to show some effort.

Anyway, it‚Äôs been a learning experience for me. I understand why you need to text less, it‚Äôs because if you text more you remove the mystery or you come across as liking her too much which both kill attraction for girls.

I(24m) m a so called womanizer by my friend group(23-30M&amp;F) because I have every month another date. I hate it so much, I just want to settle down with a girl I love and not be their ""boyfriend for a month"".

So I want to establish myself first:

I m a 24 year old male who looks average and is 6`11. I like Basketball, skiing, Tennis, Baseball, Football and walking. I also like city visits and talking with friends. I have a good job which covers more than just my bills. And I love going on partys.

Now I want to talk more in depth on my problem. First of all, somehow I only get woman who want to try a relationship but they are bored after a few dates and a bit of sex and maybe a short relationship and move on. The longest relationship I had was 4 months (I was 21 at the time). I really hate myself for not getting it to work for much longer. My standards are very low. As long as the person is interresting and fun to talk to and we have an attraction with eachother I try to get on a date with them with the goal to maybe reach a relationship and hopefully much more (Most of the time it doesnt work out but we keep in touch anyways, I got some nice Friends out of these situations). I use tinder and parties as my dating platform. Maybe I m just not fun or boring after a few dates/relationship. Just to make it clear, I only broke up with two girls after I found out they cheated but everytime Else they broke up with me. Can anyone give me tips how to keep a relationship together?

I (24M) have recently gotten into a friendly little debate with some buddies of mine about dating, and wanted to turn it to the internet! **TLDR at the bottom.**

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I was telling them when I meet a girl I'm interested in, after about two weeks of talking and going on dates I let them know my intentions. Nothing too serious I just say something along the lines of ""Hey I really like you and enjoy spending time with you, just so you know, I'm looking for something serious and hope you feel the same way!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now my friends were saying this is a terrible dating strategy, they said it comes off as desperate and *waaayyy* to forward. They are really into the ""gamifying dating"" thing where if a girl likes you, you pretend you're not interested, or wait ""x"" amount of hours before replying back and all that stuff. Also, they said that its impossible to truly get to know someone after only two weeks of talking, and that process actually takes months and maybe even years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as far as the gamifying thing goes, I *reeeeaallyyy* don't like this mindset. The thing is, I'm not in high-school anymore, if I like someone and want to date them, I'm going to tell them.  I think I'm an honest person when it comes to dating and I'd like whoever I'm with to be the same way. As for the second point about taking time to know someone, I concede that is absolutely true, but here's the thing. If there's one thing I've learned in my 24 years of being on this Earth is that *intentions matter*. Not everyone approaches dating with the same intentions (ESP ON OLD). You can meet an AMAZING person who is an absolute joy to talk to and hang out with, but they could only be looking for something casual, or just not interested in dating at the moment, or they just want to focus on their career, or they could be religious and only want to marry someone of the same faith, etc etc.... So the reason I do the ""two weeks"" thing is I want to make sure the other person is on the same page as me intentions-wise from early. That way no one ends up wasting time.

Let me know what you guys think of my ""two weeks"" strategy, I know this is only my perspective and I didn't really convey the other side as much, so let me know if I am actually an idiot and need to slow down when looking for a partner

Thanks for reading!

I recently met a guy on a dating app. He 24 and I am 21. We went on our first date recently. I have some concerns that I don't know if I should be worried about. From the beginning of communication between us he was very straightforward. He told me what he wanted: he wanted a long-term girlfriend, for us to understand each other, call each other every night or at least communicate everyday, and see each other at least once a week. None of this is bad in my opinion. 

However, he keeps over explaining himself on every topic and repeating what he expects from the relationship. He also seems to have a schedule for how things should be going. He keeps saying we need to understand each other and keeps wanting us to just ask each other questions all the time. I'm not sure this is how you get to know someone, maybe it is. He is also super affectionate. Mind you, he did tell me he was before meeting. But he wants hugs all the time, cuddles, and tried picking me up on our first date. I think this is too much so soon and kind of scares me. He also keeps saying how much he likes me, thinks I am cute, and thinks I am a good person. Thing is, we haven't talked for long (like a week). Just agreed on a lot of topics about what we wanted in a relationship. He also brings up our races a lot. I am black and he is Indian. Yeah it is a rare mix, but I feel like he shows off when we're out in public. Especially when other Indians are around. 

I'm not sure if a language barrier is going on or if a cultural one is happening. But I am surely not used to this. I could also be paranoid because I dated a narcissist before and am constantly checking for warning signs in the early stages of a relationship.

okay now that you have all of that - here we go.
in 2018 i was with a different boyfriend (23M). i was having super weird problems going on (heart palpitations, shortness of breath, etc) despite being pretty physically healthy (i was only 19 at the time). i went to the ER 6 times for these problems, and was always told it was anxiety. one day, on our way back home from a trip, it felt like my heart exploded inside my chest. i immediately told my boyfriend to go to the nearest hospital. there, i asked them to check my thyroid as i had been googling things that could cause heart problems &amp; also knew my mom has thyroid disease &amp; it‚Äôs genetic. an hour later i was diagnosed with hashimotos disease (a chronic, life long disease) &amp; was also made aware that my cholesterol was at 480 because of it! not super exciting to hear at 19 years old. my mom and boyfriend (at that time) labeled me a hypochondriac before the diagnosis because i was constantly googling things that could cause heart problems. but it turns out, i was right. i started taking thyroid meds &amp; was feeling like 85-90% back to normal. was able to go on a trip to vegas &amp; enjoy it with no heart troubles. then, that boyfriend left me. which was fine, he was an alcoholic and just not my vibe really. we had dated for 3 years at that point tho so it was a bit sad, but for the best. a week or 2 after the breakup, i met up with my current boyfriend. we had known eachother since we were 10 thru facebook (he went to school with my best friend/cousin). we had never met until that point after the breakup, were always just online friends but were always deeply in love with eachother. so i met him finally. &amp; we clicked instantly, as we both knew we would. we became inseparable, we were so in love. he made me feel safe, happy, and beautiful and i hopefully made him feel the same way. this is around august 2019 btw. so, as we all know, COVID news starts going around by December19/January20. we ignore it at first, but then it starts to ramp up. we quarantined ourselves around March. I believe that we did get COVID however, around April/May20 because i got extremely sick (dizzy, heart palpitations, exhaustion, couldn‚Äôt eat, almost fainting when standing or sitting could only lay in bed) for a few weeks. he was also sick but not as bad or as long. we got over that and moved on (though to this day i deal with daily dizziness) then, we got our own apartment (my first apartment!) together in august20. we had so much fun, had friends over (safely), had movie nights, game nights it was the best time ever. we were so happy and in love. then, 2021 hit. 
in february i found out he cheated on me, his reasoning being that i didn‚Äôt have a job and it stressed him out (i‚Äôm unemployed but only due to my illnesses - i‚Äôm an artist trying to sell my pieces but we all know how hard that is. i also constantly apply for at home jobs but those are so hard to get, especially now with them being so sought after.)
in april, my life long best friend said i was horrible and a shitty person (i will defend myself to this day - she has a severe victim complex and was completely in the wrong but that‚Äôs a story for another day). 2 days after that, my absolute best friend in the whole world says basically the same thing, that i‚Äôm selfish and ‚Äúboring‚Äù (can‚Äôt do a lot due to my illnesses lol). those losses devastate me. i end up in the ER a few days later with a racing pulse that won‚Äôt slow. i stayed there all night &amp; it still didn‚Äôt slow, but they couldn‚Äôt help &amp; sent me home. that made me spiral, &amp; i became bedridden. this lasted 2 months. i went to a cardiologist, got my heart checked &amp; it was perfectly fine just fast for no reason at times. so, i had the motivation to pick myself up and better myself. i started doing a bit more, &amp; one day i woke up &amp; decided to clean my living room for the first time in a long time. i did it, sat down on the couch, and got hit with the most intense bout of vertigo i‚Äôve ever felt in my life. like, thought i was ascending to heaven type vertigo. i quickly ran to the bedroom crying &amp; scared. my boyfriend was nice &amp; told me to just lay down. the vertigo didn‚Äôt go away for 2 weeks. i was bedridden again. it also caused me to go into a SEVERE depression. i was finally starting to feel okay again &amp; got pushed right back down. it hurt me really really bad mentally, as it took a lot out of me to get out of bed the first time. now, i‚Äôm still here, bed ridden and stuck. 
the issue is that my boyfriend and mom believe that prozac would help me because they believe a lot of my issues are anxiety driven. i too think prozac would help me, but here‚Äôs the story with that. 
when i was 12-14 i took prozac, it helped me a lot! my parents were divorced, so i would be dropped off with my dad every other weekend. he is a very big ‚Äúholistic‚Äù person. no medicine basically. he didn‚Äôt even let me take advil when i had a headache. so, he learned i was taking prozac &amp; didn‚Äôt like it. he constantly told me it was poison, i was going to d*e, etc. he would text me when i wasn‚Äôt with him ‚Äúyou still taking those meds? wish you wouldn‚Äôt‚Äù. even went as far as to buy me books for my birthday about how prozac is poison. so, that traumatized the fuck out of me. i stopped taking the pill shortly after. i also can‚Äôt take advil or any pain meds due to him (so my migraines are super fun to deal with lol). 
i currently take levothyroxine, propranolol and xanax as needed. it took A LONG TIME for me to take the propranolol, but i took it because my heart really was just too fucking fast. 
because everyone wanted me to start taking the prozac, i looked into it to see if anything bad could happen with the medicines i‚Äôm on (that‚Äôs reasonable, right?). i see that prozac and propranolol could potentionally cause some pretty severe issues, which scared me. so having that fear mixed with the dad trauma, it‚Äôs pretty fucking hard for me to take the prozac. my depression has turned into the very bad thoughts, you know the ones. i expressed that to my boyfriend, who told me that he no longer feels any feelings towards me, he barely loves me, &amp; is forcing himself to stay with me daily. i admit, i understand how it can suck to be dating someone who is bed ridden + dealing with their depression &amp; panic attacks. but i DO NOT ask for him to do everything for me. i ask him to refill my water bottle (it‚Äôs a gallon so he only has to do it once a day) &amp; then if he could grab me a snack when i‚Äôm feeling dizzy (maybe once a day 3 times a week.) other than that i‚Äôm fine, i go to the bathroom on my own &amp; whatever. the last few weeks he just hates me. honestly, can‚Äôt stand me. and i understand, but all he says is ‚Äútake the pill and i‚Äôll stay‚Äù (prozac), but doesn‚Äôt understand my intense fear surrounding it. 
today we had a big argument, &amp; i took the prozac for him. i‚Äôm still shaking thinking about it, it‚Äôs fucking terrifying for me. he said ‚Äúi‚Äôm not going to be proud of you for taking it 1 day. talk to me in a week‚Äù, this is after i told him about my very bad thoughts which he didn‚Äôt give a shit about because i don‚Äôt deserve to have those thoughts if i won‚Äôt take the prozac. 
he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs in the wrong, at all. doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúmy issue‚Äù, thinks i should just take the pill and move on. so i did it, and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs not enough. 
i just don‚Äôt know what to do. am i in the wrong? should i just shut the fuck up and take the pill? idk.

I promised myself I would never again be with someone who made me feel bad for desiring her.

Once I was 100% divorced and therapist-approved to date again, I found that many of the women I dated had a similar attitude to sex as my ex wife. It seemed that, for many women, sex is a dirty thing that must never be discussed openly, not until the nth date, not until ""commitment""--and it must never be given out to a man who didn't ""earn"" it in some way.

Many of these experiences seemed excruciating for both of us. One time a first date caught me staring at her lips while she was talking. She asked what I was thinking and I said I was imagining what it would be like to kiss her. She immediately called a Lyft, went outside to wait for it, and told me not to ""follow her outside and bother her"" (as if I would). Another woman asked for a bunch of private information so she could run a background check on me before she would agree to a date. Another came back to my apartment and then reacted with appalled horror when I moved in to kiss her. 

Every time something like this happened, I would feel something similar to what I felt when my ex-wife turned me down--crushed, hurt, deflated, defeated, humiliated. This is a difficult way to feel when we are hoping to feel affection and desire! Every time I felt that feeling, I moved on, even if the woman who made me feel that way offered to ""give me another chance if we take things slower."" It got very discouraging and I became more and more reluctant to bother with swiping or dating or being outgoing at all.

And then I met my favorite person!

Here's how things progressed when I found her:

On the day we matched, we exchanged numbers and started texting. I asked her for a picture and she sent a cute mirror selfie. I sent back a similar photo, complimented her top and asked what she was wearing underneath it. After an agonizing 20 minute wait, I got to see her beautiful breasts for the first time.

Day two, we talked on the phone. Our conversation ran for over two hours, including a little bit of everything but ending up on sex. I asked her if we could FaceTime and masturbate together before hanging up the phone and she said yes. It was amazing!

Day three, she came to my house and we were naked in bed within 20 minutes. Best first date ever, and the first of many to follow. I think for the first few months all of our ""dates"" were at home. We would cook meals together, watch tv, and of course, have tons and tons of fun truly ""getting to know each other.""

It's been about two years now and we are still together. We have built a beautiful partnership on a solid foundation of excellent sex. I feel closer to her than I've ever felt to anyone. I am glad I waited for her instead of trying to stick it out with women who weren't a match for me.

We talked for 4 months and went on a few dates. Haven't talked to her in a week. Looking back, I feel guilty. I also feel like I failed in some ways. Half of me wants to blame myself, and another half of me is looking back and realizing potential red flags I may have missed. 

We had been talking for a while, and she was giving me a lot of attention despite telling me she wasn't wanting anything serious. She was FaceTiming me, texting me a lot, commenting heart faces on my Instagram pictures and would text me in the morning wishing me a good day at times. 

I got accustomed to her presence and attention, reciprocated it, and definitely liked it. She is 20 and I am 23, but she was pretty dope. She is younger/can't even go to bars legally Yet so I'm not that surprised it didn't work out. 

We didn't talk about where we were at until maybe a month and a half ago. That's when she finally told me she wasn't looking for anything serious. I'm not either necessarily, but I wish I would've voiced this right from the beginning. After a few dates and over 2 months of talking/dating, nothing was mentioned about intentions. Next thing you know, I'm sitting just short of the 3 month mark and confused about everything. 

She was giving me A LOT of attention like I said earlier. It was slightly off but I got used to it and enjoyed her consistent communication. After I voiced my thoughts on where we were at is when she started backing away, despite us agreeing we weren't looking for anything serious at the time. 

Last time we hung out she asked me about my band I play in. She said ""I bet you get a lot of girls"" and all this. I didn't know how to respond and thought it was weird. She's younger so she hangs around younger people. She was complaining about her friends to me and telling me all this drama I did not care about at all, I zoned out eventually. 

Last week after almost a month of the changed communication patterns I was casually direct with her. Communication had become 1 sided and I flat out asked her where her head was at before I initiated anything else. 

She mentioned how it was hard to see me when I live an hour away and that she's content with friends in her life right now and doesn't wanna add anyone else to it which I understand. She's still in college so I really can't be upset about that. When I was 20 I felt the same way. 

She told me she needed some ""space from this relationship for a little"" and it confused me when she said relationship. I said ""thank you for letting me know what you need. If you need space I'll leave you alone &amp;amp; if you'd rather cut ties it's all good , I just don't want energy wasted on either end""

She got pissed. She was like ""I've said it so many times now. I just need space rn. Thank you."" She removed me from her private snap story, but not her normal one. I'm not gonna reach out for it's likely done. I wish she hadn't gotten so mad at me. I didn't respond. 

The fact that she was all over me, asked me about other girls and all this other stuff makes me wonder if I dodged a bullet or not. She was cool and maybe I got infatuated, did I miss any red flags here? Or does she sound like a typical young college girl?

I been texting with this military officer who is stationed about an hour away from where I live. We been texting for almost a month but he is currently in  visiting his relatives.

Moments before that we were texting while he was at a baseball game he thought  I was there but told him I was not.  Just recently we have added each other on Facebook and instagram(m, it was his request, is when I found out he was in the military working as part of the recruiting brigade. I have tried to give him space while he is in vacation and not to text him besides the usual text ( have fun, enjoy the beach, etc).  I am aware dating a military man or woman can be intense or rough when deployed or in training. During the time we been talking he has been attending training and local events which I have  confirmed on his Facebook when his peers tag him on those events. Is not like he has not been busy while we been texting.  Do you think I should give him more time until he asks to meet? The other option is to attend a baseball game from his favorite team which happens to be my favorite one and arrange what we call an initial meeting between the innings?  This could be the equivalent of what I have done with zero dates in the form if coffee dates with other guys I have met.  I seriously will like to get to know him and give him the benefit of the doubt while he opens up but the fact that when I propose a video chat after he said when would that be when I started to trade him in meeting, he did not respond to that.  I have checked to see if he is a scammer but he is not a scammer, neither he is married per his social profile which has everyone of his family, friends and co-workers.

I (M22) seem to have some sort of mental barrier that's preventing me from meeting and/or making moves on girls that I like.

So, I moved to this new place in like April and since the Covid restrictions have been lifted, I was able to go out a lot with new friends that I have made very quickly over there. And that's the thing: I am a very sociable guy. It only took me a few weeks to get to know actually quite many people and there are even a few opportunities to go and ask a girl out. The prepositions are perfect! I have got phone numbers of several girls, I could message or ring them and ask. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even my social situation is more than I could hope for after moving to a new place.

I simply can't go on a date. Whenever even the possibility comes up in my head that me and her could be thing, my mind just goes crazy. I'm starting to overthink flipping everything. Reading signs from her that probably aren't there. I'm also getting really really nervous around potential dates which prevents me from having a normal conversation I just black out and say stupid stuff or just nothing. Which is so weird because I definitely am able to make interesting conversation with my friends.

Also a thing I became really good at is finding excuses for not asking someone out. This kind of goes hand in hand with reading her ""signs"". It's like: ""Umm... I'm going to be rejected anyway"" but also like ""I'm going to be away for a weeks next month so going on a date before it wouldn't be good because we wouldn't see eachother after it for a while"". I just keep pushing it away from me and eventually nothing happens. 


But I think that is only secondary. I feel like on the basis of this lays a deep shame or/and embarrassment of these kind of topics. I remember my father ALWAYS making fun me having a thing with girls. Even though there weren't anything. I always tried to hide my acquaintances as well as my feelings so I became really shy about it and also really receptive for and anxious about stupid comments (I do these as well, It's normal, but maybe not in the way my dad did it). 

Does it make any sense to you? Idk maybe it does, also idk if this counts as rant or question or whatever. But I figured I could do with some advice!

Whenever I start to talk to a girl I always get very nervous and try to be overly polite (as one of my sister's put it). Whenever I or a girl start a conversation, I always like to start off with a simple ""hello there"" typically with the Obi-Wan Kenobi meme. After this has happened, and we list of the few things that we have a common interested in the conversations spirals down into short little comments such as: ""ok"", ""fair enough"" or ghosting.

We get back to the hotel room, we‚Äôre both super drunk, somehow my brother in law basically dares her to suck my dick, she does it, but stops midway through bc she was crying a little bc she was cheating. I of course stopped and felt extremely bad and my brother in law later said that he took full responsibility for sort of taking advantage of the both of us, he said he was just trying to get me laid, but he he like basically convinced her to suck my dick.

Well I was feeling horrible, but she sort of got over it somehow in like 10 min and while everybody was sleeping she came over to my bed, we fooled around for like 2 hours, getting each other off, she sucked my dick again, and she wanted me to cum on her which I did.

I was just so drunk and at one point I remember just almost falling asleep while I was getting a handjob, and I took a long time to cum bc I was drunk and high. She kept asking me if this was cheating and I would say it‚Äôs whatever you want it to be, and  I asked her a couple times if she wanted to stop, but she always said no bc she was horny. 

I sort of remember just closing my eyes and acting like I was asleep but she was still humping my leg and licking me, even though I was basically not moving.  And she wanted me to add her on social media while we were sort of messing around, so I saw her post a story of her bf and god I just feel terrible for the guy.

‚ùóHave you ever wondered, why you are not getting on second/ third dates with a woman you really like?
‚ùóOr getting ghosted after 1 month of having a ""great experience"" with an attractive woman?

üëâ Let me get this clear:

‚ùåYou are the NICE GUY

How do I know?

Well, I've been the nice guy for years and that led me nowhere. In fact, being the nice guy led me to loneliness, depression and low self-esteem.

But, what the so called ""nice guys"" are? 

I will name a few behaviours which lead into being one:

‚ùåYou are afraid of expressing your true self.

‚ùå You are afraid of expressing your sexuality! (You don't even talk when it comes to sex in front of women)

‚ùå You are afraid of conflict.

 You don't want to upset her by any chance, so you stop communicating your beliefs or expressing a different opinion.

‚ùåYour level of agreeableness is 100%! 
You agree with everything she says, proposes or even when judging other people! 

Do you have to be a brutal-6 pack looking- alpha male, who's disrespectful to women? Of course NOT! 

But you have to implement new strategies and start changing yourself!

‚úÖ Start expressing your true self and be A LEADER in every conversation or situation you are in. Women love to ""follow"".

‚úÖ Everyone loves sex, so do women. Start talking about sex with women. Talk about your experiences or your fantasies! (Please don't be a dick, always respect women)

 Showing that you are cool about sex, and that sex is something normal to talk about, is the most important step in dating.

‚úÖ Embrace healthy conflict, and challenge her. 

Women love to be challenged and to confront different opinions. 

‚úÖ Stop agreeing in everything she says or wants. 

Again, be a leader and disagree if you feel you have to!

While its still equally important to take action and insert yourself into situations where you can interact with new people, **the greatest factor which determines on average the caliber of people that surround you is YOU**.

Who would you be more attracted to?

A positive person who is striving to better their life and does not become jealous of other's successes or.. a person who is resigned to their current status and just mopes and complains about everything.

The daily choices that you make on a how you **choose to approach life** are what will in the end determine your results.
