1,ml2b9c,1617679207,Do you treat dates you meet in IRL differently that OLD,"I definitely do. When there‚Äôs that rapport, I‚Äôm just into them more. With OLD, it‚Äôs almost formulaic. Go out, have some drinks, make out, come to my place and have some more drinks and either it escalates or we call it a night. After a few weeks or months we move on. 

With meeting in real life and knowing someone for a year and going on a few dates and it ends it feels like you lost a friend and definitely hurts more.

4,ml2nxx,1617680400,How would you interpret someone you‚Äôre dating making it clear they‚Äôre only into you for your personality?,"So this is in the very early stages. And I guess context is everything, I know almost for a fact this person is interested in me romantically - and they don‚Äôt come out and say anything particularly hurtful, but more just implying in a playful way that I‚Äôm not handsome or good looking etc.. but it‚Äôs hard to tell if they‚Äôre just trying to be funny or are actually serious.

They‚Äôll say things like, ‚Äúgirls chase you for your looks, I‚Äôm just not one of them‚Äù, and making a point to let me know that they like me solely because of my personality. Like they‚Äôre almost adamant to make sure I know that it‚Äôs not a physical attraction thing. I knew this person before we started dating, and I had a bit of a rep as a ladies man/player I guess according to her, so maybe it‚Äôs like a defence mechanism of sorts, who knows.

I‚Äôm not overly sensitive, but still - in a potential partner it would be awkward for me to think that they don‚Äôt find me physically attractive, and vice versa. It‚Äôs not the be all end all but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt important.

She was smiling and maybe she was just friendly. She was real cute. Were both in the military stationed in a town where let's say dating really isn't that great and crime is a little high.

7,ml2w73,1617681192,Do I shoot my shot at the guy I accidentally got arrested in hs??,"I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. Here‚Äôs the backstory: we met in high school and had classes together and became friends. I ended up getting a huge crush on him, got drunk senior year and confessed my love.... he did NOT feel the same way, he was crushing hard on a girl he knew but she had a boyfriend. We decided to go to the local park one night and smoke some weed when a police office found us. He ended up taking all the blame, and said I wasn‚Äôt involved at all and that it was his drugs and that he invited me there. And Really, I asked him to hangout and said we should go to the park, bc that‚Äôs where everyone goes to smoke. 

Well since we were underage, the police let me go and he ended up arrested and had to do community service. The next day in school he said it would probably be best that we weren‚Äôt friends anymore. I low key was heartbroken but understood, plus I was going away to college in a few months anyways. 

Well, I ended up transferring home to a local school were he goes 2 years later (it‚Äôs a huge state school, everyone from high school goes there). I was posting on my story one day that I got lost and he texted me directions and offered to show me around campus one day as we were in similar majors. We grabbed lunch a few times but our heavy course loads, work, etc and opposite class schedules never really gave us the chance to keep it going.

It‚Äôs been 2 years since then, (I think) we both are still single and will sometimes randomly message each other on snap and will chat for a bit. I think he‚Äôs a really great guy, we are interested in a lot of the same things, and we have some mutual friends. He recently moved to my area of town, too. Should I just shoot my shot and randomly text him asking if he would wanna go out sometime? Or has the ship sailed since the ‚Äúincident?‚Äù

**He met her 3 years ago. They were friends for a year.** **He used to have a crush on her (which he denied until tonight).** **Then she started dating a guy for 2 years and they barely talked** unless it was every few months over text or a snap of her face saying ‚Äústreaks!‚Äù 

**Fast forward, she started calling him whenever she had boyfriend trouble and wanted to break up with her bf.** His friends told him he needed to tell me that they were talking on the phone. She invited him out of town (to another city for a volunteer trip which they had gone on a trip like that before when they were both single) without considering me (he asked me, but she did not). They would‚Äôve been staying in a hotel room together with maybe one other guy. I told him this made me uncomfortable and she seemed to be going after him. She never asked me to go out (or even asked to meet me), but always invited him to go out one-on-one. **I asked him to stop talking to her. He defended her and kept saying they had been great friends for years and he wasn‚Äôt going to stop talking to her.**

**A few weeks later he tried to break up with me because ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt understanding his POV that they were just friends.‚Äù He told me he‚Äôs not going to stop talking to her, but he was tired of arguing about that situation with her so he was going to break up with me.**

I felt like he was choosing her over me.

I eventually caved and agreed to try talking to her.  We realized we both have a lot of similarities and now she‚Äôs started asking if I want to hang out with her and my bf more. I think my bf might have part to do with that, but idk. I let it go for a while.

You are *not* going to stand out in her DMs. I promise you, you get buried under the dozens of other dudes hitting her up that day. 

They don't have to do anything to *earn* men's attentions and affections other than exist and look hot. This is awful for all men in the dating field. 

If you don't follow them and like every photo they post, that brings them back down to a reasonable level where you have a shot with them. 

High value men never give away their attention for nothing. 

Plus let's be honest seeing those super hot girls on tinder that are 400 miles away, have nothing in their bio but their IG handle and have 300000 Instagram photos linked is annoying. Like they just *expect* tinder guys to be desperate enough go follow them. 

DO. NOT. DO. IT.

34,ml55j8,1617689833,How do I handle a workplace crush?,"So, I would like to date this girl from my work. However, we will be working on an ongoing project together.

I met her last week during a meeting, where I got soaked in the rain and my shirt was see through. I saw her staring at my chest hair and laughing at everything I was saying.

There's another girl from my workplace who made it obvious that she was going to hook up with me. We talk about stocks and she said ""If you end up buying the fancy apartment, I'll leave my bf and move in with you"". I lost respect in this chick after she said that, but she recently said she wanted to come hiking with me, as I go often and am a photographer. So I thought, maybe I could use this opportunity to ask the other girl (my crush) to join us hiking.

All this is even more difficult to manage with my social anxiety. I'm telling my mind to not dwell on it, but it's difficult. I don't really know her that well, so it's just infatuation at this point.

40,ml5jao,1617691423,I feel like I always care way more in the relationship.,"So I‚Äôve been seeing this girl for like 2-3 months now and we see each other for like a whole day, and we haven‚Äôt had the exclusivity talk but I consider us a couple. I‚Äôve met her friends, been to her work, she said her mom knows about me (they live in a different city so I haven‚Äôt met them), she talked about meeting her parents, and we‚Äôve been on like 8 plus dates so far. 

Yesterday was sort of a weird day and we couldn‚Äôt decide what to do, and for some reason we were indecisive the whole day and drove around a lot. It was still fun but it was sort of exhausting and I guess it was both of our faults but it was Easter so there was just no parking anywhere and every restaurant was packed.

Anyways, I gave her her birthday present that I had bought for her and even though I didn‚Äôt spend her birthday with her I thought I‚Äôd buy her something small. I bought her some slippers (bc her dog chewed them up) and a plushie bc she has a lot of them. Well she forgot them in my car, she also forgot her hydro flask as well, and she was wearing my jacket and she forgot to give that back too.

It sort of hurt me that she didn‚Äôt remember to grab the presents and she was appreciative when I gave it to her, but like I would never forgot something like that. If I overthink the situation in my head I feel like this is sort of a bad sign, bc I went into the effort of buying the things for her, deciding what to buy, and she just forgot them in my car. It‚Äôs an inside joke that she‚Äôs forgetful and stuff, but that kind of hurt me.

I actually texted her that it made me feel sort of bad, but that since she since she left her hydro flask too that it lessened it a little bit. She said she was sorry and that we could meet up today, but I had work and was busy so I said that another day would be better. She thanked me again for the presents and then we stopped messaging. I know it‚Äôs probably not a big deal but I can‚Äôt help to feel how I feel.

I mean I even noticed that she didn‚Äôt have the things in her hand but I didn‚Äôt want to say anything bc I would‚Äôve probably gotten really sad in the moment. We still watched a movie after and kissed and cuddled, I stayed until she basically was like ‚Äúhey I have to go to sleep for work,‚Äù which I understand but I‚Äôm trying to think to myself like I can‚Äôt expect other people to behave like me or put in the same amount of effort.

And she‚Äôs said she was surprised why I touch her so much (I‚Äôm a touchy guy) and I can‚Äôt help but to play with her hands, her face, her fingers, just kiss her when we‚Äôre cuddling, and she‚Äôll reciprocate but sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm doing too much.

We have memories in daily life. That makes me hard to perform daily tasks. We have been in relationship for 3 years. From the start we committed to take this relationship to marriage. We had difference in our culture and language. I can speak her language but she can't. From start I told her that you have to learn my language to adjust in my family. She agreed but never learned or took efforts in those 3 years. I am kind of the person who look for reasons/pros-cons and she just does whatever comes to her mind without thinking much. Due to her nature everyone took her for granted. Nobody had respect for her and taken advantage of her. I didn't like the way people treated her so everytime she was going the wrong way I tried to protect her. In that, sometimes I would have to scold her, sometimes she will cry. I thought it is okay for me to sometimes become villain to save her. I didn't think even ones selfishly in our relationship and tried always to look after her. Due to COVID she has to move to her hometown as her parents was forcing her and in a way she wanted too. But after going there her behavior was way too selfish. She now only thinks that what is making her happy and told me she was missing something in our relationship. She doesn't want to leave her parents and go according to their wishes for marriage. Now she left me. I am going through a lot of difficult situations due to passing of family member, losing a job and now this.

We talked for a couple days via text and phone calls, she said she didn't want to meet for coffee when I asked I understood why you don't run off to meet someone from the internet rite away. She said a few things that seemed weird to me at the time but I was so tired I didn't dig into it. But yesterday what she said hit like a ton of bricks and everything made sense! She says, ""what if I told you we have talked before""
Now for the back story. For the past few years I have had a Facebook friend. I think one of the random people I added when I moved to a new area, I digress. We would talk pretty regularly and it was more then apparent she was interested in me when I made very clear I was not interested in her. Me, ""I enjoy talking to you, but I don't want to date you"" it got to a point where she started saying some very negative shit and I noticed a pattern developing that was definitely a character defect in my mind. So I stopped talking to her. She would still send odd messages that I didn't even open and some time passed with nothing. Then recently I received a message and replied, it started off nice but quickly I remembered oh yeah don't talk to her...
So this girl I match with turned out to be the Facebook friend with a fake name. She led me on for days under false pretense and now can't understand why I called her actions dishonest. I haven't responded yet to ""thanks for making me feel like shit"" well you feel that way because you did a shifty thing. 
Of course after this goes down the girl in the real world that I really like steps back in the picture. I was missing her in the first place e that's where the lonely stems from.

So I told him I really dont like texting except here and there at night when I am winding down. He acknowledged me saying it but has not at all changed the way he has texted. He will just send multiple texts throughout the day and I dont respond cuz I dont like to text during the day but he will continue to ask questions/ suggest future plans one after the other.

68,mla1jn,1617710588,confused please help me,"Hello.

So a few months back I sent a friend request to a girl on facebook that was really beautiful and we had same interests.

A week ago I decided to give it a try and text her and see how it goes.

Suprisingly, everything went so smooth, we talked for about 2 hours and It was really nice, she was asking questions, making an effort to keep the conversation going.

2-3 days later I texted her again, and we talked for about 1 hour. She really seemed interested in me and I was feeling very happy inside.

Then 1 day later I messaged her again, and I noticed we had built a good connection, she really seemed to like me, sending a lot of emoticons. being very sweet

Now, I kinda like her, and the next time we gonna talk I will ask her for a date.

The thing is that everytime we talked I was the one to text her first.

And now Im overthinking the fact that I have to wait for her to text me this time, to see if she is really interested of me. I dont want to come out as desperate or something, neither I know If she really wants to text so often. Its been 2 days since we last talk. I know its a very short time to making conclusions, but Im overthinking it and time feels so slow. So Im kinda confused cause I feel like I like her so much and I dont wanna fuck up. Im pretty sure she is interested in me, but Im confused at the same time. I've never met her So I kinda dont know her at all.

Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mla1jn/confused_please_help_me/

I have been going to nightclubs consistently for the last four weeks in hopes of finding friends and maybe even a hookup for the night. None of which came true. I usually returned with no friends and no girl to spend the night with. One night on the dance floor I was particularly wasted when someone approached me. She said ""Hi"" and introduced herself. I'm not going to reveal her name but since this is fitting I am going to call her Piggy. Piggy was trying to make some small talk. I wasn't receptive to her attempts at trying to woo me. I wasn't having a good night because women who were meant to be at my calibre were not approaching me. I told her to go away and told her that I do not have sex with fat girls. The reason I said because it is a well accepted fact that fact women really have nothing special to offer for a man who is in his prime. A couple of minutes later, her friends a mix between obese and a little too flabby for me were angry that I had told Piggy that I wasn't interested in her. I told them all that I wasn't interested in having sex with a fat girl and that was that. I left the bar angry and crying because no thin woman approach me and I ended up getting yelled at by a group of killer whales getting in my face and acting entitled. I told my co-worker about it and she was I kid you not, ""disgusted"" with my behavior all because I stood for myself and didn't let no killer whale crush my pelvis in bed.

Since then, I have been out many times and have encountered and observed THOUSANDS of couples. I have witnessed no more than about 10 couples in which the woman is taller than the man. In the other thousands of relationships, the man is taller than the woman( often much taller). Yet, I am told it is all in my head. Some have said I need professional help. So, am I imagining what I am seeing? I think not. I am disappointed that I have been lied and continue to be lied to time and time again.

I have been seeing someone since the start of the year who hasn't been a great texter. I initiate most texts and we exchange a couple of texts almost every day. However, she tends to take hours to reply and conversations typically short with little to no affection. Good dates in real life, though.

I've always been a texter myself with most people I've dated and conversations can last through the day. Granted, people get busy. But it'll be nice to be pre-empted ahead of a busy week or receive a good morning/good night text to know that they are thinking of you.  


It does bother me a little bit and I can't figure out if I'm just not used to it, or the lack of communication/affirmation is at play.

Two years ago I would have been ashamed to even think so but honestly, who cares? I definitely don't and seeing a lot of posts on this sub have helped me realise that there is no timeframe. 

Don't get me wrong, I am incredibly frustrated. I can't count the amount of times I've been ghosted, but that's just part of the dating game now. 

The idea of a hookup has never appealed to me, I've always wanted a proper connection with a woman. As a man though you can probably imagine what a lot of my friends think of the fact I don't want a hookup. 

The pandemic caused a whole shutdown here in the UK so dating has been completely out of the question. It's been a blessing if I'm honest. 

Yes, I still use dating apps but don't expect anything. I just want to have a nice conversation with someone and maybe get to know them, it's the smaller things that mean a lot to me. 

Since last March I graduated with my bachelor's, started my master's, worked on projects and started working at home since gyms closed. I've never felt better. 

I always get told I'm good looking but I think using dating apps can be a disadvantage as I'm 5ft7. Let's be real, dating apps are entirely judging a book by its cover but it is what it is. 

Despite my frustrations, I know there is someone out there for me and there is someone out there for you too. We really do have to work on ourselves and strive to become better people.

I recently started hanging out with a new guy I met over ig.  2 year age gap he‚Äôs 28 and I‚Äôm 30. Things were going great until they weren‚Äôt.  I rushed things and asked him to come to my Easter dinner (my grandma was pushing for this).  I did give him multiple outs and said hey if you want to think about it... but nope he agreed.

It‚Äôs been about a month and a half of us seeing each other. he‚Äôs deleted all dating apps and we‚Äôve had multiple discussions where he says he would want me to be his gf but has a firm rule of really getting to know someone first.

91,mlcf3c,1617717918,"I‚Äôm in a weird situation, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve been ghosted or not.","
So, to give some context, I‚Äôm (20M) in college and fresh out of a long term relationship. A few weeks after it ended I started putting myself out there, not necessarily looking for a new gf, but maybe a fwb or just regular good old friends. Got on tinder just to see what was out there.

Anyway, outside of tinder I ended up meeting this girl organically (she lives in my apartment complex). We hit it off, I got her contact, and we made plans to hang out. Before we actually met up, she made sure to let me know that she was recently out of a long term relationship and wanted to know if I was looking for anything. I told her I was in the exact same boat and I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, and she said great. We met for dinner, had a pretty good time. I can‚Äôt speak for her, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some attraction between us.

So we made plans to hang out again. However, this time she texts me the day we were supposed to go out and tells me she really enjoys hanging out with me, but she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ready for this, that she‚Äôs been having a rough time lately (presumably about her breakup), and she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I‚Äôm obviously a little confused, since we both prefaced that we weren‚Äôt looking for a relationship. She said she was just nervous because even if our goal wasn‚Äôt a relationship, it‚Äôs just too soon after the breakup. But we‚Äôd only texted for a few days and hung out once, and I didn‚Äôt actually know her well enough to feel comfortable grilling her about all the details of her personal life. I told her she should take all the time she needed. We haven‚Äôt talked since then.

A few days later, I‚Äôm scrolling through tinder and I find her profile. Obviously, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with being on tinder, since I‚Äôm also on it, but the reasons she gave me for cutting me off didn‚Äôt quite line up with having a tinder profile. And I know she was active on it because she added a new photo in that same night.

So I‚Äôm obviously a little confused. My self esteem is telling me she lied about not being ready, so she could let me down easy and then ghost me. But a friend told me they think she actually likes me and doesn‚Äôt want to catch feelings so soon after her breakup, and that‚Äôs why she cut me off. But this girl is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and several leagues above mine, so it‚Äôs a little hard for me to believe that.

Ladies, which one, if any, do you think seems more likely? I want to ask her about her tinder profile, and without accusing her of anything, kind of get an explanation for why she told me she couldn‚Äôt see me. There‚Äôs a hundred possible explanations for why she has it. She never seemed disingenuous in our previous interactions, and I say that as someone with slight trust issues.
I just want an answer so I can get on with my life.

94,mlcnm7,1617718578,It's ok to have feelings,"Welp. Here I am. I fell for the moody, distant guy with attachment issues, subconsciously thinking 'I could be there for him and fix his issues' even though we agreed to just be friends. That's all on me. My bad. 

I didn't realize the cards and personal notes were all getting to be a bit too much, even though they were well intended. I could not see that I was pushing the boundaries. I can see where I was wrong.

But sometimes he would be so open that it felt like he was interested. And other times I would talk about personal things I can easily talk about with other guy friends but it would be 'too intimate' and he would go into ignore mode. 

What I ultimately don't appreciate is the ""I will ignore her and hope she takes the hint"" attitude. Can we all agree that having the awkward ""listen, we're just friends"" talk is the most respectful route? I know it's hard. But I have had this talk myself with others and it is better in the long run. Sometimes it will not go well and other times people will be able to swallow their pride and move on, better for it.

My point is this: 

We've all been there. We've all felt a bit dumb and unlovable when someone puts up walls, shuts us out and says ""NO THANKS"" to our offering of love. But it's ok to have feelings for someone when they are not returned. There is **no shame** in liking someone so much that we make a fool of ourselves. Shrug your shoulders and know that your love is a beautiful thing. You just have to know when to **let go.** Know that **someone** out there will feel more complete because of you. Someone out there will get you and appreciate you for who you are. You are not less lovable because you have love to give and that person does not want it.

I had a small lunch get together a couple of my friends on Saturday.  So I posted a picture of myself on IG in the outfit I wore that day, yesterday evening.

My dude decides to text me showering me with compliments, saying I looked lovely. But then he went on to ask: ""So did you take this pic, before or after your date?""

I literally hadn't said anything about me going on a date with someone else. But he was basically making the assumption that I had seen somebody else over the weekend.

I don't understand the line of questioning, because actually, when I had asked him during our meetup about what exactly he is looking for ( i.e. relationship, friendship or something casual), he said to me ""let's just see where it goes"". Meaning, if I were to have gone on a date with someone else, it shouldn't be a problem right? Because we are not dating.

Nevertheless, I told him I just saw some friends, and he appears to be side-eyeing my story. He was like ""Oh aaaaiiiight sure üòáüòè"". And he hasn't responded to me since.

The thing is, I don't know if this is just playful flirtation, or is he questioning me on a serious level. I actually do really like him, but I can't put all my eggs in one basket if just wants to ""see how it goes"". But at the same time if I admit to seeing other guys (which haven't yet, but I'm open to), he might get turned off. What is his game?
