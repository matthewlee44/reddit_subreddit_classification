2,r3v186,1638071209,How would men feel being approached like this?,"
Hi, so let’s say:

You’re in a city’s park just chilling, talking with your friends. When suddenly, some girl comes up to you and asks you to talk privately.

Assuming you agree, she then leads you away from your friends far enough so that they don’t hear but then can still see you guys.

She then says:” Hi, do you have a gf? cause I think you’re really cute and I’d love to get to know you. Also, sorry for interrupting you guys”

That’s what I plan on doing but I’ve heard that girls don’t like to be approached by guys like this because:

1. They get approached a lot when they’re just minding their own business/ haning with their friends

2. Some guys do it in a way that corners the girl, which makes her feel trapped( for example, when she’s getting gas and a guy approached and now she has to talk to him because her gas isn’t filled yet) 

3. Guys who do this (at least where I’m from) are considered fuck boys who have 10 other chicks on the side.

And I’m worried that it’d be the same for guys.

So if a girl were straight forward and approached you like this, is it a big no no? How would you feel?

I want to have safe sex and also make sure I know the other person doesn’t have STIs (not judging people who have one, but I don’t have any and I don’t want to risk getting one). STI testing seems the best way to find this out, but how do I go about asking them to get tested with me for a casual encounter?

I know a lot of people don’t ask about stuff like this or just decide to trust a stranger telling them they don’t have anything - that’s great if it works for you, but not for me.

I have close friends but being intimate in a relationship with one other person feels different and very terrifying to me, I didn't date or encounter anyone in a romantic way until college. I want to get over this because I get incredibly lonely and I really enjoy physical closeness with other people, I've never had sex that I enjoyed but I think that's because I have been intoxicated in every circumstance. I don't know how I could get comfortable enough around another person to have sex sober and that makes me pretty sad. I have several mental health issues including CPTSD, not because of any sexual trauma, but interpersonal trauma which really effected how I approach relationships and see other people and the world in general. I have been in therapy for a long time and I'm thinking of getting a new therapist because I don't really feel super understood or helped by my current therapist, but finding another is yet another scary prospect. I am not insecure about my looks at all, I think I'm pretty good looking, but I am quite insecure just about myself in other regards and don't have the highest self esteem. I seek out people who I know are similarly sort of f'ed up haha which has not been the greatest strategy for me. A lot of the time I don't really feel seen or understood by anyone and I'm afraid this will stop me from getting into any sort of serious relationship.

8,r3vdv2,1638072352,Dating an avoidant attachment woman as an anxious attachment man,"I've read some articles trying to understand avoidant attachment styles. It seems the women I have dated recently have fallen into this category.

Being an anxious attachment person, I want to spend time and fall in love right away. When I don't feel it reciprocated, it's hard to temper my emotions of feeling like the next great ""ghostening"" is just around the corner.

Here are some tips I've gathered with these experiences though:

* They want to hear from you, just not all day. Maybe not even every day. But they do want to know you're thinking about them sometimes. Ask them what they are doing, how their day is, etc. Get them to talk about themselves. 

* Talking about yourself and what you're doing is not particularly interesting to them. Most people are this way, but avoidant attachment people in particular are highly independent and don't want to hear about you unless they ask.

* It feels like the first message needs to ""break the ice"". I've found just keep it simple and short. I used to try to open with a joke or a meme, but I've found that's not really effective, and not getting to the point either.

* Keep most conversations short and to the point. After asking them about themselves, ask them to hang out. Having a long conversation via text is not particularly fun to them.

* Ask them to hang out. That's what they're going to enjoy more than talking. That's where the quality time is built, not through the phone. 

* Make plans to hang out. Don't just say ""would you like to hang out tomorrow?"" Come up with an activity. ""Would you like to go to the park around 2 pm tomorrow?"" will garner much more interest. Do ask it in question form though, don't just say ""I made reservations for us at a restaurant, be there tomorrow at 7."" That's demanding and violates their independence.

* If they say no to your plans, but offer an alternative, you're good. If they say no and don't offer an alternative (typically this comes with an excuse too), just move on. Doubly so if you make plans and she cancels. People who cancel dates are not interested in spending time with you. Don't try to re-ask them out if they cancel, it's a waste of time every time.

* In my experience, physical touch is usually not their primary love language. They may not want to hold hands, make out, have sex, etc. until they are confident you can respect their space.

Hope that helps!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3vdv2/dating_an_avoidant_attachment_woman_as_an_anxious/
9,r3vhvn,1638072726,Is it true that guys are intimidated by attractive girls?,"I’m not sure if I’m even old enough to post on here, but I (17F) have always been told that guys are intimidated by super pretty girls and that’s why I don’t get a lot of boys.

This is definitely going to sound like I’m fishing for compliments but I’ve always had a complex growing up because I felt like all of my peers were getting romantic attention and I wasn’t, really. But I was constantly told how gorgeous I was and I was pretty well-liked, and when I came to my parents about it, they both said the same thing: boys are intimidated by me. 

And to add to that, I am a biracial girl in a predominantly white area, which just adds a whole layer of surprise to the mix. But once I reached junior and (now) senior year of highschool, I really found my confidence and grew into myself, and frankly, had a little bit of a glow up. I started socializing more than ever and ended up winning homecoming queen. Even boys I had crushes on in middle school have came out of the woodworks and told me that they had a crush on me back then but I was just too..intimidating. Everyone compliments me and I’ve even had people say “you could pull any guy at [My school]” and even tonight, my friends all said I’m going to “pull boys” at college. Yet, I haven’t had a boyfriend and I’ve only had about 1 talking stage in these two years. (I had one boyfriend my sophomore year during covid, but it was only a couple months long). 

During my sophomore year, my friend came to me and said all of the popular junior boys had a huge crush on me and this other beautiful girl in my grade, yet none of them approached me while some approached her. I’ve had players from a huge football school that my brother coaches at say that I’m “hot” (charming, I know) and telling my brother they’re going to take me out, yet only two have actually snapped me  but haven’t asked me out, or tried to make things exclusive. 

So, is it really because they’re intimidated by me and don’t want to attempt to even try to date me? Or are my family and friends just trying to make me feel better? And I’m not insecure at all, I think I’m a very beautiful person, inside and out, yet I just don’t get boys’ attention like other girls my age.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3vhvn/is_it_true_that_guys_are_intimidated_by/

He has showed signs of being sensitive and quick to raise his voice over small disagreements but we “fixed” it within an hour. Anyway, we travel to Mexico to meet his family, and I noticed he shut his parents down when they contradicted him. He finds it hard to admit his wrong &amp; apologize. 
On our last day, I got mad over him being unpunctual as usual. I was serious about several little incidents over the weekend with him. 
He proposed we talked about it and solved our problems, I brought up that it felt useless to do that bc he has a hard time admitting he’s wrong and apologizing. 
He turned on the radio and didn’t talk to me, so I said “great way to fix things” 
He got ALL up on my face and started saying “enough enough enough” yelling so loud and much that I wiped off his spit from  my glasses. I pulled my phone out to call an Uber and he snatched it and threaten  to throw it out the window. He didn’t give it back for the remaining of the ride even though I promised to not call an Uber.  He pulled up to a church and I had to beg him to give me my phone back. He came out and polo fixed and kept doing it all the way to the airport. He said that’s never happened to him and that he was just overwhelmed. 

What should I do? He just felt so psycho to me. It’s confusing bc he’s the kindest most willing to help others person I’ve met.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3x852/he_got_in_my_face_and_yelled_at_me_took_my_phone/

I’ve recently gotten on dating apps and wonder if my lack of experience with a serious relationship would hinder me in finding someone around my age or a little younger or older. Also, I have never been interested in social media and feel it was never for me, but seems to be a big thing for people my age or younger.

61,r3znim,1638088162,Is it possible for me to find someone who is a virgin?,"(20)M here and I have never had a girlfriend, or anything sexual. I'm going to head to college in LA and I am starting to think about my dating life now. I've been raised in a more conservative family — which I am not against at all — and they don't talk about sex or anything like that. As I grew up and learned about hook-up culture, I despise it. I think it's not the move for me (Don't care if others do it). However, it seems to me that hook-up culture is increasing more and more.

This kinda worries me because I want to be with someone who is a virgin. In college, I have no clue what to expect with this whole dating stuff. I'm expecting some responses like ""It's none of your business to worry about their sexual past"" but I think otherwise. I don't think couples should hide anything from one another. It's simply the way I view these things from the start.

Regardless, my question is if it's still possible to find a virgin out there. Any pointers on what to expect will also be helpful.

He often says to me he loves me a lot as a friend and we cuddle with each other and he can’t imagine his life without me. And I do know he loves me and cares for me a lot because when I cry he starts crying. If I’m sad, it breaks his heart. And other actions and I ask him all the time but he says I’m only his friend and he loves me as a friend. So friend it is. 

Deep down, because I was intimate with him, I love him more than a friend possibly but have convinced myself that he’s my friend and I only love him as a friend. As he doesn’t reciprocate those feelings and one sided love hurts. 

My question is, how can guys love their ex so much like a friend. Is that even possible ?  I’m not looking for a relationship with him anyways because I value myself but I’m just curious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3zunt/loving_your_ex/
64,r3zzmk,1638089569,Should I just give up?," 

I am 20 And as long as I can remember, I have always been attracted to women that were older than myself.

I   understand it's normal to a certain degree. But all guys around my age   crush on younger women, when all of my celebrity crushes are from  older  women: Gal Gadot, Elizabeth Olsen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, etc.

But the problem is that, I almost always hear women saying they are disgusted at men that are younger than themselves.

It really hurts my confidence when women I am attracted to, say they are not attracted to me because they see me as a child.

That there is nothing I can do to make an older woman see me in a romantic way.

People   say you can't get any further with older women than fuck buddies.   Really? The only thing that can make them interested in me is to use me   like a dildo and then throw me away?

I'm not going to climb the Everest or fly to the moon or split atoms. I just want an older woman. That's it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3zzmk/should_i_just_give_up/
65,r40d5e,1638091102,Giving up F(19),I’m giving up on love. I truly believe I’m never going to find someone right for me. Every guy I meet only wants me for my body. I have yet to meet a guy that genuinely wanted to get to know me. I also get attached to people so easily which is really bad but that’s just how iam. I love people so deeply but they always end up disappointing me and hurting my feelings. I also never get the same energy/efforts back. There are no good guys out there.  It’s affecting my self-esteem so much when I see girls my age having so many guys interested in them and literally craving their attention. Me? I’m just there. I’m someone who gets used by other people for their own benefits. The worst in this? I let it happen cause I have never been loved so it’s the only way of me feeling validated/appreciated. It’s affecting my mental health to another degree. I give up. And do not tell me I have my whole life ahead of me and “to be patient”. Why do I need to wait to finally be happy? Why can’t it just happen. Deleting all dating sites and social media for me to regain my old self back.

We started dating when we were 15 (we are now 18). At first I wasn’t interested in him at all and he was totally in love with me. I then decided to give him a chance because we had really good conversations but It felt weird because I wasn’t attracted to him at all. Anyways   the first whole year was just kinda having a fling and nothing that serious and It went on and off. The second year was more serious and we actually started dating for a couple of months and then broke up because of a stupid thing I did. We then got back together and we were together that summer that ended in him breaking things off. At the time he said that he loved me but It wasn’t the right time for us. I was devastated, winter came around he started to act really mean twords me and was just really terrible to me for months. After that he calmed down and we started to have a thing again but only on the weekends after a night out and that went on for months….That summer we talked things out and decided to get back together. We were togther for a few months and at the end of the summer he broke things off again without any explanation at a big event when he was drunk and said he had been feeling that way for a couple of days now. Again I was devasted and confused. We go about six months not really talking to eachother and sometimes bumping into eachother through mutual friends. Last week he wanted to meet up and I did. At the end of us hanging out and catching up he said he loves me and misses me. That he wants to be the perfect boyfriend for me, buy me presents and go on trips etc. He also said that he had been thinking about this for weeks and Is ready to put in the effort and commitment for our realtionship to work out. I was shocked but also happy. I gave in and we started hanging out again like we used to. Then a couple of days ago he said that this feels weird and akward being with me but he would really want us to work out but It just doesn’t feel right. Again I was devasted. We agreed to be friends and see if that would lead us to be together but I feel like he just doesnt care enough. I feel like I should let go but at the same time I don’t really want to.

Out of the blue he's been saying he'd like me to call him Mr. Baggins, instead of his first name like I have been since I've met him.

My plan is for us to load up on snacks and then go to a drive-in movie. We'll probably bring pillows and blankets and lay in the trunk while watching the movie and snacking on the treats we bought. I thought it was a cute idea and informal enough to where we can talk during the movie but not have it be awkward if there's no conversation cause we can just watch the movie.

Anyways, I started thinking about when I should try to kiss her. Because I'm her ride home. So if I try to kiss her during the movie and it goes wrong, that could totally ruin the date and be super awkward.

The other option would be to kiss her when I drop her off, but that would mean we just spent 1.5 hours together in the back of a car with pillows and blankets and didn't even kiss. See what I'm saying?

It makes more sense to me to try to kiss her during the movie but that could go very wrong if she doesn't want it and put us both in a really awkward situation.

84,r425ry,1638098244,On Spot ‘Poem’/ Rant,"This is a writing in my notes of what’s currently going on in real life. Non scripted and as you can see I spent about an hour writing it. Cried as I wrote it but writing is what I do.
********
4:42am:
- he is not loving me in time. I feel like it’s overdue. I feel like he needs to come here. He needs to see me. This could play out different if we were physically together. 
- Why is the word love coming into my life??
- Why is it relating to M____? 
- How could I love him? 
I don’t know love from a man. A man you’d emotionally mentally and physically confide in. 
I fear that he will teach me the wrong version of it. I worry that I will never trust love if he does not give correctly.

I want him.
But he does not give me life. He does not fulfill me. He does not make me feel loved. When at a distance. I need to see him. Nothing else will do. I can’t do this long distance shit if this is all the fuck it is just fucking phone calls full of shit and chronic silence. He’s barely 4 hours away &amp; won’t consider coming to see me after I spent $400+ to come see him 3 weeks ago. 

But I want him. 
Any ounce of his encouraging behavior makes me feel special. But I only experience that when I get undressed for him. Once ever for a hairstyle. And a few times for some outfits he liked but seeing his smile, when it’s for me, always made me feel special. Special to him. I don’t feel that from him often.

But I want him.
He’s almost been around for 3 years. We’ve only been in talking stage since. The first night we met we connected like it was nothing. In a couple days he’s caressing my legs in the back seat, in front of his friends. Where is that same adaptation? Why are you so closed off from me? 
Why is your guard never down anymore? 

I still want him. 
A part of me won’t let up until I find out whether or not he is supposed to be mine. I want to know you. I want to witness your vulnerability and have you know I’ll always protect it. 
This time with him has meant a lot, and then nothing to me. He makes me nervous. As long as things go his way everything is fine. Any verbal confrontation we have I always lose. I lose because my communication is not top tier and I do not do well under pressure. So then I sit in silence and frustration. Short replies. “What else do you want me to do? I hear you, I will work on that.” 
He’ll go: “you don’t got nothing else to say?”
No. I say “what else am I supposed to say? All I can do is work on it.”
- work on speaking up more. 
- Work on acknowledging every point
- I communicate amazingly in my writing. 
- But in real life my mind fucks me over each time. It’s very upsetting. 

When I happen to be wrong, the matter is blown up. Usually I understand his point, it’s not usually unreasonable. No ones ever emphasized the thing so do “wrong” so much. He has made me believe that I am this shitty and mostly incompetent person who just doesn’t care. A crazy person who’s “priorities are backwards”, (emphasizing himself as one of my priorities). 🤷🏽‍♀️

I still want him
All I want is one perfect day and night with him. To show him I can be all that he wants. But I’ve never had to prove myself to anybody. Every other guy naturally saw me for me. I am convinced he feels like he could find someone more beneficial and competent than me. 
 
 Still want him
He has chosen to deal with me for this long. I 95% believe he only talks to me. Otp day and night. Could it really just be me? I don’t want to believe that but I’m always the problem and to this day I need to “get my shit together” and just do what he asks because he’s “tired of having these conversations”. But still said “that doesn’t mean to not acknowledge an issue you have”

So I want him
He says logical shit. He’s not a terrible person. Though his delivery is always direct but brutal and always ends in the point of me needing to realize what I’m doing wrong and to not let it happen again. Just the other day he told me “I asked you to be better😂”.
 I have never been good enough for him. Why do I still want to find out if I ever will be? I won’t move on until I know I can be what he wants and we could actually be happy together. At least that’s how I feel.
  To say I could be right for him if he knew me better. That Is so insane. Because he knows me enough.
I get anxiety of what you could be for me, yet your every action contradicts that and it honestly hurts.

                      But I still want him.

86,r42cf0,1638098987,My gf (now ex ig) broke it off within a week when things started happening,"Okay first of all I'm 15m and she was 17. We met by pure coincidence and so on and so forth. Anyways in the first week we met i told her if she'd like to go out sometime, she said sure just to wait a couple of weeks because school had just started, to that I said okay as it was the same for me. So about one month in i ask once more when could we go out, we did and to be completely honest I had a blast. She was fun, we liked a lot of the same things and it was just in general quite nice to finally go out with someone for the first time for real. We held hands then (on the first date - her words), things were going really well. For two months we texted every day, i called her many times, we had our ups and downs but that was to be expected...i think. Now somewhere in that time period we went out, it was late, she just finished work and we just found a nice place near the river under some trees, we laid there and later made out as well. After we had done that she asked if things were going too fast for me, to which i replyed no and we went on with our little adventure. That same week i went to her house, to where her mom drove us and her whole family was home (her mom said they wanted to meet me, which came as a surprise to me and her - she later told me they won't be home, but i like tried to play it cool) so there i meet her family, all good right? We go to her room, watch a couple of movies and just have a good time in general. She took a few pics of us and posted them on social media. Then her (i think) grandpa needed her downstairs and when she came back she was all apologetic for not being with me, i said it was cool. Somewhere in that moment (idk what it was, its been like a good month and a half) she just became really sad and just ruined the whole mood but to me all that was important, was to be with her. In the end she just started crying and wouldn't even look me in the eyes, i tried my best to try and console her (idk if that's how you write it), then i also saw cuts on her arm. I tried asking what that was, she just wouldn't tell me. Her problem was also that i asked too much, about her past, about her (just in general ig) and she later said that i was suffocating her with all that and she just told me to go. The same day i texted her, to ask her if she was alright and stuff and she just told me like yea I'm good. So now a bit more than a month later, I'm broken, started with some bad habits and she just keeps living her life. I'm so sad that i had so much love for her, gave her all the attention and she just took that away - in the end saying it was more of a friendship.

Now I know, I'm 15, it's still early for me to do anything, but she said she just liked me for the attention i gave her. I feel like many months of my life have been a lie. What can I do in the future to prevent that? How can someone just lose interest in you? Now that i think about it, in the beginning she told me she had a same situation with another guy a year before. I don't know how i feel about this. I see the red flags now. Should i try and ""date"" in about a month I'll be 16, i think that'll give me some confidence. How can i change things? I did my best and she was just like meh f u too. Any advice?

How do i make him chasing me? Or is it better to just ghost him",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r42mi2/is_it_okay_to_text_the_guy_i_like_first_everyday/
89,r42ty2,1638100889,Is bad adult acne a dealbreaker?,"Went out with a guy who had pretty BAD facial acne. Bad as in cystic acne everywhere + a lot of scarring. 

If I don't think about the acne, the date went great. We connected and there was zero awkwardness. But having clear skin is really important to me (one of my non-negotiables) and I kept wondering if it was a hygiene issue or a hormonal thing. 

I hate how half of me wants to continue pursuing this while the other half can't stop focusing on the acne. I know skin is something that can improve over time but I also know it's not guaranteed.

What would you guys do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r42ty2/is_bad_adult_acne_a_dealbreaker/

93,r43q7a,1638104165,Roast me. Or tell me there’s a chance.,"I’ll preface this- a girl I fell for and have been seeing since summer, after a big night out with her friends (I legit introduced he to a big musical artist through my
Connections), became distant the exact next week. 

After multiple attempts to see her, be there for here, she told me she was working through some things and needed time alone. I couldn’t protest or anything, I can’t force it if she isn’t in a place to be in a relationship and respect that she needs to grow. 

Fast forward to now (3 months later)- this past week I got weak and reached out to tell her I’ve been thinking of her and missed her. 

Met with a big nothing. Superficial response. “Hiiii! I hope you are doing well”

Blocked her Instagram to symbolize To myself I could move on. 

Then she texts me about me blocking her. We were far more than friends, our sex and chemistry was unreal yet she’ll claim “I tHoUGHt wE wERE fRiEnDS”. In her mind we were just Fuck buddies. I thought we were dating. Or that’s just what I’m seeing. 

Friends don’t just abandon friends. So I put my stake in the ground (hoping this would wake her up to come back to me), so I said I am in an amazing place in life and can’t wait around for someone who can’t be there for me.

I laid it out how i want her in my life, I want to support her- not tell her what to do, not to give her advice, just support and hold her up while she discovers herself.. And how she needs to open up to me and let me in  because I want to be there to support her, and it legitimately hurts to not be with her. 

She said she’s still in a weird headspace and needs to focus in herself. 

I know she’s “working on herself” but what does that mean? Fucking other guys? Do I stick around? 

I spent all of thanksgiving with my family thinking of her and wishing she was here and I wasnt so alone. She really is incredible but what do I do. It’s killing me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r43q7a/roast_me_or_tell_me_theres_a_chance/

97,r43xk3,1638104822,What to do,"So I (29M) have been knowing and dating this girl (30F) for about 3 months. It all started really well as she was the one more invested into me as I generally first take things slowly. 

After 2 months I began to start thinking what are we. We are not seeing more people and everything we were doing was like we are a couple. She has been sleeping in my apartment every weekend for this past 2 months. I start to catch feelings and I tell her about this. I did this via text (was really bad for my part i know) as she was out that week and I couldn’t wait to tell her as I was seeing she was less interested than normal. She decided she needed a “break” to think about it as she has always been saying we are just meeting each other and see how it goes. After 10 days with low contact we decide to meet and talk about it. This time also helped me to low how attracted i was to her as everything happened so fast and I also needed to think about it. 

Fast forward we talk about it and we are good as we are but I don’t know that if I want more she will be going at the same pace as me. Last week was the first time we slept again together but we went to a party and we were just too drunk. I wanted to spend that the and the following day with her talking and having fun but we were not feeling well after that much alcohol from the day before. Also we had things to do for that day so she just went to her house after waking up. 

So I am here wondering what to do and how it will turn up. We have decided to flow and don’t overthink these things but these past days I don’t see her really interested. Maybe it’s how I see it. I am really happy with her but I just was wondering it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r43xk3/what_to_do/

99,r448bq,1638105816,Anything I could have done better?,"Dear community,

me (27F) dated for 3-4 months a person (30M) that is active in the military. He moved recently to CA, where I live. We met between 1-3 times a week and things were going steadily. I never have been before with someone in the military, so that life was unknown to me. Long working hours, etc. but don't have a problem with it.   
However, after a few dates, he told me he has PTSD, depression, and anxiety but I should not worry because that is his problem. I saw sometimes how he changed from one second to another, from being cheerful to very sad. In the last weeks the communication went less and less, and I finally aske dhim what is going on. He answered he has too much to deal in his life (job and other problems) that he can't give me the attention I deserve.   
I was always consistent, honest but also have my own life (so was never clingy).
