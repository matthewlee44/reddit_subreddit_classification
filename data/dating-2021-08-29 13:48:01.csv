The most outrageous story I heard was from a friend in college who met a girl who tried to set his pubic hair on fire.

But if I were ever on the other end of that experience, I feel like clarification would be a warranted courtesy just to make sure nobody feels led on or embarrassed.

14,pe2qgn,1630267911,Am I being played by this guy?,"TLDR: I don’t know whether I can be angry at this guy who said he doesn’t want a relationship but gives me mixed messages and signals. I want to cut him off but I like him.

Information:
I met this guy (Alex) via a group on CH (where people have actually met each other irl). I wasn’t able to attend one particular meet up but our mutual “friend” contacted me the day after to tell me Alex mentioned my name and seemed potentially interested. The very next day Alex asked for my number.

A month since he asked for my number, he has consistently messaged or called me. Mostly texts. I always reply back within a decent time but he can take 4-6 hours most days. We both have busy jobs but I guess texting isn’t his thing.

In the earlier stages of our talking, he asked if I was seeing anyone etc. I said no but was open. He said the same but added that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was gutted. Nonetheless, he communicated with me everyday, basically flirting and giving me “x” after texts etc. 

Anyway, fast forward to the mutual friend. This mutual friend basically expressed his interest in me and I shut it down immediately. I was really hurt because I wondered if Alex had said “go for it” as if I was a cheap piece of meat. After sometime I raised it up during a phone call and he claimed to be shocked. Fine. He also said that he and I were “not talking like that”. After that phone call I felt immediately stupid yet relieved and asked him to stop flirting by calling me his girl, mother of kids, messaging me on CH if another guy raises interest etc.

I also noticed he only replies back when he sees me on CH after a full day of ignoring my text messages. But since yesterday I have been giving him airtime. I think I deserve better than this mixed signal BS.

A part of me also feels like I have no right to be angry but he must know what he’s doing. Talking about what our sexual chemistry could be TF. 

I feel foolish. How do I deal with this guy moving forward? He reached out again this evening. So far I’m ignoring. Both of us in early 30s.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe2qgn/am_i_being_played_by_this_guy/

There's this girl, she came over to my college dorm room because we were drinking with a bunch of friends and my friend invited her to come. She was vibing with us, two weeks passed. I asked her over to my place for some wine (she lives literally two floors below me). She said she's out with some friends but she's let me know later. She messaged that she's arriving but already exhausted, but told me I can meet her for a few minutes to talk a bit. I said sure, I'd love to get some air anyways. After the meeting, she said that she can come tomorrow. I messaged her at 8 pm the next day to ask her when she's coming out from work. She never responded since. I get it, you had higher priority things to do. I'd totally respect that she would prefer an old friend or whatever, just let me know. I know the more you chase the worse it can get, but honestly, isn't there just a way to tell her that it's totally fine to reject or say she changed her plans or that she's not interested at all?

Even worse, she could actually just change the plan, ghost me &amp; then decide it's too weird to just message me later even if she's interested.

Let's say I went on a date with a woman on a Saturday night, we had dinner and it went well and it was our first date. I think she is interested in me but not necessarily fully into me. I am interested in her not as a hookup, but for a serious relationship. When is the next time I should ask her out for the 2nd date? Should we see each other every other weekend or a couple of times of week or something else? When should texting/calling start to escalate?

I feel there should be some sort of medium balance. If one asks to hang out too quickly, the woman might think you have no life and that your social value is low. On the flip side, if you take too long to ask to see her again, then she might think you are just not interested in her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe40iv/how_frequently_to_start_spending_time_and/

There’s a really cute girl in my Intro to Ethics class. Cute to the point where I’ve had class with her twice now and I keep thinking about her despite not wanting to. It’s like I have a middle school crush again. 

I want to talk to her. But I don’t know how. I’ve never been great at breaking the ice with people. But I can hold a conversation if one arises. She usually shows up to class a few minutes before it starts, always sits pretty close to me, but far enough away (1-2 desks away) to make casual small talk uncomfortable. During the class, the professor lectures everyone, and there’s no opportunities to try and talk during class. And after, she’s usually one of the first people to leave. 

On top of all that, I’m now struggling with the idea of if I even should talk to her. The actual likelihood that she’ll like me and actually want to go on a date with me is pretty small. I’m not bad looking, and I don’t have a bad personality. It’s just, she could already be with someone. Or I’m not her type. Or she doesn’t want to see anyone right now. Or I’ll get friend-zoned. Granted, a lot of this is just me overthinking things over the weekend since I haven’t had class with her since Wednesday. But considering how much she’s been on my mind, despite me trying to think of other things, I feel like I have way too high of expectations for talking to her.

Since I was little, people have told me I look pretty and put together so I think it's really my personality rather than how I look.

I do have a lot of other friends that actually have never had a boyfriend before since we all have a lot of academic stuff to focus on from university, but now that I'm about to graduate, things are just getting extremely lonely and at this point I just want someone to cuddle and share emotions with.

35,pe4t1s,1630274581,Should I keep pursuing it or stop.,"I went out with a former coworker (18f) to get piercing she invited me (20m) afterwards we hangout for over 4 hours she kept giving me occasional compliments about things I do or how I look. The thing is that I am not good at receiving and giving compliment, So I would just pretended I didn’t hear them. I know 😭. overall though the vibe was really good she left and we texted. Next day came rolling and we don’t talk till afternoon and I texted  “we should hangout sometime”. She said she was going to a party and that if wanted to come by. To me this was going To feel awkward cause I haven’t made any moves on her and kinda haven’t shown any romantic interest in her however I knew this could be my chance to change that. It went horrible though, (1.)I pulled up and she wanted to smoke with his guy friend but I felt like I couldn’t talk, they just know each well while don’t know much about her so kinda stayed quiet. (2.) After smoking we went inside and she sat next to me kinda smiled at her and tried to talk to her but I feel she felt embarrassed or something she kept looking around. my vibe died down I felt that it was my fault of the awkwardness. She left 40 min after I show up saying she had to go to work tomorrow. Honestly I feel kinda guilty for the awkwardness around us, I feel like it’s my fault for no knowing how to flirt/talk. Now my questions is if a still have chance with her, if so what can I do to go out with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe4t1s/should_i_keep_pursuing_it_or_stop/

39,pe56ou,1630275852,My bf (20M) just broke up with me (20F) and now Idk what to do,"So my bf and I have been together for about a year and a half. We love each other to the moon and back, we’re so good together, like we fit together, and everybody else says so as well.

He has a job right now that he hates, brings him a lot of stress and makes him work late most nights. He doesn’t have his GED yet, or a driver’s license either, so it makes things doubly hard for him too. I don’t have my license either. But relationship wise everything seems to be going pretty well, until last night that is. I get a text from him that says:

“I need to tell you something serious btw, And it's harder for me to say than think but I feel like we should stay friends. I've been really thinking about this. And given that I'm going to be quitting this job soon for a new one  I need to focus a lot on these things. Now I'm not saying we shouldn't visit each other and whatnot. I WILL visit you regardless. I hope you understand my decision here.”

After I read it, we got on a call with each other and we talked. He said that it wasn’t my fault, which I believe, and I said it wasn’t his fault either, he agreed with me. He explained that he wanted to try and get all his stuff together (new job, GED, etc.) and that because of that, it would be hard for him to make relationships his top priority. He also explained that he’s bad at multitasking, which ngl he is. He also has Aspergers, if that puts things into more context. 

He also felt bad that we aren’t able to spend enough time together as we want, I just moved an hour away for school and he came to stay the night over at my place a few nights ago. Every time he does this though, he has to give notice to his work and ask for 2 days in a row off, and that usually takes about 3 weeks to finalize. 

I said that I’m still in love with him, and he said that he’s still in love with me too. He said “Ik. But atm I don't wanna be in any relationships for a while. I need to do what I feel is best for me sometimes. It's kinda like a Spiderman type thing. Too many things to take care of. Not saying AT ALL that you're a burden.  I mean that I can't keep track of everything so I need to do things one at a time.”

I told him that once he got some stuff figured out, I would be more than happy to snatch him back up in a heartbeat if he so chose lol, and that if I ever cross a line or make him uncomfortable in any way, to tell me and I would stop. I asked if all that sounded good to him and he said “Yeah. I just feel like I haven't been making my own decisions in my life in a long time. Even before I met you like I've been letting everyone choose for me. I want to take control and make my own decisions for me. Ya know? I just don't want my decisions for my life to hurt you.”

We’re best friends right now, so it’s better than nothing lol. But I’m not gonna lie and say that I’m not a bit hurt by all of this. I should’ve seen this coming, and I think I did, but I didn’t wanna say anything or acknowledge it. It’s not my fault or his, but rather his circumstances, which we both agreed on. It’s just so weird that after all of what’s went on between us, it’s just gone, mostly anyway. Tbh, I have been encouraging him to get his driver’s license, GED, and all that, because I love him and I wanna see him succeed. We have done nothing but support each other since day 1.

I’m hoping that maybe he just needs a little time, to find a new job and all of that. I hope that someday we can be together again.

Right now, it’s 8 hours after the fact, and I’ve slept about 2 hours. I feel pain in my chest and my head is throbbing. I just don’t know what to do. Advice please?

51,pe5yd8,1630278486,She Said She's Not Ready for Something Serious,"Almost four years ago, this girl (let's call her Katrina) caught my eye. I messaged Katrina on social media but to no avail. Eventually, I met her in person as I joined the charity that she was a member of, and we talked for a bit, which was nice. I could tell she was genuinely curious about me and that she wanted to get to know me better. Unfortunately, after a while, I found out that she has a boyfriend, so I moved on.

Approximately a year passes, and I forgot all about her as I start dating another girl I met from the charitable organization (let's call her Alberta). Eventually, Alberta finds out that I liked Katrina before I liked her, and she couldn't accept it since I was ""the one"" in her eyes, and she felt like she was ""the second"" in my eyes. Suffice to say; things didn't end well.

Over the course of the two years, I have met her once or two handfuls of times at various social events. At each event, we'd have a small chat, which she usually initiated. At one of the events, she saw me with Alberta, and I could visibly tell that she was slightly jealous. She waited for Alberta to leave before coming over to say hi. Katrina broke up with her boyfriend around the same time Alberta, and I broke up. I messaged her, but it was way too early to make a move. Looking back, I'm not even sure they had completely broken up at the time. She stopped replying to my messages once she realized that I was trying to flirt with her.

Some months pass, and I see her across the street. She was smiling at me, but I decided to walk across the street without acknowledging her. She was visibly depressed over her ex-boyfriend, which made me feel like shit. After several months, the charitable organization hosts an event which we both attended. We spoke for a large portion of the event, and the guys were even winking at me as if something was going on between us. At the event, I finally made my move as I asked her out on a date. She started laughing and smiling while telling me that she isn't ready for something serious yet and that I should text her before the next event. She gave me her number.

A couple of months ago, I started seeing her wherever I went, and her friends were implying very heavily that I should make a move. When I met her, I could tell that she was still depressed over her ex-boyfriend, which made me sad. It's clear that she thought of this guy as the love of her life and that she wanted to marry him. I doubt she'll ever love another guy as much as she loved her first boyfriend. I tried to avoid her at this time since I didn't want to get rejected again. After texting her, she kept appearing in places after I had posted it on my story. 

Finally, I decided to walk up to her in front of all of her friends to have a small chat and ask her if she's ready for a date: She said no. This shocked me because she had shown such interest leading up to this. She was genuinely flattered and happy when I made my move, but at this point, I kept thinking, ""f\*\*k this, stop wasting time."" I could tell that I made her much happier and helped her overcome what seems to me as symptoms of depression. The event we spoke of a year ago is approaching, and if she shows up, I'll know that she is somewhat interested since I'm the only reason for her to show up. 

*About her:* Saying she's very pretty is an understatement. I know there is an army of guys waiting in line for her just like me. She loves attention, and I think she wants a guy to sweep her off her feet. The more guys there are in line, the more tests there will be to win her heart. Normally, I love playing ""games"" and overcoming tests to win a woman's heart, but I won't play if I have no chance. I like to play but I don't like getting played. World famous actors even follow her on IG.

Slept together on the first date and basically lived together for a month. He was still seeing other people and I found out. Initially hurt but I realised it was early days and we never had the discussion.
We acknowledged we went fairly fast and he's stated he wants to explore us and hopes for something more but feels we should take its slowly. While the time together has lessened to take away the intensity and slow it down, the sex aspect hasn't. I've informed him that I've had past dating scenarios where I've been used, and because I'm serious about seeing what happens with us I don't want it to be just about sex. He agrees but the pace for sex is still at the same level as before.
For myself I'm at a point in the relationship where I'd like to explore a bit more exclusively and he's aware but I understand the need to take it slow. I've emotionally invested into this and thus sex plays a different and more emotional role now.
I feel that since he wants to take things slower that there needs to be boundaries around sex and dating other people. I'm just concerned of how to address this without putting him off or him feeling like I'm rejecting him. 
Is it ok to put in boundaries and pull away physically around sex when we've been so fast paced and sexually expressive? Especially if we want to take it slow and figure us out emotional",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe5zh0/setting_physical_boundaries/

I continued to talk to the clerk about the return and the girl came back into the store and asked me for my number.

57,pe66y0,1630279301,The cycle of how modern dating makes us all feel worthless:,"Rambling thoughts incoming. 

I don't believe people on average are good or bad people. Most of us are simply byproducts of our environment.

I'm a 25 year old bi woman, fit, not a model but conventionally attractive and get a decent amount of attention. I used to be a worse looking in high school, and although I got less attention I think in a way I preferred it. I felt like the connections I had were more genuine. 

Modern dating is fucking things up for everyone. Both genders lose in this game. Men lose now because it's so much harder to meet women, women's standards have increased due to marriage not being a necessity anymore, and how hard it is to even get a date in the first place none the less start a happy, healthy relationship. 

Women lose because now because we're having too many experiences. Let's be honest, amicable breakups are the minority. Some men will do the absolute most for women they're not even that interested in initially, simply because it's harder to get a date with a woman. The woman then thinks this man really likes her, love-bombed and ghosted, or used for sex. Rinse repeat. 

(I realize I'm generalizing a bit, but those are the common problems I see with men/women in modern dating.)

After years of the constant rejection, humiliation, being reminded you're not good enough: whether it be getting rejected on the front-end or rejected on the back-end, baggage and unhealed trauma accumulate.

Like I said, we're byproducts of our environment. I definitely play my role in contributing to the fast life, the casual sex/disposable culture. Even if you're a person who wants something meaningful, going through cycles of dating that last a few months where you truly begin to open up, then get shit on emotionally again and again and again... It begins to feel like, what's the point of this?

Even if I don't like casual sex, or thirst trapping on social media for attention, or OLD, sometimes I feel compelled to resort to it because something feels better than nothing. Even if I don't like the bar scene, shitty socialization feels better than none. To others it might be viewed as narcissistic, for me it's a desperate cry to feel something. Anything. I imagine at least some people feel similarly. 

This last time around, I fell for a friend I've known since middle school. It was one of the few times I actually felt the feelings were reciprocated, and they are, but he won't date me because our libidos are different. He wants sex everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. I want sex a few times a week. There's nothing but love and I understand where he's coming from, but it really hurts, again, feeling like I'm not good enough. 

I'm sorta beginning to wonder if I should just throw it in the towel and give up dating for good. I don't want to be anymore damaged than I am already, I'm tired of being used/abused/discarded and consistently being treated as an option and not a priority. I'm tired of dating for a few months and then it ending and them falling off the face of the earth. I'm tired of working on myself internally but people I'm with not doing the same. I'm tired of having a great conversation with someone who starts hitting on my (more petite) best friend when she walks in the room. I'm tired of people only hitting me up when it's convenient for them. I'm tired of being the second or third choice and not the first. 

I have good friends and family I'm very grateful for. I'm pretty sure I don't want kids. Maybe I just legitimately am not built for a relationship. I know I play a role in why modern dating sucks. I think in a way, we all do, consciously or not.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post was, but I just needed to get it out. Thanks for reading.

I feel like I love this girl but I can’t shake the facts. I don’t want to leave her alone to deal with this new news she received? What should I do?

64,pe6ntm,1630281002,"Challenging myself to be ""secure"" for 30 days--any tips?","Hey all! I've (27, m) discovered that I'm EXTREMELY insecure and that this leads me to ruin my relationships. I have huge amounts of anxiety from overanalyzing and reading into literally everything that the person I like does and making it into a thought that he hates me. He didn't reply to a text? I must be annoying him and now he hates me. He's busy on the day that I asked him to hang out? He's just making it up--he actually hates me. Etc, etc, and I'm sick of it.

I've decided to challenge myself to be more secure for the next month by taking everything at face value. If he says he's busy because xyz, just accept it and realize it has nothing to do with me. He didn't respond to my text? He must be having a busy day. I think this approach will help keep me from sabotaging our relationship with negative thoughts and be good practice for the future.

My only question is: on the off chance that he genuinely *is* trying to hint something, what do I do? E.g. he doesn't respond to three texts in a row. Where do I draw the line? If it gets to that point and it legitimately upsets me, do I just reach out directly to address it (like ""hey, I noticed you're not responding anymore. I don't want to assume anything, but lmk if you're no longer interested!"")? Or do I just keep accepting it at face value until *he* says something to me directly (like ""I'm not interested anymore, stop texting me plz"" lol)? Any ideas here?

67,pe6p11,1630281124,Does any other guys feel like it’s not okay to talk to women?,"I’ve just seen so many people online and have known so many girls that say this or something similar. 

It feels like women are now off limits to speak to. I’m a 20 year old in college and I’m in a major that has barely any women and I rarely see any women outside of like the gym or just walking to and from class and it feels inappropriate to talk to them. I don’t want to be viewed as creepy or seen as a threat and I go out of my way to avoid them to so they can feel as comfortable as possible.

I’ll go so far to avoid a certain machine at the gym if I see a girl by it. If I’m running at night I will put at least 30 yards between me and any woman I see. If there’s an open seat near a girl in a class I’ll avoid it like the plague. I just don’t don’t want to know be creepy and it feels like the easiest way to do that is to just avoid women as much as possible.

The drawback of this, I don’t think I’ve met a new girl in about 3 years. I don’t know how to and not make them feel uncomfortable. I’m already pretty awkward and genuinely bad at social interaction. I don’t have but 3 friends because I sometimes just can’t bring myself to speak to other people. 

Usually I make a fool of myself when talking to guys, so I can’t imagine how awful it’d be to try to talk to a girl. She’d probably pepper spray me. The only way I feel like I can meet girls is online which is a massive shit show as I’m aesthetically challenged.

75,pe78xl,1630283139,Need some third party opinions on my situation,"So in early March, I (20M) matched with a girl (20F).

We went on a total of 4 dates. First one was like 4 hours, second was 9, third was 10. Fourth was short since it was during finals. Also FaceTimed her during the summer for a couple hours. Whenever I was in person with her, we'd be laughing and, it at least seemed like she was having fun. 

On the third date, it was the first time we ever cuddled. Laid in my bed after watching a movie for the remaining 6ish hours. Just talking. I snuck a cheeky compliment in at one point (still proud of how smooth it was and her reaction lol), and at one point she began rubbing my arm. 

I really regret not at least asking her if I could kiss her

I really enjoyed each date. She was very funny, and I was very attracted to her. I saw a potential for a relationship with her.

Anyway, early June rolls around, and my job hadn't started yet so I was incredibly bored at home. Very hard to keep my mind off her. At one point we lost our best friends on snap, and it slowly turned into snapping only twice a day.

At this point, I figured I should be straight up with her to see if it was worth stressing about. I sent her this message:

""I feel like it's kind of implied, but I just want to make sure we're clear with each other. Idk if this was supposed to be brought up earlier (haven't gotten this far on tinder lol) but I just wanted to say that I definitely see potential for a relationship. Just wanted to let you know where I stand in case you don't feel the same way

Ik this definitely came out of the blue but idk I figured there's no harm in knowing where we both stand""

To which she replied ""fair enough. I don't know what I want"" (not verbatim. It was along those lines).

So I followed up by asking her if it was worth continuing to talk. She said she'd have to think about it.

A day later I unadded her from snapchat and Instagram. She did the same.

However, we're still matched on tinder. I'm kind of contemplating asking her if she wanted to hang out since I'm back at school now. Figured maybe she said she didn't know what she wanted because she either

A. misinterpreted what I said and thought I wanted to be exclusive at that point

B. Didn't want to string me along because she didn't want to talk all summer only to change her mind later

I also highly doubt she would message me if she wanted to hang out again. She wasn't the type to initiate seeing each other (maybe she was just never that into me lol). So if she did want to, I'd have to find out by asking her

I want to ask her, obviously, because I really liked her. I don't want to because I feel like I lose my dignity by asking her again after we cut contact

77,pe7bxq,1630283453,10 Month ‘Thing’ Confusion - Need advice,"Throwback three years ago, I met this girl. We became really close and great friends but eventually cut contact because we went to different colleges far from one another. I always had a slight interest in her but nothing to note as we were young and dumb. Fast forward til about ten months ago, we met again and found ourselves talking everyday. We hit it off really well and about a month or so in we planned a date and eventually confessed feelings. 

Things were really good between us and at about the 2 and a half month stage I was going to ask her out. However, she decided that she couldn’t do a relationship at this stage because of her mental state (which I understood) so I told her I’d wait. We never really distanced and still continued to talk everyday in a flirtatious and couple-like way. 

Fast forward another 2 months, I brought up the idea of dating again to which she said she’d be open to it, and if I asked she would say yes. The upcoming fortnight of this we were supposed to hang out maybe 5 times, to which she cancelled on me every time. I asked her what was up to which she gave me another ‘I can’t do a relo right now’ type response. This hurt me a lot. And I knew I needed to simply cut her off to get rid of the feelings but for some reason I just couldn’t. She continuously gave me the idea that she wanted something so a part of me kept holding onto that and didn’t want to give up on her and let her go. 

For the next three or so months, we talked a little less and I talked to a lot of other girls to see if I could get over her throguh someone else (not healthy i know) however every time it felt like I was getting somewhere, I’d conclude that no one compared to her and I didn’t want anyone else but her, but I knew she didn’t want me. 

Ultimately, I gave in and told her how I felt - how I only wanted to be with her and couldn’t stop thinking about her. She reciprocated these feelings. I thought this was great and finally thought to myself that I had her, I had gotten what I’d wanted for the past forever. I loved her and she was the only person I’d felt this way about and I knew that meant something. Fast forward another month, things had been a bit rocky with the odd argument. I had the idea that she thought I didn’t want this anymore, so in an attempt to reassure her, I asked her out and told her how i felt. I got rejected. In her eyes, it had been too up-and-down and only caused her stress. This is whenI finally decided to let her go.

It’s beeen about 3 weeks since that. I removed her socials about 2 weeks ago and we had only talked a little bit since expressing how hard saying goodbye to the person we loved was (mutual). Anyways, I felt as if I was getting somewhere, until last night she sent an 1000 word apology stating she wishes she could take it all back and said she’s willing to fight to be in a relationship with me if I let her. I’m torn between risking being seriously hurt again, for the chance of being with her - what i’ve wanted for the longest time - and letting her go but potentially making a huge mistake i’m going to regret. 

I also love by the motto ‘Never run back to what hurt you the most.’

79,pe7tp1,1630285359,How to proceed after first virtual date?,"Hello everyone!

25M here - at the end of May, I matched with this girl (26F) on Bumble. We immediately started texting, and had organised to grab drinks. I unfortunately had to reschedule the drinks due to work commitments (started a new job, was under pressure to make impressions etc) and she understood as she is also a workaholic like me. We continued texting, and then again, as bad as it sounds, I had to reschedule the drinks due to work holding me back. On the same night, our city went into a lockdown, which didn't help.

We have since then continued texting on/off (we might have a conversation during the day, then either of us may respond in a few days etc). We had organised drinks again when we came out of our lockdown, but it was a short period of freedom as our city again went into a lockdown.

As we continued talking, I suggested a phone call / virtual date, since we couldn't catch a break. Funnily enough, she rescheduled our virtual date twice, and we finally saw each other last night over Facetime.

We spent almost over 3 hours chatting deep into midnight. We got along really well and shared a connection. By the end, it was obvious we both want to see each other again.

Now currently in our city, there is a 5KM travel limit from your house, unless you are leaving the house to visit your intimate partner.

At the end of the date, she said that she was open to hanging out/going for a walk within her 5KM limit, but her concern is me travelling down. She isn't too keen on getting a fine, or me getting a fine (which can be hefty). Now we can use the 'intimate partner' excuse, however she again said, that she wouldn't want to put me in that situation, so its up to me how I want to go about it. I told her that I'll dwell on it a little bit, but if not, we can do another Facetime call later in the week/next weekend. She agreed with this and said we can still do activities/games if we do a virtual date again to make things fun.

Fast forward to mid-day next day - I don't know what the protocol is for texting after virtual dates. Is it ok to still say something like 'I had a great time' etc and ask how her day is going to get conversation flowing again?

I go to a great school, just started an exciting job, have a friend group I hang out with almost every day, go to 2 clubs on campus, volunteer at church, work out and hike, etc. 

It seems like all the variables for meeting and dating girls are in place. But I cannot for the life of me get a date. I've tried online dating, and as expected, it was a crapshow. Ghosting, girls just looking for weed, bots sending me links, never matching with the girls I actually like, the usual. I met one girl who really clicked, we schedule a date for that Saturday, and she cancelled at the last second bc she got exposed to covid. Never answered my texts after that, so who knows if that was the truth. 

I've tried meeting girls through church and classes, but was always rejected. If I had a dollar for every ""I have a boyfriend"", I could buy the Sistene Chapel. And these girls aren't lying to get me to leave them alone - I've seen and met their boyfriends irl. The few times a girl was single and seemed to be giving me signs... the ""just friends"" speech ensues. The girls are usually very polite and apologetic with their rejections, and I appreciate that. But still, how many times am I going to hear ""sorry, I'm flattered, but...""? Is this just bad luck, or am I doing something wrong? 

I don't think I'm unattractive. I work out 5x a week, I wear good clothes, I use cologne and deodorant, keep a good hairstyle, and take pride in taking care of my skin. So it's depressing to see that after all that, the dudes in my church who wear shirts 2 sizes bigger and shower 3x a week are the ones getting girls' attention. I know things like my short height and brown skin turn some people off, and i wouldn't want to date anyone who makes a big deal of that anyways. But the reality is that my 6' white friends have all the girls, and my 5'4"" Mexican butt is left on the sidelines. I know I shouldn't be jealous of others' success, but ""don't be jealous, keep that positivity going"" doesn't change my reality. 

I can't get girls at work because that's a one way ticket to HR. I can't get girls at the gym because that's creepy and intrusive. I can't get girls on tinder because... well, it's tinder. And I can't get girls at church because the second they see my more attractive friends, I'm yesterday's donuts. Always seen, sometimes considered, never wanted. 

I live by the mentality of ""go where you're wanted."" And the burden is on me to go out and find the girls who want me. But the truth is I don't know where to go. Where can I find single college girls who will like me for me? Am I just destined to endure pain after pain until a girl finally says yes? If I can't even get a date, how am I supposed to know how to navigate a relationship? Wouldn't girls see ""he's 20 and never had a date"" as a red flag?

I went back to his place a couple times but told him very clearly that I wasn't ready for sex and that I can only be intimate with people I have a connection / trust with. We fooled around a bit and cuddled etc. he was respectful of my boundary to not take it further than that. He kept saying how he wanted to do all this stuff together and talked about the future etc. He used to text me every day little notes (we both agreed we're not huge fans of texting, but it was nice to get those daily check-ins to show we were both still interested). 

But since our last date, he texting me the morning after and we exchanged a few messages, but I haven't heard from him for 4 days... Which normally wouldn't bother me, but it's inconsistent with how he's behaved in the past (literally used to hear from him every day). 

I have no idea why or what happened - again, very new to this modern dating scene. For the record I'm 27 and he's 30 if that means anything. Can anyone explain or give some pointers on what I should do? I obviously don't think the right move is the chase him, but I hate being stuck in a limbo like this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe86cg/perspectives_on_my_dating_situation/
87,pe8iug,1630288050,No date confirmation.,"He asked me out on a date and we agreed to meet up on Sunday after he got out of work at 5. He texted on Sunday at 5:30 to figure out a place and time. I cancelled and let him know I made other plans as he didn’t confirm the date ahead of time. I got an apology and a work excuse. He did ask when I’ll be free again this coming week. Should I give it another shot or leave him on read? Ps. He had 4 days to make concrete plans and never texted to do so, prior to Sunday.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe8iug/no_date_confirmation/

89,pe8kn5,1630288243,[Greek] Looking to find love in NYC,"Hello,
I am new to this sub-reddit but I figured this is the best place to ask this burning question I’ve had for some time. 

Quick backstory before I ask away: So I was very sheltered growing up and still somewhat am (traditional Greek families tend to do that). Anyways, I didn’t socialize much plus my profession that I chose didn’t really welcome social-life…. Engineering.

So I ask: What routes/avenues/advice/apps can you recommend for someone such as myself; in to find a Greek down-to earth, family-oriented, religious girl that is looking for something serious in NYC. I am 24 years old and I’d like to think that I am at a decent spot in terms of my career/preparedness for a relationship. I’ve been told that Greek conventions are your best bet but where/how do I find out when those are occurring?

Need to become more social as a whole so I’m down to meet new friends to go out with to these meet-ups/conventions. Hit me up with a DM if your Greek and down.

TLDR: I’m a Greek male in NYC seeking a Greek female looking for something serious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe8kn5/greek_looking_to_find_love_in_nyc/
90,pe8lf4,1630288331,Really struggling with this… Would someone use a family members health as a reason to reject someone during the pandemic if they just weren’t interested?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe8lf4/really_struggling_with_this_would_someone_use_a/
91,pe8lm7,1630288355,Good thing s come to those who wait!,"I posted last week about how my (24 m) girlfriend (23 f) spent the night at my place and even though we didn’t have sex it was a great night.

[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9eaw7/she_spent_the_night_last_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most people were supportive of us and that was nice but a few were saying things like I should have kept pressuring her. She told me last week she wasn’t sure she was ready to take that next step in our relationship and I was okay with that. I’ve never liked a girl as much as I like her and I knew pressuring her would ruin a relationship that feels really special to me. 

First off I’ve known this girl since we were teenagers. We went to the same school and she’s been friend with my sister forever. We only admitted that we liked each other back in June and have been dating since then. We also opened up to each other about the fact that both of us have a history of abuse that I won’t go into. So I understood where she was coming from with her desire to take things slowly.

Well all I have to say is that we spent the entire weekend together and good things come to those who wait! I won’t go into details but yeah it was definitely worth the wait. Tonight I am as happy as I’ve ever been. I don’t even mind having to get up for work early and working so many hours because I know when the weekend rolls around I’ll be with her and all my problems disappear when we’re together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe8lm7/good_thing_s_come_to_those_who_wait/

On the one hand, she has come with a friend of mine to lunch, she was always sitting next to me at the pool a few days ago, I know she catches me looking at her, and yesterday I was supposed to be with her again at the pool but ran late so I was told by another friend that she started wondering out loud where I was and when I was coming and when I showed up, she seemed excited that I was there. However, there are times where I feel like I'm not there and she doesn't talk to me. Not only that, the same guy that told me about how she was asking where I was is also flirting with her when they both get drunk even though he already has a girlfriend.

We both have children, who we have not introduced to each other yet and we both have busy schedules. When we are together, he is very physically affectionate and extremely thoughtful and generous. His actions definitely tell me he likes me, but texting or talking on the phone with him is very business-like. Which is a problem when our schedules prevent us from seeing each other for extended periods. I feel like it is sending me mixed signals and makes me feel extremely distant. How can I tell him I need more so that I don’t feel that distance when we’re apart?

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to just sit down with a random group in the cafeteria. Whenever I see a group I always assume that they’re a friend group and that I’d be interrupting something. And if there’s someone sitting alone I assume that I’d be intruding.

99,pe9725,1630290637,one sided exclusivity?,"so i (23F) have been seeing this guy (25M) for about a month between talking an actual dates. our dates have ranged from going out to dinner, arcade, and just chilling at home and helping me plug in my switch. 

we are both seeing other people and that honestly doesn’t bother me. 
i just think that i am getting to the point where i want to be exclusively dating so we can fully test it out, my fear is that he will be unsure and will still want to see other people even if i’m only seeing him. 

he’s not a very emotional person (i am, INFP) but conversation flows and we match on a physical level too where things just seem natural. 

not thinking about the future too far but i do kind of want him to make more of an effort in general… 

so all, please help me out. 🥺",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe9725/one_sided_exclusivity/
