2,mlegde,1617723501,How should I proceed ?,"So I met this guy through an online dating app. Ever since we matched we weren't the types to text back and forth. By we I mean him. Sometimes we would go a good 5 days without texting. But he always made plans to meet. He was the one who initiated all dates. Date #1 which was pretty decent. Date #2 was amazing with us kissing. On date #2 I told him it kind of bothers me that he doesn't text a lot to which he said he will. He did put in some effort but after we met for date #3 which was pretty okay imo because we met in a hurry. He has gone back to how he used to text when we first started talking. 

He also did not make plans for date #4 so I decided to ask him out. He did not shoot down my idea but said he had some place to be and will confirm soon. Asked what I had in mind and told me he will let me know. Sometime back he messaged saying it looks doubtful. Did not give a followup time we can meet. 

What do I do next ? I really like this guy. Do I let him know I would want to see him again? Do I be upfront about this or just see how it pans out ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlegde/how_should_i_proceed/

12,mlfjpo,1617726364,Where to start? (Feel free to stick to the short version if you're not into novels.),"**The Short Version:** I (24 M) have (by choice) never really jumped into dating, and now I'm curious about where folks would suggest starting. I would rather avoid dating apps (at least until summer) for reasons I will expand on below.

**The Long Version:** Essentially, I've always been a very future focused person, and I've been responsible to the point that I guess I have kind of just neglected forming romantic relationships. Long-term or strong relationships have just never been very practical for me, and I'm a pretty seriously minded guy who's never really been interested in flings.

Back in Highschool, I never really got deep into dating for a few reasons. Taking IB classes, my workload was heavy and my social circle was pretty much restricted to other IB students, and all of our social time was pretty much spent collectively working not to drown in essays and test. My parents wanted me to focus on my academic performance, so I didn't have a job outside of minimum wage fast-food or cleaning work in the summer, meaning I rarely had much cash on hand- a problem for an old-fashioned guy like myself, who insists on paying for the date. My parents would have bankrolled such ventures if I had asked, but the thought didn't sit well with me, especially since I was already making it a point to spend as little as possible because I knew my family was having financial difficulties throughout my high-school years. Additionally, most of the girls I was interested in would assuredly be going off to various Universities after high school graduation, while I planned to go to the state college in my hometown because it was by far the most responsible choice I could make (my parents encouraged me to go off to university as well, but I didn't want to get buried in student debt or put yet more financial strain on my family, and I knew that I wouldn't earn enough in scholarships to cover my tuition elsewhere). It just didn't seem fair to them or myself to try starting up a relationship that I knew almost certainly wouldn't last and would only end in hurt for both of us.

I did have a couple dates in high-school (literally 2), though neither went well. 

One was with a girl from my IB cohort, who I avoided like the plague thereafter because of all the red flags she set off. Everyone thought I was nuts because she was so ""pretty and nice and intelligent."" I was vindicated a year later when she started dating another friend of mine, and we had to have an intervention because of how controlling, manipulative, and abusive the relationship was. He went on to take the full-ride to West Point that she tried to pressure him out of, and, last I checked, she is still banned from the Panera he finally broke up with her in. Good for him. 

The other was more of a Pseudo-date. When I was a senior, a female friend of mine from our Mock Trial team (a Freshman) got dumped by her boyfriend (a Junior) right before prom. Obviously, she was very upset, all the moreso because she had already bought her dress and wouldn't be allowed to attend unless another upper classmen tapped her as their +1. As we were friends, and I didn't have any intention to bring anyone else, I offered. We met up with some friends, and the night went pretty well right up until we left to go home. Once we were on our own in the car, she got considerably more... aggressive than I felt comfortable with (especially with the age difference), and I drew some lines and got her home as quick as I could without wrecking the car. We didn't talk after that. I later learned from one of my friends that they had known she was very, ahem, *physically affectionate,* and they just hadn't thought to mention it to me.

The college years weren't too different. I was still short on cash, using scholarships to cover tuition and my part-time job to cover my other needs and a few wants here and there. My last couple of semesters were especially tight, because working a job while also doing student teaching and managing your classes is a nightmare, and I so dropped the job. I also realized that one of my high-school issues has reversed, in that I knew I wanted to at least leave town after getting my degree, whereas most of the women around me (especially in my Education courses) wanted to stay as local as possible.

In hindsight, I can see that there were some girls that made passes at me that I just wasn't in the right headspace to recognize. My favorite story is when I got rear-ended at a red-light and the girl got out of her car incredibly flustered and apologetic. I wasn't too worried about it (my car was over a decade old, and the rear bumper was already a mess when I bought it), and she eventually offered for us to have lunch together at the restaurant we pulled into to check the damage. My brain, still being in work mode after finishing up an essay, just wanted to make sure she was okay and let her know I wasn't worried about it and that she didn't need to stress, so I didn't pick up on the obvious hints and flirtations until I was a couple minutes down the road. Was caught between swearing up a storm and finding it utterly hilarious.

Eventually I decided to just hold off on dating altogether until I was pretty much settled and self-sufficient.

And now I'm there, and, if I'm being honest, I don't entirely know what to do. 

I've got my degree and a stable job as a teacher, and will finish my first year in service in about 2 months (and let me tell you, it's been a hell of a year to start on). I make more than enough money to support myself,  and am currently building up my savings account (much easier, since I'm not battling student loan debt). I've made it a point to cover the tab any time me and my friends get together to make up for all those times I couldn't pitch in back in high school and college.

I'm not in love with my current location, and plan to move (likely out of state) in a couple years, but it's also pretty well known that it's an incredibly difficult area to teach in, so sticking it out for a couple years raises my marketability quite a lot. It's not perfect, but I figure that if I'm watching for every last duck to get in row, I'll be single all my life, and I'm frankly just tired of waiting.

I am in a college town, so there is a decent number of people in the appropriate age category, but having moved here under a year ago, and with the vast majority of my co-workers being in their mid-40s+, I don't exactly have a ton of inroads into pre-existing social circles.

I'm not really a fan on online dating to begin with, and I'm really not a fan of the atmosphere on dating apps like Tinder. I gave it a whirl for a couple weeks in college before deciding to hold off on the whole dating thing, and didn't much in the way of results. Additionally, despite the fact that I teach middle school, I am 100% positive that some of my little piranha lie about their age and use those apps (like I said, it's a rough system), and the last thing I need is them running across my profile on one. I might be more willing to give it a go over the summer.

I'm not above hanging out at a bar for a bit and seeing what's what, but I don't really have anyone to hang around with me, and I'm not even sure if that's a thing that people really do all that much.

For the record, I don't regret any of my decisions. They were good choices, and they've left me in a good position in life. I've laid a solid foundation to support the family I know I will someday have, and that's something that has always been important to me. It's just that now that I feel I'm in a place in my life where I feel ready to pursue dating, I don't much know how to go about getting the ball rolling, and I don't really have anyone in my life at the moment who can help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlfjpo/where_to_start_feel_free_to_stick_to_the_short/
13,mlfkp0,1617726437,Do I ?,"Hi everyone,

There is probably a simple answer to my problem, but I cannot seem to make up whether I should tell her or not.

For about half a year now I've been working with a lovely (26F) colleague that I get along with very well. Outside of work we have quite a decent amount of contact and we frequently take walks together. 
I started to like her as more than a colleague but I never acted on it as it is generally not a great idea to shit where you eat. I am also fairly certain that she doesn't like me the same way. She's been doing OLD recently.

Lately however, I've been struggling with my feelings for her. Been thinking about her more and more and it's starting to hammer down on me. If we weren't colleagues I would've told her sooner and if I got rejected I probably would have let her go.

I know it is probably not a good idea to tell her what my feelings are towards her, given we're colleagues. But deep down I really feel like I should, and that she deserves to know, even if that has a negative outcome for me. Workwise it will probably not affect anything (but you can never be certain). She is really sweet and I'm sure it will stay between her and I. It's just something that has been on my chest for some time now and I feel like I need to just get it off.

I want to ask you fine folk to provide your external advice, as my own are probably not the most objective right now.
Should you require more information, ask away.
Looking forward to your responses..

Kind regards.

And then you start talking and the butterflies rush in. And just that feeling of being in the right place at the right time.

24,mlgvkq,1617729869,Met a guy while he was on vacation - I‚Äôd like to find a way to reconnect but not sure it‚Äôs a good idea,"Met this guy while he was visiting my city for a month. We got along really well, a lot of texting, hooked up on the first date, still texted every day and then hooked up two more times, including once several hours before his flight home. We both wanted something casual - him because he was only there temporarily, and me because I just got out of a relationship - so we ended on a positive note. 

But after going from texting every day to nothing, plus the fact that I‚Äôve been going through a bit of a dry spell with OLD, I‚Äôve been really wanting to text him. He‚Äôs the kind of person I‚Äôd really like to get to know better - I haven‚Äôt felt that in a long time. I can‚Äôt even say it‚Äôs feelings because it‚Äôs more like there‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know about him (he‚Äôs very reserved), but he seems to check a lot of boxes, but it‚Äôs hard to say when I only knew him so briefly. It just feels like we neatly closed this chapter in our final messages to each other (friendly, upbeat messages about how it was nice to have met and hung out - nothing particularly emotional) and I don‚Äôt want to disturb that. Also, I feel like I can‚Äôt really tell if he was even potentially into me for more than just for fun.

Anyway, the real meat of my question, beyond knowing people will echo my sentiment that texting him is a bad idea, is that in about a month or so, I will likely be in the city he went to for my work.

I'm honestly not sure how to approach a first kiss with a woman also in her 30s. I'm not sure what is normal. I believe we are both fairly conservative when it comes to physical touch, and I know I'm not the most touchy feely especially with someone new.

So I've got a few questions: If I just hug and say goodbye, how many dates in would you want to stop doing that and break out a kiss? Or...if it depends...how would I know when its OK. Do people ask ""may I kiss you"" or something like that before the first one? What if she leans in and I'm not sure she wants to have a kiss at the end of a date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlh2ui/first_kissing_for_people_in_their_30s/

39,mlighp,1617734140,First date went well. Have my [32M] guard up a bit and wondering how to proceed,"Got drinks with a girl [29F] last night after talking on Hinge for a few weeks. Mind you, we didn't talk every day. She actually took a week break from the app during our convos and then spent time with visiting family. As such it took a good while to pin down a night that worked for each of us.

We sat at the bar area and had two glasses of wine (each) over the course of about two and a half hours. There was lots of laughter, similar interests, etc. I felt things went very well.

Being that this was a first engagement/blind online date, there wasn't a kiss at the end and we left with a hug. She let me pay for the drinks which I felt was a good sign.

We had good chemistry and we joked a bit about future plans, but I didn't push too much into that as were still just getting to know each other. She did mention she'd be single since November and has had a few ""bad dates"" since then.

I sort of viewed that as a red flag. Four months isn't a terrible amount of time to be single, in my eyes, and my post-date vine lingered on that. There was no post-date text from her which I understand everyone doesn't do, but in my experience when a date has gone well I've received one by the time I got home. This was a late date though and we left around 1030pm. 

I sent her a text on my lunch thanking her for a fun night and making a joke about something we talked about on the date. She did respond, but I'm curious of how I should best proceed. At the end of the date I did say that we should ""do this again soon"", so I somewhat feel the ball is in her court. Thoughts?

TL;DR
Had drinks with a girl... first date. Date lasted almost three hours. Lots in common, lots of laughter. She's been single for about four months after a LTR. My guard is up a bit and wondering if I should back off until she shows more interest. I initiated our match on Hinge, scheduled the date, and sent the follow-up text today. She has reciprocated each time, though I don't want to come across as too needy.

47,mljflk,1617736747,Do you ever look at an ex &amp; think what was I thinking?,"34f that's how I feel now about an old flame. We were friends first, then we dated for a few months. Not that long. In the short time I dated him he played games &amp; was talking to other girls. He even dropped me for another girl (which he doesn't know I know about) even though he was the one who pursued a relationship with me.

That was over a year ago that that happened. At first it hurt real bad but eventually I got over it &amp; realized I was better off without him &amp; that I could do better &amp; he wasn't really my type. There was a part of me that still wondered about him though.

I got into another relationship soon after but that didn't work out &amp; we broke up towards the end of last year. Last month out of the blue, I contacted this old flame. The one from over a year ago. He was open &amp; seemed happy to talk to me. When we met up he seemed really nervous &amp; he apologized to me for the way he treated me back then. I accepted the apology &amp; said we could be friends. We ended up hooking up though. 

Now I feel like he's upset because I pick up he wants more from me like a serious commitment but my heart just isn't there anymore. I also am not attracted to him like I use to be &amp; he's gained some weight during Covid. He also seems really depressed (more than he usually is) &amp; I feel has let Covid &amp; all the conspiracies get to his head.

He just doesn't seem in a good place &amp; seems he's looking for someone to love him. Also I know he's fickle &amp; so I feel even if I gave him a chance at a relationship again I feel he'd get bored of it soon &amp; his eyes would already be wandering for a new girl &amp; I know for a fact he talks to other exes still but I feel he does feel a genuine connection with me but I just don't see it going past anything casual for me at this point.

Even then I don't feel extremely attracted to him anymore &amp; last time we kissed I realized he's a bad kisser. He also doesn't like to go outside that much either so overall I just don't see us being a good match but I think he's convinced himself we are.

He's very passive aggressive which is annoying &amp; I feel like he's already trying to tell me via social media that he's butt hurt I'm not taking things further with him. I feel like I'm going to have to have talk with him &amp; tell him I don't want anything serious with him because I feel he has a pattern when it comes to dating &amp; I don't see it changing which is the truth.

52,mljolu,1617737431,Shes confused. Strong potential in us. Im going to confess to her this weekend.,"I apologise if this might be too lengthy and I might be a bit all over the place but here goes. I'll put a TL:DR at the end to summarise this whole situation up.


4 months ago I, 26M met her, 27F on Bumble. During one of the deep conversations we had early on in the relationship, we shared the same sentiments that relationships should start off platonically and romance should grow organically. In a sense, this convo created a direction in which how this relationship would be headed.


I am a very reserved and shy guy by nature, I have minimal experience in dating and I have not been in a relationship before. Most of my dates ended up just not working out.


With this whole getting to know each other (platonic) phase of the relationship, I was very cautious to not make too rash or sudden romantic advances as I was afraid of pushing her away, or by going against the start-off-being-platonic sentiments that I had (and which I still believe in). Coupled with my reserved nature, I felt that I didn't dare to make certain advances, in a sense that, only if (in a scenario) when I was given a push, would I then dare to do anything. 


First date though, I gave her a gift for a hobby that she was super passionate about. She thought that was extremely thoughtful. (Shes super into gift giving and acts of service). While she was on her period, I surprised her and gave her a little care package to make her feel better (I did this just because I wanted to make her feel better) and she really really liked that as well. She also surprised me on my birthday by arriving early to a restaurant, putting her card on tab and asking the servers to present a tart that she has baked at the end of the meal and I thought that was really sweet.


However, this relationship was in an awkward phase of a platonic limbo. 4 months into dating (we did all kinds of stuff, mini-golfing/hiking/finding and discovering cafes/amusement parks etc.) but it has always been sort of a hangout sesh more than anything. However, at the end of these dates, we always have a sit-down to talk about the relationship/getting to know and align our thoughts with each other, and thats the highlight of the date for me when we truly get to connect with each other.


After our most recent date, she texted me and asked me how I felt about the relationship. I texted and told her that so far its been great. 


However I had some concerns regarding the relationship:


1. At this stage, I was worried if we were to be in this platonic limbo for far too long, I was worried that it might become stale, and that one day all of this will just be gone and feelings might fade (it was getting to a point of good morning and good night texts, texting throughout the day (quite fun texting actually) and just hanging out as two people with no romantic development).


So I guess I was trying to attain some sense of security from her (which I shouldn't have done as a dude lol) but we wanted to be truthful and honest to each other (since we shared another sentiment that in healthy and good relationships, communication is extremely key). 


2. I also assured her that I was serious about looking for a solid, long-term relationship. I also mentioned that both of us had potential, not potential to be in a r/s yet, but potential to be in a relationship in the future.


From this, she replied saying that she sees that I'm a genuine, sweet and thoughtful guy, and that my thoughtfulness has actually played a key major role in why she wants to hang on to this relationship. She also mentioned that usually, she knows if a r/s works or doesn't work 2 months into it and she would usually break it off with the guy by then, but she mentioned with us, it felt different.


She mentioned that she understands what I meant by how there was potential in us to possibly be in a relationship in the future. But she was not sure if we had the chemistry or if we matched yet. So she was unsure still.


Lastly, she mentioned that she is still confused as to what she wants or what shes looking for in a relationship. And she admits that she herself has been in the backseat regarding romantic advances during our outings. She says she will need some time to think things through.


With this our confessions via text regarding this topic ended.


I was abit saddened by this as I thought there were some sparks during our relationship (from my side anyway) and was sad to hear that it wasn't the case on her end. But the fact that she mentioned that she needs to think things through on what she wanted in a r/s and that she sees the potential in us being together in the future gave me a glimmer of hope.


I also didn't want to leave my confessions as is via text as I felt a lot of emotions could not have been expressed through text. As such, I am inclined (I'm gonna do it actually, have already set up a date with her this week) to talk to her about it and ultimately, confess to her. At least it could provide her some perspective and give her assurances and additional inputs so that she knows where i'm coming from as she think things through.


Heres what I am going to tell her in real life (just a short meetup near where she lives, ill send her home afterwards then ill head home myself):




-START-




*Approach, hands her the foreign candy that she has been dying to try for weeks* I will then ask her if we could sit closely together for this, and I will look her in the eyes for this convo.


""So initially, we shared the same sentiments that relationships should start off platonic and couples should not dive in head-first right? Which we did! However, I feel that our relationship has gotten to a point where it has become far too platonic. And naturally, as a reserved and quiet guy, I would tend to shy away from romantic advances in fear of pushing you away. This actually put our relationship in an awkward state of sort of a platonic limbo, which in turn resulted in nothing happening, it was just the two of us hanging out.""


*I will then proceed to tell her all her good points (mostly personality and also physical appearance) which I find were attractive and which was what I was looking for in a potential partner*


*I will also mention that I am looking for a long-term serious relationship*


""This is me sharing my thoughts on our relationship, because I felt that I didn't properly convey myself properly through text, so this is to remove any ambiguity you might have. I feel there is a huge potential in us, and I really want to work on giving this relationship a chance to blossom into something more. And this is not me giving you any ultimatums or to put you in the spot, but I was wondering if we could get together? *Looks into her eyes and mouth, if no response* And I don't need an answer now I was just telling you how I am feeling currently.""




-END-




With my experience, I guess it raises a few very key points as well as questions about my relationship with her:


1. Are relationships that start off platonic a recipe for failure eapecially for introverted people in a relationship?


2. How do you all feel about this entire relationship. Could it work out in the end? (Some of her friends are rooting for us haha)


3. What do you feel about my approach with the conversation I am having with her this coming weekend? (Any inputs? Thoughts?) I didn't want to put unnecessary stress on her by the way, just wanted to let her know what I am looking for in this relationship (texts really dont convey emotions well)


4. (Important) Any other additional inputs on how I should approach this relationship? (I really feel she's an extremely sweet, mature and sensible person and I would actually genuinely feel a loss if shes gone just like. I want to at least try and not be that person who regrets not trying last time).


5. (Important) She has had 4 past relationships before. Number 1 was safe, slow and steady. The rest had high chemistry but were all toxic. She mentions that our relationship reminds her of ex Number 1, and she feels its Safe and Steady.


TL:DR

She said she didn't want to be in a relationship at the very moment, which I don't either so that's good, but she 100% wanted to be with me in the future apparently.

I feel very very happy, but also lonely for some reason.

We moved in together October of that year. We where really close and he was the clingy type. He always wanted to hold hands, cuddle, and so on. He was a very sweet and loving person. So by the time I got a huge belly he started to distance himself and checking out the same girls on his social media. It made me uncomfortable because at the time I was nothing like the skinny pretty girls, I was swollen and had a huge gut. He only started deleting his search history. May I delivered our beautiful daughter. I spent every living second with her as he played video games right after work but it didn‚Äôt bother me. So mid summer I‚Äôm feeling self conscious because my body has changed a lot and I never had time to do my hair or makeup because I was keeping my house clean and my daughter happy. I found out he was talking to a girl and deleted their messages. It was one of the girls he was always looking up on his social media. I was gonna leave but he swore he‚Äôd never do it again and I wanted to stay with him for my daughter. By December he was working out of town so I got on his computer and found he had made a secret snapchat account with a made up name and made an OF account to purchase private pics from other women. I left him for about three days but ended up getting back with him however we didn‚Äôt live together anymore. I asked him and was very clear I was uncomfortable with him looking at other women like that in general and he agreed to stop. February I randomly asked him one day ‚Äúare you still checking out those same girls?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno I only have eyes for you‚Äù. Two days later I found out he was constantly clicking the link to the same girls OF even after I asked him days before. I was so heartbroken. He has watched me cry and cry over this girl and still continued to do it. He lied to my face multiple times and swore on his dads grave that he wasn‚Äôt. He admitted to it but apologized. I left him and a week later I got back together with him and had him block those girls. I hate our relationship now. I hate a relationship I can‚Äôt trust or believe in. He acts so different now, he gets defensive with everything and snaps at me for little things. He gets upset when I am suspicious about anything and says it‚Äôs annoying I don‚Äôt trust him but I have been trying. I don‚Äôt snoop through his phone anymore, if I have a question I just asked. But every now and then I have bad days where it‚Äôs all I can‚Äôt think about. Like today, the thought of his past just randomly pops up in my head and haunts me.

I'm 31F and I finally deleted my apps recently because it felt really tiring and I was so focused on them that I was neglecting other things in my life, and also a part of me feels like being over that 30 mark (especially as a woman) makes dating apps less useful even though I was still getting plenty of matches. Also tired of hearing ""are you really 31?"" as if it's a compliment. I generally find I do so much better when I meet people in the real world, but before this time I was never fully ready (either was in the one serious relationship I had or was not sure of who I was so I wasn't dating/was celibate)... so the pandemic is a bummer.

68,mlkx0s,1617740840,Why do men ghost after 3 months of talking and sounding like they want to be with you?,"I (28/f) starting talking to this guy (33/m) in January. We really hit it off, but we took it slow due to COVID--we wanted to have an outdoor date to be safe but we live in an area where it was still cold af. So for January we texted.... a lot. Like 5 paragraph texts back and forth almost daily. We had so many things in common, and we really liked each other. Talked about how finding a connection like ours was like finding a needle in a haystack level of liked each other. And as the weather got milder, we stepped up to virtual and in person dates and the connection was still strong; our first virtual date was 8 hours. Our first in person date was 5 hours. We had several sleep overs at his place; physical attraction was definitely there. And he kept upping the sweet and romantic things he said to me. Saying things like I meant so much to him, he couldn't get over how amazing I was, and I reciprocated and did things like made him cookies from scratch  when he was sick. When I went over his place for the last time, it was still great, there weren't any negative signs. In fact, I planned on asking to be exclusive and potentially official when I saw him next.

Then things went south. I got a text the day after I left saying thanks for making him even happier than I normally do. We didn't talk for the next few days, but then I get a ""good morning beautiful, I've missed you"" text. Then silence for 6 days. I sent several texts like I usually would have, and then one just asking if everything was okay because it was strange to not hear from him. He finally got back to me, saying he had an anxiety episode and that he disappeared on everyone, and he wished he could have reached out sooner but he was sorry and he missed me. I thanked him for telling me and thought it was something we could work on together of how to make me a support system when he was feeling that low.

He texted me the next morning. Then I stopped hearing from him again. At first I just sent a light ""How's your day going?"" text a day later, then 3 days of not hearing from him I progressed to a ""I'd love to hear from you just so I know you're okay. We can talk on the phone or hang out in person if that's easier"". Then 5 days of not hearing from him I was really concerned, so I sent a ""I'm worried about you and I like you a lot, but if you need space or you need me to support you in a different way, please let me know because I want to learn how to be here for you."" Still nothing.

Yesterday, Day 7 of no contact from him, I reactivated my dating app (I chose to take it down independently a month and a half into talking to him, his was always up as far as I know), because I can't be with someone who isn't talking to me and was preparing myself for the reality of having to move on. This morning, Day 8 of not hearing from him, I see him active on the app, and he updated his profile. So he looked at other people, but didn't text me back. I texted him to please let me know if he was still interested because I'm into him and deserve that level of respect after being invested in him for 3 months. That was 8 hours ago, and he's said nothing. I'm guessing I'm being ghosted.

So for the past couple of months I‚Äôve been going to a plasma center and donate plasma twice every week, and every time you go in you have to be screen and that takes like 5 minutes. Well every time I go in I mostly always get the same (receptionist I guess?) and she‚Äôs really cute even though I only see half her face due to a mask and her scrubs. I don‚Äôt know her age but she‚Äôs a senior in college so maybe 22/23. Over the months I‚Äôve been getting more comfortable with her and try to fit in a lot of conversation in those 5 minutes while she checks my blood and temperature. I learned that she goes to the same college as me, her major, when her birthday was, etc. Sometimes when I get done with donating and about to walk  out, I take a glimpse over at her and she sees me and smiles and waves bye as I wave back. She also told me as she was getting out of classes she saw me on campus and wanted to say hi but I was walking away in the opposite direction. 

Well my Mom also donates at the plasma center (she just goes on different days than I) and she knows that she‚Äôs my mom due our last name being the same. On Saturday my mom comes back home after donating and says to me that the girl there told her that ‚ÄúYou have a really sweet son, he talks to me every time‚Äù.

77,mlmrb5,1617745745,Is he actually interested in me?!,"Okay so my brain just can't be happy with whats going on and I keep second guessing this so I just need some validation üòÖ

I work at a transport repair shop. There is a big company (for privacy sake I'll just refer to them as Logistics) that parks in our yard and has us do all of their service.

There is a guy (I'll name him Jason) who was driving for them.  Super friendly,  very cute, smart guy. Whenever he brought his transport in, he usually took the time to chat me and one of the techs (let's call him Kyle) up. (Kyle will be important later)

Over time, Jason's visits started getting longer. He usually stuck around for at least half an hour talking to me, sometimes up to an hour. This is what made me start to like him. 

A few months ago, Jason bought his own transport and had been working on it to get up to safety standards so he could drive as an owner operator. A couple weeks ago he stopped in and told me that he was finally set up to drive it and he had given his notice to Logistics. He also booked an appointment for us to put his new tires on it, and inquired about parking in our lot.

When he came in to get his tires installed,  he stayed for almost two hours just talking to me (the appointment did take an hour and a half). At this point I was really starting to like him. But because it was a customer dynamic I wasn't sure how to approach it. He had also asked if we could store his old tires for a few days until he could pick them up (this is important later).

A week later , parking was coming due for the next month (April) and I realized I never got his email address to send him thr invoice. I decided to use this as an opportunity to send him a text and see if anything could materialize from there. I decided it would make sense to wait until the 31st to do that tho. But later that day I noticed neither his transport nor car were parked in our lot.

So he conveniently came in on the 31st before I could text him and he broke the news that his transport broke down and he decided to cut his losses and sell it. He told me he applied to another company and was going to be driving one of their trucks. During this visit, he stayed for maybe half an hour. 

So I decided I was going to send him a friend request on FB. I was being a bit of a chicken about it tho. But then I saw he commented on a public page I follow and I liked his comment.  He then sent me a friend request. That was this past Saturday. 

So on Monday I was talking to Kyle , he's newly single and was talking about dating stuff. So while we were on the topic, I decided to ask his opinion on Jason. Literally all I said was: ""So you know Jason?""

His response: ""did he ask you out??""

Obviously that threw me off guard. I said no, and asked if Jason had mentioned anything. Kyle said that Jason hadn't but there was definitely a 'vibe ' coming from us when he was around. So all day Kyle was on my back to send Jason a message and start conversation. I was too much of a chicken to actually do that.

Conveniently at 4PM I saw Jason pull into our yard. I of course started to panic inside a little bit lol. Kyle later walks in and said Jason was there getting his tires (that I thought were already picked up) and that he was going to come in and pay a bill. Although,  Jason didn't have any bills that he owed us. I argued with Kyle and said he owed us nothing and Kyle said well he's coming in to see me so just let him know. I start to panic more lol

So Jason comes in 'to pay his bills' and I said he owed us nothing.  And he then said he knew, he was just joking.  But he wanted to know if I wanted to go for ice cream with him on Friday.  I of course agreed and Damm near died lmao.  He didn't stick around long tho because two customers came in and I had to take care of them.

Once the customers were gone Kyle walked in and was like 'soooo?' And I asked him what the heck did he say.

He fessed up and said that he asked Jason if he'd be down to go out with me. Jason was apparently surprised by that question but said he would. Then Kyle told him I had a crush on him, and they came up with that plan to come pay a bill ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So while I'm excited,  I'm also nervous that he only asked because Kyle put him on the spot? Kind of.

And today, Jason sent me a message asking if I wanted to reschedule to Thursday instead because it's supposed to rain on Friday and the weather wouldn't be nice.  That conversation was super brief tho. 

My brain is trying to convince that he's just being nice. But I'm trying to tell myself he wouldn't have done that if he didn't actually want to go on a date. Fml. What do you all think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlmrb5/is_he_actually_interested_in_me/

He came back the next night and asked if that following evening worked well, and I said okay no problem even though he hadn‚Äôt asked for my number anything. But then he disappeared...I never ended up hearing from up until three days after the proposed date. He said someone in his family had passed away but he never apologized or offered to plan another date. Instead, he asked me to come to his place...the whole thing was so odd.

83,mlnrkr,1617748456,"She‚Äôs got it pretty rough right now, how much time do I need to give her?","So to keep a long story short: she got back to me a couple days ago following two weeks of silence after she was called away from our first date because her grandad had been rushed to the hospital. I know, sounds bad for the first date to end that way, right? But believe me when I say it was perfect for what it was. We grabbed some dinner at McDonald‚Äôs, found out we had a lot more in common than we thought, shared a few laughs. I even went the extra mile in buying her an Easter egg. Then as we were waiting for someone to pick her up at our local park, I opened up, told her how I felt, she said she felt the same way, just that she needed time to get over her recently ex-boyfriend of five years who‚Äôd cheated on her the month prior, that she didn‚Äôt want that to ruin something that could be perfect between us and we‚Äôll just see where it goes. So we agreed to play the slow game, and after a prolonged first kiss goodbye and exchanging of numbers, we parted ways.

So yeah, nothing of what she‚Äôs going through currently had anything to do with the date, it was just unfortunate timing for us, because there was genuine attraction and she has expressed an interest in making further arrangements in future and joining me in a few movie/game nights once Lockdown is over. So with all that said, I heard back from her the other day, where she apologised for not returning my calls and that she just has a lot going on at the moment, it‚Äôs just a lot for her to even comprehend, but that she hasn‚Äôt forgotten about me and she‚Äôll talk again when she‚Äôs ready emotionally. I texted back almost immediately asking if we could talk about things when everything calms down a bit, and as of yet, she hasn‚Äôt responded, but I‚Äôm thinking communication is one of the things we might have to work on. I told her I was worried because she began skipping work and for all I knew, the last time I heard anything was when she had to rush off to tend to her grandad so I didn‚Äôt know what to think at the time.

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking here is: How much time roughly would I need to give her before trying again with where we left off in the dating side of things, based on what I‚Äôve just described? Because I want to trust that she‚Äôll come to me when she‚Äôs ready, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to let things between us linger more than they have already and it‚Äôs just a tricky situation since whatever‚Äôs happening with her grandad could be quite serious and I don‚Äôt want to seem insensitive towards that factor.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlnrkr/shes_got_it_pretty_rough_right_now_how_much_time/

90,mlp4pk,1617752601,Broke up + Pandemic fatigue,"First time writing. Feel like just letting people know my thoughts. I'm venting.
I broke up with my boyfriend of a year. We had started dating only a few weeks before lockdown. We stayed together through it, in hopes that things would get better. We did meet a few times, but I guess the distance got to us, plus I was losing my mind over graduation, and all the life changes that are going to come with it, and so I ended it.
It was a loving relationship, but I feel like it had run its course somehow, and now we were just holding on for the sake of holding on.
I do feel a bit lonely, even though I ended it, and on good terms. I have an entire life to focus on, but the pandemic fatigue has held on to me like a crutch.
I have a good life, with good people and privileges, I can't deny that.
But everyone is going through their own shit, and I don't want to whine about my tiny problems (hence, I'm here)
I drank waay too much coffee and now I'm here at the break of dawn, writing to strangers.
I guess it'll be hard for me to love again, I know I will do it, but it'll be hard. This is the second time that I have been more involved in the relationship than the guy, which led to me flipping out and losing my mind.
I know relationships require hardwork, I wish I eventually find someone who is willing to that with me, and does not make me question their feelings about me every second day. I just want a sweet boy to hold me (toooo cheesy)
