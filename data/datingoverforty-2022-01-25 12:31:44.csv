6,scuera,1643162729,"I think I met someone I like and now feel awkward and could use your help, Reddit friends!","Okay, I don’t know what I’m posting this for. Advice? What to expect? Other than just “wait and see” because my anxiety doesn’t work like that (hence why I’m posting here, I guess). Also I guess I don’t know the “rules” of dating these essays. 

The next 2 paragraphs are backstory and I know this is long so feel free to skip if you want to get to my point/question. 

Little backstory: got divorced about 2 1/2 years ago. We were together for 13 years. No kids. Decided to up and move somewhere out of state I always wanted to live. Got a great job. Then Covid hit. I knew I didn’t want to jump into the dating pool right away, but a single friend of mine who we had always flirted offer to be a rebound for a month or so which really helped. 

So as lockdown etc is still going on in summer/fall 2020, I decide to try OLD. Met a guy, we got along well from the start, we decided since both of us had been working from home and had no other interactions we would meet up. Hit it off great. Dated for like 3 months. We broke up because he was emotionally unavailable but we are still friends and really enjoy hanging out. Tried a couple more dates in 2020 and they were all nothing I was interested in. Stayed away from even trying all of 2021. Month or so ago decided to try again. Matched with one guy and we hit it off so great talking for like 2 weeks but when we met in person the spark was not there for me. No matter. 

So I guess I’m not usually the one to reach out, “like” whatever (match.com). Last weekend I see this guy, I think he’s hot and I notice his profile is totally the stuff I’m into and not just all pics of skiing and hiking and mad gym shots and “if u wanna know just ask” and all that shit. Divorced with no kids. Love kids just never wanted any of my own and lots of people dating at our age do have kids. So I decide to send him a message. I see he’s read it and checked out my profile and online so I figure ok, he’s not interested, no worries. Next day he messages me back and we spent all day chatting and he asks if I want to meet up for a drink the next day (yesterday). So, we did! It went great it was a little over 2 hours and the moment I walked in he gave me a big hug and there was no silent or awkward moments the whole time. He said he had to go because he had to get up at like 5 for work. We walked out and we got to his car first (I was around the corner) and he said he’d like to do it again if i would (which I said yes), gave me a hug and a kiss which turned into like 4 (pecks, whatever, you know), we leave. He texts me later and says he had fun and was really busy all week but if I had time next week let’s make plans. I said ok. 

All of this seems really positive to me! So you might be wondering what the hell I am going on about. Well, I like him and I feel so awkward. Do I wait for him to call or text me? Should I not worry if he goes silent for a week because he is so busy? Would it seem weird if later this week I just texted him to say hi? I don’t know what to fucking do I’m mid-40s and I feel like when I was dating in my 20s it was still more of a wait for him to call you and if he doesn’t in 2 days or whatever he’s not interested. 

Please fellow daters just help me not crash this before I can see where it will go. I’m not trying to get serious fast or anything like that, but this is the first dude I actually was like, wow, yeah, I want to see more of him and just enjoy his company and see what happens. Also I now don’t really want to talk to multiple dudes/answer messages but should I assume he is talking to multiple women?

10,sd5wn2,1643203463,Am I kidding myself?," If you’ve been on this sub for a while, you’ve probably seen some of my other posts – but I’ll try to provide a brief background anyway:

Started dating May 2020 – Really great connection in all ways, we actually “love” each other – Feb ’21 I was dealing with some neediness issues, we took a 3-week break. I overcame my issues and she’s even said, she hasn’t seen them since. Everything was great again, and we were spending even more time together. Jun ’21 came back from a vacation and she started to get distant. Jul ’21 we broke up. She felt she couldn’t give me what I wanted from a relationship because she has kids still and mine are grown. (Really was never an issue, but she did seem to have an avoidant attachment style). A week later we decide that we can still be friends and hang out – that leads to friends that can hang out and also have sex. (Dating?). 

We start hanging out often and I even spend the night the nights we do have sex. We kiss hello and goodbye. We figure out that maybe we do have a chance, and while unspoken we are basically dating again. We do make a promise to one another that “if there is no chance at a future for us” we’ll let the other know – so they can start dating or whatever. 

Day after Thanksgiving ’21 – She tells me there is no chance for us in the future because she’s not ready to be in a relationship – has too much on her plate – just doesn’t feel that way for me. But we continue the relationship almost exactly the same except – we no longer kiss hello and goodbye, and sleeping over stopped. 

Two weekends ago we end up spending the entire weekend together. I slept over both nights and we had a great weekend. That week we hang out again. 

**Issue/Question:** While she knew I was going to try dating – went on 3 early Dec – none since, not by my choice, OLD sucks for guys. She initially put herself OLD but stopped and she told me she was taking a yr off from dating because she wanted to work on herself. So the other night I saw her on an app. I called her and asked about it, and she claimed it was from before she decided and she couldn’t delete it – I told her I was going to wait to say something, but when she’s ready to date, I’d like an opportunity. She said if we get back together, it would have to happen naturally and she’s not going to push it. I know she’s probably going on dates – but obviously not found someone cause we’re still having sex and hanging out. – **My question is, am I kidding myself that she might consider getting back together with me again?**",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sd5wn2/am_i_kidding_myself/

13,sdbr0d,1643219210,BF visiting Only Fans,"My BF (53) of 7 months has been up front since the beginning that he uses porn to masturbate when we are not together (we see each other 4 nights per week).  I’ve never had a problem with that — he has a VERY high libido.  And I’ve never felt sexier or more cherished.  

BUT I recently learned in a round about way that he has been visiting an Only Fans site for a woman who markets herself as a sexy teacher.  

I see Only Fans interaction as different than passively watching porn—because it is interactive.  So while this may not be actually physically cheating, it feels more like that and I feel very conflicted.  

I can’t tell him to stop — he is a grown man.  But I’m wondering if I should tell him that it bothers me?  I’m still wrapping my head around this … it’s not necessarily a deal killer but …

Also when I found out about this, he lied to me at first, which tells me he knows it is different than passively watching porn.  

(No I did not snoop on his phone or computer.  We share an Instagram account for a side gig and when I was on that account I saw in the notices that it said “your contact [only fans name] is on Instagram.”  I then saw that he followed her with our joint account (mistake) and liked her two (very recent) IG pics with his own account.  When I asked him who she is, he denied knowing and said he hadn’t even looked at her pics and then I said I saw he liked them so he confessed he had looked and apologized for lying … but he claims not to know what an Only Fans account is and I know that’s also not true … not sure how much to push this.)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sdbr0d/bf_visiting_only_fans/

So, this is an update to my (41F) post about getting infected with Covid and having my widower date, 57M, all but faded out when I needed compassion. Well, he returned after I recovered, and we continued dating. His wife died of cancer 6 yrs ago and I'm a divorcee.

Here lies the problem. We text once a day.Typically good morning, good night, and to confirm a date. We've kissed and made out, no sex. It's been 3 months with many dates. I'm not having sex until I'm ready, and he's not pushing. We basically meet, have lots of fun together, and kiss goodbye. No phone calls between dates. I typically feel like we're strangers again each time we meet.

He was very, very enthusiastic during the initial dates, but he's cooled way off. I've tried to initiate more affection, hand holding, etc but I sense he's holding back.

Is it because of the lack of sex??

I don't want to have sex with someone who isn't into me.

She has a 8 year old daughter and the ex is in the picture. They broke up two years ago and said she evolved past him as he wanted her to remain in the home and act like it was the 1950's. Anyhow he also has a son from another marriage, his mom is outta the picture and my gf is kinda like a stepmom for him. Yesterday we had plans to hang out, I go over to her house on Tuesdays. I text her that I'm headed over around 7 and hear nothing. Text her a few more times hear nothing. I'm at her house hanging with her niece and we're both getting worried about her because its not like her to do this, to not communicate, esp with her niece. Finally hear from her 3 hours later, saying they're was a fight between the ex and his son and she was being peacemaker. She was super apologetic about it and said she left her phone in her car. I'm miffed though because me and her niece got left hanging without a text. Feel like she picked the ex over me, the old over the new. Didn't have the consideration to text me and let me know she was gonna be delayed, felt disrespectful. Like there was no consideration for my feelings and I'm just left hanging there. The day before we had an awesome conversation about our burgeoning relationship too. When she got back I said my peace, that it was messed up to do that and to leave me hanging like that. She asked for my forgiveness and said she'd never want to make me feel that way again. Has been super apologetic today as well. But the damage has been done. Am I overthinking this and should I be forgiving, or was that messed up? Should I walk away? It definitely stung. Haven't been feeling good about it since.

That made me wonder. My last stable relationship where I called someone a boyfriend ended in 2017. Then I had a casual dating partner (someone I would meet once a month but monogamously) for about a year till I moved out of the area. After that, I have dated, but nothing really worked out. I often take breaks from dating when it feels exhausting. Right now I am on a break. 

Reading that comment made me wonder if people would think that I am non-committal because I haven't been in a stable relationship for some time. I have never thought of myself like that but maybe it is something to think about? I always say that I am looking for a long-term stable relationship.  

I guess I have two questions: 

What would you tell someone when asked how long have you been single? Is it based on the last stable relationship? Casual partner? 1-2 month dating partner?

Outside of some weird body issues nobody can see, I'm genuinely happy with how I look and always constantly gaining muscle and losing weight.

We are both divorced. She has adult children and mine are minors. 

Our finances are very different. She makes WAY more than I do, plus all my money goes to child support. We have talked extensively about financials and she is fine carrying the financial weight of the relationship. 

This brings me to my question. We have been talking about giving me some control over a small portion of the financials so that I can plan dates and activities or make purchases of things for us without me always having to ask her.

33,se5yfr,1643310421,Self Sabotage and Leaps of Faith,"I don't know how appropriate this title is, but I started wondering to myself if I am a self-sabotager. With dating I seem to be extremely passive, meaning, I really need to have the guy chasing hard in order for me to feel like I want to be in it. Hear me out, it's not an ego thing but a self-aware insecurity. I guess as a woman you always feel like you hear these messages that 'if he wants you, he'll go after you', so for me it's the only way I suppose that I know he really likes me. At least in the beginning. That said, I have started to wonder if this tactic has hindered me. I posted something a while ago - my first reddit post actually - where I had an incident where I left a date because I felt rejected. Most people thought I overreacted. Fast forward to this past weekend I met up with a really great guy and we hit it off. Had a couple drinks, talked a ton, and ended the night with a steamy make out session. He texted me that night to say he had a great time and to make sure I got home ok. That he thought I was very pretty and sexy. Then he texted me the next day to see how my day was going and also to reminisce about the make-out. Granted, a lot of signs pointed to him just wanting to get physical, but I kind of flirted back and left it alone with him texting last.

The next day I unmatched him from Hinge because I really want to date someone who can ask me out after a first date, not just a lazy flirt. Maybe this is okay but then I wondered if it was another overreaction from me. That he initiated the texting and just because he didn't ask me out right away again I unmatched eventhough it had only been a day. Anyways, I was having a good day today and had a couple of great opportunities present themselves (non-dating) so I guess I found myself in a flow - you know the kind where you feel like you can rule the world for a minute? - and decided to text him and let him know while my weekend was busy i'd love to see him again and left it in his court.

34,se8ri0,1643317796,"Resigning myself to being single for the foreseeable future. Giving up, but not jaded.","I think I just need to vent… I apologize in advance for the long read. 

I’m 42 M, and live in northern Alberta…And I swear I live in a city where the people are so damn disingenuous it’s infuriating. I haven’t been on any dating sites in a couple of months, as I feel like it’s the same serial daters that have been on there constantly for years. Granted, I live in a working city that’s about 8:1 men to women. I feel like we live in a “throw away” society. Nobody wants to give anybody a chance anymore. The females around here have the pick of the crop as there’s so many, and are always looking for that “grass is greener on the other side”, constantly. I’ve even had a girl in the middle of a dinner date with me reply to messages on the dating site we met on. 

And honestly I feel like my biggest hurdle is the fact I have a soon to be 5 yr old daughter. I was with her mother for a year, and pregnancy was unplanned, but we rolled with it. She went abusive berserk a couple months after birth, and we split. I have her 50/50 and is obviously my #1 priority. I’ve been told numerous times I’ve got no business trying to date at my age with a young child. 

I’m no underwear model, but I do take care of myself. I’m tall, and yes have a bit of a dad bod, but I’m active and eat healthy(most of the time). I just can’t get anywhere with women. 

The last part is going to sound weird I know, but please be kind. My sex drive/testosterone is unusually high. Like teenager high. I’ve read that’s not supposed to happen, but here I am. I’ve been told by a couple of women now, that’s a turnoff. As in the more I want it, the less my partner does. I’m not a walking hard-on that’s dry-humping everything either. Just enjoy a passionate relationship. 

I’ve had way more bad experiences trying to date than good ones. Apparently being a single father with a young daughter is a huge deal breaker in these parts. And honestly covid has unfortunately turned me into a bit of an introvert. My self esteem has taken a beating over the last couple of years to say the least, so I’ve just resigned myself to being single for the foreseeable future. Just I just wait till my daughter’s older and try again? I’m not unhappy per say, just lonely I guess. Do I have a defeatist attitude?…..maybe. Just all the rejection for things out of my control has me down a but lately. 

It’s still a long day if you don’t laugh, right? Thank you for reading, and take care.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/se8ri0/resigning_myself_to_being_single_for_the/

40,sep7wy,1643371261,Beware Dates Who Decide What You Need,"Lesson from my two most painful Bumble experiences:
Be careful when a date out of the blue starts deciding what you need. This is not the same as them hearing what you need and working with that. 

--------------

First was a man who converted a date-for-relationship into a ONS. I was completely enthralled by this one. On the second date we talk for two hours then go to his place for drinks. After an hour of more conversation he looks at me and says something about how I might need sex as part of my growth right now.

From my point of view, we're still on a date, he's still interested, and he'd like sex with the understanding that it would hold no promises. So we do.

Later that week I get it in retrospect. He never was interested in me long term. He used the talk to dazzle me, and the declaration of my needs as a way to make sex look like him being concerned about me.

---------------

After the first experience, I felt like maybe I did want to be open to casual dating and sex, but with better communication and with better connection, hopefully making for a better experience.

So I change my OLD profile from relationship to ""I don't know.""

----------------

Second was a man who restates my ""I don't know"" to ""casual with connection."" I say it's a fair restatement even though I am still open to a relationship. 

This date is much, much better than the other experience. He's pretty wonderful and, for me, the casual with connection feels like casual with profound connection.

But then in less than 24 hours he's saying I'm great but he needs a relationship and since I'm ""casual with connection"" it can't work.

I want to believe this second guy was less manipulative than the first. But I also think he wanted to clearly define my position before sex so that he could have an excuse after it. I do have a feeling that if I had said I want a relationship, that after sex he would have said he wasn't ready for a relationship.

------------

I'm walking away from these experiences with plenty of information about people and myself. I'm learning.

People can be dazzling and very convincing temporarily. I'm sure I'm stating the obvious when I conclude that anyone can misrepresent themselves over a short time period. Also, talk is cheap.

At my age and stage in life, I'm recognizing that I must have a connection before sex and therefore I need to protect myself more, because it f*ing hurts to build a connection only to have it broken. 

I think I prefer to go much slower, and--like many of you already advise--give myself much more time to get to know someone before I make myself vulnerable to them.

OLD is a rollercoaster because it feels so urgent and that urgency can lead to shallow decisions and experiences. 

It isn't necessarily so, I have met men who are much more old-school and seem intent on getting to know each other well before getting physical. This makes me appreciate them more, especially after my other experiences.

And, these slower men also--so far--take what I say about my needs at face value, and they work with that.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sep7wy/beware_dates_who_decide_what_you_need/

44,sexscr,1643395940,Dating app behaviour question,"I posted before about my Bumble date, where we formed a very fast intense relationship which led to meeting within a week of starting to chat, telling our friend and families we were together, meeting friends and colleagues, and starting a physical relationship on the first night because we had amazing chemistry. A week after we met for the first time, he texted me to end it, saying it was going too fast, for which he took responsibility, thinking he wanted that, but he was spooked and not ready for a relationship. 

Since then we have spoken at length about everything except the relationship - as friends we are great, but his contact has been sporadic and interspersed with days where he doesn't even read my texts, then will text or phone me and talk for hours. He said he wanted to start dating slowly but hasn't actually taken any steps towards making that happen.

I have regretfully decided that although I still have strong feelings for him, I can't cope with the uncertainty and mixed messages. I won't contact him proactively again, and if he contacts me I will tell him I want peace of mind not this anxiety, so I need to stop contact.

My question is, would it be normal for him to have unmatched from me on a dating app if he wanted it to end?

Firstly, I would value any advice as I’m feeling quite sick at the moment…. 

Some background - 
Marriage of 22 years broke down - caught now ex- husband in an affair. 
It’s been two years. 
Met a wonderful guy (also divorced after a long marriage - he was faithful till the end) a year ago. 
We talked every day for a full six months, went for walks, coffees. 
Things went further, it felt like we both fought this as I genuinely belief neither of us were out to rush into anything and it’s weird as hell. 
We have a wonderful relationship, we can talk for hours or just sit in each other’s company and quietness with no uncomfortableness. 
We have amazing sex, like honestly - never felt more alive…

While we are still ‘unsure’ as to this new ‘thing’ we don’t refer to each other as our partner. Even though some of our friends are (and my kids). 

Today we had a little ‘inside’ joke on messages and I said to him all I ask is honesty, if you get bored or want to move on with someone else please be honest and let me know. 
He was shocked at my response and while I then asked for him to let me know his honest thoughts about how I feel… He didn’t respond. 

Am I too sensitive considering  my background and cheating ex husband?

We talk about stuff together in our future. Talking to his family (he always talk about me with them). He said things like he wish he met me earlier in his life and I’ve made him a better person, etc.  

Please help me. I don’t want to ruin this with my insecurities…

We will see each other later and I will talk to him then but will be good to get an outside view. 

Might be relevant to note we are both in our mid forties.

60,sfki5y,1643470496,What happened? We broke (41F 48M)," 

Hi everybody!

A  couples of days ago the woman i dated broke the relationship after 3  months and a half. She is 41 and i'm 48, close to 49 soon.

I  must admit that I caused the breakup because she has been more  uncomfortable than usual for days with her, so I went back to topics  that I knew were sticky for her and that we had talked about the day  before after returning from a weekend at a resort, we had a great time  good.

There were 2 issues in my relationship:

1. We  work at school as teachers. I was new. So we started dating but she  wanted that nobody knows at work that we were dating. Until the end of  our relationshio. She is very traditional, and i'm an urban male. I  don't care what the people thinks about me and my relationships, but for  her it is, and in my country is ver normal that teachers date as  coworkers (when it happens) normally, not as something awkward.
2. She  is very childiss in the intimacy, and very shy for sex and even for  talking about her emotions, mostly if she needs to say something nice or  about love. She isn't rude, but her communications skills in this area  are poor, from my point of view.

Those  things becoming a bigger problem. We had 2-3 first months like a dream,  very passionate, kind, doing things, etc. etc. Classic couple that  communicates very well, talk a lot, etc.

But  it seems like my sense of the relationship was wrong. Week after week,  we live in a small town (we are not from here, we live both in another  city close, surprisely),  sometimes, i felt embarrased. Casue waking  around the town, she want to be invisible, that nobody notice she was  with me.

It's like she wanted to  live in a small capsule with me. I know it sounds weird. I let her,  after some discussions, let this, but i'm a normal guy and i dont like  to hide. Never did it. It was very umcomfortable.

But  i adapted, things goes nice, and so on. But, at the same time, i felt  like she was very good with me. She was happy, she was kind, and so on.  But a little bit,  a few days ago she started to act different.  More  like a Diva. I thought i was giving too much, much than her.

Last  night, after a day with some discussiones about the 1 and 2 point, hide  our relationship and she do things, but never says something ( i told  her i didnt want ""i love you"", but something like i like to be with you,  or i like your eyes) cause i need it to ear that too.

She  said while fighting talking that she felts very pressure, that she  needs more time, and i remember her that the idea of going to live  together in a few months was hers, not mine, but i was agreed. We live  each other in our houses.

So...  Things went wrong and wrong. I said that i can't with that hiding shit,  and she said that she does not want to have a relationship with a  coworker... and i told her how the fuck is that, if we are fucking  DATING 3 months? I dont' want a relationship with a coworker too, isn't  easy, but life is life, what do you mean.

She  also said she felt awkward last weekend when we were in the resort, and  i must be honest saying that i felt that too. We didnt had sex, we were  exhausted for the last 2 weeks, but we were doing nice sports and  sleeping together as usual an being very affectionate with each other.  Next day she send me a message and she told me she had a nice weekend  with me and so on.

So, yes, maybe i  pressure her, but i felt that sex isn't going nice (not only for the  last weekend, i felt like no emotions with her, but i felt too that i  want to stay with her, i thought it was a small crisis), but the fight  getting hot.

I saw a woman i never  seen again. She was saying things to hurt me. She said she is not going  to change and dont want to date me anymore, and in that moment i  thought that was i want too. I was tired of all of that shit, globaly. She told me before that previous guys (she had very few relationships and her last big was when she had 25 years old, other were from 1 year to months, and no more) she shuddenly feels on the top of the rollercoaster and then a few time later, she goes to the bottom and needs to leave the relationship, she told me she feels that and dont know why, but that was happened with me recently these last days. Well, i'm not Brad Pitt, and i'm not the most attractive handsome guy of the world, but i am, haha, so i don't know what happened to this woman with me because i never detected any sign that something goes wrong (cause she hide it, maybe, but... that's not my problem then, it's hers). 

I  answered her rudly too, and she said old issues about us or that she  thought that she NEVER told me before. like she were saving all those  things that worried or disappointed her instead of telling me and  talking about them. Like mature people i think do.

Things ends me leaving her at her house and breaking, i was really angry too and she was like an ice with me.

First time i saw her in that mood. It was shocking.

What i thought (i know i left a lot of info, but i want to do it shortly):

1. She  likes me, but she wants a casual relationship hide with me to keep  doing his private life, sports, etc. etc., but not to invest too much.  BUT IN 2 MONTHS or a bit more THE IDEA OF GOING TO LIVE TOGEHER WAS  HERS, NOT MINE. She started dating with me, she asked for me, she was  looking for dating me, at the beginning i wasn't interested. But she  wants a discreetly relationships cause we had a good position in our  school and she is an ambiitous woman, that i like, and maybe she wants  to hide it. She told me her family was very traditional. But hey, you  can't say in my car that you want to put your glasses on cause some kids  or friend coworkers can see us together. Those things, not everyday,  but every week or 2, was fucking my mind.
2. She  was never in love with me, just with a guy who treats her like a queen  and she was enjoying that and no more. And when she started feeling  less, she was thinking about broke the relationship.
3. She is a very inmature woman emotionally (i think this can be true and also 2 or 3).

So,  yes, i'm not perfect, i invested more than her, and i didnt play mental  seduction games with her that most man know, cause i wanted to have a  natural relationship and see where that goes.

The  las fight was very rude, as ai told, she was trying to hurt me, and i  answered rude too, but never trying to hurt her, but that happened, it  was no control in that moment. I told her that if we are going to be  friends later or at least say goodbye hello at work, but she said: of  course not.

Man, i have a great  personality, i have a lot of character, but i'm not an idiot guy  insulting and those things, i don't need it, i'm more ironic and  sarcastic.

Well, it hurts, cause i  have feelings, but some part of me wanted to break and know im feeling  hurted, not much, but i invested an for another part of me, the brain,  says: she is not for yours, baby, she is not the kind of woman for you.

So,  what do you think. I made mistakes, i push too much maybe, but if she  said she was not going a milimeter (textual words) what she thinks about  not dating a coworker (and were 3 months and a half, it's an hilarious  argument), so there's no debate and negotiation, there's nothing i could  do cause i'm not going to stay with a woman under her rules while she  lives the perfect life privately that she wants.

61,sfl5xd,1643472366,Who is willing to invest in a potential partner as they work on improving themselves while dating?,"Today is the 7 year wedding anniversary of one of my friends. She used to weigh 300 pounds and met her now husband while she was making healthy lifestyle changes. A guy who she went on a date with before meeting her husband is one of my friends and he just told me he wished he gave her a chance because not only is she still beautiful (she was beautiful at 300 pounds) but she has since became so successful in her career that it allowed her husband to go back to school full time to get his masters and PhD (something my friend has been wanting to do but can’t afford to quit work). 

I told him it sounds like he is looking at what she could do for him instead of what he could offer and he said he could have worked out with her like she put in her dating profile, but he wanted the finished product, not the work in progress.

I have stories like this where I was told I would be perfect if I wasn’t overweight by guys who didn’t want to invest in me. Some of them didn’t even have the ability to match me in what I was bringing to the relationship, but I was willing to support their journey to better finances, a more meaningful career, etc and all I wanted was someone to workout with me and who is creative with healthy meals. I’m in a healthy and happy relationship now but I’m curious how many of you have passed up people that you wish you gave a chance and/or invested in? Anyone willing to date someone who is actively working on themselves and support them on that journey or do you all prefer people who have everything together? 

Side note: I understand to some people that despite how beautiful or handsome a person is, if they are overweight or underweight it automatically makes them unattractive so the can’t be with someone like that. Example, one my friends loves Natalie Portman but was instantly turned off when she lost weight for Black Swan. So for people where weight is a deal breaker, another example to use may be bad finances since people can come out of debt with work just like people can change their weight with work).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sfl5xd/who_is_willing_to_invest_in_a_potential_partner/

I was a DJ for 15 years and through my own gigs or with my fellow crew memebers, there was always an event or way to be out and socialise.  Now everyone should be avoiding those situations for awhile and I am home just working on myself or small projects but I miss some social interaction.  Some jokes to share or good conversation or just a movie, TV show or book to watch, read or talk about.  I looked into Hinge and started to sign up but I am not sure what to put.  I don't have many good pictures.   Most pictures are group at night or a dimly room and we are all hamming it up distastefully so I will not put any like that.  I have to have someone take pictures of me.  So they will be staged with me probably standing unnaturally in front of somthing.

I think many of my personal stories to share sound fantastical and fake, my background sounds made up as well but online is the only way I see to meet anyone these days.  We can't travel as freely and I am holding off on booking trips because this modified distancing isn't what I want to travel around the world to see.  

Lastly I got a blue collar job now.  It is different than my first career programming computers and it is not a high paying six figure job.  It is pretty poor paying but I enjoy it.  Younger me would probably say that I have settled and don't work so hard anymore.  I own property and have planned for retirement and have investments, now just trying to enjoy living and exploring the world.

I'm 44m and I have been single for some time. My last serious relationship was in 2014 where that lasted two years with me ending it on bad terms. I've had ""flings"" and been on some dates but that's about it.

I've used online dating on and off with abysmal results.

I take OLD as a definition of insanity and not a place for any relationship.

Now, with that said, I'd like to make a real push to find someone, but...where? Clubs don't interest me (they didn't when I was in my 20s but I went anyway) and neither to bars. I feel like I have no hobbies. Honestly, I feel lost and don't know where to even start to find someone, not for the relationship aspect, but for just someone to go do something with that is the opposite sex.

We met up for dinner and the first part was delightful, our banter continued and then relationship stuff came up. I asked her what she was looking for and she proceeds to tell me what she's not looking for and what ended some of her other relationships. She went on to list out specific details or traits that turned her off. One ex did a lot of social media content, posting Instagram stories, tiktoks etc., another guy worried her because of his financial situation being so precarious, and another ex seeming like he needed my date's intervention to fix his problems, and one more item was that an ex annoyed her by wanting to be included in her friend outings. After going into each of these she says ""maybe I don't want to be in a relationship at all. What do you think? Why should I be in a relationship?""

I was taken off guard and I redirected her into telling me about her upbringing. It was traumatic, she grew up poor with a father who was in and out of prison—she provides for his elder care now that he has Alzheimer's. From what she told me about her past, it made sense how she viewed and prioritized her security,—there's nothing wrong with it but it does show that she has unresolved trauma and attachment issues, from what I could tell. I asked her if she knew anything about attachment theory, she deflected and proceeded to go on. At that point it felt like more of a rant than relating her experience.

By the end of my date, I felt like this wasn't the right fit and that we both view relationships with very different lenses and I told her as much after the date. I was bummed but I felt like it was the right choice.

I'm no therapist, however, I've also had to confront my own unresolved trauma and attachment issues and perhaps I'm projecting but hearing what I heard resonated so much. It also illuminated the fact I've learned so much about myself in trying to come to terms with my own stuff. I've also had some of the same fears around security (emotional and financial), so I can understand where my date was coming from, it just sounded like she wasn't ready to let her guard down yet.

We are living in an era of a syphillis resurgence.
And half a billion people in the world are living with genitals herpes.

Yet, pretty much every time I’ve started seeing a new person (men in their 30’s and 40’s), they try to have unprotected sex with me the first time. When I’ve asked for protection they’ve complained about how much they hate them, they try to convince me they’re clean and they’ve been tested recently, or they say they’ve had the snip so don’t worry.

It worries me that they are so quick to try to have unprotected sex when they don’t know my history. They don’t even ask.
If they’re doing that with me how many other people are they doing it with?

And what about pregnancy? Most of the time they don’t even ask if I’m on birth control. I suppose they don’t care because it’s not their problem- I’m the one that would have to go get the morning after pill or an abortion.
They can just fuck and forget!

If I sound angry it’s because it’s happened one too many times and last night I met with someone who intentionally tried to manipulate me into unprotected sex and then accused me of being ridiculous and paranoid for wanting to leave. 
I got away from him without having sex but he made me feel ashamed and dirty just for being put in that situation.

So, soon after my above post, I decided I would relax and consider myself lucky that a 55yo guy like me, with a dad bod and flat ass, is even date-able :D  Anyway, on the next date we grabbed dinner and I asked her where she felt we were at now and where we were maybe going. I told her before she answered that I was just seeking information, no agenda or subtext. 

And would ya look at that, on the other side of the table was a human being with the same concerns, thoughts, and fears. She wasn't sure how she was coming across either but she decided it would be better to 'show interest when you're interested, even if that means you might spook the other person.' I admired that. 

Since then, things are progressing and we're talking. The sex has heated up (she's got zero inhibitions). Money isn't a problem for her; she once co-owned a bar and banked the proceeds when her partner bought her out. And yeah her feelings are stronger than mine probably, but we've agreed to keep the communication lines open.

I really would like the option to have biological kids in the future, and so you can probably guess where this was going. 38 is fine for kids from everything I've read about the subject, but to be fair we're not having kids on the first date. By my rough math, even if we hit it off, dated, got married, tried to have kids, etc. I'd likely have to add something like 1.5 years or so and considering she's likely 38 and some months, we're basically looking at 40+. (And this would be a first kid after 40 - I believe there may be a difference with a woman who has had a first child earlier and then subsequent children after 40).

So I have a dilemma on how to proceed since I would have gone all in if she was 36 like I first thought, but now I am more uncertain.

Just to head off some potential comments:

1) She actually brought up future kids herself in a casual way, and more or less said that she was on the fence but would be for it if she met the right guy - (so this isn't just me pushing my wanting of kids onto her)

2) I realize a woman can have kids after 40 and it happens all the time etc., especially with IVF/other technologies - and so I mean no disrespect to women on this sub in their late 30s that want to have kids - but it cannot be denied that probabilities/complications etc. change around 40 and we might be setting up for a rocky road - i.e. maybe it would be better for me to nip it in the bud and try to stay friends, especially since I can still date younger women (I do not mean that in a sexist way, it is just that in theory I could still potentially find someone I click with who is in her early to mid 30s - although this has been really hard, which is one of the reasons why I was so excited about meeting this woman).

3) I realize my 1.5 year thing sounds coldly mathematical - the younger me would never do this -- but I'm only doing this ""calculation"" because I like her so much as a person and get along with her so well that I see her as long term, and so I am fast forwarding a little into the future since she just so happens to be in that borderline window. I really like every other aspect of her - but since I am looking for that family life/kids scenario, I feel like I have to factor this aspect in and I'd rather think this through before I get too deep with her and potentially waste her time, and that involves this math.

4) You can always adopt etc. if it doesn't work out. Adoption is a beautiful thing, but I would really like to try to have biological kids.

5) There are other factors other than age involved - like a scenario where I meet a 30 year old who wants kids, we fall in love, but I find out later that she can't physically have kids. If I was in that scenario, it would suck, but I'd know we did all we could have done within our control and it is basically an act of god so to speak, and we'd deal the best way we could and move on based on our shared love. But isn't a way I could have necessarily known that would happen in advance in that scenario - whereas here, knowledge of the woman's age is the only factor I know in advance and can control by either dating her or not.

So I know this was a ramble, but curious to hear how others might proceed in this situation - thank you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sgnlcx/dilemma_about_meeting_a_woman_on_the_older_side/
91,sgp45x,1643593971,Brainiac Tendencies,"Hi! I’m a few years shy of forty, but this question is posed to you males who are actively dating and in your 40s. There’s this guy (isn’t there always). He’s wonderful. The best guy in every way. We have been friends for quite some time. We have recently been kicking around the idea of progressing the relationship. We align in several ways…..except in the land of intelligence. This man is off the charts. In the sense that sometimes it is often unrelatable. Perhaps I should qualify the level of intelligence. He has a reference for almost any topic, and it doesn’t stop at reference. He can dive down the wormhole in a moments notice. The man is literally a walking encyclopedia. To be honest, I struggle with this. I’m not uneducated, but I don’t have the depth he does. Sometimes during the conversations, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but I don’t want to voice that because I never want him to turn it off. It is a part of who he is, he shouldn’t shroud that, and I love him for it. He is enamored with learning. I also feel though, I might not be compatible with him for this reason. Which breaks my heart quite frankly. I want him to find the most amazing woman who can vibe with him on his level, and I’m not sure I’m her. It is ultimately his decision, I’m just not sure what to do/say, if anything, about the matter. What are your thoughts?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sgp45x/brainiac_tendencies/
92,sgpyr6,1643596436,Feelings for FWB but he is seeing someone else,"I met someone great about 7 months ago, we really clicked. We talked early on about expectations, neither of us ready for a commitment but also not opposed if it evolves. We were both dating casually and I want to be clear I was seeing someone else when we met which he knew about. I broke it off and never concealed anything. He never disclosed he was seeing anyone else until recently, I don't think he was. 

Basically we are FWB, we have really great sex but we now also go on dates and we talk every day. We have a lot in common and we are genuinely good friends. I stay over a couple of time a week, I'll drop by a few more times also for coffee or dinner, to watch a show. We don't often go more than a day or so without seeing each other since before Christmas. My place is shared so I normally go to his.

I felt like things had naturally evolved over time, our time became much less about just having sex but more relationship oriented. It was never purely sex, we'd talk a lot and cuddle, share meals or whatever. I never felt used before this incident. He holds my hand when we sleep, we watch multiple shows together, we cook, we plan for future events together eg: buying tickets for shows well in advance. I looked after him recently when he was sick, I'll get groceries for him when I shop for myself, we help each other if needed, talk issues through etc.

He can sometimes be a little withdrawn and seems to need some space at times, so I respect that and wait for him to ask me over again. I just say like ''Ok, I will miss you"", I never display any disappointment if I say I want to hang out and he says no, or overstep by assuming anything - I always say do you want me to stay over before I go there etc. If he says no, I say cool and I'll leave if he asks me to - usually he says he needs to get to bed. I never feel it's one sided, he will always ask me to come over and says he misses me, he's affectionate and caring.

Basically he has been treating me like a girlfriend for a few months now so imagine my surprise when he says he reconnected with an ex and he thinks he's in love with her. My heart just froze. I was speechless. I mumbled oh...that sounds a bit complicated, good luck, and I left shortly afterwards. We didn't talk about it immediately.

I felt like such a fool. I examined everything again to figure out was I crazy, did I imagine this feeling of being more than just a convenient f#@k or what...at first I concluded I did assume when I should have just asked and I was mortified. What a moron! I wanted to crawl into the earth and disappear forever. I thought of the times he was on the phone texting while I laid in his bed beside him and wondered was he talking to her when it had never occurred to me he might be before now. I was gutted, literally so humiliated. I don't know how to explain it really. I guess I did assume incorrectly and the realisation was a big shock.

I decided to tell him I felt hurt and went over to talk so I could get some answers. When we talked it all though and he was saying how much he loves being with her and how grateful she was to me for taking care of him whenever she couldn't...I just saw red. I lost it and I cried my heart out. I just felt so used and I couldn't understand. He said he was always open and he thought I knew where he stood from the start, he was clear he didn't want a relationship - that is true but I am certain he never said he was seeing someone else. 

She knew all about me (which honestly made me super self conscious and uncomfortable) but I never had an inkling about their relationship all though he did talk about her, but never as someone he was seeing - just his ex he had run into recently (around the time we started to feel more serious actually) and that they'd had lunch or hung out. I never realised these were dates, he always calls her like "" *name* you know, my ex"". He told me she's married but it's open and she's invited him in. He took her up on it and he wanted to  inform me, but recognises now his execution of this revelation was possibly inadequate and insentive. 

Honestly I don't know what to think. I know I should immediately walk away but he says he doesn't want to lose me. I don't think I could ever be happy in this kind of situation, but I really have feelings for him despite everything. I don't want to lose him either, I'm heartbroken just contemplating it. He's adamant he was clear he didn't want a relationship with me and it is true he's never ever said that - but for me it was implied in his actions. I don't want really don't think I made it up. I asked for a proper discussion when things (me) cool off a bit and he agreed.

However it's been a few weeks and no discussion. We carried on like nothing happened but for me I'm feeling resentment and rejection a lot. It's not good for me. I want to confront him and be firm that I want to talk this over properly. 

I don't know where I stand anymore. He thinks he loves her but he says he doesn't want to lose me? We're not in a relationship as he says, and won't ever be - but he wants to keep on as we are, which feels like a relationship to me? I guess we are still FWB but I don't feel like that about him anymore. I care for him a lot, I think about him all the time and look forward to being together. I have told him this over and over. I do suddenly feel used by him, like he had sex with me then immediately had to text her.

I am now just comparing myself to her all the time ( I haven't met her) and wondering constantly why I am not enough for him and what I could do better. It's honestly eating me up inside. I know it's not healthy but I can't seem to stop. 

I know I need to ask him these questions and I will but I'm just trying to get my head around things and wanted to ask some advice first - where do I even start to discuss this? Should I just break it off before I get even more hurt?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sgpyr6/feelings_for_fwb_but_he_is_seeing_someone_else/
93,sgrgxf,1643600890,"Why dating in 40s not a spontaneous affair, how to navigate through it","I have been trying online dating for few weeks now. Last I dated was more than 12 years back. Due to some twisted fate I have become single again. I know and understand the pitfalls of online dating. Pretty much most of the profiles are fake or does not describe the real person behind it. More often that not it is filled with married people trying to escape the rut of that life. 

I know that matches will be very rare and they are indeed. Many times even after a match the conversation does not go anywhere. However once in blue moon you do get matched and try to build a relationship in real life. 

So far for me this seems so forced. It feels that other person is not into you even if you are trying to show interest. I remember last I dated, we were so spontaneous and into each other. We used to stay in different parts of the city but just needed any excuse to be together. It was so fun.

I understand in 40s we have responsibilities, like I have 2 young daughters, same is with almost everyone, trying to juggle job, kids and aging parents to take time for dating. However if you put yourself out in dating world I assume you have figured this out and are making yourself available to that other person. Many times you end up exchanging endless text to just make some evening available and then it is cancelled. Then there is a radio silence for few days and you again repeat the same. All this is no fun, Where is that spontaneity?

Will it be like this only in 40s or will it be different with the right person. I know dating in 40s would be different but how different it is from when we were in our late 20s to early 30s. What exactly are we suppose to expect and accept when dating in our 40s?

95,sgte32,1643606882,Was recently broken up with mostly due to my mental illness. Feeling like I should just give up dating entirely.,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder. For the most part I've grown out of a lot of the symptoms most people with bpd have. To the point where my therapist said I just have ""borderline traits"" 

A couple of weeks ago marked the two year anniversary of the end of a relationship that I thought was going to be my last. I really thought I had found my person. I had a bout of depression and wasn't able to find work so he kicked me and my two kids out of his place (he wasn't their father)

I took it hard and ended up having to spend some time in the mental health ward. 

I recovered, but the ""anniversary"" of the break up makes me very anxious and fearful still. 

I had explained my bpd and the fear of the anniversary to the guy I was seeing and he seemed to understand and sympathise with what I was going through. 

With the stress of Christmas and also my kids birthdays being right around Christmas and New Year, I was really starting to become fearful again. I was also getting paranoid and jealous of my ex and his relationship with his ex wife. I realise now it was all due to the anxiety I was feeling. 

I really screwed up. I began to spiral and couldn't get out of it. I would send him hurtful messages and immediately regret doing it. But it was like having an outer body experience. I knew what I was doing was going to ruin things, but I couldn't stop. 

The morning before the ""anniversary"" I woke up to a text message from him saying it was over. That he couldn't take it anymore. I lost it. I became frantic. It was the same thing all over again. At least we weren't living together, so I wasn't about to become homeless, but the rejection and pain was all the same. 

I called non stop because I had to ""fix things"" it was messy and ended with me attempting suicide and ending up in hospital. 

I still have feelings for him and I wish he would talk to me. Not to get back together, but to talk to me while I'm no longer in that fucked up mental state. I'm blocked by him everywhere. And I can understand why. 

Should I just give up? I'm talking to my therapist about how turbulent my relationships are and she's going to try and help me. But sometimes I feel like it's better for myself to just be alone. I can't hurt anyone that way. But I also want to love and be loved. 

Thank you if you made it all the way through this. Apologies if I've made any spelling errors. 

TL;DR - I suffer from a mental illness that makes relationships turbulent. Should I just accept that I'll be forever alone?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sgte32/was_recently_broken_up_with_mostly_due_to_my/

98,sh3tri,1643642902,"Plenty of Options, but Sparce on Time","I'm (M, 45) not sure how many guys in here are single dads with primary custody of their kids, but that is my life situation. At present I only have one set night every other week where my kids are not with me overnight. My issue right now is figuring out how to prioritize from a pool of prospects for dates. Thanks to what is likely a result of ""cuffing"" season, I have around 5 women I've matched with via online dating in the last week or two, and two I'd say have my primary attention since we've met in person. One woman, I've been out with twice, we had sex both times, and I think in the end we are just FWB material to each other. The other I think is high-value, but we've had one date--which went well. We kissed too. The other 3 are new but seem interesting in their own right, and their interest level is there. 

As I approach my one night off I get this weekend, I asked the ""high-value"" woman what her plans looked like this coming weekend, a few days ago. Her answer was uncertainty. Her grandmother's 93rd birthday is this coming weekend and she's not sure when they are celebrating it. ""I should be able to do something Saturday night. I think the party is Sunday.""

She's been in contact with me just about each day since this response, and I still have not got a FIRM answer yet. I'm curious if I should ask a follow-up, or just go ahead and make plans with someone else since, at this point, she's had a good 3 days to figure her plans out? I'm leaning towards the latter, as much as I like her. I stopped things a month ago with a woman who would give similar answers whenever I'd ask her out (though 9 times out of 10, we would get together and have a great time). I just never felt there was a mutual effort on her part. In a way, I want to make it clear my time is valuable, which I never did with the previous woman.

The reason why I did not have children before was because I was in a long-term relationship in my 30s, and without being specific, it was abusive.
