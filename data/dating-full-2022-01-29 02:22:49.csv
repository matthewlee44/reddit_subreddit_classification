I‚Äôm 2019 I met a guy and we started texting a lot. Anyways we ended up dating for two years. 
He is 25 and I am 20. We love each other so much. 
His family was so supportive. I‚Äôve never met them. But he told me all the time of how happy they are. He told them he wanted to marry me. That I‚Äôm the girl he wants. 

Problem was that my parents have always been very strict about dating. Every time something came up with a guy they would cut it off straight away. 
I was open and honest to my parents about him. I said there is a guy I like and we both want to start dating. I showed a picture and they put him some straight away and helming me I have to cut it off straight away and let him go. 
I didn‚Äôt do that. I told him what happened and he said he wants to keep going as well. 

My mum and I have a weird relationship. Sometimes we are close sometimes we aren‚Äôt. We‚Äôve had quite a past. She hit me a lot and blackmailed me, threatening me. Even with a knife quite a few times. 
She still slaps me and treats me like I‚Äôm 5. I‚Äôve told him this and many other things so he understands how things run at home. 

Of course he got confused because I post alot of my and my mum. Yes we have fun and she‚Äôs super cool but just as you get older you see things much clearer and certain tactics being used. 

Anyways, my‚Äù two best friends ‚Äú helped me with this but turned out they have been lying to me alot as well. They encouraged me to move out and just live my life. I was planning to do that. 

But then it came about about me and my boyfriend. My parents were super upset about it all and how I talked about them to him. 

Anyways they decided to go meet him without me there and his parents and showed all the text messages between me and my friends - us talking about my parents. 

They basically told him how when I was you her I chased after boys and they took me out of school for that. They said they never saw a picture of him and barely knew about him and that everything I said about them was a lie.

In freshman year I actively avoided liking any one because I felt like (and still feel like) I know the answer to question if were to tell my how I feel answer is no (and It will always be no). so I just quit even pursuing it even If I like the person and plus I don‚Äôt want make them uncomfortable if it‚Äôs not mutual because women have deal with the thought ‚Äúthis guy might kill me‚Äù. 

During sophomore year the 1st wave of Covid hit and the quarantine started. During spring of 2020 I saw the attacks on Asian Americans and became frustrated by ignorance and racism of Americans (especially black Americans or any other minority) thinking every Asian is Chinese and thinking if someone is Chinese they have Covid-19(which stupid btw ).

During summer time of 2020 I started watching South Korean streamers even though I was more accustomed to USA / UK streamers but this part of twitch was interesting and new and I did not know much about South Korea. My brother gave me two copies of the Genki textbook because he and his friend owned a channel where the spoke to people public places to practice. Also during this time I fixed my politics because I saw how my people were being treated by law enforcement and I became more self conscious about my actions and how awful I am for being oblivious to certain issues and subconsciously holding misconceptions to sexual minorities, and I felt like I corrected most of them during rest of first wave but I started to hate myself when discovering I might have an ( oh god I hate typing this) ‚Äú preference to Asian women‚Äù or ‚Äúyellow fever‚Äù this was a reaction to Asian American women YouTubers, Redditers, and journalist describing this behavior (reasonably so) as dehumanizing and how historically rooted it is in the west. And after when they were describing common behavior that they exhibit I realized that that fit in this umbrella because I watched anime, study an Asian language And follow on Instagram and twitch I followed to mostly to East Asian women from twitch. After realizing this I started building up (I think deserved) amount of self hatred for liking asian women and of course jumped to if you like an Asian women your a yellow fever creep which straw man of what message that was being given. 
This become a more serious problem when the Atlanta shootings happened. I felt (maybe unreasonably so) like I was as horrible as the monster that killed those women. When came back to school after quarantine I had crush on two girls but I hated myself for it because they were both Asian Americans. I avoid running into them because or being in place where one girl would be. I do similar things with non-asian not liking them or not like avoiding looking or even glancing at them because that would be creepy (I think), walking directly behind a girl in the hallway example when we have switch classes after the bell and I even think having crush is creepy. So basically following same formula but only difference is that I hate myself for it and 
I‚Äôm convinced that deserve to hate myself and I deserve to rot in isolation for exhibiting this.

Honestly dating as a black woman sucks!! All my white friends are getting married and literally all of my black friends are single. I am a pretty woman, I think (at least I am told that) but every person I have met only wants to be a FWB. Also add to the fact that I am a software engineer and have 2 other side hustles (that I mainly do for fun) altogether I make \~220k a year, so I think some men are intimidated by me??

 The black men I meet are not even close to my level mentally or financially, the successful ones I meet do not date black women. There is this one black guy (23 yo cutie lol) that lives in my apartment complex, he is an engineer too, and after I had been celibate for a year we essentially started hooking up. We have both been clear that this is temporary and he even helps me look for potential guys. Bless his heart :-)

The white guys I meet view me as easy sex. Its so infuriating. Idk what else I am missing, I will attach a picture I have on my dating profile to see if you guys can give any tips. I could probably lose some more weight maybe.

I know her name and I‚Äôve tried to see if I could get some more info on her (bc who doesn‚Äôt do that nowadays) through social media. All accounts are private so I really didn‚Äôt glean much from her‚Ä¶
As it turns out, her mother still has the post up with the photos from the engagement. It was actually really sweet, they went on a walk on the beach together around sunset, and as they came back to the house he got down in one knee and popper the question. His face is so full of joy and love, and she looks so happy too. There‚Äôs one picture where they both look like they‚Äôre on the verge of (happy) tears and it is such a sweet moment. Their families were waiting for them on the upstairs porch and watched the whole thing while the photographers secretly captured the event from the side porch and in the bushes I assume. Truly, truly gorgeous photos with a brilliant sunset and honestly a precious couple. 

It‚Äôs just heartbreaking to know that it didn‚Äôt work out, mainly because they got engaged fairly soon after they started dating (3 months to be precise); this was only because his parents got engaged that soon and they are happily married to this day. My BF said he and his ex-fianc√© ‚Äúthought they were in love‚Äù but they were just in love with being wanted by another person. I guess they didn‚Äôt realize that until after they got engaged. Anyway, he called off the wedding two weeks before it was supposed to happen, and I can‚Äôt imagine how devastating that was for her - I know he was torn up about making that decision because he told me all about it (and I got collateral from his sister) and said it was hard for her too. Such a gorgeous couple and a sweet, life-changing moment captured in these pictures‚Ä¶ Why would her mom keep them up on social media though? If that was me, I would be so gutted by the whole thing I would never want to see any evidence of it ever again‚Ä¶

And as a side note, the ex-fianc√© has an IG account all about the puppy they got together while they were engaged - I knew they had a puppy, and his sister showed me the account about the puppy so I could see part of the reason why he was so torn up about ending the engagement (she kept the puppy).

Honestly.. I'm happy, but sad. If that makes sense. But I feel immense guilt for leaving. I am fast to fall for people. I have BPD, so the feelings are intense even online. We had a long distance relationship, Sweden-England. And the plan was of course to meet this year. Like, hopefully pretty close to the beginning of the year, too. Like February. We only dated for 2 months and... 12 days. But it felt like a lifetime at one point. When we did connect, it felt amazing. But I realized more and more that I gave way more than I got back from him. I gave so much of myself to him, he knew me on such a deep level. And I was open to share most of my life with him. All my baggage, my background, my traumas. My every day life. I told him whenever I was going somewhere, when I would be back and everything. (He almost never talked about what was happening in his every day life.) And I mean, he was supposedly open to listening to me talk about my life, but I did not receive what I needed in the form of feedback or comfort when feedback or comfort was expected. I could go days wondering what was going on in his life, because some days he would just write like \~7 words to me all day. While I would maybe write at least 14 messages with lots of sentences per message. I know it sounds excessive. But 1 day is 12 hours. That's not a lot of time spent on someone you supposedly ""love"" and call your partner.  


I guess I should have seen some warning signs, like him telling me he loved me after 3 weeks. I mean, I felt the same way (or so I thought), but it was still way too early, even for me to say it. And now it feels really weird. Creating and fantasizing about a future with someone I really barely know. I know some stuff. But not a lot. And his defense is that he's a private person. But yeah, that defense didn't cut it for me this time, even though I understand it from a rational standpoint. I can't be with someone who doesn't share as much as I do. Which is why I ended it, I think. I felt unseen. I felt alone. Lonely. Forgotten at times. And like all that mattered was his life and me supporting him. And never the other way around. When we had fights, he always offered to leave if I wanted him to. Which was weird, that he always went there. He always constantly said that I deserved better. And in the end, he was right.  


Long story short.. I am proud of myself for choosing myself. Choosing to love myself and ""date"" myself now finally. I've had these thoughts for a while but I've just not been ready. I've been so afraid of the loneliness. But I am so done with dating for a while now. Done with sex, done with people, done with making out whilst drunk, done with being hypersexual (thanks BPD....). Yeah, no. I'm just gonna love myself for a while and see what happens. I am realizing that I was probably rebounding from my abusive ex fianc√©. And maybe I'm finally ready to heal now..

I (29) have been dating this woman (26) four times now and up until now I thought things were going rather great. Although I lack quite a lot of experience (which shows itself mostly in my terrible kissing) I have overcome my shyness and became a little physical in a non-sexual way with her (putting my arm around her hip, taking her hand into mine, etc). I have usually taken her out for dinner, but this Friday I decided to cook for us. We opened a bottle of wine that I was dying to share with someone and she brought over some gin and tonic. 
We ate, chatted and had a good time overall. Afterwards we watched an episode of a show together and I hold her. However, pretty early into the evening (roughly 2,5 hours) she told me she needs to get going, as her Ex boyfriend is sick and asked her to bring over food and some Asperin. Now, since I'm not about to tell her how to spend her time, I give her some terrible kisses and see her off, however, not before asking her if she wants to finish the series with me next week, to which she agreed.

Now her interrupting our evening together to bring her Ex food and medicine weirds me out quite a bit. It could just be that she is the caring sort (both her and her Ex are doctors..), but what if they are in fact not over each other (even though she told me they are)? I mean her Ex is a grown man and I would imagine that he can take care of himself.

At the same time I cannot image that I am just entertainment on the side for her, as we haven't been sexual so far. I really feel like we mesh well, she is attractive as hell and I want to spend much more time with her, but her always leaving quite a bit earlier than I would want and now the thing with her Ex, makes me question whether she feels the same way about me.

I recently got out of a relationship 14 days back. 18 days back I started talking to a girl (A). we clicked instantly. We have the same hobbies, ideas etc. she is the type I could keep chatting to for hours and not get bored.

We met twice. The first time we just walked around and chatted a little.

The second time we went trekking and walked around. We chatted for almost 3 hours and it got pretty intense.

So she has a fwb and theyre pretty close. Though they don‚Äôt love each other or want a relationship with each other, they still goof around. She had a fight with him and during our second meet she was talking about their fight and cried a little.

Im better looking than that guy imo. I think both A and me are in the same league.

Now the thing is I think she is pretty friendly with guys and pretty chill too so idk if shes giving me hints or not.

After the second meet, I just cant stop thinking about her. Now I would have asked her out but I think she would be a really really good friend too. So I don‚Äôt wanna ruin it without guarantee of success.

I've done foreplay and making out before, but I'm a virgin and have never had a proper girlfriend.

I NEED SOMETHING. I don't need to get laid or meet my soulmate by tomorrow. I just want SOMETHING, SOME interaction with the opposite gender. Even if it's just some making out or dirty dancing at the bar. Or being able to flirt with a woman. Better yet would be cuddles or a date

In 2021, I made out with a few women, and got two really good dates, but typically some BS happened where I lost interest in them or they lost interest in me. I have even been offered sex, but I don't want to lose my virginity to some random hookup.

I haven't masturbated in over a month, because I'm kind of over it and it doesn't feel good anymore.

I had an FWB that I was talking on and off with for three years, and we met up twice. I asked her out on a proper date last week because I've always liked her, to which she agreed but then bailed on me at the last minute. I asked to reschedule, to which she basically decided to be brutally honest with me and said that she's too busy with her new beauty business and doesn't have time to date. So, this has made me feel really depressed and down these past couple of days.

I'm on a lot of dating apps, but I've pretty much swiped through every single person within 20 miles of where I live. There was this one really sexy woman (a solid 10/10) that I was talking to who wanted something casual, but I didn't text frequently enough and she stopped responding.

So... I have only three options. I can go to bars, which I will do tomorrow, I can flirt with women on Whisper, or I can see a prostitute for some cuddles and a massage. (I wouldn't even want sex from her. Just some connection and physical contact from a woman.)

But flirting with women on Whisper is cheap, and there are a lot of problems with hiring a prostitute, the main one being that my self-esteem would probably take a serious hit if I did. But the more lonely I feel, the more tempting it becomes.

At that moment, it confirmed that my suspicion of his tone was true and he probably thought I was sleeping.

I texted him back &amp; said I‚Äôm done and pay me my money back on Monday. To be honest, I did agree to let him borrow $500 today. 

However, after he continued playing video games without even stopping to check up on me and replying with ‚Äúw.e dude‚Äù after breaking up with him, I decided to just take the money I had let him borrow &amp; call an Uber.

Anyway, I‚Äôm 23M and I recently moved to a new town to start graduate school. After a series of tragic life events that could rival the backstory of Heinz Doofenshmirtz, I had decided to take a roughly year long break from dating. It wasn‚Äôt some super enlightening period of my life where I learned a lot about myself, I just worked two jobs and got some general life stuff figured out. 

When I moved in to my new place I decided to try my luck on Tinder again. Why not? Grad school is a new chapter of my life, and I felt like I was ready to roll the dice with dating again. 

A couple days later I matched with an adorable 22F graduate student in a similar field to mine. We talked for a couple days and I asked for her number and agreed to go get coffee in the next week. 

I was pretty nervous to meet her as I haven‚Äôt done a lot besides work in the past year, so I was worried I‚Äôd be socially rusty. 

Turns out I was dead wrong and we clicked instantly. She literally personifies everything I find attractive. Academically hardworking, awesome sense of humor, similar world views, backgrounds and interests. Oh and a laugh that just fills a room. 

Over the next few weeks we went on several dates and have agreed to the boyfriend / girlfriend label. It‚Äôs been difficult to mask how hard I‚Äôve fallen for this girl but goddamnit it feels right. 

Since then, we‚Äôve communicated (another not insignificant green flag) our needs and wants relationship-wise. I.e. love languages and regularity of communication throughout the day. Again we clicked with this stuff too which is a big deal. At least it is to me.

Hi everyone!

So basically I (23m) finished working at my job yesterday. There was this girl (27f) with whom I went along really (really) well. Lots of people thought we were dating, meaning that, she was not speaking to me like to other men. 

We went on a date 3 months ago (I asked) and when planning the second one (She primarily said yes)  she suddenly backed down saying that she was in a complicated situation, with a recent breakup and an ex-boyfriend that she was still kinda seeing/ had difficulties forgetting. She didn't feel single at the time, which is normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

The time has passed and I never dared to ask her how her situation was evolving (I know I know...). But now that I am pretty sure I won't see her soon I want to know and hopefully go on this second date. But I don't know what and how I should be telling her this (It will be by text...). I am not afraid of rejection but afraid of sounding like a jerk or someone just wanting to get into her pants.

We still haven't had sex and I have some trauma from my past so I question if he is sincere or I'm just paranoid and irrational.


So I recently reconnected with a friend (we were both in relationships with other people before) and we hit it off. Both of us haven't seen each other in months, and I noticed he did alot of self-improvement in terms of his outlook and goal setting. Something sparked and we have been going on dates now and seeing how things unfold. I must say, I've never been treated like this by any guy, and by that I mean he plans things ahead of time and sticks to them, memorizes the things that make me happy and gets me them (ex. Favorite coffee, cards, little sentimental things), takes interest in my life and plans and always supports me, sends me good morning texts and makes an effort to see me if I don't feel good or just to surprise me, uses ""we"" language and talks about the future... 

Here's the thing: I'm so used to dismissive and borderline abusive behaviour from men I'm dating that this kind of attention irks me. Don't get me wrong, he is very sweet, but sometimes *too* sweet if that makes sense. He is ALWAYS in an optimistic mood, has puppy dog eyes for me, frequently and randomly kisses me in public/holds my hand/massages me, has made lifestyle changes to appease me (ex. Changed his diet and did a complete 180 in terms of diet to lose weight) and NEVER pushes on sex (we haven't even had sex yet actually). I feel bad because he knows I've been hurt in the past so I question his actions implicitly and it is an unconscious defense mechanism. He recently made V day plans for us ahead of time and talks about ""breaking down my wall and rebuilding it into a home for us"". This phrase freaked me out, despite me enjoying our time together and imagining long term stuff myself. I can't help it.

I feel bad for shutting down when he showers me with affection. I question whether he is sincere or I'm just too damaged from my ex and paranoid to be hurt again. How do I deal with these feelings? He is a great guy, handsome, very funny and kind... but he is a complete sap for me and I've never had this before in dating.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155621,public,self,Is he too nice or am I just paranoid/broken because of my past?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sfg04r/is_he_too_nice_or_am_i_just_paranoidbroken/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

That came last year, around march/april, we started a friends with benefits situation to see how we felt about eachother and went on vacation in the summer together. During that time, a guy from my choir (I was president of said choir since 2018) got really close to me, I was depressed for the majority of the ending and begining of the year and he just kinda started talking to me, texting everyday and hanging out, but in an inappropriate kind of way because he had a girlfriend. That situation started to make my boyfriend uncomfortable, so I ended it, but only on the final of the school year. 
After the summer I thought me and my boyfriend would be okay but he broke up with me before class, because he didn't believe we could be together and would fight as soon as rehearsal started. Two months went by and after some incidents we decided to try again (you can how much we like eachother, can't really be apart). This time it was better but in the begining of December, after he went to a concert of my choir he got mad because I was feeling stressed about people telling me that I wasn't doing my job as president, and ended up lashing out on him instead. He got mad and started blaming everything on the fact that I go to rehearsal and the choir all together. Christmas and New year's Eve went by and last week rehearsal started again. I resigned myself from president and got out of the direction board in order to make things better for us, but I'm still going to rehearsal because the choir is my home since I started university 5 years ago. I did my best last week to be with him before and after rehearsal, told him everything about what happened, told him about the guy and how he doesn't talk to me and I don't talk to him, asked him numerous times if he was uncomfortable. Yesterday he just told me that he felt like I couldn't do nothing for him, that I should have left the choir or at least thought about it. He says he's starting to resent me because has made an effort to stay in this relationship and I haven't and that that's unfair.
I really like him, it's the only person I have ever imagined myself with. And I know he really likes me too.
Now, he just says there's no solution because if I leave the choir now, he will feel bad because I left for him and it's important for him, and if I don't he will keep feeling uncomfortable and hurt because I see the guy 2 times a week.

Somehow those crushes got know about me liking them and nothing ever happened as I was dumb(still might be) and I dont know how to talk/express myself.

As the years have gone by I think my dumbness(meaning talking to girls/people or expressing myself) has reduced but still not that extent. I moved to a different country and I have made new friends and have even made a few female friends(2-3).

My main reason for this post is I think I am in this point of my life that I think I need someone by my side to enjoy time and be with. I have almost all the major dating apps(tinder, hinge, bumble) i get a few matches here and there like 2-3 a week on all the apps combined, but the chats dont go anywhere, apart from few exceptions and I believe getting success from these apps is very hard. Dont get me wrong, I am decent looking and have hooked up- one night stands - had fwbs with girls from these apps but nothing meaningful yet. My problem is also that I am very picky i will match with all of them that have swiped on me but I dont think I can be in a relationship with all of them (physical attraction is important to me).

I think this post has gotten long enough and might be confusing to some people, hope you understand what advice I want üòÖ

I think I find it hard to show interest like in a light-hearted fun casual way, or I feel like I am etc but sometimes they feel otherwise.

Two dates I recently had one said after three dates she liked me etc, but felt wasn't enough chemistry, fair enough she also said she felt like I was more into her than she was, when in reality I was just trying to have fun etc, but it seems maybe it comes across as pressure idk. It makes me feel like it's hard to find a balance I mean isn't a date meant to be fun and light hearted etc.

The other girl said she felt she had ""all the power"" for me I feel like the ""power"" thing is a bit silly because isn't a date just to have a good time and see if you vibe etc idk.

We shared poetry, life talk, cultural exchanges, sex talk, pictures, videochat, rants, our respective love lives that weren't going anywhere. He is handsome as a god, he has a quick mind and an easy smile. We tried to meet three times but the pandemic made us cancel it each time. 

After a few months I fell madly in love with him nevertheless; after all I was closer with him than with some people I met in real life. He was much cooler about it than me and he didn't want to engage in anything serious; ""at least until we met"" was how I understood it at first but he meant in any case. He started being unavailable for days suddenly and an imbalance was growing.

I wasn't happy anymore and after some talk we decided he wasn't ready to give me what I wanted and I wasn't willing to continue the vague thing we had, so the only thing to do was to end it. We said goodbye and I blocked him everywhere, deleted all chat history, deleted his phone number and forced myself to find a real partner.

He sent me short e-mails every couple of months, kind and pretty neutral but invariably ending with ""I miss you"". I missed him too and it cost me tons of self-control not to answer. I made a huge mistake sending him a line for his birthday, because he was on my mind all the time after that, even though I didn't follow-up after his reply. (I'm basically just as bad as he is.)

Last week, exactly one year after we 'split up', and two weeks after I registered on Facebook dating and gathered a considerable amount of suitors, among which a really sweet, committed and handsome available guy I was just planning a 3rd date with, he sent me an instagram chat request from an account I didn't know. He started off saying it didn't feel good to be blocked and ignored. Just a few lines into the chat, I melted, got all emotional and touched. I feel stupid now even writing it. He said he had changed, which sounded legit since he had spent two years abroad and was just back to his family for a few weeks, he considered travelling to my country to visit me, and he was learning my language. He hinted at sex talk but accepted my refusal. How could my hopes not flare up at this point?

But I lost my self-control and was carried away within days. I dumped the available guy. And mr. Perfect, being true to himself, is disgusted by whatever is available and only pursuits what is impossible. So he backs off again. He says all sorts of contradictory stuff like 
- that he is not the person I think he is but also that I know him better than he does
- that he loves me, that he will always love me and can't imagine a life without me but also that I can't be in love with someone I've never met in person.

I wish I could just be happy with anything and not make everything heavy, but I can't help crying all the time now. I have been crying for a year over him and I'm tired of it. I'm sick of being sad.

My options:
1. block him again and block as many e-mail addresses as I know from him as well, and never again get in touch with him myself.
2. the same, after an angry message telling him I'm humiliated by his shitty behaviour
3. the same, after a kind message telling he wants my unconditional availability without giving me his unconditional availability and that it's more than I can do, that he expects too much from me and I can't handle it
4. act cool and wait till he comes back and then hit back by rejecting him nice and hard
5. act cool and wait till he comes back and let him (but then having to act cool for the rest of my life)

I start going on tinder just to make new friends or perhaps get into a relationship !

Like what did i do? As long as I remember we both did nothing awkward or uncomfortable
I thought maybe he liked my personality but got turned off by my face ? Or quite the opposite? No matter how much i think what i did. I can't get an answer from myself


THE SECOND ONE ( who actually broke me from inside):

yeah to be honest he seemed kinda shady compare to the first guy , when we met he seemed so tired and dry!! 
He kept on talking but i knew he wasn't into me and was looking for something else,
It's like he just saw me and was like "" what a disappoinment""!
The date seemed okay and we went home and never talked to each other
