Was seeing this girl (30F) who I (32M) was really into. We slept together by date #3. The morning after, she was super affectionate and cuddly, even kissed me goodbye and said ""see you soon""

Well, flash forward a week later. She invites me to her place but insists ""just as friends"". I came to her place and she gave me the talk that she's not ready to date anyone and that we should be friends. She basically gave me an ultimatum: either we're friends or nothing. She told me to think about it and let her know. I texted her the next day saying that friends wouldn't work for me and that I would like to see where it could go romantically with her. She said ""we should go our separate ways"". I told her: ""That's totally cool with me, I appreciate the honesty :)""

Well, after 3 weeks of no contact ( I didn't msg her, no likes given on instagram, not even views on her insta stories), she texted me on Saturday morning saying ""R u out tonight?"". I texted back (after about 8 hours) saying ""Yup, I'll be downtown"". She didn't say anything else after that.

Men can empathize with women but women can't rationalize with men.

Or is it Men can rationalize with women but women can only empathize with men when they have something or a resource.

I see women acting like high schoolers demanding everyone support who they are with like they are a mindless zombie. Oh the friend is did this flipped out when I was like ""I am happy for you but why are doing these Facebook posts to have your friends overwhelm you with VALIDATION not to see the red flags like the last 3 guys""

Then there is spoiled princess game. I get dumped because I don't have a college degree which is the dumbest thing because I have awesome credit. I have been told to ""date down"" which is the most anti American thing I heard. Date who you want to. I make okay money not great but it's legal and honest BUT every woman got to change a man because they want their ""beauty and the beast"" fantasy.

Then there is feminists and there is the femin-nazi where they just want slave or to purposely get pregnant and to get an abortion. They just hate men and ones that don't get an abortion just spawn another slave for the private prison and blame the next man they with ot raise their kid like an emperor while hating men.

Oh the LGBTQ+ chick that just says she is LGBTQ+ because they don't know what they want and can't think for themselves. Oh the LGBTQ+ chick has emotional problems because she is raped by her LGBTQ+ friends all the time. Oh I am not allowed to call it rape or sex trafficking yet the Coercion and blackmail and extortion made me dump her ass. 

There needs to be breeding contracts, I am about to just get some work done and do porn because love is dead. Replaced by zealous Kleptos 

I have done interracial dating got that is a hell. If they are black they are concern about what their friends and family think. Asian well they keep too many dicks in a glass case and they guilt trip her to end it.

Oh the sharpest dagger I dated a woman that wanted to get a sex change and how dare I not support her. My bad I want kids to couch and nurture to productive humans.

Any advice please.

It really hurt. What hurt more was that he said a few more things and everything based on conjecture. Plus he decided everything on his own. The bottom line was he didn't feel romantic interest with me. But he said he can't loose me and wants to talk to me when I'm over him.

The thing is I tried. For a year and I told him after careful consideration. I don't know if I can or want to.

The thing is. I'm sad that I might loose him completely as both friend and partner. Because he won't discuss it and expect me to gloss over it. (Something I foolishly suggested)

TL;DR And I can't decide. Should I bury my feelings? To be his friend or should I just tell him what I can't. I'm scared that it might fizzle out.

I had a drastic transformation from 310lbs overweight to 190 lbs fit at 6ft1. This has done wonders for my health and dating life. However I still suffer from anxiety that has stuck around from when i was overweight. 

My anxiety only really appears when I am on a date or seeing a girl I'm really into, especially if she is attractive. I get attention from girls I never thought would ever find me attractive two years ago. I get so anxious I can't relax and be myself, and hook ups are quite difficult on my part. This is very stressful for me as I would really like to get out and date but I don't feel like I'm putting my true self forward, and I'd like to be capable of hooking up too which I also can't do. 

Does anyone have any advice to overcome this? I understand it's very likely a self-worth issue where I still overvalue attractive people in comparison to myself. But I'm not sure how to combat that. I have more upcoming dates and I would like to find some solution to help make it less stressful and gain a more positive outlook. Also I have a therapist I am seeing but that is a very slow process and I haven't had much success unfortunately because I'm also studying to become a therapist so I rarely feel I connect with what she tells me.

40,pw3uus,1632695360,Tread carefully when doing online dating,"After a long term relationship breakup in June this year. I decided to jump into online dating, and for me that was‚Ä¶ not what I expected.

I signed up for numerous sights including:
- eHarmony
- Bumble
- Christian connection

There were several other sites I went on but I will speak about my executive on the above sites. I will go through these in chronological order.
I was on Bumble for a week before connecting with a young lady I was interested in. I went to her end, met her for a meal and had a short walk around her end of the woods (around 40 minutes from myself.) Although I and get connected on most things, but then there was the big sticking point that had not been mentioned in the week that I had been speaking to her- she wanted to go abroad and become a missionary. This never came up in conversation until the in person date.

After the above experience on Bumble, I decided to move to a more well established platform, so I tried out on eHarmony. I spoke to three different women on this platform in which there were two notable people of interest. The first was a woman that thought I was a catfish or a fraudster of some description. The young lady drew this assumption from the fact that my dating profile photos as well as my WhatsApp photo all looked somewhat different- but not significantly, the one major difference being that in some I had a beard while in others I did not. For context, I normally keep my beard quite short, so you may still see them shape of my face.
The second woman on eHarmony was a different bag of fish. I got speaking to her over the course of two to three weeks, and we agreed to see each other on a date, even though we lived at opposite ends of the country. Something which I did not take enough notice of was that I and her did in fact clash on a number of issues, and she was alot more open with her intimate side (including with pictures.) This let me in a difficult spot as I wanted to stay her but I felt conflicting feelings. I caved and resulted in a handful of somewhat intimate photos from myself sent to her. Although she was impressed, I felt humiliated and had let my guard down. About a week before I was to see her, she claimed she had almost been in a bus accident (note *almost*). When she asked for empathy from me, I was frankly a little confused - how should I give empathy to someone i‚Äôve never met when I can‚Äôt relate to what they‚Äôre talking about? (I have had bumps and scratches in cars and I‚Äôve not felt the need to want some empathy from someone for that.) That is where she and I parted ways, I having deleted all explicit messages to distance myself from her.

Now, my final experience on Christian connection. This has been my worst date in living memory. I met someone online on the CC app- she having liked my profile and myself liking her profile back. We chatted for two weeks before I suggested a date. I traveled to her area- 80 minutes from where I lived in an area I was not familiar with. Let me tell you readers‚Ä¶ wow‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never felt so insulted in my life in the course of two hours, so let me summarise what was done and said:
- Upon arriving (after my long journey and having spent more than I anticipated on travel) and suggesting to go to a deserts cafe, she promptly says to me that she is not hungry (you agreed to meet me here, so why don‚Äôt we go in and eat as we agreed?!)
- We go on a walk, and after 10 minutes of walking in a unknown direction and turning round to our starting point she says to me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ten minutes that I‚Äôm not getting back‚Äù
- She says that as I am a particular star-sign that is the same as a friend of her‚Äôs, I must be aggressive, violent and unhinged frequently (you have been speaking to me for 30 minutes and that‚Äôs your conclusion??)
- She compared me to my photos online and came to the conclusion that I looked very different (physically I had not changed, but having slightly more facial hair now)
- the comments ‚Äúmy ex was taller than you by 3 inches‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the second best guy I‚Äôve dated on CC‚Äù (if that‚Äôs the case why aren‚Äôt you with them?)
That date went on for two hours, after which I quite enjoyed the train ride home. I have not spoken to her since that day.

Now, what are my key points I‚Äôve taken away from online dating:
- You WILL be judged on your photos
- Make sure your photos are all up to date
- If your gut tells you that something is not right (such as anything from my experiences that rings true), end the relationship/conversation there
- faith-based dating services often have people with a loose definition of what ‚Äúfaith‚Äù is (honestly if they‚Äôre not sure what ‚Äúfaith‚Äù means in this context, there is a red light for you religious folk!)

42,pw3xfq,1632695612,"Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking, idk","So I need some advice or maybe just to vent. My fianc√© and I have been together for almost 4 years and we‚Äôre getting married soon. I love him so much, he‚Äôs literally my best friend and I couldn‚Äôt imagine life without him. I can tell I‚Äôm his whole world and the love he shows me is so pure. But there are some things I‚Äôm a little ‚Äúeh‚Äù about. And maybe I‚Äôm just being picky. I was recently diagnosed with ROCD about a week and a half ago and I started having symptoms back in April and he‚Äôs been supportive through it all even when I made it EXTREMELY hard. My parents love him like he‚Äôs their own son and everything is great. 

However 

Last Sunday I had his phone and went to his deleted photos just to be nosy. I found a picture of a porn star and she had a dildo on. I‚Äôm aware that people watch porn especially men so that wasn‚Äôt the big deal. I jokingly asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this about?‚Äù And at first he was hesitant to explain which again I understand because talking about porn can be awkward. He eventually told me that he saw the porn star‚Äôs profile on Twitter and wanted to view her girl on girl action. it was a link connected to it. So I went to the PS‚Äôs profile and clicked on the link. Her website popped up and I saw she had girl on girl action AND videos of her pegging men. I jokingly asked ‚Äúbabe do you watch these too?‚Äù He at first said no then after some digging he said ‚Äúok yes babe, I saw the video of the pegging and was curious as to how it worked but that‚Äôs not my thing and I don‚Äôt want that done to me‚Äù. He insisted it was the only video he‚Äôs ever watched like that and that he doesn‚Äôt want anything up or around his butt. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by it but I am. Idk I feel embarrassed like
Why is my man watching that? I hate that I‚Äôm questioning his manhood. He‚Äôs assured me it‚Äôs not his thing. And before finding this I would playful try to play with his butt and he was NOT into it at all. 

He sometimes does the broken wrist gesture and that makes me overthink even more. I do have ROCD and it causes me to overthink things and obsess over them to the point I‚Äôve contemplated ending the relationship because of this. Idk I just feel embarrassed. Maybe that‚Äôs crazy. 

My mom‚Äôs last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past so idk I have this fear of that and it‚Äôs really got me thinking the worse. 

I can tell he loves my body he‚Äôs always trying to do sexual things with me. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if I should be concerned?   I‚Äôm just really ashamed I saw it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw3xfq/maybe_im_overthinking_idk/
43,pw43vf,1632696232,What did I do wrong with my ex girlfriend?,"I emailed my ex girlfriend and asked her how she was doing. She had me blocked on Facebook and also changed her WhatsApp number.

She is 26 and I am 31. We had a short relationship and I broke up with her. I apologised to her because I really hurt and betrayed her.

Today I saw that she has deleted me from her Instagram and also deleted my contact in her phone because I do not see her picture and status anymore.

I did not text her since 3 days.

Did I do anything wrong?? Why does she behave so emotionally unstable? Should I have suggested an alternative day to call her when I said Sunday is not possible?

45,pw4aqu,1632696906,Online Dating and Horrible Conversations (Rant),"tldr: Online dating conversations suck when it is all one sided. It's basically an interview and people need to step it up. You can't expect to only talk about yourself and answer questions without trying to get to know the other person. It's a two way street;

\-------

Is it me or every time I talk to a guy on dating apps, the conversation turns into an interview. Always me asking the questions and carrying the conversation while they just would answer but not ask anything about me. It's not like their answers are short and show disinterest, but more like several sentences answering what I asked but they never ask me anything about me so it makes keeping the conversations alive difficult.  


Here's an example:

Me: ""Hey XYZ, how's your going week so far? I saw some of your pictures and they look awesome and very aesthetic. What are some of your favorite places that you have went to so far.""

Him: ""Hey ABC, Thanks for the compliment. My week has been going great, with a dash of busy, but I'm hanging on until Thursday where I get to play some online games with some of my buddies. Those pictures I took were from my trip to PLACE X and it was one of my favorites because of the amazing food, views and friendly locals who showed me the non-tourist hot spots. It was crazy how the safety there is so different compared to here.""

Me: ""Nice! What kind of games do you play? I play a few games myself and sometimes stream them. I would definitely put that place on my list. Were you able to try X dish from there? If so, what did you think of it? I heard it was delicious! Do you have any other places on your list to visit in the future?""

Him: ""I play -INPUT GAME NAMES HERE- with my buddies. We do this every Thursday as a way to stay connected and we try to form teams and compete online for fun and sometimes go to in person competitions on weekends. Yes, I did try that dish and it was really good. I kept eating it everyday there too lol. This was the last place I was able to go to before covid so hopefully I get to go to X, Y, and Z in the near future.""

Then this goes on and on back an forth for a day or two until I start to feel the drag of the conversation. I hate these interview like conversations and it really triggers me. At times I feel like ghosting these guys out of spite, but I would remember my ghosting experiences and straight up say I am no longer interested. I mean, it's pretty obvious when my messages start to take longer and longer to reply and everything is one sided.

I can't be the only one that experience this, right?

51,pw4nfo,1632698098,I don‚Äôt understand my issues with promiscuity,"I‚Äôm not sure why, but I am totally turned off by promiscuity. I‚Äôm a 27 year old male and have only ever slept with one person. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I was 25 to someone I deeply loved. I broke up with her, but up until that point, I didn‚Äôt get into a relationship because I didn‚Äôt feel ready for a relationship. I had insecurities that I knew would make me clingy and I didn‚Äôt want to subject a person to that. 

Anyway, I did have opportunities to ‚Äúsleep around‚Äù in college. girls would approach me and seemed open to the idea of one night stands, but internally it would be a massive turn off to me. I would feel disgusted that someone who didn‚Äôt even know me more than an hour would be willing to give me access to their body. Most men and women seem to be open to that idea, so I always thought there was something wrong with me. However, sex is a very intimate act to me that I don‚Äôt think should be done freely. Not to mention, the dangers of being promiscuous (STDs, kids out of wedlock born to dysfunctional homes, emotional damage, etc.)

At times, I thought maybe I was just jealous because I couldn‚Äôt hook up with every girl like my peers, but now that I‚Äôve been going to bars more frequently I‚Äôve had an opportunity every time and it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth the pressure and risks. I‚Äôd rather just continue to hang out with my friends.

Maybe I just have issues with intimacy. For me to even want to date a girl I have to have strong feelings for her to put up with the emotional aspect of dating. Most people are not comfortable enough with themselves to even be in a relationship, so I just don‚Äôt think it is worth the time and effort to invest.  I rarely see relationships or marriages work out. Of course I do have sexual urges, but then I just masturbate and keep it moving lol.

62,pw5hny,1632701077,Does she like me back?,"I am 19M and she is 19F. Hey, first time writing here but I need your help!
So I started uni almost 1 month ago and I needed new friends. After random cause of events we formed a friend group of 10 people. We are all from the same country so that helped bond us because we are studying in a foreign country.
So this is about a girl who is part of this friend group. The first two weeks we were just on a hey/hi basis and nothing more. I didn‚Äôt expect much and didn‚Äôt have any plans dating her. But things changed after we had a party 3 days ago. Usually I was pretty introverted back home so my new goal was to be really confident in myself and try not to stress over social experiences. So after the party ended me, this girl and 2 more people left together and decided to chill out at another place. We sat down and started talking about each other. For example when we started talking about our fav movies it turns out we have the same fav movies with the girl. We started talking more and found even more strange coincidences.As I said I am starting to be mor extroverted and not really caring about opinions so I was really bold. I made some comments like ""Oh, we have so many shared interests I think we should be dating already"" and she just laughted it off. I was kinda losing hope by that point but made some stupid joke along the way and she just kept laughing after each one. She wasnt drunk or anything like that. Like every single joke she found it the funniest thing ever. Then I got some hope again. After some more conversation she says she is a serious person and she is looking for a serious person. And I said to her ""Oh, well you dont know me, I am actually really serious"" and she replied with something ""Oh I dont believe you."" I kept making some stupid jokes until the end of the night. The next day, the same group of people from after the party(me, her and two more people) decided to go to the market together to shop for some fruits. Again, the same thing happened. We started finding strange coincidences about us and she kept laughing after every single stupid thing I say and then saying about the serious stuff. 
So I dont know what to do. We started messaging today but her replies are really slow. I am really confused what to do because half of the time she laughs at every single thing I say and we find many strange coincidences together, the other time she says she is into serious people, she replies really slow to my messages even though she is online and overall is playing really hard to get.
So what should I do? I have never been in a relationship before so I dont know when should I make a move or if I should make one at all. I have gotten to this position a lot in the past but never actually made a move because I was scared of embarrassement and rejection. Is she even interested in me? If so what should I do in the current situation? Should I just jokingly ask her out and if she rejects I will just say it was a joke. Should I start playing hard to get or overall not show so much interest? Please help :D",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw5hny/does_she_like_me_back/

I've only dated a couple of girls that were the opposite of me, e.g. social butterflies, extroverted, more artsy rather than nerdy. While these two relationships didn't last, they were my longest-lasting relationships. I'm finding it's extremely easy to get dates with girls who are like me, stem, introverted, etc but it just seems like things aren't clicking and there's no chemistry with these kinds of girls.

65,pw5leb,1632701452,Transition from talking to a girl for school stuff to personal things.,"Hello. 
I've been talking to this girl, who I've been in the same school for 5 years with, but I've never really got the chance to get to know her. We've been walking home from school together a couple of times in the past 2 weeks since the school year start when our schedules match. I've also chatted with her inviting her to a group volleyball meeting, that we've been doing regularly with our friend group. I invited her, because she's been to 2 of those meetings before and she shared that she was scared that she would ruin the game because she can't play, so I wouldn't call inviting her an obviously sign for her that I might be into her. (It also opened the chat between me and her, so I'm happy with it)
 While going home we usually talk about school stuff, but there is nothing much to discuss so I run out of things to say. I wanna get to know her better and become friends no matter if there could be something romantic between us or no, but I'm not sure how to casually do the transition from talking just because there is nothing else to do and talking about personal stuff, because we both wanna share. I'm also not sure about this feeling in my chest, but I think I might be falling in love. I've been in love only once before and at first I didn't look at her that way, I just found her friendly and cool and then one day I just realized I might like her, a week later I was sure that I'm in love. In my school there are mostly males and as a shy teenager I don't often get to meet girls my age, who I find different from the rest, so maybe it might be exaggerating, but I really haven't talked to someone new who I would consider partner-material in a while.
She also texted me herself about something school related yesterday, but our conversation was kinda weird and sloppy. 
So my question is how can I make the transition and maybe give her a hint that I might want to get to know her better. And also how would I know if she didn't like me or didn't want to communicate with me and instead just do it because she would feel bad or something... Personally for me when a good-looking girl has a nice personality and behaviour, I would just try to get to know her better and if I have luck we might get into something. But does it work like that for the females? Do they instantly get attracted to decent looking guys with good personalities.

My best friend said to just be her friend first. Meaning don‚Äôt ask her out till class is over, which is in May. 
My dad says to just talk to her, build a relationship, build intimacy. He recommended talking to her during class breaks, he said maybe buy her a soda to show you‚Äôre a good person lol. 

I‚Äôve checked her fingers, no rings lol. And in class, she does not talk to anyone, I mean no one! During class breaks, I hear people taking to each other just like me talking to my friend, but her, she just walks out of class, returns, and talks to no one. She‚Äôs just on her phone and stuff.

84,pw6nl5,1632705343,"YSK there are three types of unsolicited dick pics: Naive, strategic, and malicious.","To put it simply, there are basically three main reasons a guy will send an unsolicited dick pic. 

1. Naivety: The first time he ever sent a dick pic was in 10th grade when his first ever serious girlfriend asked for one. She then replied by sending him nudes and they had sex for the first time soon after. Because of this experience, he now thinks that girls like unsolicited nudes as much as he does, and since he doesn't mind sending them he thinks it's a good way to get a girl's interest. 
2. Strategy: He knows that most girls aren't into dick pics unless they're already interested in having sex with him. It's a lot easier to send a pic than it is to write a convincing paragraph to the same effect, so he sends out the pics regularly knowing that even though the vast majority won't have any positive return, some will. 
3. Malicious intent: He knows that the girl in question isn't interested in unsolicited dick pics, and especially not from him. He also knows that it's the most sexual act he can do with her without getting in real trouble or feeling like he did anything wrong. For him it's a win-win situation, creating disgust for her and pleasure for him. 

Sometimes you see a mix of these philosophies as well. A combination of 1 and 2 might make a guy send a dick pic to a girl seemed like she was flirting, but was just being friendly, and a combination of 2 and 3 could motivate a guy who wants to get laid but hates women in general for rejecting him so much.

86,pw6p39,1632705497,I want to hear from cheating men,"Sorry, this might be a bit long but bear with me. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm living abroad with foreign boyfriend and 5 week old baby. SO has some prior trauma from not being able to keep a boner in his younger years, which was so traumatic he actually cries about it. Subsequently, he didn‚Äôt kiss anyone until 17 and didn‚Äôt lose his virginity until 21. I caught him with a second phone, where he intended to meet up with some girl to have sex (we had not had sex for awhile due to pregnancy and depression) and he said he was going crazy. Unfortunately, I feel his traumas have made him unreliable and he will forever need this attention from girls since he lacked it for so long. Should I stay or leave?

So I‚Äôm a 22yo American female living with my 26yo Brazilian boyfriend in his country. We have a 5 week old son, together for going on 2 years. I only officially moved here 4 months ago, but I spent quite a bit of time here including 3 months during the pandemic. We got along amazing. I really felt he was the one. We had lots of coincidences that further convinced me. I accidentally got pregnant and after many discussions about what to do, we decided to keep him. We love him, he‚Äôs an amazing father to him. He really loves our baby.

Fast forward to me moving here. I arrived here pretty pregnant, I was trapped in his room all day while we looked to move to our own apt out of his apt with roommates. He is doing the equivalent to a navy seal course with the military right now, he worked mon-sat 5a-8p. I got depressed. I purposely went to sleep before he got home just to not show my depression. I wasn‚Äôt affectionate. We barely had sex. I couldn‚Äôt smile. He always tried to cheer me up, talk to me to know the issue, etc but I was standoffish. 

We finally got our apt and I was a little better, but many times he found me randomly crying. At this point I was huge pregnant, uncomfortable and overall sad. Many times I told him I was considering to go back to US until his course was done. At this point, he‚Äôs working 5a-8p mon-fri. He also was gone for one solid week without communication, and 4 weeks with communication only on the weekends. I couldn‚Äôt smile when I saw him. I loved him, but I was just so depressed. We didn‚Äôt really have sex, so it has been a solid 5 months since we had a decent sex life due to distance, pregnancy and depression.

Fast forward to one week ago‚Ä¶ I found another phone. A phone he‚Äôs had for 4 years for some unknown reason, which he destroyed when I found and asked him to open it. What I did get out of him is that he‚Äôs been talking to girls on there, and one of them he intended to meet after work and ultimately backed out because ‚Äúhe thought of us.‚Äù He obviously has some secret on this phone unrelated to me since he‚Äôs had it even before I came alone. 

He apologized profusely, asked to work it out. Said he would do therapy, open passwords, cameras in the house, live location, video call for the entire day that he isn‚Äôt here, etc etc and how stupid and sorry he was.  

Here‚Äôs the problem: he was a virgin until 21 and he had a traumatic sexual experience when he was younger. Apparently he would try to have sex but couldn‚Äôt get boner. He had to take medicine for it. He finally defeated this at 21. It was so traumatic for him that he actually will cry when he talks about it. Idk if there‚Äôs more to the story. 

My problem is‚Ä¶ he barely had attention from girls when he was younger. Now he‚Äôs attractive, he gets attention. I fear he craves this attention, since he had this traumatic experience and lacked this attention for so long. 

Although he‚Äôs sorry, I‚Äôm not convinced he will never cheat again because of this. Overall, he‚Äôs one of the nicest and genuine men you will meet. Everyone thinks highly of him. But due to his trauma, idk if he will ever be someone I can rely on. I know this man loves me and his son, but I don‚Äôt know what he is capable of if he did that in *this* situation.

87,pw6rbp,1632705714,Is it Over?,"Sorry for the melodramatic title. Also for formatting because mobile. 

So‚Ä¶ my fianc√© and I were an LDR. I had more ties and a better job, so we moved him here in February. He talks to and FaceTimes his family every other day or so, which I stay out of because that‚Äôs his time and his grandparents have termed me the gold-digging B from [state]. Ftr, there‚Äôs no digging; I have/make more money than he does. My family is dysfunctional at best. 

My job is not amazing. It has perks, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a job. I am shipped to multiple different locations in the week and this is exhausting for me because the different locations have very different expectations and requirements. At my home location, I am primarily front-end, so I do a lot of face to face interaction and people pleasing. At my secondary location, I am managerial, so I do reviews, schedules, pinch-hitting, etc. At my tertiary location, I am whatever is needed - front end, back end, inventory, etc. Sometimes, I go into work expecting one thing and wind up blindsided by something unusual. For the most part, I‚Äôm pretty roll with the punches. 

On Friday, I was back at location three, where I haven‚Äôt been in about six weeks. Things have changed, including almost everyone I know having taken better positions elsewhere. I‚Äôm happy for them, because they‚Äôre great people. But obviously, new faces were seen and one of them was this flamboyantly gay, socially awkward guy. We started talking about D&amp;D while we were working, and he invited me to check out his party in a themed bar because I‚Äôve never played. 

Meanwhile, my fiance is having a rough day at his work. I invited him to my work and I would take a short break to talk with him because I‚Äôd been asleep when he left and I wouldn‚Äôt be home for another four hours or so. Immediately when he gets there, I finish up what I‚Äôm doing and go talk to him, but he‚Äôs got this attitude of just pissed off petulance because he saw me talking to the new guy, and starts to be rude to the new guy and tries to get me away from him. 

I excuse myself, even go outside with him, and he‚Äôs being aggressive and unnecessarily rude about me talking about how new guy invited me to check out his party. I‚Äôm trying to calm him because I know his day was rough, but he‚Äôs just being a jerk, so I go back inside when my break is up. 

It‚Äôs now two days later and he‚Äôs been rude to me the whole time, and is trying to pick a fight because there‚Äôs a bad anniversary coming up and he‚Äôs got anger management issues. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm hormonal, and it‚Äôs in the rougher end of hormones. I feel like shit and have now worked in three separate buildings in three consecutive days, and I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôve been vomiting most of today because of the hormones. 

I leave work a few hours early to come and lay down, but he has the bed covered and instead of packing (we move on Friday) he hasn‚Äôt completed anything he was supposed to today and is instead playing video games. I broach the topic of neither of us having completed any specific task yet, and he immediately starts throwing things and screaming. We argue until he throws my abusive ex in my face and tells me I ‚Äúwish he would hit me so I could get rid of him like I did my ex,‚Äù and I leave. I tell him he can go back [home] because his behavior is not acceptable and I‚Äôm tired of him throwing my abusive ex in my face. 
He tells me to ‚Äúenjoy [my] date with New Guy.‚Äù 

I come home, hoping for some peace and quiet and to use some of my anger as energy to pack. He‚Äôs here. I should have left again. But I didn‚Äôt, because I‚Äôm having massive amounts of anxiety about this stupid move. I angrily remind him that New Guy is gay, and it starts another argument. He eventually tells me to ‚Äúget that memory thing checked‚Äù because I have a brain tumor that impacts memory. 

I took off my rings. Because we were LDR in the beginning, I never take off my rings except in the shower (unrelated plumbing issue). I just‚Ä¶ feel very disrespected and like there‚Äôs a huge double standard because HIS friends can invite HIM out, but a gay guy cannot invite me out to a D&amp;D party.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw6rbp/is_it_over/
88,pw6tes,1632705925,Don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation?,"So I went out on a 2nd date with a girl yesterday and it went pretty well, bc we ended being out for like 8-9 hours or so. Here‚Äôs the thing, I find her cute and all but I just don‚Äôt really want her as a gf bc I don‚Äôt feel that spark snd that insane attraction for her. It came up in the conversation like what we were looking for and here‚Äôs were things got complicated. She told me out of the other guys she‚Äôs seeing that she has a connection for me (I guess she got out of a 6 year relationship like maybe last year or something, she was vague), and she‚Äôs bisexual as well, so it was a lot to take in.

I don‚Äôt really like holding her hand or being too intimate, but we got drunk and ended up making out on and off for like an hour or so. I started kissing her neck and she said it didn‚Äôt really do anything for her, but maybe she was lying bc I did it and she started getting worked up, and she ended up wanting a hickey lol.

While this was all happening in the beginning she was like ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre gonna break my heart,‚Äù and she was hesitant to make out at first, but I reassured her, but at the same time I was drunk and didn‚Äôt really mean those things and just wanted to keep kissing and making out. I told her that something casual like a friends with benefits could be good, but she said that she feels like she‚Äôs catching feelings, and that she wants to see where it goes. 

I just like the intimacy and I like feeling desires, feeling loved, etc (as anybody probably does), but I don‚Äôt really like her like her. So I guess the options are to just go with the flow or just stop things, before she becomes attracted and things get messy. 

I didn‚Äôt like that she tried to act like she was talking to a lot of guys and to try to make me feels special she was like, but I like you the best. She also said she hasn‚Äôt felt like this in awhile, and idk we were both drunk so I‚Äôm hoping she was just talking out loud or something. This girl has a lot emotional baggage and there is a weird part of me that enjoys filling some role for her, but in a perfect world I would just want to experiment sexually with her and that‚Äôs it. I said I was willing to go on dates and stuff, but that I wasn‚Äôt sure that I wanted a relationship. 

What do I even do, I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings, I want sex and like the physical intimacy, but am I going to have to play along to get that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw6tes/dont_know_what_to_do_in_this_situation/
