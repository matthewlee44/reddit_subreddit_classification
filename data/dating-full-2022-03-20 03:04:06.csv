Paying for sex is my ONLY option, It's more obvious as time goes by. At this point I know my fate and I'm relieved by it tbh. I'm Autistic &amp; 350 LBS.  I'm physically unattractive and realistically will never date the women I actually desire. I realized that I don't even desire what the average male would deem as gorgeous, one friend told me ""Yo, you only like girls who look like pornstars"" but I can't help what I like. Admittedly I'm a porn addict with no desire to stop. The influence it has on my standards are irreversible, because even before porn existed to me I was like this. 

Since I was 5 or 6 I ONLY desired ""Dream Girls"", porn just bursted the flood gates. Most of the girls I'm attracted to don't even act like I exist. My current crush only interacts with me out of pity (she literally told me), SO I'm NOT gonna lie to myself and say I have a chance with her. I'd be lying if I told you it doesn't bother me. Bc it does, but only a little lol. It doesn't really ""get to me"" anymore if you know what I mean. I STILL can't stop fantasizing about her. I even found a pornstar who looks like her. 

Honestly, ""Pay to Play"" seems like my best bet. I can actually have sex with my dream girl for X amount of dollars, absolutely NO strings attached. It feels like the only way for me. The philosophy of waiting for ""the one"" just makes me depressed and hopeless. I want sex WHEN I want with WHO I want, waiting for chance ain't an option for me no more. 

Sex is my biggest desire. I'm not even sure if I want a girlfriend. I have a female best friend and she's AMAZING. She actually encourages me to take this route. My philosophy may be flawed, but I see nothing wrong with my decision. Honestly it feels like the logical ""next step"".

I am smart and quite successful in my field of work. I used to think I am an interesting person as I I have a variety of hobbies and wouldn't have trouble holding a long conversation with even strangers.

I dated a guy who said he was super into me and would make plans every two days to meet as he couldn't wait to meet me again. Slowly things turned physical and after some time I felt that he started to pull away. I had to initiate all conversations and keep insisting on spending time together. Finally I asked him if he saw us dating in future and he said no. I left it there but told him how what he did was wrong and he shouldn't have dragged it out and told me that he wasn't interested. He didn't agree with me. I left it there. Now I am wondering if it was just physical attraction for him from the beginning or did he slowly lose interest in me after spending time with me and realised I'm not that fun as a partner.

I dated another guy I was excited to meet because his bio was very interesting. During our date I felt he was generally unimpressed by what I had to say because he had done something 10x better and the only chance I got to speak was when he would check his messages. He made me feel dumb. When I told him about not meeting again he didn't understand why and felt that he did everything right. He was flirty, romantic, chivalrous, complimented me on my looks, etc. He said he felt like he had met his soul mate as soon as he saw me. This screamed red flag for me because he didn't even have a chance to speak to me before feeling that way. Also, I'm very aware that men don't get matches so easily on dating apps and he also mentioned how he gets matches but the women never bother to follow through with the conversation, which made me question everything he said about me. 

I have seen this happen so many times that I now question my self worth. I question all my achievements thinking maybe being attractive is what got me to where I am.

It happened one night about 2-3 weeks ago(she is in another country), we were video calling and she said that she wanted to sleep so i said fine but before i even got to end the call an co-worker called and she ended before i did to talk with him.She talked about 10 minutes when she finished she told my good night and messaged me after an hour if i am still awake didnt really cared at that moment but next day she says a friend of her needs a pill no to get pregnant, again i didn't really cared. After 20 minutes i found out that she went out in that hour when she first told me that she is going to sleep, of course i got mad and asked her where she was and denied that she went out, then said that she was after cigg.
After two weeks i see the conversation that she had with her friend and oh boy, that pill wasn't for her friend for sure, she is texting her that she needs to buy that pill fast and kinda tell her what happened.
After everything i found out she still declines that she did anything and that pill was not for her. Anyway i decided to break up because of that and other thing she did and she called me and started crying to give her one more chance.

We got along so well.

My biggest mistake I ever made, was turning to one of her best friends for advice. I thought I could trust her to keep a secret, but she ended up telling her everything I discussed. 

Now they basically won't respond to any of my texts for the past month. We were supposed to hang out over spring break and now that stopped. 

We see each other in class again. I was about to ask her out on a date. We were friends for a year but slowly started drifting apart. 

What did I tell her best friend?? I told her that I waited too long to ask her out, and that she was making a move on me. The best friend got jealous because she wanted me too. She told the girl I liked (middle school drama) and she was completely embarrassed I was talking about her behind her back.

So here are my options...

**Option A: Keep apologizing** 

I could keep apologizing and texting them, but then I come off as really needy and creepy. They won't respond to any of my texts anymore so I think maybe I should stop.

**Option B: Leave the group chat and block them out of my life**

I could storm out of the group chat and say my last word. Only problem is I have to keep seeing them for two more months in class. We are class partners. Plus I want to try and redeem my last chance.

**Option C: Wait until next class, do nothing, and then ask her out??**

I could wait it out until next class. We see each other again in April. I could just not text them again and just wait to talk with them in person. 

My final chance so we see each other just two more times. Somewhere and somehow I have to ask her out in that short window of opportunity. 

How do I do this without being needy, making her embarrassed, scarring her off even more, or getting her to lash out in the middle of class. 

I've already creeped her out enough by waiting way too long to take her on a date. She tried for four months to get me to ask her out and I was too chicken to make a move.

I think it would be cool just to go on one date and see what happens.

I developed a crush on a coworker shortly after meeting her.

Over the course of a year I've slowly realized that I would be miserable dating this person. 

It's been a series of exchanges that have cemented my opinion. 

1) Her expressing how much she likes exclusively tall guys. I'm short so that squashed any hope. That's life, it happens. 

2) How she complains about men being pigs/creeps and yet she gushes over tall actors and makes small penis jokes. (Which is highly inappropriate but whatever).

3) The fact that I spend 40 hours a week with her and she has literally never asked me a question about my life. While I know quite a lot about her because that's all she ever talks about. I've had stitches on my forehead and she didn't ask, I was in a car accident.

4) She is hypercritical of others. We have an older coworker who makes small, easily-fixable mistakes. It's not that big of a deal, but my crush somehow thinks it is. The older coworker is a wonderful person that actually asks me about my weekend, my hobbies, my goals, my family. The older coworker creates a positive work environment even in times of stress. 

5) Having no friends and being openly misanthropic. At first I thought she was awkward or introverted, but it's really just a consequence of her judgemental attitude and lack of interest in other people. Her best friend is her cat. At one point, I was actually jealous of the cat. 

6) Her anti-depressants have killed her libido. (I didn't ask, she openly told me this and I steered the conversation away from sex) 

These are just the 6 things I can list off the top of my head. 

So you can imagine my surprise when another coworker mentions that my crush has been frustrated that I didn't ask her out.

The only reason why she wants me to date her is because I'm the only person who puts up with her bullshit. 

I politely said I'm not interested. 

But felt like ranting here. 

I dodged a huge bullet. 

It's not my job to fix this miserable person.

I didn't date or socialize much in my teens and early 20s and whatever socializing I did was mostly just to make connections and build social skills. I was busy on trying to make a better future since I didn't have much going for me at the time.

I'm definitely better off now than I was when I was younger in finances, life experience and physical fitness.

I met a guy and hung out with him for a few days. He didn’t flirt with me, but I could tell he liked me too. People said they could tell he did. He even told some mutual friends that he liked me, but he denied it when I asked him. He had a girlfriend, and because of that, he cut off contact with me. I had no idea he had a girlfriend until I asked him if he liked me, and our mutual friends had no idea either. I figured that since he denied it, maybe it was all just a big misunderstanding, and I thought we could be social media friends. We live in different countries, so I figured there'd be no harm in that. But he rejected the request, so I blocked his ass for a couple of days. A mutual friend reached out the next day and asked if I was mad at him. So he told our friends that I blocked him. They broke up two months later. Yet, he still looks at all my social media, like at least once a day. Like all of them, my Twitter, TikTok, etc.

It really hurt me. Yes, people say that he’s trying to do the right thing by her. That he liked me but wanted to stay loyal to his girlfriend. I agree with them when they said that he’s not a bad guy, but he hurt me too much. Like I said, I misread a lot of stuff, but he said he liked me. I feel like I’ll never forgive him. I even say that I hate him. Listen, I know that he actually did the right thing, but did he have to tell people that he liked me?

I finally decided to overcome my anxiety with sexual relationships with women.

There is a girl (ca. 22) in my wider social circle who I have a crush on. I met her roughly a year ago on a party but I could never overcome my anxiety to approach her so the contact was limited to group talk/banter. Fast skip forward to last week: I was out with my friends and she was there too. We increasingly talked and interacted more and more during the night. She also became quite teasy and flirty to me. We ended up on the dance floor. The details are blurred out because I drank quite a lot but I remember we were dancing with each other and were quite touchy (I definitely held her hand when I escorted her through the dance floor at some point). My buddy claimed I could have closed (also confirmed by her to him few days later) but drunk and shy me didn't realize it. Anyway I blundered this and she went home. 
Next day she hit me up on IG about some songs we talked about on the dance floor. Note that I have never written her in general. I just followed her some time ago on IG. I responded to her casually and we chatted briefly on Monday. On Wednesday I wrote her DM if she is up to go to a museum and grab some drinks afterwards next week. Sadly I did the rookie mistake and didn't use the word ""date"". She responded to me that she gladly accepts my invitation but asked if it's okay to meet just as friends. I was baffled but didn't see a way out and accepted to her ""terms"" admitting to the friend zone I guess. Should I have insisted it on being a date?

Hindsight is 20/20 but another buddy said I should have just stayed casually in contact and try to setup a night with my circle and see if I can get another shot at her. What's your opinion guys?

In my last relationship, I didn't have most of the physical issues, since I truly think I may have had COVID that triggered a lot of it, so although I felt like a burden, it wasn't to the extent that I do now. **I feel like I am ""broken"" and that this guy would be better off with someone who can do more things with.** For example, I can't do any strenuous physical activity because it triggers vertigo. That sometimes includes sex, unfortunately. I'm afraid of certain places due to agoraphobia, and although I challenge myself, a panic attack can quickly ruin the experience. I also feel malaise most of the time, and it's hard to identify what is causing it.  

Other than that, **I also fear getting too attached.** I'm not sure why exactly this is...possibly due to bullying, my trauma, or just craving human connection so much coupled with my general anxiety. I feel emotions very intensely and am afraid to get hurt, because that pain will also be intense. I am afraid of scaring people off, so I hold stuff back. I am afraid of dragging someone else down &amp; hurting them. When other people feel bad for me or I cause them to worry (or even cause them to think anything about me, tbh), I feel guilty bc I feel like I don't deserve it. I also feel like I ruin everything. For example, with my last relationship, things went south because I had a sort of mental breakdown when I was severely depressed. Looking back at old texts, I truly was rude to him, but was oblivious to it at the time. I broke up with him in order to further isolate myself &amp; due to my overall negative emotions that I was taking out on him. I feel like I ruined his life by ""leading him on"" with an amazing couple of months and then just being a shitty person. With this new guy, I feel a ton of pressure to hold it together and try to be as ""normal"" as possible. **I'm on edge constantly about a possible worsening of any of my disorders that could have a negative impact on him/the relationship.** 

**I also don't know what is normal in terms of attachment.** Like, is it healthy to want to see them everyday? Or hang out with his friends? How soon is too soon to stay over at his house? It is weird if he lives with his parents but they're cool with it? When is too soon to have XYZ conversation? How many of the skeletons in my closet should I disclose and when?

Obviously this is a lot, and yes, I have a wonderful therapist. But I'd appreciate advice from either people who can relate to me or people who've had a partner like me.

\[Oct\] Back in October, I (34F) was invited by my friend Amy to join this weekend party trip. I only know her among the trip members as I just relocated to this country. I first met Scott (31M) &amp; Jane among other people on the trip. Scott and Jane did NOT always spend time together during the trip, but they always ended up being a pair for any pairing activities. For example, when our group went for Jetski, Scott was riding with Jane.

But I think Scott made a move to me. We did this late-night van ride, our group split into two vans. Scott was in the same van with me, Jane on another van. We were all pretty drunk and everybody started doing this lap dance and Scott gave me a lap dance. On the next day, I somehow ended up sitting at the bar with Scott while everyone else was on the dance floor for most of the night. And he was asking me all of these questions like whether I'm single, what kind of guy that I'm looking for, etc.

I asked Amy, what's the deal between Scott &amp; Jane. She dug around and reported back to me saying that Scott &amp; Jane used to date, but I didn't work out but they remain friends.

\[Nov - Dec\] After the trip, I was invited to this WhatsApp group where Scott arranges various group activities on Sunday (for free). Again Scott &amp; Jane do not always spend time together during the event but they always come together. Then Christmas &amp; New Year happened, most people including me were leaving the country, so nothing much happened. Scott &amp; I interacted by leaving each other's comments on IG. But we do not text/WhatsApp each other.

\[Jan\] The end of Jan was Scott's birthday. He hosts this party with probably 60-70 people. Around 10 people including me continued the after-party at Josh's apartment (Scott's friend). But first Scott needed to carry all the party stuff back to his place (next apartment building to Josh's), Jane offered to help. They both went for quite sometime before joining back at Josh's. It was just drinking and dancing. When I was about to leave, Scott carried me back to the living room and danced with me, then became intense, twirling me around which look like wrestling with me. While Jane was twerking Josh.

\[Feb\] Valentine, I can see from the IG post that Scott &amp; Jane had Valentine's dinner together. Jane looks gorgeous in her dress, I even asked her where did she buy it. End of Feb, Scott was out of town, I hung out with Jane with a couple of other people. We were just talking random stuff and one of the stuff we talked about is Jane told us that she thinks Josh is hot and would definitely sleep with him. But she couldn't because she made a pact with Scott not to sleep with each other's friends.

\[Mar\] We went picnic with the Sunday activity group the weekend before St. Patrick's Day. Jane was out of town for one week. This picnic was blasted with music. Scott randomly picked me up again and did that dancing stuff. I don't find it inappropriate, just... weird, in front of all of these people. I felt like it was a bit.....PDA. Later on, we all had dinner together. One by one everyone left, it was just Scott, Amy &amp; I. When Amy went to the toilet, Scott asked me ""so are you still single?"", I said, ""Yes Scott, do you have any hot friends, you need to be my wingman!!"". He replied, ""Well I'm also single. I do have single friends, but no one is cooler than me"". When we're leaving, Amy hugs Scott as usual, but when I hug Scott, he gave me this full-fledged ""under the rain"" hug.

Fast forward to a day before St. Patrick's Days, I felt like going out for drinks. I was thinking to ask Scott out to be my wingman. But on second thought, I felt that would be weird because we're not that close as friends. But Scott randomly texted me about the Sunday activity idea that I bounced to him. I ended up asking him whether he has any plans Thu Night, he said he has no plans. But he didn't ask me out either &amp; at the same time, I have another group of people who invited me for drinks that night. On Thu evening as I was getting ready, Scott texted me asking whether I'm out. I said yes, going to Bar X. He said he'll meet me there. So we were out partying and after the bar closed, Scott &amp; I walked to find Shawarma. Scott's place is within walking distance of the bar while my place is a bit farther. We walked to Scott's apartment and ate Shawarma on the bench on the street in front of his apartment then just talk.

Scott told me that he moved here during lockdown 2 years ago. He just broke up with his ex when he met Jane. They were just fooling around but then Jane became really into him and she's not exactly what he's looking for. Even though they talk often &amp; Jane also moved into the same apartment building, they're not together. He also reiterated earlier this year to Jane that he's going to go on his own path. On another hand, this is stuff that Scott said to me ""You're the whole package. You walked into that bar looking like a model that night. You could've picked up any guy you want at the bar."" Then Scott hug me and said, ""I like you groovin\_holic"". Scott hinted that I can spend the night at his place, but I went back home.

The next morning Scott texted me good morning and checking whether all is good. Then I checked IG, Scott posted an IG story of our photo together!! And he didn't post anything else which makes it look like he had a date with me while I actually there with a group of people. I remember panicking like ""gosh Jane is gonna hate me"".

I just never really paid attention to Scott before this because of his weird situation with Jane and I feel that Jane is still very much in love with Scott, so initially didn't want to get in the mix.

But then, I received many comments for the rest of the day saying that we look great together and I found myself smiling looking at the picture. Then it hits me Scott is super hot and I would rate him 10/10. I also just read another post here about a BF who never post any couple photo, while Scott proudly posted a photo with me.

Q#1\] Now I'm wondering is there anything that I can do to take this thing with Scott to the next level? Should I just wait it out until Scott makes his next moves to me, maybe while he sorts his stuff with Jane (if any)? Should I be more aggressive to reach out to Scott? Should I express that I like him too? Should I suggest Scott keep some distance from Jane? Or should I just walk away as Scott &amp; Jane clearly still have something going on? I also feel like it's too early for me to do any kind of ""talk"" with him.

Q#2\] Does he even actually like me? I'm not even 100% sure he actually likes me or just bullshiting me because we don't have constant communication. He just makes moves to me when we meet.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164090,public,self,A guy told me he likes me while still being (close) friends with his ex who is still in love with him and the ex is also my friend.

They do love the guy and stay committed to him and are happy in such relationships but idk it doesn't really appeal to me.

My boyfriend ended our relationship on Wednesday…. He said he wanted to be an actor and travel a lot, never wants kids and wants to travel the world.

We met on a dating app in May 2021. He had just moved to the uk from the USA so I did wonder if maybe it was a bit too soon for him to date. But he was kind, interesting to talk to and attractive, he seemed really interested in me and his friends said he never stopped talking about me.

At the start, I planned all the dates, as he was new here and I wanted to show him the good places. He never paid for things, only ever split the bill. But this lack of planning of dates continued well into the relationship, in fact he never planned a single date, but promised me he would soon.

He lived with his mate, and told me things would be better when he moved out. When he moved out… he said things would be better when he had a car.

Every week I felt he had a new unrealistic career or business idea… but he never did anything to achieve it. He just worked a low paid job and never left the house. He only ever really talked about HIS future goals

He also ate very unhealthy, takeaway most nights. He never really cared for me when I came to stay, I would have to ask for a glass of water and he didn’t think to buy food. We would always have to use my car to go to the shop and eat super late, whilst I would always have something cooked ready when he came to visit me. 

He would play video games a lot. And he would often sulk if things didn’t go his way (e.g his favourite takeaway was closed one night so we had to get pizza instead.) he talked about money constantly, it was the topic of most conversations 

I put a lot of love and effort into the relationship, but now I feel hurt. Does this mean he will probably never have a serious relationship?

But over the last couple of weeks there have been things that she has been doing differently which makes me believe that maybe she may want to be more than friends. 

This is what I have noticed.

1. She asked me if I was going to homecoming and if so if I was going with anyone.
2. When around me at work she becomes way more social than what she normally is with other workpeople.  
3. She makes a effort to try to continue the conversation after she gets interrupted by something. This was evident today as she was wanting me to talk about everything that was in my head to be honest
4. At work she makes a effort in being near me and chatting to me while walking with me around the store helping out and trying to make it last as long as possible.
5. I catch her glancing and looking at me from either across the store and the class.
6. Whenever I walk past her and her friends they go from talking to becoming really quiet as if they are talking about me
7. One of her friends has asked me if I have a girlfriend 
8. She waits behind for me at the end of work and and will sit near me at break in the staff room.
9. She walks with me on the way home but then has to leave as my direction home is the complete opposite way to her house.

So I matched with a girl on Bumble a weekish ago. Since I broke up with my gf about 2 months ago I've had like 60ish matches on the apps, and been on a handful of dates. The thing is, this girl was the first person I've actually felt something for properly. I got instantly super excited by her profile, in a way that I haven't with any other matches. We ended up texting essentially non stop for three evenings in a row, and agreed to go on a date on the Friday just gone. But come Wednesday/thursday last week, her reply time slowed waaaaay down, and really suddenly too.

Anyway, Friday comes and the date goes super well. We end up hanging out at my place for like 5 hours, with lots of making out and good conversation. It really did seem like she liked me, and a few little things she said, suggested that she wasn't just looking for something casual. We agreed to go to a Museum next Sunday, and everything seems great. I was happy as Larry.

But, again, since the date, the texting has slowed right down. Now I'm not saying at all that I want or expect to talk all night like that all the time, but I've found it very jarring to go from that to how it is now. I don't think I've come off too strong and freaked her out since, despite it making me anxious enough to ask for advice on reddit, I've been sure to not be too much, and to like not double text or come off as clingy/overly keen. I get it's probably just me being silly and anxious, but it's sort of confusing is all.

I guess I'm just wondering now what the deal is? As I said, it felt very jarring to go from texting so constantly to slowing that right down, especially after the date seemed to go so well. She would start the conversations before, but hasn't lately at all. I really like her a lot, and I'm just worried that maybe it isn't really reciprocated or that something happened to change her mind? But then what was with the constant stream of texting before?

He is really spontaneous and I know he doesn’t like staying in one place for long periods of time. I met him about a year ago and he had just moved to my city at the time and once we started dating he decided to stay there for me. However fast forward to a year later, he has just dumped on me that he has all these ideas of what he wants to do. He’s just finishing up his real estate and he told me that he was going to upgrade his courses so that he can practice in my city,  but now he is telling me that the client base and market here doesn’t sound sustainable for him. Then he told me he’s thinking of moving to another province because it’s cheaper to live there and it’s expensive in my city. 

On top of that he told me he feels bad he’s left his family back home. He has a younger sister and he feels bad for leaving her. Clearly his mind is all over the place and he told me that he feels like it’s not fair to me for me to just follow him where he goes because maybe I’ll end up hating the place we move to. I told him that wherever we go I will he happy because I’m with him but he told me I’m just speaking from an emotional standpoint. 

He told me he loves me so much and that he wants to figure out a plan with me. I know he loves me a lot and he said that when we met he didn’t have any expectations and didn’t expect to fall in love with me and date for this long. How am I supposed to figure this out with him if he has to a million different ideas of what he wants to do. He also told me that he wants to take time off work to travel. I literally feel sick and I’ve been crying so much that my eyes hurt.

Ever since I broke up, I became the whole new person. I let people go easily. If I dated people before for some time, it was hard to break things off when we are already into relationships(if we can’t fix the issue after several attempts.) I could miss people and moments. Now I am more “living in the moment”. I can share very intimate moment with the person but I will be totally okay to just forget about it and be thankful that it happened but not ask for more of that. If before, when I started developing feelings for a person I would really get very much into feelings and start thinking about “we”, now I keep thinking about me first always. I can let them go even after a small inconvenience unless they also really try to work on that. This honestly is scaring me because I don’t know if it’s healthy. But at the same time I feel good because I see so many people losing themselves in relationships, giving up things for a person and then nobody even needed this sacrifice from them. So I feel great keeping myself in balance, enjoying the moments but not being way too involved. Mostly doing things to my own benefit, even relationships that I have.

Despite the cultural differences between us it felt like we fit extremely well together personality-wise. 

So this weekend I brought him to meet some of my closest friends out of town. We had a chill evening around a fire just talking and we had a couple drinks. When it was time to leave he asked if we could go see some friends close by that he hasn’t seen in a while. When we got there his friend had kids ranging from babies to younger teens that were all awake at midnight with music blasting crazy loud. I like going to shows and loud music and it was still too loud for me like bordering on painful, I was honestly concerned about the little kids’ hearing and felt super self conscious about the neighbors in this tightly packed residential neighborhood because they actually opened all the windows to make it louder on the street. And my bfs volume also went way up. He was practically yelling on the porch to the point where the friend blasting the music even asked him to quiet down. So much emphasis on LOUD. It threw me way off because my bf is def more outgoing than me but usually soft spoken towards me and tells me he likes that I am more chill. They drank and to dispose of their bottles had a designated place in the yard to smash them. My boyfriend was soo happy seeing his friends for the first time in years so I just waited around patiently and tried to relax despite being super uncomfortable.

Afterwards he said he wanted to go see another friend so he took me down the street and had me follow him to a house where a man was outside. He asked to see the person that lived there and the man was obviously put off because it was now like 1am and a random guy is dropping in for an unannounced visit.  Before this I assumed he had called first. They went back and forth for a bit sorta arguing until the door opened and an old woman recognized him and welcomed us inside and they were all crying tears of joy. I thought, okay, this is strange but it seems to be all good now. I sat while everyone in the house was awoken to come down and visit including a toddler. I got asked to another room with just a bunch of teenagers who were smoking and drinking. One of the boys that lived there that knew my boyfriend said something under his breath making fun of my boyfriend basically indicating he wanted him to go away. It was all so very awkward.

It is not my way at all to be imposing or rude, and I felt like the entire experience visiting his friends I was roped into being just that and had no idea what was going on. Like I thought we were going to casually see some friends and it turned out to be a whole reunion in the middle of the night with people he hadn’t seen in years but obviously meant quite a lot to him. I was happy he got to see them but also confused why it had been so long since we only live about an hour away. 

Idk. I just feel like this kind of changes my view of things between us. Not only did I feel extra uncomfortable tagging along with him but I also am certain he felt uncomfortable with my friends now if his idea of a good time is so drastically different. But things between us when we’re alone are perfect so I’m not sure if I’m being harsh.

My ex made me feel so insecure in every way and I feel like I was in survival mode every day looking for new threats to the relationship. It was codependent so I also feared the end of the relationship so much at the time. 

Ive been single over a year and have had much needed time to reflect on everything that happened and the potential effect it could have on me in future relationships. 

Anyways, I recently met someone who is the opposite of my ex from what I can tell so far; kind, calm, actually listens to me all that good stuff.. we had a connection straight away. We live a little far away and both are going through very busy periods so have only gone on one date. However we do text every day. We don’t text 24/7, which I actually like, it feels healthier and the conversation is more quality over quantity if that makes sense. 

However in my last relationship, lack of a text back always equalled trouble. I was getting the silent treatment for some reason and it always ended in tears. So fast forward to this new person, I haven’t heard back from him in almost 2 days. Thinking logically, this isn’t an issue and I know he’ll get back to me and is most likely busy. But there is part of my brain that is in panic mode and obsessing over this, it’s as if I’m still in my last relationship. I’m kind of embarrassed saying this because we’re not even in a committed relationship but this is what’s happening. In case you haven’t noticed I have an anxious attachment style
