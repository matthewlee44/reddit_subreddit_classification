:'^)

TLDR: Girl I'm interested in may or may not have something with another guy and/or is trying to see multiple options after a break up where I maybe one of them. This is all based on assumptions from the inexperienced anonymous_chico. What should I do?

To begin with although I'm reaching 30, I have zero experience when it comes to dating, approaching women etc. I'm a bit of an introvert, wasn't really in a good state emotionally and due to that let myself go physically. But since two years I'm at a better place and lost weight. Looking better and feeling more confident about myself.

So last year due to corona measures and partnered sports being canceled I started out with a new activity where it was still possible to do partnered up drills. At this activity it's almost 99% of the time in male/female couples. One day there weren't enough women and a replacement came in who got partnered up with me. In short I can describe her as an attractive lady. One who I as an introvert would not dare to approach. Anyways, we had a great lesson together. Made stupid jokes which she could laugh about and got some small talk in to get to know her a bit. Then another lockdown came and didn't see her for 8 months...

FFW to this summer. At the activity I'm doing there are practice nights. So I saw the girl I was having a great lesson with someone and assumed it was her BF. Didn't want to ask her to partner up, so let it fly. But last September she was there at the practice evening and was sitting alone. I asked her and she immediately recognized me and I said I remembered her aswell because I had a great lesson back then. 

At the end of the song I wasn't really thinking of getting to talk with her because I thought she had a BF and sat down, but she instantly came and sat next to me. Wanted to talk about how I was doing, if I was seeing someone etc. As an introvert with no experience at all and seeking something longterm I usually don't want to talk too much about myself with someone I just met, but our conversation felt so natural and comfortable that I was fine to open up a bit. I asked her if she was seeing someone and she said no and that not long ago she came from a break up. The conversation lasted more than hour and afterwards she asked me if I had social media accounts, but I'm not really active at it so we exchanged phone numbers. 

We messaged each other the last few weeks and saw each other at 2-3 practice nights again. So last week I was with her at a practice night and offered to guide her back home for a short distance. She was fine with it, but wanted to eat something first. Couldn't join her because of work in the morning so had to pass. She gave me kiss on the cheek which I may have seen as a sort of signal and asked if I was coming Friday again. I wasn't sure about it and she was all surprised as if I had to be there on Friday. 

So eventually I decided to go on Friday. I saw her and she was with that guy again who I first assumed was her BF, since they were all playful. Decided to ignore her that evening, but when I was at the wardrobe to get something out of my bag she pinched me and talked to me. I wasn't really into it, but tried my best to act all cool. After the practice evening ended she left with the guy and was waving at me, but I looked away and that was it.

For this week we had something planned, but I don't know if I'm still down for it. Don't wanna be a rebound guy who is number 456 on the list, be left in the friendzone or be the sucker who she gets with after her partylife. Haven't messaged her since Friday and don't know what to do. Don't assume things and get to know her better? Ghost her and just let her go?

A few months ago, a girl showed interest in me, heck! she even asked me out. Initially we started out pretty normal, talking about our interests, our dreams, etc. But after a while, the problem started - primarily because of my cultural upbringing. I have been the ""sex negative"" my entire life. I didn't even talk about these things with my friends; in fact I even felt downright awkward talking about things like sex, love, feelings, etc. So, when she tried to take things further, I would freeze - as in I literally couldn't think of a single romantic thing/suggestive jokes to drop in the moment. I couldn't even ask my friends for help, and searching online for help was waste! - all most people say is  ""the girl is already interested in you, then what's the problem take it further"" - but my problem is how? I felt like a complete idiot, as if I was living under a rock. Then a few months later she lost all interest in me and left.

So, I need serious advice on what to do when dating someone? What do people talk about on the phone, or while texting, or while walking on the street - I've seen couples while walking on the street, where guy keeps talking to her and all she does is blush? What were they talk about?

Just before being left on delivered I asked if it was because of her exams but she said that it was because of some other stuff. 20 hours later I had still been left on delivered so I messaged her saying that I hoped she was okay and was sorry if I did something wrong. I then went on to say that I had never told anyone about how I feel because of the drama involved (as everyone always pestered me about it) and because I didn‚Äôt know how she felt about me. I didn‚Äôt actually admit to liking her etc. I finished up by saying that I‚Äôd be keen to meet up again as we had already hung out a couple days before this but I didn‚Äôt want to pressure her into anything. This girl had also told my friend that she didn‚Äôt know if she liked me but wanted him to figure out if I liked her etc. Well it turns out that as soon as I had sent that message, her snapped popped up from 20 hours ago and it was her explaining everything about everything bad going on in her life. It was too late for me to delete my message as she had already seen it. A few minutes later she responded and said that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and that she wasn‚Äôt sure how she felt and how she had a lot going on but was keen to meet up again. My stupid self then sent one of the worst messages which went like

He‚Äôs also the most attractive guy I have ever dated, and also incredibly smart and ambitious.I feel like a tongue tied teenager around him so to a degree I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to put down my walls as much as I would like. 

I actually feel like I may be an inadequate match. I‚Äôve never felt like that before, actually usually it‚Äôs the other way around. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I am still questioning the direction, meaning, and purpose of my life- the last 4 years was a bit of a mid life crisis for me- I‚Äôm not currently in it anymore but that‚Äôs probably another reason I‚Äôm intimidated by him.

Is it when you are aesthetically attracted/mentally recognize someone as your type looks-wise, but don‚Äôt feel sexual or romantic attraction yet? 

Or is it when you recognize a specific personality trait, whether or not someone is your type looks wise, that can create a mental/emotional attraction which will lead to a physical attraction? 

Is it when you feel initially lukewarm but let a romantic/sexual spark develop through getting to know their personality? 

Does baseline attraction mean the spark/chemistry start as a small ember and slowly starts burning more intensely?  If so, how does your perception of someone‚Äôs looks influence the existence of the spark?

So it all started with me and this girl meeting at the start of school. I develop a crush on her and best comes to best we start talking, then holding hands, then hugging/cuddling, then came the question, ""will you be my girlfriend"". She says yes. Things go great for about 2 weeks until one day she stops holding my hand, hugging me, stops kissing me, stops calling me, stops making an effort to call at all, changes my name in her bio from ""my name&lt;33"" to just ""my first initial"" , takes me off her wallpaper, changes my highlight on her insta page from ""my initial&lt;3"" to just a moon emoji. Basically just acting as if we werent even together anymore. This happened in a span of just one week. That week was the worst of my life, because I was stressing that maybe i wasnt good enough for her and that i had maybe done something wrong.

When i finally confront her 4 days after she started changing, she says "" I need to be honest with you. i haven‚Äôt been feeling myself I know that i like you and I thought i was ready to date but ive been reflecting these past days and im not. Im terrified of getting hurt and im terrified of hurting you. I feel so many emotions and its eating me up i‚Äôm so confused about dating again. I thought that I was healed from what had previously happened to me but clearly im not. I don‚Äôt know how to tell you for what is seemed the longest week but i need to focus on myself. I hate to do this to you especially since you are so perfect and i hate to hurt you it aches my heart.. the reason i‚Äôm telling you now is that i‚Äôm really hurting myself and I don‚Äôt want myself to hurt you in the future. I hope you understand me and dont bash me for how i feel but i‚Äôm not okay currently I need time to heal and find myself and love myself again. "".

I reply with blabber about how she didnt tell me anything and that I was upset that she didnt let me know about any past relationships.( So i didnt know anything about her past basically) Worst then comes to worst and i brake up with her because of the stress she caused me that week.

The conversation continues and to sum up the paragraphs and paragraphs we wrote each other, she is basically dealing with too many emotions and she is overwhelmed and is scared of being hurt or hurting me( because of past relationships apparently)

Now that thats over and explained, now to my point. I want her back. We really couldve been something amazing. She was perfect for me.(notice how i didnt say perfect, I said perfect for ME) She understood my humor, talked a lot, cared about me, showed A LOT of physical affection( up until the week of course),was attractive, funny, and much more.

Now, my biggest paradox, im not really sure if im being blinded by emotions or not but im having trouble seeing exactly what she did wrong to make me break up with her. (Which is why im asking reddit) I love her, and I cant stand looking at her, thinking about her, or being at places where we previously had a date.

Thanks for being around when I've needed someone to lend an ear :) I appreciate this community and the insights I've gotten from it!

I am a 29F in an exclusive relationship with a 35M for the last 6 months. It has been fairly ok - a few bumps here and there as we both came in with unhealed wounds (as is normal), but are working through them. We both have long standing histories of **obsessing** over people that have by and large turned out toxic for our mental well being.

Some background about us - we are both simple, grounded, caring people, committed to growing and supporting each other. The sex is great, but we both don't quite feel 'in-love'. For him love means 'that light-headed / airy feeling over the clouds'. For me, I think love is partnership - a conscious choice made to build a life together, to learn together and to commit to continuing to choose each other. Although I have felt a strong surge of emotions in the past with my toxic exe's, I do understand now that 'love' is NOT obsession, love is not what's shown in the movies, and by my definition I think this is love.

What I find strange is the fact that it's been 6 months and he hasn't really confessed feeling 'in love' with me. We continue having great sex, spending time / effort into nurturing this relationship but he doesn't quite think it's love. I am feeling off about being intimate with someone who really enjoys the sex but isn't quite feeling it. It's making me feel low-value coz I wanna feel wanted, and not with someone who's 'not feeling it but doing it anyway'.

I am thinking of expressing how I feel and also maybe drawing a boundary, perhaps telling him that we work to continue nurturing the friendship / relationship without being intimate and see if any 'romantic feelings' come up as those are important to him, but I am not sure if I am on the right track.

Would love to hear this communities thoughts on this. TIA!

Few days pass and she messages me about her food. I turn it into a date idea and suggest we cook together sometime. Which she likes the idea of, but we don't actually plan a date.


I went over to see my friends that live in the same complex as her and went out for a cigarette and start chatting to a friend of mine who borrowed something from her. She comes out to get it and didn't realize I would be there. Us 3 are having a conversation and the entire time she had her back to me and didn't really look at me. I noticed she didn't have any make up on and just assumed she was self conscious or something?


Later that night I message her about it and we're talking she just said she was embarrassed and didn't expect me to be there. End up talking for a while and I invite her to come over for a meal which she accepts but says she might have to bail on because of her work load, fair enough I just say no worries.


I message her the following day if she is still interested in coming which she says she really wants too but can't as she has to much studying to do.

Looking back, I believe that because I had some residual guilt over my husband committing suicide and second guessed whether or not my boundaries were too ""harsh"" and that is what led me to stay in a bad relationship after for as long as I did.

I have my first date Wednesday since my last relationship ended with a man I met last week. I'm worried that I won't be able to find a healthy medium between feeling too strict and too lenient. The man (41m) I met is polite so far, carries himself well, and although he's usually pretty busy because he's a doctor(heart surgeon) he does seem to call/text promptly and be respectful of my time.

The general consensus was that she should not be dating right now...

31m met 29f online. We went out 5 times and, as much as I hate to be that guy posting this on Reddit, we are a great match. At least on paper. We hit on pretty much every big relationship thing.

First 2 dates were great, and it became obvious that I would be interested in pursuing a relationship with her. I subtly hinted at that, but she was hot and cold. 3rd date was a trainwreck of awkwardness. She finally admitted that she had only been single a few weeks when we first me, and that she was having trouble. Her relationship was only a couple months long, but sounds like it was full of drama and moved and ended fast.

I got out of a 2 year relationship where we were living together 4 months ago. And even though I'm ready to mentally invest in a new person, I'm finding I'm still rusty in the dating game. So at least part of this awkwardness is on me too.

We agreed to go out again. This time she drove 45 minutes to my place. We went to dinner, which went smoothly. So I asked her back to my apartment (I live alone and she knew this) and she agreed. She seemed very nervous once we got there and things got awkward again. I walked her to her car, she gave a tight hug, and I went in for a kiss. She accepted but it still felt weird given the dynamic.

So I texted her a couple days later. I explained that I felt like she is unavailable right now. And that she should sort things out and then let me know when she does. That I like her and my door is open.

She blew up my phone explaining her past relationships have been different. She dates an abusive alcoholic for 4 years. And her most recent ex was depressed and their relationship revolved around ""fixing"" eachother. And that her mother is twice divorced to alcoholics and that's what she knew growing up. She told me shes not used to ""mature emotionally available men"". I mean, I'm a nice human being but I don't think I'm too ""nice"" in the sense that I'm a people pleaser. I never made any grand gestures to her or anything over the top. I'm just a mentally healthy adult with my life together and I'm not an asshole to strangers. I dont like taking advantage of people. She asked for another chance and invited me to an amusement park with her female friends and their boyfriends.

Against my better judgement I accepted. I like roller coasters too much (so does she) to turn down an offer like that. But given everything going on between us I knew it would be awkward, and it was. The day came and everyone dropped out except for her one female friend. 

So a couple days after, now she basically texts me the same thing that I texted her after date 4. She ends it with me. I'm like uhh what, I just suggested that and you texted me your autobiography and practically begged for another chance, just to end it with me when I give it to you?? I'm so confused.

The back and forth with this girl has caused me a serious headache. Normally I would move on, but I do really like her.

I go no contact and she drunk texts me after a couple days ""Yo"" ""I had 2 sour monkeys and I'm like drunk"" ""What is this life lol?""

Tidbit also, we hold hands on our date but I always have to be the one to initiate, and she doesnt really say anything about how she finds me cute / initiates any physical touch, nor do we flirt or say anything remotely sexual on text. Im kinda concerned im being strung along.

Excited to see what‚Äôs out there. At first I wasn‚Äôt optimistic about getting matches, it‚Äôs not like tinder where I would get over 100 likes in the first couple hours.

 I had some serious reservations about trying to keep up with multiple people at once. But I‚Äôve matched with a good amount of people and I‚Äôm doing my best trying to engage and interact. 

My problem is that I‚Äôm a fairly shy person and I have social anxiety. People in general are not my strong suit, meeting new people for me is hard, more times than not I‚Äôm just misunderstood. 

I can be a little more outgoing than normal over text, even then I‚Äôm still not the most interactive. Texting people all the time feels more like a chore. There‚Äôs one guy I‚Äôve been texting and he‚Äôs the one that reaches out everyday. I‚Äôm used to getting absolutely no notifications so me keeping up with a conversation it‚Äôs not normal for me. I feel bad because I want to try, I want to meet new people and see where things go. I try my best but my best isn‚Äôt always good enough 

The other half of the problem is meeting  people in person, it‚Äôs kinda like I shut down, sure I talk but I‚Äôm not that open. It takes me a while to open up to people. Besides talking about the basics I get quite and don‚Äôt have much else to say. I feel like this might be a turn off for people. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I talk to someone and they lose interest and stop talking and I thinks it‚Äôs because how quite I am. 

I hate it and I sometimes wish that they knew that if they would have held on just a little while longer they could have experienced the real me. The real me is outgoing, loved  to laugh and have a good time. What people might see is someone who is shy with a cold demeanor. Unfortunately I‚Äôm always trying to protect myself in that way but I‚Äôm capable of being myself. People are so quick to judge and  it‚Äôs based solely on a couple of conversations.

Every few months he would send me a snap, I wouldn't reply or I'd reply with my view. I never removed him from Snapchat but I removed everyone else I talked to before. I have no idea why I didn't remove him, but I just didn't. He is a very beautiful man, and I wonder if part of me was scared of rejection. 

I broke up with my boyfriend last week because I never felt really anything for him and he has some severe mental illness I'm not willing to deal with.  I actually went and met this guy I blew off, and holy shit. I'm not sure what this feeling was, but he described it before I did, so it wasn't just me. We met and all he said was ""Wow!"" From like 20 feet away, and he came over and stood by me and he couldn't stop smiling. We both laughed. I was speechless. He is beautiful, he's nice, he is a hardworker. At the bar we went to I couldn't stop staring at him when he was talking, and it felt unreal. I've never once felt this before. I never said any of this outlook, but he did. He also said he felt compelled to keep me on snapchat even though I ignored him and blew him off. 

We did end up making out in his truck, and he stopped me from going any further. I have never done that on a 1st date. He makes me feel comfortable. He said he feels something, and doesn't want to mess it up by being too sexual with me, so he told me he wants to wait. He previously sent me naked snaps, and since we met he hasn't, he has now sent the same place he was naked but fully clothed now. He has called me every night after work though, he asked me on a 2nd date before we even left the first date and let me know how excited he is to see me again. He did notice how I was looking at him in the bar and he said most people think he looks angry, and he never had anyone look at him like that before. 

Tldr; I have absolutely no idea what is going on and if it should be alarming me, but I like it a whole lot. It's very weird to me. He is 27, I am 26. Is this a normal thing to feel?

I (24F) recently met someone (22F) through my town's martial arts gym. It took about two months from our first ""hello"" until it dawned on us that something was up. Lots of ribbing, sarcastic flirting, but also feeling like we've known each other for years. I felt close enough to confide in them about having feelings for someone of the same gender as me for the first time in my life but lied about meeting them through work. A couple of weeks later and after a few drinks, they asked me if I wanted to talk more about it. I fessed up that my \*crush\* was on someone at our gym to which they said that they also like another woman at the gym (a surprise to me as both of our dating histories only involved men). Turns out we both had feelings for eachother! Similar to me, I was the first woman they had any feelings for that wasn't a celebrity or fictional character. But...after giving ourselves a day to think on it, they told me they didn't want to pursue anything because they wanted to keep the gym a safe space - they didn't want both the good and bad of dating a training partner ruining that environment. For more context, they were involved in a pretty toxic relationship \~2 years ago and found martial arts as a way to escape it and the gym as a place that felt like they could be themselves. Every part of me knew that this was perfectly reasonable given their past and also knowing that gym relationships can be iffy (but if both parties are mature enough, it shouldn't be that big of an issue, right?). I tried to play to their emotions and asked why they wouldn't want to figure this new thing out with someone they trusted - they pretty much defaulted to wanting to keep the boundary they set for themselves. But beyond that I had nothing else to say because anything would come off as me disrespecting or pressuring them. 

We pretty much tried to go back to normal as soon as possible...back to still seeing eachother 4 times/week at the gym and also spending HOURS on weekends together or with our mutual friend. 

About two weeks after deciding not to do anything, I subconsciously acted a little weird one night and they noticed and called me out on it. I admitted that my feelings for them were still there and they admitted the same. Apparently they had spent a lot of time trying to see how they could make this work but decided that not dating was ""non-negotiable"" for them. Their friends that had seen them through their previous relationship also agreed that this would be a bad idea. Even with that, we ended that convo by agreeing to talk about things if it was on our minds, as long as it will be a productive discussion and not one spent lamenting. This was the last time we've talked about all of this. But we've talked about dating in general with them once mentioning that they don't know how to know when they're ready for a healthy relationship. This reminded me that they are pretty damn young and still have a lot of growing to do, as do I...which lodged the desire to keep hanging onto this in case something changes in the future as our friendship evolves.

I've talked to my close friends about this. I've semi-joked that I think something may just \*happen\* one night, but I'm afraid that will spell disaster for our friendship if we don't handle it well the next day. My more optimistic friends think I should hold onto hope. My more logical friends think they same but also to protect myself and not stop myself from dating other people (as if meeting people is easy for me). My more pessimistic friends noticed that our friendship is essentially us dating without calling it dating, which is not a good situation for me because they were the one to set this boundary. But all of my friends agreed that the other person will have to be the one to initiate anything because any of my attempts to do anything would be disrespectful to them and their wishes...leaving me to just wait around for them. 

Now it's been a month since our first convo (which I know really isn't that much time) and I've noticed my feelings for them comes in waves. Days will go by and I think staying friends will be a good/okay thing and then I fall into a deep hole constantly thinking about them, our time together, and how sweet it would be if we could make something work. I'm not looking through rose tinted glasses thinking about how magical things would be or how good we would be together, I just think this would be a beneficial thing to explore together. 

Shoud I actively try to hold onto this in case something changes? Should I move on and forget it (this actively occupies my mind on the daily and it would be nice if it didn't)?

""Me and so-and-so have a date next week, but I'm not sure if they really want to go on it. I don't want them to feel awkward about going out with me, so I'm thinking I should text them and (a) tell them they don't have to go if they don't want to, or (b) cancel the date.""

And it's so sad because I used to feel the same way back when I wasn't as confident of a dater as I am now.

Be mindful that dating can feel like a high-stakes game at times, where losing feels catastrophic. We can often end up putting so much pressure on ourselves to be perfect, or say the right thing... but we also put pressure on the other person to have to show us a high level of like at ALL times.

That's not to say the person we're taking out shouldn't like us a lot, but the intensity in which they show that like to us will change from day to day. They might be consistently texting us back one day, then be slow to do so the next day. When you're getting to know someone, it can feel in those moments like interest is waning, but you haven't spent enough time with them to know the ebb and flow of their emotions, their work schedule, or other things that may make them not be so enthusiastic about you all the time.

I say this because our feelings about a situation can make us feel like one thing is happening when it's actually not, i.e. that the person we've asked out doesn't really want to do it when they actually do, in spite of how you're viewing it. I've had many times where I asked someone out and thought they were just doing it out of pity, only to find out by the end of the night that they were DEFINITELY in to me.

So, if you've set a date with someone, you have to let it play out. Trying to preemptively cancel a date isn't necessary; if the person you've asked out doesn't want to go out anymore, they are more than capable of finding a way out of seeing you, usually in a respectful way. Yes, it will still probably bruise your ego a bit (that's the ""feelings"" part we're all trying to avoid), but you get used to it over time.

I (25F) was dating this guy (23M) and after a couple months of dating we mutually broke up because he was moving for school. We both agreed long distance was going to be difficult and it would be better breaking up. I tried setting boundaries with him after but he kept crossing them. He introduced me to his friend group (all friends from high school) and coworkers. They were all considering me his girlfriend which I found odd but kind of ignored it. 


His last week home we spent every day together and he had me keep our blanket from our first date. After his moved we spoke basically every day and his friends invited me out quite often. 

Recently he told me that he spoke to his mother who I never met and she wanted to offer me a job at her location. I found it interesting she even knew I existed cause I thought he never spoke about me. 

After that he went a bit MIA for a couple days and called me to motivate me to take this job opportunity. Then told me he was actually on tinder now and he didn‚Äôt want me to feel weird working with his mom or being with his friends since they all liked me. I was hurt by this because well I had hope he‚Äôd want to work this out even though I knew it was going to be difficult. 

Flash forward to this weekend!
I had lunch with one of his friends who I am close with. I was open and honest about how I was feeling since I didn‚Äôt want to make things weird. But found out she had no idea we were broken up.

Long greasy Covid hair, flip flops that show off their long yellow toenails, hoodies so old you can‚Äôt make out the logo anymore, dirty track pants or jeans that keep falling down exposing his boxers. One guy even came straight from the gym and smelled terrible. 

I figured that since coffee is so casual and low-effort I could just do the same. I would shower but show up with my hair in a lazy bun, glasses, zero makeup (no I don‚Äôt have perfect skin), faded grown out manicures, loosely fitted t-shirt, jeans and sneakers. Did this 3 times and every single guy has been disappointed and complained, even though I was at least clean and my clothes fit much better than theirs. They would tell me how good I look on my Instagram (I dress up when I go out with female friends), how they love girls in dresses and heels etc. 

I however do not want to spend so much time and effort dressing up unless it is mutual and I think that is fair.
