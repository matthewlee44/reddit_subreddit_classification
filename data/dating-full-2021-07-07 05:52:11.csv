He rarely online during the day (sometimes he stays offline for several days) since 2 months ago. Meaning that he never text me first. I have raised this issue to him and he said that he just not the type to text and he hate seeing all the unread text from his groups. He also said that he only replies to my text. It's true, he always reply to my text but only at night. There was one time he just ignore my text and didn't text me for whole week.

He never calls me. It was always me who initiate the calls. However, when I try to end the call, he would always stop me and ask me to stay. 

His friends know about me. He post about me online and I was invited to join his group WhatsApp with his friends last month.

I just don't understand him. He rarely says romantic words but when I sulk or mad, he will say that he loves me. 

He never compliments me and always tease me (i don't really mind though but looking at his action, it starting to bother me).

He always on discord playing games with his friends. However when I ask to call me, he would leave his games and spend his time with me. Only if I ask for his time. 

Idk if I'm overly sensitive but as this is my first relationship ever, I am so confused with his treatment in this relationship.

Please give me some advice on how to handle this kind of situation. I'm sorry for my bad english as I'm not a native speaker.

The day he left to the airport  I hugged and kissed him goodbye. Ever since that day I didn’t stop thinking about him and miss him  everyday.  Its been three months since he left.  Recently,  our conversation became dry and dies quickly.  He comments on my Instagram stories  and reacts to them sometimes but nothing more. 

I’ve been feeling so lonely these days and I keep fighting the urge to  text him because If I do I might  mess things up. I also don’t want to sound so desperate and annoying.

My friend told me i should move on and stop worshiping him lol . But I just want to keep our conversation alive. I thought maybe it’s okay if i chat with him about my new job for example or the new city recently I moved to..

So after I got back, I texted her one or two hour later, ""I had a fun date today, btw!"" She said, ""Oh good lol I had fun too!"". Well, that was our last communication, yesterday, and there was none today.

I was originally thinking about texting her this Thursday (two days from now) to ask if she's still down this weekend, but I wonder if I just text her tomorrow? Like hey what's up?

**I (22m)** went to a top 10 program in California and did well in school/career/etc. I will be doing a MS in CS in a top 10 program this fall hoping to make some bigger bux. **She (22f)** went to a top 50 program and did no extra curricular.  She will be ""exploring"" and ""volunteering"" at hospitals later in the future to determine what she wants to do..... She also does not have a resume yet....., while I have held over 3+ internships and was recently promoted to senior data analyst at my university research lab.....

**Why are we still together?**

1. We survived a long distance (60-mile relationship) for over 3+ years and love each other's company very much
2. We are each other's first for everything and our high school sweethearts (hs dances, proms, kisses, etc)
3. We would stay at each other's college apartments over the weekends and absolutely loved the time we spent together over the weekends, sleeping over, eating every meal tog, and etc.

**Why we should NOT be together?**

1. Her parents don't like me cuz of past high school drama. Her parents used to only let her go out with me for 3 hrs max and that drove me crazy. My parents don't know cuz my parents will not like background (height, education, work exp, uncertain future plans, etc) Yes my parents do not know of a 5 yr relationship and I don't know how to tell them....
2. She is not fully ""independent"" yet. Her parents are super strict on her going out and does not let her sleepover, go out with me on consecutive days, and she still has to ask for permission for everything. This drives me crazy because she does not make her own choices and cant sleep over on the weekends like the good old days.
3. She's extremely introverted and does not like going out very much. I love going out to the gym, playing tennis, hiking with a bunch of friends, and meeting all sorts of people. I am sorta of an ambivert.
4. I am financially stable, been saving up for already 4 years, and have predictable future plans financially and professionally. I have no idea what she will be doing this fall, next year, or whatever her future plans may be..... The best response I got from her is that she will be getting either an EMT or Certified Nurse Assistant certificate and try to volunteer in a hospital. She does not even have a resume :/ (Her family is significantly more well off than mine, if that adds some rationality)

I liked her and I think she's attractive, both physically and personality wise (at least the part of her personality I got to know)

After this first date though, she said she didn't feel ""instant click or chemistry"" but she did believe in love that can grow over time. I can understand this. She's been through some hard times with her ex and I can imagine she's a bit more cautious now. We agreed to see each other again when the kids are gone on sports camp early July. 

Earlier this week, I asked if she wanted to meet again and she said yes, but she also said that she preferred not to meet with the prospect of a relationship in mind but just to have  good time. She said that she does believe in this chemistry she spoke about earlier after all and didn't feel it with me. She then proceeded to invite me over to her house this weekend, at night, to watch a movie together cosy in her sofa while the kids are not home (her words).

I mean what the fuck? Usually, when a woman invites a guy in her home on a second date, at night, when she's alone to watch a movie that's a sign she's interested, but then why did she say she didn't feel the chemistry?

On one hand, I want to go because I'm genuinely curious as how the evening will turn out and what she actually wants, on the other hand, I don't want to get into the ""you're a friend and we'll never be more but I value our friendship"" story because well, A) I have enough friends already and B) I find her attractive and if it's not reciprocal, I'm not gonna put myself through the torture of being ""just a friend""

But I'm just really curious what she wants and how that evening watching movies would turn out. Either way, I'd like some closure on this and if it's gonna be a ""let's just be friends"" scenario, I'm gonna respectfully decline, turn around and walk the fuck away. I made the mistake of keeping myself in the friendzone in the past. Never again.

What do you think I should expect? Is it OK to tell her I want us both to be direct and put our cards on the table as to what we expect in whatever's going on between us?

I am fortunate enough to have found someone through the rollercoast of online dating so rather than go AFK, I wanted to share my experiences which I hope will be of help. I spent a long time trying to dial in exactly what it was that made me go from pretty unsuccessful in (both online and in person) dating to successful. Please bear in mind that this is my own personal experiences and won't necessarily be exactly translatable to how you experience dating. I'm sure plenty of people may come back saying well I have all those things and I'm still not getting anywhere. I am truly sorry to hear that, but I just wanted to lay out what worked for **me**. This is the sort of information I would have really appreciated when I was starting out. To be clear, this is also very much coming from the perspective of a guy but I hope it might still be interesting to hear for the women out there!

For reference, I am an average height mixed-Asian 26 year old male in the UK. By no means particularly good looking but I have managed to attract some really attractive girls. Another bit of context... Prior to doing the whole dating thing again a few months previous, I came out of a nearly 3 year relationship where I had found out she was cheating on me with multiple people the entire time and got into a relationship with another person. I was living with her and it was obviously very traumatic. I managed to work on my mental health through many one-on-one chats with my amazing sister and mates and it was truly priceless in helping me recover. \*\*DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH\*\* and take a break if you need to. Anyway, onto the advice...

*How do I define the unsuccessful and successful stages in my dating life?*

The unsuccessful stage (let's call it the first stage) was me doing dating on and off for about 3 years in my early twenties. In this time I had dates with 4 girls, all of whom at some point down the line rejected me. I wanted to experience different people but didn't sleep with any of them. 

In the second stage, where I was successful, I was 26 and within a couple of weeks I managed to get 3 dates in one week. The first date went really well and ended in a hook-up, the second one I let down gently as I wasn't really interested and the third girl is now my gf. I went into it with the mindset of having some fun (no real intention of rushing into another relationship) but it ended up just falling into place.

I'm going to split the advice into two sections: 

1) Things I did **before** the date

2) Things I did **during** the date 

\*\*\*\*\*

**Things I did before the date:**

i) **High self-esteem**. This for me is the most important one by a country mile. All of these posts I've seen about being confident... I think it is a sort of confidence but it's more nuanced than that. It's confidence in yourself. For me, when I really sat down and thought about what had materially changed between before and now, it was that I had high self-esteem now. I got this high self-esteem through forming strong and lasting relationships with mates and my family and through a strong sense of worth in my job. When you feel this, rejection doesn't hurt so much, you tend not to overthink things so much and you bring your best self. 

I can't tell you exactly where I got this high self-esteem/self-worth from. Prior to doing the whole dating thing again, I came out of a nearly 3 year relationship where I had found out she was cheating on me with multiple people the entire time and got into a relationship with another person. I prioritised my mental health and spoke for hours one on one with my sister and had phone calls with my mates to work through it and unpack everything. Honestly, it worked wonders and I found myself confident and raring to go by the end of it. Of course, this took several months, and it was a serious emotional rollercoaster but I wanted to make it work and I spent a lot of time in the outdoors and exercising which definitely paved the way for a better me.   

ii) **Mindset shift**. I'm sure this is linked to i) but my mindset completely shifted when I went into dating this time round. Rather than thinking, how do I act in a certain way to impress this girl so that she'll fall for me and this can go further... My mindset was much more selfish. The thought process was now: let's see if this girl is a fit for me... what does ***she*** bring to the table? Part of this came from the fact that because I had good self-esteem I felt like I was worthy of someone attractive and desirable, because ***I*** was attractive and desirable. The other side of the mindset shift is viewing online dating as a bit of a side hustle i.e. it's not your main 'thing'. You definitely need to put time into it to be successful as an average guy but try to view it through a light-hearted lens as a bit of fun.

iii) **Have a GREAT profile**. I cannot overstate this one enough. I don't really know why this didn't hit me enough when I was dating previously and having little success (very few matches let alone dates). You are competing against other guys... you need a **great** profile to stand out. Clear shots in good lighting which make you look interesting, show off your interests and your hobbies. By having a great profile, not only do you stand out but you demonstrate to someone that you put effort into things and that's probably a good signal for any potential partner. As an average looking guy, you NEED a GREAT profile to stand out. I've spent so long looking through profile reviews and honestly so many of them aren't great at all. 

When I did this properly, I spent easily 3-4 hours doing a photo shoot with my sister (I would've honestly paid someone otherwise). 95% of the shots were bad but 1 in 20 was great and they were the ones I used. Yes it was cringey but once it's done, it's done. The difference was very material. A few years ago, I was getting 1-2 matches a month on Tinder and now I was getting a solid 1 match a day on average on Hinge. Obviously, it's still not tonnes compared to what attractive girls can get but it's about the quality of matches. You do obviously need some quantity of matches though, which is where a great profile comes into play.  

iv) **Set a date up quickly**. The successful interactions I had with the app were successful because I moved quickly. Girls have a lot of options (my current gf who I met on Hinge told me she got 100+ likes in a day on Hinge before). If they have a lot of options, don't draw things out. Be confident, make a move and if they're not interested then move on. The successful dates I had involved matching, couple of messages on the app, get their whatsapp, then try to set up a date within 3 days or so (definitely within a week). When you move quickly, you're new and interesting and they have less chance to lose interest. 

Additionally, you should move quickly to protect yourself. I say this because by getting a date in quickly, you give yourself less chance to become over-invested in someone and start overthinking things based on your fairytale image of what this person 'could' be. This is something I definitely did and this is a good way to combat it. 

v) **Hinge**. This is very personal and specific to me but I found Hinge to be far far better than the apps I was using a few years back (Tinder / Bumble / Coffee meets Bagel). The key USP on Hinge is that **you can message someone before you've matched with them**. This is such a powerful tool as a guy. If you can throw together an observant/funny message about something in their profile it really does boost your chances of matching.

vi) **Being older**. I know this might not seem like helpful advice but I wanted to include it anyway to give some of the younger guys a bit of perspective if they're struggling. I found that there was a material difference between online dating at 21/22/23 as a guy and dating at 26. Aside from the obvious maturity gains, from my experience, girls tend to date guys who are at least their age or older, which means the pool of datable girls is very small in your early twenties. Additionally, I found girls are generally looking for less serious things in their early twenties and get a lot more serious about finding a partner in their mid-twenties. I wanted to call this out because I've seen a number of posts about guys struggling in their early twenties and I think particularly in online dating it is just straight up fucking hard as a guy in your early twenties. You're much better off in person I reckon.   

&amp;#x200B;

 **Things I did during the date:**

i) **A first date doesn't have to be expensive, something intimate and simple is much much better**. My successful dates didn't involve fancy restaurants or bars. Instead, we sat by a river in a public place with a bottle of wine. I also think having a little bit of darkness works wonders for amping up any sexual tension between the two of you. Also, dinner dates are terrible first dates IMO because if there isn't chemistry then that's heightened between the two of you. Also, you're usually sitting opposite so there's no way to break the touch barrier (see ii)). Remember, you don't know each other for a first date so why would you go all out. A nice dinner on a third date, sure! But not for a first date!

ii) **Break the touch barrier early**. I understand COVID has made this much more difficult but as more and more people are vaccinated, you really HAVE to break the touch barrier with them and be physical early on. In normal times, I would always give a kiss on the cheek when I first meet them. A relationship (if that's what you're going for) cannot form if there is no intimacy. It's dead in the water. You need to show you're interested and you need to escalate that interest over time so she's comfortable with you. 

iii) **Keep the conversation fun and light-hearted**. Strike the balance of having an interesting and nuanced opinion on things, don't be afraid to disagree but definitely don't be dogmatic about anything. I would personally avoid topics like politics on a first date and instead stick to topics like: hobbies, sports, pets etc. The heavier stuff can come later on when you both feel you're a match.

iv) **If it's going well, tell her!** Sometimes people need a bit of reassurance and there's nothing wrong with making yourself a little vulnerable. Telling her that you're having a good time and giving her the opportunity to agree (maybe do this a couple of hours in) is also a good segue into setting up a second date (if you're feeling it)!

&amp;#x200B;

The irony of this post is that now that I have a different mindset, I look back and cringe slightly at how I was. I know now that if I had met someone with my old mindset while dating now, I definitely would have rejected me. But, it's all a learning experience and I'm glad I've gone through it.

Just a little backstory, ok? :)

&amp;#x200B;

I was brought to Germany by age of 12 by my parents together with my 5 years younger brother.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2 uncles and 2 aunts came from my mothers side came here too.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a cousin one year younger than me and she found a Romanian boyfriend.( We are all Romanians). My cousin age 28 came later too here. The cousin of my fathers side. He found too a Romanian girlfriend here in Germany. The female friend of my cousin after 5 failed relationships also found a Romanian boyfriend at the end and they are very happy together. My younger brother also got a crush on Romanian teen here in his German school.

&amp;#x200B;

But me.... I had a girlfriend but she was German..... and our relationship could not last more than 4 months. Girls in Germany prefer either Germans or guys born in Germany. I am neither.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to go in my country and make friends there. I met 2 situations. Either they asked me:"" Oh are you from abroad, I think you earn very much right? or Oh you are really sweet, but I don't want to leave my country...sorry...

I really can't flirt. I'm terrified of even making eye contact with people when I'm out and about. When it comes to non romantic/sexual things I am completely fine. I'm very extroverted and social, and guys I have very much not been interested in have then thought I was flirting, but when it comes to flirting I freeze up. My two cents is that due to past heavy childhood bullying I'm scared of the person being not just ""not interested"", but grossed out and angry that I tried to flirt with them. I'm very aware that this logic is insanely stupid, but I can't really get away from it! It also causes me to not get when people are flirting with me, because I could never assume that about something. That part has gotten a little better, but I still am rubbish at picking up VERY obvious hints. 

The interesting crux here is that I've done really well when it comes to dating - but almost exclusively on apps. When I KNOW someone is interested I can talk to them like normally (I still can't flirt for shit but I'm quite charming), and on some plane of existence I know I'm good looking and a catch - that knowledge just absolutely vanishes as soon as I am faced with the prospect of flirting.

I'm recently single and I'm so tired of dating apps from my last single period. I want to meet people organically, but how do I do that if I can't escalate anything ever?

Last night, I went on a second date with someone I am pretty excited about. We planned to meet up, grab dinner, and walk around downtown looking for dessert and/or drinks. 

Dinner was fantastic - conversation flowed, food was good, and we were all smiles =). So I threw caution to the wind and tried to hold her hand while we walked around afterward (sort-of - I asked if it was okay because it was just a second date). She was cool with it, and I'm pretty sure I was flooded with endorphins or whatever because I was on cloud 9 haha.

We circled the area a few times, and most of the places we were interested in were surprisingly closed (even places we both researched ahead of time that claimed to be open). This forced us to one of the few bars that was open, which had a Jazz night that literally started 5 minutes after we arrived! It was fantastic! And the atmosphere allowed us to get a little closer too (more hand-holding, put my arm around her, etc.).

Hours later, we are at her car sharing an ""awkward"" first kiss haha. I loved it!

I'm hopeful with this one. I've finally met someone who makes me want to put down all the apps and see where things go. I have no expectations, and I know that I barely know her.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to put as much information as possible as I really have no sense of direction. About a month ago, I (22) started talking to this girl (21) via Instagram after we started following each other. I must point out, I think she may be the most beautiful person I've ever talked to. From the get-go, I let her know that I'd like to take her out on a date if all goes well. She said that was sweet and said that I should know that she's very terrible at texting ahead of time. She was not wrong. It wasn't exactly terrible but she'd maybe text me three messages a day but they were lengthy. She then explained to me the reasoning behind her late texts and it's because she works two jobs each day of the week. She even gave me her work schedule which was thoughtful but unnecessary. I appreciated it though. Anyways, as I talk to her, I realize we have so much in common that it almost feels like she was put in my life on purpose. We shared the same interests in music, games, shows, foods, etc. People sometimes say that it's boring dating someone who is exactly like you but I say otherwise. We were getting along very well and she was very sweet. Also, I must point out as well that she is hilarious. No offense to the previous girls I've dated but they just weren't funny so this is a huge plus for me. About two weeks into talking, I plan a date with her. She loves the plans but then informs me that she's not sure what would be a good day as it is only on weekends that she gets off early. She explains that she hangs out with friends now and then only on weekends as that is her only free time (if any). She offered Saturday but says she wasn't sure as she needed to pick out a gift for her father. I agreed but didn't get my hopes up. As I thought, she let me know that she didn't think there'd be enough time for a date since she gets off work late and she needed to get a gift. I let her know I understand and we keep talking. Maybe three weeks in, I stop getting a response out of nowhere for two days straight. I wasn't sure if I should text her again or not. I was thinking about how if she really wanted to talk to me, she would text me. I asked my best friend for advice and she told me that I shouldn't let my ego get to me and that I should just message her again. I did as she said and messaged her with a plan for another date on the day before July 4th. She quickly responds and lets me know that she was going to Austin for the weekend to celebrate her brother's birthday on July 4th.  I'm a patient person but at this point, I felt like I was getting played. I let her know that I understand but if she doesn't want to go on a date, I'd be completely fine and that she can be honest. She responds with, "" I wish I had more free time tbh I usually go out with friends once I'm off work but it's a short hangout. I know you said you don't mind but I wanna enjoy our time together too."" This of course makes me feel appreciated but still, no confirmed date. I last got a response from her this past July 4th. It's been nearly three days now and I'm not sure what to do. I hope this doesn't sound narcissistic but since high school, I've never had problems with getting girls so all this ""ghosting"" is new to me. Although I don't necessarily have feelings for this girl, I really do like her. And I think she's interested in me as well after all this time but it just doesn't make sense to me. If she were actually into me, she wouldn't go nearly three days without talking to me right? And if she isn't into me, why entertain the idea for nearly a month? I just don't know if I should continue talking to her or move on. Sometimes I hear that girls like to be pursued but at the same time, I don't think it's right to go after someone who doesn't match the same energy as you. I know I ultimately have to make this decision on my own but I would really appreciate any advice that the Reddit dating pros can give me.

So this girl I met on Tinder... I was very attracted to her. After one date, I felt like the fate went really well and I really wanted to see her again.

We spoke a lot through text afterwards too and I thought we were doing well.

Anyways, I asked for a second date and now she says she didn't really feel the ""click"" and the ""instant chemistry"" and that if we see each other again, it's not with the prospect to be in a relationship. She said that she found me a super cool guy and it's rare for her to find a guy she gets along with so well, that accepts that she has kids and with whom she can talk so relaxed to and literally told me ""it almost feels like I'm letting a chance pass with you because I went on another date and that was no relationship material either. He just didn't have your intellect and wit"" (her words)

She said that apart from a relationship, she would be happy to have an extra friend though.

I respectfully declined. I've been in the friendzone once in the past. Never again. I swore I would never allow myself to go through that bullshit again.

This is what I answered by text (translated)

""I appreciate your directness and I'll be honest with you too. I'm not looking for just friendship and I won't pretend I'm fine with being just friends. If we're destined to be just friends, I prefer to decline because being friends with someone I'm attracted to is self-inflicted emotional torture I have no desire for. I think it's better we just break contact. I wish you a happy life""

She replied she understands and that if she only encounters the wrong type of guys from now on, she'd keep my number for in case she seeks an honest, honorable man.

That last part kinda offends me. So basically, I'm her last option and I'm only good because others are scumbags? What am I a fucking Nice Guy? Either way, I'm done with her.

But the bottom line is: if you find yourself in the typical ""let's just be friends"" situation, think very carefully whether you're cool with that or if you're actually deluding yourself that she might change her mind. It's OK to reject being just friends. She doesn't owe you a relationship, you don't owe her friendship. She's not entitled to your friendship.

I could use some comforting words though... my confidence took a hit.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,883349,public,self,Proud of myself: I gracefully and respectfully rejected the friendzone,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofhxhz/proud_of_myself_i_gracefully_and_respectfully/,all_ads,6,,

I meet this girl 2 years ago, in a friends party, she had a boyfriend but flirted with me all night. This was new for me as im really shy and although some girls liked me it was never this type of girl, pretty and smart.

Fast forward 6 months and she broke up with her boyfriend and started dating me casually, she didn't want to have a relationship as she was just getting out of one.
So we keep this going on and off till the pandemic started. After that we lost all contact till we reconnected in November 2020, we dated till January were she told me she didnt want a relationship and clearly i wanted one. There were some stuff happening in the middle like she getting piss at her best friend for jealousy over me or me getting angry with her because she always changed the plans we have, but nevermind. That ended in January.

The thing is. In the 2 years i knew the girl she always had a friend, a pal that was way similar to her than me, and they spend a lot of time together. Much more time that she spended with me, although the guy was living in an other city so he wasn't around much. But I clearly could see she enjoyed being with him. Of course i asked her, not in a confrontational way, if she was involved in some way with him, as we weren't exclusive it would be Ok but I just wanted to know because it would be weird for me. She told me no, that she would never feel that way about the guy because its not her type nor she found it attractive, he was just a friend.

So on Sunday I hang out with a common friend of ours and she told me, this girl was dating the guy friend she told me not to worry about and that they were dating officially for some time now.

And the thing is, I just feel awful. My confidence is on the ground. She never wanted a relationship with me because she never saw me as dating material, what's so wrong about me? She lied about how she felt about his friend, why did she do that? Was she hooking up with him in this 2 years?  Our mutual friend also stated that the two of them are really close to each other, going to parties together, going on vacation together, basically they do all together.

I just i dont know, my confidence is really low right now and i dont see a way that in the years to come i look back and dont feel like i wasn't enough for her and that this doesnt hurt me.

I dated someone I met on tinder for about 3 months. It was quite obvious he wanted sex and I wanted a relationship so he strung me along for months hoping I’d cave in but I didn’t. During that time, we got intimate but we never had sex. I know that penetration sex isn’t important to me in a relationship but for him it was. I also had

He ended the dating because he couldn’t reciprocate my feelings for him but wanted to be friends not acquaintances. Basically he was sick of me and wanted to move on. A week later he called up up out of the blue to ask how I was doing, and then he called the next week. He thought he could get more matches but didn’t get a single one. I got a lot but didn’t feel like dating anyone. So he called me as an option. And I know this because I asked him and he just admitted it lmao.

We got along really well and I enjoy his company as a friend but I don’t enjoy him as a lover because he lead me on. We did a lot of outdoors stuff and physical activities which I miss doing with someone.

I remembered his birthday and sent him a message. He called me on his birthday and asked me how I was, chatted for 40mins and then asked if I wanted to see a movie with him.

She's doing her master's while I'm finishing my undergrad. We are the same age (22) and she may have been a little bit taller than me. 
I invited her to go on a walk before to start it off and I ended up asking her out for a picnic by the lake. I brought a bottle of wine and some snacks. I thought it went really well, we had some good conversations and many similar outlooks on life. This was also her first date that came out of a dating app. It lasted over three hours and we only really left because the sky was getting really dark. 
I walked her home and said I'd love to meet her again and she said that she very much would like to explore the city again (but not specifically saying with me).
I texted her the next day to tell her that I had felt really comfortable around her and would love to see her again if she felt the same way since I had a great time. She said that she had a great time and was glad that she went on the date. She said that I was super sweet and respectful. But in the end, said that she didn't know if we were compatible. 
I'm also a pretty skinny shorter guy and she's a thicker tall-ish girl. I'm wondering if this was due to a lack of sexual attraction perhaps because of my size and looks or if it has more to do with her being more successful in academics than I am and having a clearer path in life so far. 
I would rather not ask her because I don't want to make her uncomfortable and she really doesn't owe me anything. I respect her too much for this.

Here is a site that defines alot of the different methods(link in the comments because its not allowed in a post). I find this helpful because it adds a actual name to all the tactics people use. It makes it easier to spot because you don't have to ask yourself ""Is this really manipulation or am I just being too sensitive"" If its on that list, its not appropriate and should count as a glaring red flag. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I feel it is unhealthy to obsess over finding out who is trying to screw you over before they do it. Or who is a cheater before they cheat. You have to realize a very very unfortunate piece of information. Narcissists are really the only toxic individuals who can be easily spotted. Because their fragile ego controls them, they cannot mask for long and will usually throw up red flags from the get go.

&amp;#x200B;

however......

&amp;#x200B;

Sociopaths/psychopaths , and to a lesser extent borderlines(Their fear of abandonment can give them away, also they tend to show their intent by using ""what would you do if"" questions, because they use these questions to psychoanalyze you. They may also say ridiculous things to gauge you reaction, its another form of psychoanalyzing but at the end their insecurity usually gives them away) are basically near impossible to spot. I'm not saying throw caution to the wind. But the only way you will be able to tell if someone is actually one of the cluster B is to not trust anyone ever. Because these people are more patient then the media likes to give them credit for. These people can be everything you want in a partner for YEARS before the mask finally comes off. That is because they will not demask until they are certain you can't get away(or believe so anyway). 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a little quark about sociopaths and psychopaths that you have to realize. While other people have personalities based around likes, dislikes, passions, opinions, dreams. That is not the case for a these people. The only way they can feel happy is through successful manipulation of others, its about feeling in control to mitigate their trauma as a child where they had no control over what people did to them. And honestly most of it is benign(for lack of a better term) This is their group of ""friends"" and their social network. They will spend ridiculous amount of time perfecting exactly how to fly under the radar. They will know what gives away red flags, and know how to mask it. Most of the manipulation is what you can call ""Playing pretend"" in which they will try out different fake personalities and manipulations on random people. They will pretend to be rich, poor, passionate, depressed, a musician, a computer programmer, they may just practice lies they plan to later use to make sure they are confident that someone wont pick up on the lie. They use other people as their judges. Only when they feel like they can perfectly pull it off will they use it on an actual victim. Its kinda like the old saying about lions, if you can see them clearly they are not interested in you. Most psychopaths will play the long game. They may even have perfected the exact amount of time it takes to get a person to different levels of emotional dependence. They know how to steer conversations away from possible realizations without seeming like they are doing it at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

This may seem like a weird mental health rant that's misplaced in as dating sub. But I felt as though its important for people to realize that not even a trained therapist can spot a sociopath unless they record the sessions and review later. What I'm saying is to be able to be on their level you would have needed to have spent your entire life up to that point literally obsessing over how to manipulate people. It's like a musician trying to out math a computer engineer. My point is allowing paranoia around not being screwed over will likely not actually stop you from being taken advantage of. It will just worsen your own life by adding paranoia to it. It might actually make you more vulnerable to it, because its another insecurity they can use against you.

Just do you best to know about the different manipulations. And have self respect. Take care of your own mental health to reduce the ways a cluster B can control you and NEVER accept a person trying to isolate you from loved ones. But outside that, realize that its not a reflection on your worth as a person for being ""manipulate-able"" because literally everyone is. It's not your fault, you trusting in the goodness of humans isn't a flaw. Because most people are good people, and even the bad ones are usually only bad temporarily due to some event, very very few people fall into this category of predator . Many people feel guilt after being cheated on or otherwise abused, because they think ""How could i have not known?/How could I have let it happen?"" Well the answer is because the person targeting you put way more effort then you think into making sure you didn't know, and to make sure you believe the abuse is perfectly fine and you deserve it. You were just a good person who was victimized by a bad person. And now you know some of the more subtle red flags not covered by mainstream websites. It can be a way to add strength rather then a way to tear yourself down.

I’ve tried getting on dating apps and putting myself out there. However, I get next to zero matches, and when I do, I shoot them a message and they never respond.

I had my last serious relationship ending in February 2020, so I have been single for more than a year. **For context I live in Italy and I am a 24M.**

I had a few dates since, especially after the lock down restrictions eased up a bit. I will describe those quickly as I didn't get that many.

First girl was 19 yo that clearly suffered some mental disorder. She had serious problems with anxiety and took pill. I had only one date with her where we kissed. I was involved and I was blind to the cleat red flags: we were not a functional couple. As much as I liked her way of thinking and her personality, she was too much conditioned by her family and her mental issues. She ghosted me, but she obviously couldn't tell me straight that it was a mistake and that it was not working. Fair enough and I moved on.

Then I met a 26 yo a few months later. She was half Georgian half Russian. We went on a date. We had a wonderful time talking and never in my dating experience I found someone blasting me with so much compliments and appreciation. It was surely a nice stroke to my ego. She looked sensitive, intelligent, feminine and she seemed to have a traditional mindset. Unfortunately that night I wasn't feeling sure of kissing her: notwithstanding the talking and smiles, the eye contact was weak and her body language made it very clear that it wasn't appropriate to embrace her. So I left, telling her it would have been cool to take it slowly. After one week of planning a next date she tells me abruptly that she is in a bad period and that she doesn't want any relationship so she asks me out of the blue to be friends. I say no. She blocks me. So I delete all the chats, wipe her from my life and move on.

As of now I feel very insecure and a bit disappointed by the women I was meeting as it seemed as I was a magnet for disfunctional people and probably I myself wasn't behaving to the top and with clarity.

**So what is the problem you may ask?**

Well, I met this 20 yo Greek girl through some friends at a pub when we were watching a football match. She gave me her number and her Instagram. I must have impressed her with some of my cheesy humor and with my bare knowledge of the Greek alphabet. As of now I know her very little, but she seems like someone I would enjoy spending some time with. I asked her out but she was very sad to tell me that my proposal was very nice and interesting but she had an exam in two weeks and she needed some serious studying (she studies medicine). 

She asked me however to describe better what I study and what my career would be. I felt that was a little nosy and I thought that maybe she is very ambitious and she is looking for some rich successful partner. She is set for a brilliant successful career herself probably so I am honestly a bit afraid that this might create some tension in the immediate or worst in the future. If she will make it a priority from the very beginning, I will have to be honest and walk away. 

Regardless I don't know her yet so I am interested to see if we can actually develop some form of bond despite these differences. I have no expectations and no prejudice about it, I am genuinely thrilled to get to know each other better. 

I have kept the texting at a minimum because I have had so many bad experiences with texting lately that I just came to hate writing messages.

However I slipped out of my plan a bit when I send her a photo of a sunset I made at a place where I work out usually. She reciprocated a lot and she sent me a photo of her own. I felt that that was really cute and we wrote stuff like ""in person is much better"" and ""beauty is in the little things"". It is not Shakespeare but I liked that she was on the same wave.

Now 2 days have passed since this message and the road to the ""day after the exam"" is getting anything but steeper and tougher. I am honestly scared to send a stupid message and fuck up everything. But at the same time I want to keep the interest alive and set things for a date without coming out of the blue.

What can I do? Am I misinterpreting stuff as usual? Did I already make some big mistake already? Let me know down below.

We celebrated our 4 years earlier, and we were actually the only people we've ever dated. We had even managed to be together throughout the rough part of the pandemic this past year.

Around May, when things started to open up with all the vaccinations, she was able to meet her girl friends a lot more often for girls nights out, which she hadn't been able to do for most of the pandemic. Having just graduated from college this spring, it was reason for them to celebrate.

A lot of her friends have been telling her that she should have a ""hot girl summer"". I had no idea what that meant, so I kinda looked into it and saw that it was a trend promoting women to feel confident and get into shape for the summer and look good, feel good, and not care what anyone else thinks. I thought that was pretty cool, and figured that could apply to guys as well (hot boy summer?).

What shook me is that for a couple weeks after graduating in May, she started to be less talkative and eventually at the end of May, she told me she wanted to break up, because she needed to find herself. That one really hurt me, especially it being so unexpected after 4 years. She told me I was a good guy and that there was nothing wrong with me, but that she just needed to focus on herself a bit, and have a hot girl summer with her friends.

I didn't even have the words to respond, and she left. I just don't understand what having a hot girl summer has anything to do with your relationship status? Can't you be hot whether you're single or in a relationship?

Regardless, I didn't date again and rather focus on my career and building my future, as well as attending family events. Sometime in June, one of my buddies said he found her profile on a dating app (I think tinder?), and that confused me even more. She said she needed to find herself, yet she was apparently ready to date again? I assumed she just didn't want to date me. I spent the rest of the month feeling I needed to move on, I didn't want to make the same mistake as some of my friends that held onto their ex too long.

To my surprise, she reached out to me this weekend, saying how she missed me and that she really regrets leaving me. Obviously I still loved her, and I'll admit I took her back immediately. And now we seem to be back to what we were before May, we are together again. But now I just feel like I can't trust her, and I didn't even want to ask the real reason why she left. And she kept repeating ""You're the best guy I could ever have, I'll never leave you again"".

Should I be trusting her even after her actions?

TL;DR- My girlfriend dumped me in May to ""find herself"" and have a ""hot girl summer"" with her friends, but recently came back to me saying it was a mistake.

During late last year I was talking to a mate on the Xbox one night, this was when I first properly met, let's call her Mary. I had technically known Mary for years. I didn't actually ""know"" know her but she was in some of my classes and I knew of her from other people I knew. One of my lessons I actually sat next to her for the whole year! We never really talked before that evening she joined the Xbox voice chat. We played some games for a few hours and then my mate, who was the host of the Xbox party, went off for the evening because he was tired. It was probably around 11:00pm. Mary and I ended up staying up a bit later and talked for a while, we didn't even play anything. We both just stayed up an talked, it was nice and we did that a few weeks. We would wait all evening for everyone else to leave the voice chat until it was just us two and then we'd just chat till we couldn't anymore. 

We have shared a lot of stories and experiences, we have even cried together a few times. One thing that practically made our whole friendship was a game called 'Life is Strange' and without it we probably wouldn't be friends right now. We bonded so much over that game, it is her favourite game and I had a bit of money left on my Xbox card so I thought why not. I care about her a lot and I never started talking to her to try and gain a relationship with her. It started off as just being nice as Mary was a good friend with my other friend, little did I know she would become the most important person in my life that I have ever had. She has so much in common with me and we can talk for hours about anything and everything daily. It is always great fun when I'm around her. It honestly feels like I've known her for years. She was actually the one who said that and I completely agree. She has become such a huge part of my life and its only been around 7-8 months. 

She is the most beautiful girl I have ever met, on the outside and on the inside. All I want to do is spend all my time with her. She is constantly on my mind. I get an anxiety feeling in my stomach whenever I think of her and I always have butterflies when I'm around her. I don't want that to get in the way of our friendship but I can't help but think of her as this brilliant girl. Of course she has her flaws, everyone does but I don't care. All I want is to make her happy and be there for her when she needs me. Every text I get from her puts a huge smile on my face and every time I see her I explode with excitement and joy. I have had previous girlfriends, best friends and crushes before but nothing as intense as how I feel about Mary. I have never been in love before and I don't know what it feels like but I'm starting to get worried that I might be in love with her. I get so nervous around her, even when I'm on an Xbox party. I meet with her all the time. I thought that if I spend more time with her that I'd be less nervous but I can't help myself. All I want is to be with her and I hurts a lot sometimes. I don't know if maybe I'm being selfish or I'm just too young to understand love. But that's how I'm starting to feel. This was never supposed to happen I can't control my feelings and I just want them to go so I can enjoy my time with her more. I don't Know how to cope with this all in my head and I haven't told anyone how I feel due to the fear of people finding out in my personal life. I don't what Mary to ever find out but it eats me up inside and it has done for months. 

I really don't want to ruin our friendship. And I really don't want to tell her how I feel either. I feel like I can't and the thought of it makes me feel sick. She tells me all the time that I'm her best friend and that I'm very important to her. She tells me she doesn't know where she would be without me. So I know that she likes having me as her friend and wants me to be a part of her life. The worst part about this whole situation is that no matter what I do I can never have her in a romantic way. I can never have more than just a friendship with her and that part hurts me the most. I would want nothing more than to be with her as I have never felt this way for anybody. But I can't. Because Mary is a lesbian. My best friend is a lesbian. What do I do? How do I stop it from hurting? And how can I move on with her still as my best friend?

This is one of the primary reasons people have trouble with confidence around the oposite sex. Their self-perception is one of mediocrity and inferiority.

Aside from being needy, being boring is the biggest attraction killer. If you inherently believe you are just “normal”, then there’s no reason they won’t view you as being dull and will not be excited to be around you.

Normal is boring. Normal is what you should strive not to be— to be different from the status quo in society is crucial. Others might say you’re strange, you will gain more detractors, but this comes with the territory when you view things differently and are polarizing.

This isn’t an argument that everyone is born unique and special. That’s bull shit. Your actions alone are what make you unique.

Think of any ambition or experience you’ve had that makes you unique. For me, I always go to my love for writing and ambition to make it my full career. Even though at this time I haven’t reached any major benchmarks of success, I have an ambition that I am taking deliberate steps towards, and it supersedes almost all else in my life.

I also have unique work experience. I was an intelligence analyst for the government for several years. Although it didn’t make me rich, I learned a lot and was an interesting time of my life.

Focusing on bits and pieces of your life that you are proud of will allow you to truly believe and project that you are unique.

However, if you still feel you don’t have anything to offer, focus on developing yourself for YOU, not to impress the opposite sex. Attraction is an amazing benefit of being dynamic and interesting, but should not be the ultimate goal. Develop yourself until you achieve what you want, the rest will follow.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,883685,public,self,"Stop viewing yourself as ‘normal’.

But she talks so, so, so much it's destroying my ability to spend time with her. I want to address it but honestly don't know how to approach it.

Admittedly, some venting here, but also honestly seeking advice:

I realize this is a stereotypical complaint for men to make about women, but it's sometimes a very real frustration, and it's become a real issue for me in this instance. I enjoy this person's company most of the time, and we have very similar interests and values, and we have great chemistry overall... but 97% of the time, her talking. just. does. not. stop.

Every single inane detail of every single story or idea she has, she just has to express. She has no idea how to filter or summarize. It's extremely exhausting, hour after hour, to have to listen carefully to what she's saying, tangent after tangent, and try to find the relevant thing she's ultimately trying to convey.

I at first thought it was nervousness, but she's definitely comfortable around me by now, and also I've observed her interacting this way with others she's clearly comfortable with, too. In fact, the more comfortable she gets around me, the worse it seems to get.

I often have to really force myself into a conversation to say something. And when I do, she may or may not listen. Often she'll just say ""yeah"" and keep talking.

And she almost never asks me questions, but when she does, she has one of two responses:

1. She says ""yeah"" and keeps talking.
2. She will reflect on my answer to her question, but only as far as it compares to her answer to the same question. Then she just keeps talking.

I invited her over the other night. I made us dinner, then served us both ice cream after, and then made us some night time tea to share on the couch. She talked so much that I finished my dinner before she even took three bites, I finished my ice cream before she even touched hers, which eventually melted, and I steeped, cooled down, and finished my tea before she even took her first sip.

I know I'm painting her as very vapid and self-absorbed here, but she's actually a very kind, fun, pleasant person (although, yes, I do think some self-absorption is part of the problem). In later convos, she does recall things I've said, so I can tell she is in fact listening at least some of the time. And in our quieter and more intimate moments, we really do connect well, and she can be thoughtful and accommodating and approachable... in a way she just isn't the other 97% of the time.

But the relentless talking is crushing me otherwise.

My previous break up was a mutual, non messy one. It seemed a little doomed from the start and it didn't last long so it didn't take me too long to get over it. The biggest reason I have stayed single during this time was so I could take some time to self reflect and learn to be okay just being me. I got into my past relationship WAY too quickly because I was desperate at the time for emotional support and in the end felt like a waste of both of ours time. But I vowed I wouldn't do that again and so I completely cut relationships out of the question until I could sort myself out.

I have been to therapy, and have really gotten used to just being okay alone. And have probably been better mentally than I ever been. I still have my ups and downs, but that's normal. 

But now at this point of my life where I feel more ready, I am considering joining the dating pool again. I do miss romantic connection, but it now seems more intimidating than ever before.

I have admitted to myself as of recently that I am ace. I am biro ace, which means I view others romantically and not sexually. I do not want sex or anything to do with it.  Which will inevitably make this whole process a lot more tricky. It was one of the reasons my last relationship ended.

But I do not hate all physical contact and I'm not sex repulsed majorly. I like kissing, cuddling, making out even. Though I dont necessarily need those things. But when it reaches sex its where it crosses a line.

I would of course be very straight forward about this to anyone I would talk to that I am interested so they know what to expect before. And I have a feeling I will be friended/ghosted by many. And the idea of having someone I really like not get into a relationship because of sex over and over seems like is it going to make me tired. Since I'm in the ace mindset, I don't understand why people view sex as such an integral/important aspect of a relationship. But I know and understand most others do not think this way.

I suppose my question is how would you go about relationships in this context? Do I just not attempt relationships with people who are sexual? Is there even a chance someone who isn't ace would be interested? Is there a responsibility for me to meet someone in the middle who is sexual to accommodate for them since I'm not repulsed?

I tried text her a few times later to hang and the plans never went through. I just deleted her number and moved on. This was about 6 months ago.

I ran into her at grocery store. I was unemployed and living with my parents when we hooked up. When I ran into her she gave me a hug and asked what I was up to. I told her about my new job and where I moved etc. we talked for a minute or two and when I was walking away she said I should text her and she misses me or wanted to hang out or something along those lines. I told her I lost my contacts (not true, just deleted her number) and she said she’d text me. I knew she wouldn’t but I’m not taking it personally because she was a terrible planner/texter when we were hanging out.

I know she was probably just being nice, but I did find her number. I feel like I’ll always wonder what would happen if I didn’t text her. I mean she could’ve just not said to text her. But I also never want to be the guy who *just doesn’t get it*.

She was kinda not great to me when we did hookup, and does have some red flags, but we all do, and I feel like I can’t leave this book open. I don’t even know what my expectations are for her. Idk if I want the same things I wanted 6 months ago or somebody just to chill with on Friday nights.

Nothing bad happened between us. There’s no reason for her to have negative feelings towards me. I guess my biggest issue is, what’s the best case scenario? Best case scenario is honestly her not responding. Worst case scenario is that we hook up a few more times and I go through the same thing I did last time. I really doubt I’ll be able to go into this without any emotions towards her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,883801,public,self,I ran into a former hookup. She told me to text her.
