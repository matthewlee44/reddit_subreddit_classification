Due to time constraints on both of our ends we can rarely meet up so staying rooted together is our best option until we can make time to see each other.

This is something she has mentioned to me she is quite upset about and hasn't taken the time or energy to plan out when or how we will meet, and that she is leaving this decision to me. I told her I am ready when she is, as I already have everything in place. 

She has mentioned to me looking to break away from her routine to come over and unwind and relax. This has been something she has had concern for before until now she feels completely pent up and unable for us to make time to see each other. Saying her work is more important.

I completely resonate with these feelings and have mentioned if she wanted a quick afternoon escape we could make this happen. 

Her friend has mentioned wanting to get together, saying that she is also feeling unwell and under the weather, and to make time to visit would be something we both have an interest in doing.

Given our history she has shown a distinct interest in our relationship, and I personally would be open to exploring things. Whether that means online in an emotional aspect or in person (what I would lean towards).

How do I speak to her about inviting to my place? Considering the situation this is going to be an ongoing topic and I only want her to come if she plans on enjoying herself, any other reason would not be sufficient. 

How can I find a time suitable for her to visit, or should we wait and talk about things when we are both open to discussion?

Also, since the date, she's been pretty quiet and acting different around me in-person until I saw her last week, where she seemed a lot more normal and like herself. Also, a mutual friend asked her flat-out if she was interested in me (which I didn't really want, but whatever), and he said she felt emotionally unavailable.

We met eachother when we both were looking for sex (grindr) so I didn't expect much when we first started talking. He impressed me for being proper because he introduced himself before he came on to me. We didn't hook up, but instead just talked all night. We both felt that this connection is completely different than any other we've ever had. He has really impressed me with where his life is right now and I have the utrer most respect for him becsuse of it. He has goals and dreams of his future that are realistic and obtainable so I like where he's going into the future also. He's an extremely hard worker,  but doesn't let work prevent him from enjoying his life. He has full custody of a daughter (11) who is questioning if she is a trans man or not. He 100% supports whatever she feels is the right path to take, although he is concerned about her living life a trans man because he hates how our culture treats trans people. He's such a good daddy to his daughter, and I respect him so much for how he's raising her. To top it off, he's completely adorable, emotionally available, and 100% the type of guy that I've always imagined I've wanted to be with. Oh, and most importantly he loves 90's music the most.


For our first date I invited him over for dinner and cooked us steaks. It's cheaper than a restaurant, more intimate, and there's no awkwardness when it comes time to pay a check. This genius of a man turned on some Boyz II Men and asked me if I'd dance with him while I cooked. I started crying and he got confused about why, but then I explained to him how I've never been asked to dance by anyone before and I didn't know how. He didn't miss a beat and grabbed my hand with his big roughed up man hands pulled me closer, then proceeded to teach me to slow dance in the kitchen. It felt so good to have him in control with his hands on me leading me around. He told me I was beautiful then asked to kiss me when we were done dancing and I just melted in his arms. He actually asked instead of just doing it and making it feel awkward. It definitely wasn't forced. That meant so much to me because it made me really feel respected by him. The whole ordeal was the most romantic experience I've ever had in my life. The icebreaker of champions, I say. He's like the alpha of all the other alpha males.


We spend a lot of time with eachother, and I feel so wanted We're always as eager to see eachother as if it were the first date every moment we are together. I don't want to get ahead of myself and be let down by false expectations, but I feel that I've met the one that sticks around finally. I've thought about marriage before and I don't want to get married because I'm independent and I generally don't need a man. Surely not for money because I'm retired, and I've got a dog snuggle buddy. Not to mention I own my house. I don't need a man to screw up my life, and I feel that the chances of a trans woman getting married are extremely low anyway since we're so easily taken advantage of in that regard. That said, he said he likes my level of independence because I don't make him feel used like a lot of other women have. I do feel that this man could definitely make me rethink my stance on marriage would he ever ask me to marry him. I know it's cliché and all that jazz, but it really has been love at first sight. I need to learn more about him and only time will tell, but I would absolutely give myself to this man with no questions asked, and that scares me a little bit.


Tldr; I met a man I really like and our first date was extremely romantic because he asked me to dance. After dating for a bit, I'd change my stance of not getting married for this man.

Why can't guys ever just say ""I'm disappointed to hear this but wish you the best too"" and leave it at that? That's what I would say back. In all my past experiences where i've been the breakup-er the men have replied negatively or rudely.

This other guys has been traveling and out of town for almost a month and a half of what was our 2 month relationship (6 dates in total). He returned after 4 weeks at the end of July and we hung out twice but then he left again and wasn't due back until the end of August. Does anyone else seem to have this issue? TBH I feel like it's affected my wanting to have serious conversations with those i'm dating because all their responses (except with the guy I'm now exclusive with who seems to be a diamond in the rough) have been so mean.

So  I (27M) met this girl (21F) at work (she had bf of 6 years, but told me  relationship has gone to shit at that point)  and during couple of  months we started talking more and more. Long story short we started  flirting and sexing and about week after she told me she broke up with  him. Next couple of days we went on a dates after shift and had sex  every time. Week or so after our last ""date"" she became cold and told me  that this is just too much for her, and she isn't ready for anything  serious and is sorry for jerking me around. I gave her couple of days,  but when I reached out she told me that she needs to give her ex another  chance and went to trip both of them had planned together. We didn't  speak for some 10 days and out of the blue I got message that she is  thinking about me and wants to see me as soon as she get back from a  trip (she has broken up with him again). We flirted over text but then  she started asking ""serious"" question about compatibility and  relationships. I felt that that conversation was a bit heavy so I didnt  text for a day after which she invited me to her place. Once there she  said she doesn't want sex, but that she wants to take it in a ""proper  way"" and that we should just hang out and get to know each other first,  of course hour later we ha sex again. Everything was great for a few  days but then I noticed her getting cold at work, and she told me that  everything is so complicated and she doesn't know what to do and she  doesn't know if we should see each other any more.

Next  Monday she was all all but ignoring me on the work and indirectly told  me that she is back with her bf. I returned at kind and other than  greeting on the beginning on the day I didn't communicate with her. Now  she started looking at my direction, starting some small talk, even  touching my hand.

We started as friends getting to know each other but within the first few hang outs realized we liked each other more than friends and things got more flirtatious and physical. Well…. I freaked out thinking about how close we’d come in such a short period of time and when we met up on Monday I told him I didn’t think we could date each other based on an issue I saw in the future of a relationship with him (compatibility based). He was very disappointed because he had been hoping in that same conversation to make things official with me and I just completely caught him off guard. He thought we hadn’t had enough time to get to know each other well and the potential issue I brought up would only be realized after spending more time together. I asked if he had a friend he could talk to about this and he said he did. So I said I was open to hearing what his friend had to say, if he felt like sharing it, and I would leave the situation open-ended, and for now just wanted to meet up with him as friends in groups. We have mutual friends. I texted him this morning at 9am (Wednesday) and asked how he was doing and said I was checking in because I had left our last conversation uncomfortable and probably hurt his feelings and felt a little bad about it. It’s already been most of the day (3pm) and he hasn’t responded, even though he usually responds to my texts within an hour, even during work days. Also, one of our mutual friends texted me around 1pm and asked if he invited me to the beach because he’d invited her and a few other people and she wanted me to join them. I told her he’d mentioned it and I’d sent him a message but I was waiting to hear from him on logistics (he’d told me about this event on Sunday). So now I’m waiting on hearing 2 things. The beach thing and the “how he’s doing” thing. But it seems clear he’s ignored my message or maybe is taking extra time to think about a response for me. Maybe he’s changed his mind about my beach invite?? The suspense is killing me so I’m gonna type it out here. Also, is it reasonable to expect him to respond earlier? Just saying, “Hey I want to respond to you but I need more time to think about it” would be better than no response. When should I expect a response and when is an appropriate time to reach out again? I might just need to give him the benefit of the doubt that he’s having a busy workday. Or should I assume he hasn’t responded to me yet because he still needs to talk to his friend about the issue?

Following week I reach out about meeting up. They said they injured their back the day before me texting and would be resting when not at work. I was bummed and started to wonder if these were legit excuses or if they were trying to let me down easy. So I just said get well soon which is less enthused than usual and they followed up by asking about my get together with friends. I responded and they didn’t comment (guaranteed I didn’t ask any questions of them). So it’s been a week and I reached out and asked how was their injury. They haven’t responded in 24 hours which is atypical- they are usually slow but respond within several hours. They haven’t unmatched me online either.

Bit of a long read and also on mobile so apologies.
So I (25m) matched with this girl (26f) through OLD about 3 months ago and have been on around 6/7 dates (only 2 in the first 1.5 months as she then moved to my city) and we’ve been talking pretty consistently everyday, sometimes a lot of messages, sometimes only a few but nonetheless we’ve had pretty consistent communication. 
We both agreed after our first date that we were not looking for anything serious right away but we’re open to seeing what would happen and that we would be dating other people as well. So far so good. 
After going on a couple of dates we found that we had a lot in common, we share common music tastes, films, books, the same kind of humour, political views and general outlook on life. We also began to open up emotionally with her telling me about family issues and previous relationship troubles, her singing with me (she said she hates singing infront people), her introducing me to her sister through FaceTime  and troubles with anxiety for both of us. Physically we did progress  however due to several unforeseen events and a bad timing from a certainly monthly event we didn’t seal the deal until about 2 weeks ago. 
And this is where the problems start.

So what happened was we went on a date at the beginning of the week, both of us got trashed and had loads fun, lots kissing laughing and touching. When we finally got back to hers we got into bed cuddling at which point she told me that ‘I make her feel safe’ and just as I’m making a move she passed out. We wake up the next morning cuddling at which point she tells me that she loves spending time with me but isn’t looking for a relationship,I’m still unsure about what I want but tell her I feel the same and bring up our agreement from the first date. I get up to go to work and she’s all over me kissing and a talking about our next date which we agreed would be the following week. 
So then two days later she invites me over to watch a film in the evening before she travels back to her home town for the weekend, and we end up having sex and cuddling afterwards.

However, since then our communication has done a complete 180. She started to take a day or two to reply to me or just leave me on read. Normally with casual dating this would be normal but considering the way we were talking before the shift was noticeable and jarring, however I did organise a date for Monday just gone, which was only two hours as she had prior plans. 

So this is where it gets confusing. We enjoyed ourselves at the beach talking about deep and light subjects and about what we’d been up to since we last saw each other, she even shared with me something that only her sister and counsellor know about (a very grim and traumatic experience). We kissed and were close, sharing beach towels as blankets. When we left I asked her if something was up with her to which she replied that she was fine. However when she got back to hers she messaged asking ‘what did I mean by that’ and when I replied that it seemed like there was ‘something on her mind’ she said it was  interesting that I picked up on it because she thought she was hiding it well. I asked did she want to talk about it and she said ‘it’s not important at the moment’ and that ‘she’ll tell me at some point’. 
Cut to today when she finally replied to a message from yesterday I told her that we should talk about what’s on her mind to which she replies that ‘she really doesn’t want to’ and that it’s nothing to do with me and it’s ‘her own shit and she’s been feeling overwhelmed and talking with her sister about it’ to which I replied that if ‘doesn’t feel comfortable telling me then she shouldn’t.’ She thanked me, and wished her a happy weekend on her family getaway. So what’s a guy to do? 
I’m not going to lie, I feel like maybe something happened when we had sex, and whilst I’m not a sex god by any means I’ve never had any complaints or this happen where I’ve been dating someone and communication drops off after the first time in bed together. Quite a bit of a confidence killer. 

And whilst I’m very aware that I still don’t know her extremely well, I do not think she’s the type to play a game, at least not at this point into dating.
Since my last message I’ve decided to just wait until she gets back to me. My problem here is that I think I’ve caught feelings a little bit and need some advice as to whether to wait it out, or just cut the cord and end things on my terms. And honestly I guess I’m just confused as to what has happened

I'm working a temporary labor job before trying to find a better paying one in my field. Many of my friends and family express surprisal that I'm not seeing anyone and even encourage me to get out there while I'm young. 

I've never been very inclined to date, in high school I got asked out a couple of times by conventionally attractive girls but just couldn't find the desire to actually engage in an actual relationship with them. I don't think I had depression because I actively spent time with friends and had a good social life which I did feel motivated to maintain. Come college I didn't really pursue anything until my junior year where I had a brief thing with a girl I had become really fond of but that ended really badly.

A year later and I again still can't find the motivation to go out and find dates. I personally feel pretty content just trying to improve myself right now (saving money, investing, and hopefully finding better work) but am becoming a bit worried. I'm a virgin with no real long term dating experience which feels like it will come back to bite me if I ever do feel like trying to date.

I know some people would advise me to just do what I'm comfortable with and if a girl rejects me due to lack of experience that I was probably better off without her, but I'm beginning to think that might be a unrealistic mindset as lack of experience at my age or older may understandably be a red flag for many. Should I just bite the bullet and put myself out there so that it's not an issue later down the road?

I will go on my first date ever on Saturday. Saying that I'm nervous is quite an understatement.

I'm the good old 22 yo that never kissed a girl. I never went on a date with someone, either.

We are just getting a Coffee to talk a little. 

Now, the thing I'm worried about the most: My whole life I was really overweight (140 kg was my max). Last year, I got my shit together and lost 30 kg. While I feel way better and more confident now, I still have some self-esteem issues. Every time I look in the mirror, I just think ""What girl would like to date such an unfit and fat guy"". That is the hole reason I never went on a date before. I'm just extremely self-aware, in a bad sens.  

There is this one sentence I picked up a couple of years ago, and always have to think about: ""You can't love someone else if you can't love yourself"". Well, I have trouble loving myself. It's really, really hard.

I'm also not a very social guy. I have no problem whatsoever talking to people in a group, but being isolated in a conversation with just one other person that I never really met before freaks me out so much. What if I run out of stuff to talk about? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, does anyone have any advice on going on a date without feeling confident in your looks? And how could I keep up conversations and ask the right questions?

I went on a date with a colleague (we don’t work in the same function so not conflict of interest). We had this bet of drinking competition. Although I know I cannot match him, I drank so much. When we left the bar, I was very drunk. I cannot remember the details but he accompanied me home. I puked a little bit on bed. And then sometime in the early morning I got up to go to the washroom and noticed he is on my bed. I was definitely not sober and seduced him. Although he enjoyed it but we didn’t do it in the end. He got up to clean up and left.

I spent the next 24h to sober up and feeling extremely embarrassed. The part of puking, the part of seduction and the part I didn’t clean my place so it’s a mess when he was there. 

I texted him the next day saying I enjoyed the time together and apologized for drinking too much. He said it was all good and asked how rest of my weekend going. He said he went drinking the night after us so he was kinda vulnerable. After I replied to him saying let me know what he needs to make his hungover better, he left me on read for 3 days.

I feel like I cannot cope with this. I feel I ruined it because the date before me drunk was great. We still work together so eventually I’ll see him in the future. Should I just leave it now?

I would pick apart my entire existence to justify why so-and-so treated me like crap and/or didn’t want to commit. 
Eventually I hit an all time low, and began going to a counsellor. During a portion of our sessions, we talked about my dating history and mainly my last relationship. I wanted to understand why I allowed people to blatantly disrespect me and use me. Why did I feel extreme guilt when I finally put my foot down, and why hadn’t I done so sooner. Basically, their treatment of me was a direct reflection of how I felt about myself. Only then (did I realize) I was using dating as a way to reinforce the negative beliefs I had about myself. 

Since I’ve seen a million and two posts written by people who are in unsatisfactory situations, I wanted to say this: Admitting you want equal partnership with someone on your level (mentally, emotionally, financially, physically, spiritually etc) is NOT weak. Do not settle for non-committal, selfish, inconsiderate, immature, XYZ, BS. Own who you are and all of the positive qualities you have, do not let someone pull you down to their level. You are NOT asking for too much, trust me. Having standards (that can and will be deemed as too much by the wrong person) will protect YOU from low quality experiences. You cannot fit a square peg into a circle, if someone is incapable of being the person you require them to be then do yourself a favour and move on!

So I left it at that and we stopped talking for about a year or so. Yesterday she hits me up right…and I’m quite surprised. She calls me by an old nickname she used to use for me and said ‘I’ve found another person that says eegenvalues’. 

We chat for an hr or so. She’s replying quickly and seeing my messages.
