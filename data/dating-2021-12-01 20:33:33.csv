0,r6wm2b,1638412873,in a “situationship” with my guy best friend. should i clarify what’s going on between us or wait it out since it’s still early?,"i’ve had feelings for my guy best friend for several months now, but honestly have been attracted to him the entire 9 years we’ve been friends. over the past few months, things increasingly became flirty between us, we spent a lot more one on one time together, and i felt like something was building (but couldn’t be sure).

1 month ago, we were sitting in the car and we finally addressed the tension that’s been building. then he kissed me (!!). since then, we’ve been hanging out around once a week, texting occasionally, and hooking up (although not all the way). the physical chemistry is very much there

my only concern is that things are super undefined right now. i told him TWICE that i don’t want this to just be a hookup/FWB thing, and he said that’s not what this is to him. he said he felt like there was attraction building between us over the last few months, but also something more than that. he said that when we hangout, he feels like a more positive version of himself.

BUT- on the other hand, he also said he doesn’t have the time to commit to a full-blown relationship right now because of his schedule. i know, i know - typical guy excuse. the thing is, even BEFORE he made a move, he kind of went MIA from everyone because he was so stressed from work. me being best friends with him, i know that his schedule is an actual source of anxiety for him

however, i’m also getting stressed at how ambiguous the situation is. we said we would only hookup with each other, but i almost feel like i need confirmation that he’s emotionally involved in us. should i bring up another convo? stop the physical aspect of our relationship? feel it out for a while since it’s only been 1 month &amp; i already told him i didn’t want just a hookup &amp; trust him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6wm2b/in_a_situationship_with_my_guy_best_friend_should/
1,r6wokm,1638413067,why is online dating so flaky and garbage,"Recently i got back into dating apps and for some reason out of nowhere ive exploded with matches the past week to the point where it was getting hard to keep track of all the numbers and snaps i was adding.

Lo and behold everyone is fucking flaky and lame. Ive only had a good experience with one girl so far, we’ve been on two dates already. Every single other one shows a lot of enthusiasm and then stops talking to me after a day or two, will spend all day texting me and sending me voice messages only to ghost the next day, will enthusiastically agree to a date only to fall off the end of the earth after or *show interest in the date the day of including thirty fucking minutes before the agreed time only to ghost and stand me up anyways*.

4,r6wuas,1638413530,Pouring out my heart here,"First of all i have no hope that there is anything that anyone here could possibly say to fix my damaged none-existent and never had it ever existed love life, but i am procrastinating on studying for an exam so i may as well do this. I am (F30) grew up in a very conservative middle eastern environment. If i say i have rejected 1000 men in my life, believe me there is a good chance that number is an under estimate. First year of college my friends used to tell me that men are raining on me, i was crash of every boy i had ever known in school. But i could never picture myself with anyone. I always hear people saying there was an instant connection when we met, that is what i have never felt all my life with anyone!!!! Never ever! I did grow up watching a lot of romantic movies, and reading novels since i was probably 7 yo, i always dreamt of a great love; the kind of love that is grand and special that would make a love story. The closest thing i ever had to a relationship was with someone for 2 years, but right from the start i knew it was going to be temporary for me, never placed him in my heart where i could see him as “the one”. After 2yrs he purposed and of course i rejected him, but at the same time i was so emotionally attached to him that breaking up with him was so difficult i didn’t leave my bed and didn’t eat much for days. We eventually broke up gradually, as it was extremely difficult for me and i was all alone. He used to say you love me but you are not in love with me. And it was true. The diehard hopeless romantic person that i am didn’t ever succeed to feel truly and utterly in love. It is weighing on my heart so heavily. For me a romantic relationship never was or will be a part of life, it is life itself for me and without it life has no meaning. My career, everything else means nothing to me. And yet i could never find what i valued the most in life. It was easier when i was younger when i had my whole life in front of me, but it keeps getting harder day by day, it shatters my heart to think that i have to settle one day eventually!!! And i had to let go of that dream. I used to have more faith, that someone somewhere is made for me, but it these days it haunts me what if that is not true for everyone…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6wuas/pouring_out_my_heart_here/

6,r6x420,1638414319,Finally met someone who was attracted to me too and all he wanted was sex. Am I just destined to be alone?,"I (25F) am a virgin who has never been in a relationship. Up until this year, my only romantic experience consisted of a long string of unrequited crushes. None of them even found me attractive enough for a drunken kiss, let alone a date. Some of them liked me as a friend, but that was it. The only guys to ever show interest in me were the occasional creepy older man, and a Trump supporting classmate back in 2015. Then a couple of months ago I went on my first ever date with a guy from a dating app, but he rejected me the next day.

However, two weeks ago I met a guy in a club who I was extremely attracted to and thought was way out of my league. But by some miracle he was actually attracted to me too, and we ended up making out. It was the first time in my entire life that someone I found attractive had actually felt the same way, and I couldn’t believe it. He kept saying how gorgeous I am, how badly he wanted to fuck me and he couldn’t keep his hands off me. He even asked if I’d go home with him, but I didn’t feel comfortable doing that (I have nothing against one night stands for others, but I wouldn’t want my first time to happen that way) so I said no. It was one of the best nights of my life though and I was (and still am) in utter disbelief that it even happened. 

We texted for a few days after that, and we even arranged to go for drinks, but when I told him that I’m a virgin and although I’m not necessarily looking for a relationship I will need to take things a bit slower (I didn’t volunteer the information but it came up in context) he lost interest and ghosted me. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m no idiot. I was fully aware from the get go that a guy I met in a club who tried to take me home the night we met wasn’t exactly looking for a future wife. And I wanted to have sex with him too. I was just hoping we could go on a few dates first at least. Anyway I’ve been extremely upset ever since for two reasons. 1. This is the first time my attraction to someone has been reciprocated, yet it still didn’t work out and 2. Now that I’ve actually EXPERIENCED more than platonic physical affection and being desired by someone I desire too, I know firsthand how nice it is and I want it to happen again even more. But I just don’t think it ever will. I’m convinced that that guy being attracted to me was just a fluke and I can’t imagine it ever happening again.

Deep down I’m a huge hopeless romantic, and I really do want a serious and meaningful relationship, but I’m convinced that it will never happen. I don’t think the issue is my personality because I’m very outgoing, friendly, caring, attentive, have a wide range of interests and not to brag, but I’m smart and creative. I’m also no homebody: AI have a very active social life and go out regularly. So it’s not like I don’t get opportunities to meet people. I’ve come to the conclusion that the problem must be my appearance. I’m definitely not ugly, and in fact after doing a TON of work on my previously extremely low self-esteem, I actually think I’m quite pretty. But I’m just not that stunning bombshell that most men seem to want. I’m short (5’3”) but not short enough to be deemed “cute”, I’m skinny with small boobs, I have light brown skin, medium length jet black hair, very dark eyes, a Roman nose and a square shaped face. I definitely don’t fit the western beauty standard (or the beauty standard in any culture for that matter) by any means.

Basically, I’m scared that I’ll never get into a relationship, and I suspect that my appearance is the reason. If it took almost 26 years for a guy I was attracted to to be attracted to me back, I highly doubt it’ll ever happen again. And even he was only interested in me sexually, so what are the odds of me meeting a guy who I’m attracted to who actually wants to get to know me romantically? Probably zero.

Sigh. Maybe I should just sleep with this guy seeing as it’s probably the best I’ll ever get.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6x420/finally_met_someone_who_was_attracted_to_me_too/

I've been talking to this guy I've met on bumble for a month now. Our first date was on Sunday. We went to the movies and then we sat in his car for an hour and talked (nothing more I swear. ) after he hugged me goodbye and parted ways.

A couple mins later he texted me he had a good time and I said so did I. We texted for a while and Tuesday he said he wanted to hang out again. I agreed but once I got off work I canceled because I was honestly too tired. 

Today he asked if I was down to hang out at 5pm. I just got off work but I agreed because tbh I wanna see him. 6pm he texts back 'ok I'm almost done helping my little brother and then I'll be on my way' I said ""okay!! Can't wait😊"" but still thought it was weird he texted an hour later than our meet up time :/.

It's 7pm now and he texted ""I'm almost done I'm sorry!! Do you still wanna meet?"" I mean should I even meet him? Would I look stupid for agreeing 2 hours after our original meet time? I need help lol

I'm decently sure I'm not aromantic, but lately though my brain has been having these thoughts of not really seeing a reason to seek out love or relationships anymore. It's like I no longer see the point of love or relationships, like my hearts either grown cold to the idea of love and relationships, or I've just become suddenly apathetic to the idea. Almost like love and relationships have become some foreign concept I have trouble wrapping my brain around. I don't know if I'm even making sense, but it's bugging me.

12,r6xi4i,1638415488,Confused about not wanting to have sex yet,"I 24F am going out with this guy 31M for a month now.

Bit of background: my only long term relationship has been in University and my ex used to be physically and emotionally abusive. He would blame me for not having an orgasm through PIV sex and refused to go down on me/help me while constantly forcing me to do everything. He ended up cheating on me multiple times but wouldn't let me break up with him. Eventually I had to find a job in another country to escape that. 

Shortly afterwards I dated a guy for 3 months who was exactly the same about sex but atleast nicer about the whole thing. 

Anyways I concluded may be I wasn't attractive enough for guys caring about me during sex so I stopped doing it or even dating. 

Been 2 years since.

Present issue : this guy I'm seeing seems nice and interested in me as a person (met through mutual friends). I am really into him - I get tuned on when he touches/kisses me. But I am bit uncomfortable to have sex yet, because I feel insecure and somewhat afraid NGL. He has been testing my boundaries, trying to take it a bit further each time and I shoot him down. While he understands, it does anger and confuse me further (I understand may be he gets carried away by the heat of the moment?).

(I haven't really spoken to him about the past because I hate to discuss it.)

So the whole thing confuses me and I would like to sleep with him but idk I'll enjoy myself because of the insecurity. My question is how do I get over it? A book I can read maybe? 

(I just started seeing a therapist being financially more secure)

If they don’t open the car door for me or restaurant door, it’s a no.
If they wanna split the check or have me pay for it, then it’s a no.
If I drive a better car than them, it’s probably a no.
If they don’t dress at the same level I do, then no.

20,r6y0lx,1638417016,"Ladies, how long is too long?","Hi, I rarely post asking for advice but I find myself in a really interesting situation, I've never been in before. I (23M) knew my crush (20F) for a few years now. We worked in the same business together, and she dated my former best friend. He didn't appreciate her, and she ended up with someone new. During that time period, I developed a crush on her for a various amount of reasons. Her willingness to stick up for me when I was too introverted to do so, being up front and telling me when my former best friend had another person in their car talking shit about me pretty much all day, the way she was willing to quit weed for him just because she cared that much, wouldn't go to parties he didn't want her to go to because she cared, surprised him by paying for his food, always supported him at every event he has been at, and in the case of the new boyfriend let him work a show she wasn't even allowed to be at on Valentines Day just because she knew he loved wrestling. Before she went for the new boyfriend, I think I screwed up in typical not knowing how dating works fashion. We worked the same show and I let her know I was interested before but I wanted to give her time to get over her ex. At the show she told me her best friend was trying to get her with said boyfriend, but she didn't know yet. I don't know if that was supposed to be a sign that she was ready for me to shoot my shot or not, (possibly) but I being a complete dumbass said instead, ""I don't care if its me or him, I just want you to be happy because you deserve it, and I would like to know so I can move on accordingly."" Looking back I think that was a big mistake and I may have had a chance if I didn't say that. Obvously new boyfriend and her got together, and I tried my best to be okay with it but saw the signs I was losing my mind about it and eventually stopped all contact with her, because I didn't even trust myself around her anymore.

Fast forward to recent events, Its been a while since I talked to her, but she had been on my mind a lot still today. I've gone on vacations and still wouldn't get my mind off of her, but I kept it away from her to be mature about it. It didn't help that I got a playlist suggestion on Youtube that was literally about meeting the right person at the wrong time, and sometimes I think maybe that was the scenario then. I wanted to reach out to her and check up on how she's been, but needed a good reason to do so, so I decided to send her a happy anniversary message only to find out they aren't together anymore. She was at work so I'm still waiting to hear back details, and am trying to be there for her as a friend, but part of me also wants to let her know that I'm still interested in her after all this time. I've worked on myself alot over the time apart, and I know there is still more I could work on. I'm not gong to tell her immediately because that has always been a red flag to me going after someone as soon as you found out they weren't with someone anymore and especially if you just decided to reconnect with them out of the blue, no matter how much we knew each other in the past, and am going to focus on some of the things I need to better myself on still. But at the same time, I wanted to ask for advice on this situation because I feel like the last time, I waited too long to make a move.

All our other dates have been in restaurants/bars. We text daily (not all day, just in the evenings; we both have quite intense jobs). We haven’t talked about exclusivity but since things are going well I have stopped swiping on Hinge and I would presume he has too.

When we talk the conversation flows very easily (last night we were at the restaurant talking for four hours lol) but it’s more about work / movies / hobbies / getting to know each other  than “what do you want out of this”.

I am quite sure he wants LTR (given we have gone on several dates and only kissed on one of them — he is clearly not in this for sex). I only want LTR.

Privately, I only want to date someone who is interested in marriage in the next 3 years and children in the next ~5. Even though that’s pretty normal (I am 25F and he is 26M), I don’t know how to convey this without sounding like a psychopath!

I cut off every other girl, started looking at places for us, and even began talking to her about an engagement ( which we both started to discuss.) I got ready because I knew, it was always her. But I was just a little too late. When she told me she had been talking to someone, and she wasn’t in love with me anymore my heart sank. She suggested we see other people and see if we come back to each other.And it’s so weird because I felt it physically. And I’ve never had that before. Like I just fell through the sky. This woman is my soulmate, and I lost her.

At the end of the day I know I fucked up so I’m not looking for a lesson learned type of deal. I don’t I really know, just needed to get this off my chest. Any advice helps too. Thanks for reading",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6y9ic/1st_heartbreak/

I've had a successful 3 year relationship that ended mutually due to busy schedules (she also wanted to party). I've had a few woman pursue me, but they weren't ""the one.""

I'm currently recording an album and pursuing multiple goals, I'm an incredibly happy positive person. I feel like I have every box checked for being a desirable male, I'm healthy, in shape, have money, I do my best to ""put myself out there"" I'm just having trouble meeting a woman that I feel a deep connection with and she feels it back. I just want a wife..... :( any advice from females on where a guy like myself could go to meet a high quality female that values emotional and intellectual connection? I want to mention that I seem to connect with females 5-10 years older than me (late 20's and early 30's) even then I briefly dated a (28F) who ended things with me because, ""I had my life too well put together for her, and she didn't want to ruin me"".

I do not know what the reason behind this fear is, I get asked out a lot at work and before when I was at school too. My friends always try to set me up on dates with guys they know. I just never said yes or went out on a date because I am so scared.

35,r6yy4y,1638419902,Just a good ole vent.,"Excuse the vent and incoherence.

I don't know what I want anymore. I'm pretty much a late bloomer when it comes to dating, but I thought I had a good idea of what I want. I was previously not very open to anything casual because I know myself, I feel too much. But since finding a serious relationship has not been easy for me (due to not meeting people who want the same thing, or lack of effort in putting myself out there more because of self-confidence issues, among other reasons), I thought to give something casual a go just to have some affection and fun in my life. That's what I kind of have right now. I like it for the most part, and I'm actually surprised that I'm not having feelings for this guy, even though he checks a lot of my boxes. Being in this situation made me realize that right now I do just wanna have someone to have fun in bed with, and I might not be ready for something serious. If ever. I've always thought that I might be good girlfriend material because I'm caring, giving, and I just have a lot of love I've been wanting to give. But those things aren't enough, what do I even offer? Am I interesting enough? Smart enough? On top of my insecurities and overthinking, I'm also pretty needy, not great qualities to have with something casual. I want consistency. I want someone to have fun in bed with and have regular conversations with. I need to figure out what I want and adjust my expectations.

I apologize if this sounds... Depressing and annoying. This is what happens when you're lying in your room wondering why your casual guy has not texted you in hours. Ugh, I know, I know. Man, I need a new hobby.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6yy4y/just_a_good_ole_vent/

How do you contemplate moving on when you did something unforgivable to your ex? I fear that is the person I’ll always be and moving on with someone else isn’t possible. 

For context I was controlling and possessive in the relationship towards the end. I got really attached to my ex and started overthinking that he could be cheating but he wasn’t. He broke it off with me when I couldn’t stop being suspicious. 

Now I’m wondering if I’m a person who can even be in a relationship due to my past actions. Like maybe I’m supposed to be weeded out from the dating pool for being toxic and die off like some survival of the fittest type thing. Toxic people aren’t supposed to continue being toxic in other relationships and isn’t removing myself the best thing I could do? 

In the beginning I’m detached but once I start liking someone the unwanted thoughts creep in. I have to be reassured a lot and I’m clingy.

(please read the whole story),"Hi there, straight to the point: me and my crush knew each other through our mutual friend for about a month now, started to dm on instagram. We talked almost everyday and some times we would get flirty. Never told our true feelings though. She was super excited to talk to me and so was I, it was the best feeling ever. Recently, we went on a date (not really a date because we haven't confessed? plus there were two other friends) and I gave her flowers, she said it was the first time anyone gave her flowers and was super touched.

Then about 2 days later, we talked about our past sad experiences. anything to talk about. she mentioned about a past relationship which was about 7 months before she knew me. It was a very painful experience but she didn't told me the details of all the things that made her sad. I understood that maybe she wasn't comfortable enough yet to tell me all those things. A few minutes after that she said she was sad and told me she wanted to sleep. and so I let her.

The next day, we talked like usual but I could feel there was something off. The vibe just made me sad although there's nothing wrong. I didn't want to ask her why she was sad because she wasn't comfortable of telling me yet. She said it was just a random feeling and that she's feeling better today. But somehow I know there's something wrong and it just made me super sad. Fast forward to the night, our conversation became a little bit odd, I flirted with her for a bit and didn't received the same energy. made me extra extra sad and cried the whole night.   


Some time later, I knew about the thing that made her sad that night through my friend. He said that my crush was sad because she said she felt guilty to give me hope. She wasn't ready and still experience pain from the last relationship. She said she likes me, that I'm a nice guy and all and that she doesnt want to lose me, but she doesnt want to give me hope. Hence, that was why she was super sad and cried that night.   


After hearing that, I cried continuously for like a few days straight. I dont know why? because it's not like she doesnt want me, she's just not ready and she just needs time. But it felt so sad to the extent that everytime i see her face I felt so sad and I cant look at her pictures and all. I wanted to discuss about this with her but she's currently taking her finals and I dont want to distract her from her studies. All I can do now is cry and wait.

I told her I'm sorry to hear all that and that I always viewed her as a good friend even though this silence, she said to me that she appreciates hearing that now more than ever. So we decided to swap numbers and she even went as far as to tell me that I can text her whenever I want and if she is in the OR, she will even try to answer me then. I told her I can keep it at a texting level right now, she came back with ""I adore you"". She wasn't that hesitant to get involved with ""my life"" perse, not long after she got my number, she's starting to follow me now on snapchat.

The first time we text, I didn't get much because she was busy helping one of her daughters with a school project. The second time we text, we made small chit chat talking about high school. The third time we text happened to be Thanksgiving, basically I told her happy turkey day and that I was thankful we were able to reconnect and that I hope we can continue to keep in touch. She came back with ""Happy thanksgiving my friend! I'm so thankful that you are back in my life, you have always been so good to me and so supportive. I wish you an amazing day full of good food and wonderful people. &lt;3"".

So the last the last time we text, which was Monday, I found my yearbook and showed her what she said. She got a kick out of it and we made more chit chat, talked briefly about turkey day and she went on to tell me how she didn't have her kids for the holiday and just yogurt and granola.

56,r71602,1638427313,Do you guys believe in “the one that got away”.?,"I’ve been talking to this girl for about a month now. It’s been cool and relaxed. No dry texting from her or anything like that. We actually have some pretty good chemistry. Last week, I asked for her number because I just upgraded my phone recently. She was like, “why do you need it?👀”  I said some playful bs and she ended up giving it to me. I took about a day to text her because I needed to get my new phone. I texted her “See that wasn’t so hard was it?😁” because I thought that I was just teasing. She didn’t reply or even read it. My stupid ass did the unthinkable about double texted her with “What’s going on with you?” She left me on read. 

NOTE: I didn’t say that it was me in any of the texts. I forgot lol. I’ve beenD Ming her Instagram to talk to her so yeah. I think it’s three things. 1. She didn’t know that it was me. 2. She misinterpreted my first text and I kind left her on read on IG so she’s a little buthurt. Or 3. She is just flat out ghosting me for what ever reason. It just doesn’t make sense to me, because it was so sudden. I thought that I was just overthinking. 

Some people said to just call her or dm her on Instagram again. So I did the latter. She posted on her story and I saw it as an opportunity to start a lighthearted conversation. She did what she did before and not even open it. So imo, I think it’s over. I did what I could. I really wanted to hang out with her this weekend but I guess we’ll never know what could’ve been. At least I know that I tried, instead of wondering “what if” later on. Anyway, I’m wasting time contemplating on it.

62,r71x42,1638430123,She's moving on but I can't get over her,"So I (23M) broke up with this girl (25F) three weeks ago after an on and off 1 year relationship with a 1 year taking stage. There was a 1 year talking stage because among other things, she couldn't get past her ex and I grew too insecure to make her my gf. Things were pretty rough, it felt like a mentally abusive relationship. She refused to say we were dating even though we were spending relationship time and doing relationship things. She wouldnt even agree that we were talking at times, my self worth plummeted that year. A year went by and when she finally realized how she was messing up, she asked to be my girlfriend out of the blue in order to fix things in our relationship. Things did get better, but I had grown so hurt and insecure about relationships that I decided to prioritize myself. I couldnt leave her because I knew I still loved her but I certainly didnt treat her well for months (lots of invalidating, holding her to the past, making her feel like she wasnt a priority). I eventually started distancing myself from people because of how hard post-grad life was for me. I blamed her for a lot of things that were going on in my life while keeping my problems to myself. I called her at night three weeks ago and told her I needed to be alone and meet new people. This was my way of pushing her away so I could focus on myself. This past weekend I reached out to her because I was having regrets of breaking up with her the way I did. I had a deep talk with her and realized a lot of the issues that were happening that I was causing that I didn't see. Most of the stuff I mentioned earlier, including pushing family and friends away were something I hadnt realized I was doing. I soon realized she had not only moved on but she was asked out on a date to which she agreed to go on very recently (couple days). I realized all of the ways in which I was treating her wrong and I wish so bad that I could go back and fix them. I realized how much she meant to me and how I would give anything just to have her around. I apologized profusely for all the mistakes I made and encouraged her to rant. She eventually told me she wanted to see me and I rushed to see her. I thought things went well. We got food and talked about our memories. She told me she wished she was with me and not the new guy. We hugged a lot and told eachother how we missed eachother and even almost kissed.  In a complete change of attitude, the next day she calls me and makes me feel like I no longer deserved a chance with her and that she no longer wished to talk to me.  I tried so hard to reassure her that I wasn't a bad person and that she would understand because she was in a similar position last year. She told me she counldnt forgive me. Soon after deciding I was going to let her be I found out she lied about when she started talking to the new guy. She wasnt recently asked out on date as she had claimed. She was asked right after we broke things off. I found out her and the guy had gotten close and he even met her friends on her birthday party.  I was mad so I called her the evening after deciding we would no longer contact bc I felt like she owed me an apology for getting my hopes up when things werent how she made them seem to be. She got mad bc I gave her anxiety with how I texted her my message and told me she didnt have to tell me anything and that I ruined every hope of getting back together in the future. Im in a shitty position in life right now and I just need some advice on how to handle this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r71x42/shes_moving_on_but_i_cant_get_over_her/

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I reached out to her again and we began talking again, having a laugh and making our own inside jokes together. We generally really connect on a deeper level and I really do value that. She is amazing in so many ways and she truly is a wonderful person.

We met up and went for a night walk in a park near her, looked at the stars and had a good time with some deep conversation as well as talking and joking around in my car for 2 hours after!

I’m so happy to have met her, but, and I really feel awful about this - I just don’t feel attracted to her on a physical level. That is my perspective, I don’t mean to devalue or insult her, but I have questioned it over and over and I feel that I can’t move past this.

I’m 30F, he is 36M

Before he left my house he asked me…”so what do you like about me so far”

This after being together all day on Sunday [the date began Saturday 7pm at my house for dinner]) we were hugging and smooching and being flirty when he asked. It caught me off guard. I’m quite into him and I’ve sent the signals that I am. 

I chuckled and said that I like a lot about him but that I felt a little deer in headlights to give a specific answer. He chuckled said it’s fine and we moved on and we said our goodbyes. I texted him later what I like and he said it was nice to hear after waiting forever to get home and sent a heart emoji and told me what he likes about me and teased for not asking back (i just know it’s a not a super good question to ask). the text exchange seemed pretty joyful though. 

He was incredibly charming on the first date, we kissed within an hour of meeting. It was exciting but i thought for sure he is seeing other people. He took a week or two to get back to me on the dating app so it was already off to an unusual start.

He takes a long time to respond to texts usually (usually ~ two hours even if I respond to him right after he texts me) 

When we’re together I notice he is on or near his phone a lot. 

Also he seems to have an odd schedule. Which reminds me of myself making up my schedule to ppl I’m sidelining in dating- but he spends enough time with me on the weekend where I don’t feel sidelined.

I can’t tell where things are going but it feel relationshippy with mixed signals that aren’t apparent enough to ask about yet.

So why would he ask me this? Is he conceited? Actually interested in me? 

He asked me if he could buy a pair of prescription glasses for me so I have a more fashionable extra pair for me so that is also confusing. Like that’s kind of a committed purchase.

On our 3rd meet up he met a friend of mine and I out for dinner. I was confused about when we were meeting and he was being wish washy on the date time and plans so I asked him if we could reschedule. He said he understood but that he would love to join me on a night out. I asked if he would like to meet my friend and I to get dinner because I this point I made other plans. He at first asked if he would be a third wheel since my friend is a guy. I said no lol and that he is the main wheel. He paid for the dinner afterward which was quite the gesture my friend and I thought. And after the two of us went on our own date.

I was really caught off guard like I said about his question, mostly because of his confidence.

It’s been a whole year now and I still have feelings for him. I tried to push them away and see him for who he is. 

I’ve asked him to hang out a couple times but he always declines. (He’s a loner that doesn’t hang out with anyone) he always assures me it’s not me but the fact that he has his own issues. I think he may have some sort of trauma/ anxiety problem. I don’t mind that. 

Every time I try to be vulnerable he pushes me away but yesterday he asked “is it not hard to talk to me?” and I was stunned. He never talks about emotions and it took me a while to respond. I asked if he was rejecting me and he said he wasn’t. What does this mean? Should I keep trying? 

Some red flags 
- I always text first 
- Sometimes he just ignores me 
- He’s very hot and cold",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r74rqz/should_i_keep_trying/

I’m not a cute slight odd I’m genuinely odd and it’s one of those things that you cannot ignore unless you act like me. It’s like a level of weirdness I rarely meet that I just yearn for.

95,r7624q,1638446866,Where to go if your date doesn’t drink?,"

I am going on a second date ( first date was coffee date) our to dinner next weekend. ( a BYO restaurant, no bar or anything). Totally looking forward to it. 

Given our coffee date which was over an hour, I think we might want this date to go on longer than dinner. Usually when that happens we switch to the bar and continue talking or go to an actually bar, have some drinks, extend the night . The option is back to my place ( he’s coming down by me ) and I really like this dude and I am not ready for that.

Where does one go? Coffee places aren’t open all that late here anymore. The only thing open is bars. 

He doesn’t drink, but used to and stopped by choice. He recently went to his high school reunion at a bar. He enjoys 420, so he is not “clean” 

I’m a drinker ( not an alcoholic, but a drinker ) and I have always dated drinkers . This is new for me. Is a bar OK to suggest as just a venue that is still open so we can hang out an talk? Or does anyone else have any other suggestions ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7624q/where_to_go_if_your_date_doesnt_drink/
96,r763go,1638447004,Was asking a girl from workplace out a horrible mistake?,"She (31) suggested to go out with me (28) to a movie after knowing her for awhile now, it wasn’t much of a date, but something more casually. It went kinda good and we had a good time. 

I actually grew to like her (the more we spend time talking and running into each other) and made a bad judgment call. I asked her out and suggested I’ll take her to a nice restaurant I know or alternatively since she lives so close I could cook a dinner for her since I love cooking.

Apparently, it wasn’t a good call. She rejected both of my suggestions, and to make matters worse, she became slightly hostile.

She seem to avoid bumping into me in the office hallways, I suddenly don’t see her in the bus which we used to go back home together (we’re neighbourhoods), usually her texts with me are quite colourful, but when I suggested to grab food for lunch as always she replies with a single “no thanks”. She would come to me daily before that and ask “when do we grab some lunch??”. 

I don’t know what the hell, I didn’t suggest anything sinister.. she could just politely reject and still remain on good terms. 

Should I learn from that to never try to ask girl from workplace out ever again? How do I reverse it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r763go/was_asking_a_girl_from_workplace_out_a_horrible/
97,r7688z,1638447480,Should I just give up?,"So, I (26F) met this guy (30M) on OkCupid about a month and a half ago and we immediately hit it off. It was such great conversation and I really enjoyed chatting with him. He asked for my number about a week into talking and since then we’ve been texting each other. 

After about a week of exchanging text messages I said that we should meet in person. I am a single mom, so I told him that it’ll have to be a little later like around 9-10pm because I get off work at 6pm and I have to make sure my son is settle before I go out. He said that’s fine and we had agreed to set up a date around that time frame. The day comes around and I haven’t heard from him all day, so I text him if we’re still on. Crickets. Then I receive a message from him I think around 1am the next morning and he says that he had a family emergency — a death in the family. So, I’m like, of course take care of it. 

I give him some space about a week or so and I message to see if he’s alright and to also let him know that whenever he’s ready I would still be interested in furthering things. And he responds back and says that he’s still interested also. So, we try to set up something else again. Something simple this time like video chatting. The time comes around again and I ask him if he’s up. No response again until the morning. He said he had family issues. 

This has happened multiple times. We were supposed to meet up in person and he said that he spent too much money on fixing his truck. I told him I didn’t expect it him to pay for anything for me. Then we were supposed to video chat again and this time he responded back but said that he had a migraine and the bright lights are bothering him. I told him it’s fine, next time. 

I tried again to set up a time for video chatting. This time I told him the time when I got off work (I got off around 7pm because we were slammed and I didn’t have a chance to tell him sooner). So I told him around 9pm or 10pm would a good time to video chat. I hear nothing from him again. I stay up until around 11 and texted him that I can’t stay up any longer. Then I told him this: 

“So, I'm not trying to discredit you nor do I want for you to take this the wrong way but every time we try to set something there is something that comes up. I know I'm nothing more than a stranger right now, but I would like to see more effort. 

I'm not sure if you have too much going in your life right now and you're not ready? But I am ready and I want to be pursued. So just let me know.”

So, he says: 

“You know I'll take the blame for every other time that we set something up It was my fault I can handle that. I don't feel like that was the case last night. I am not blaming you I just think there was a breakdown in communication. I was just expecting us to chat a little sooner but I know things come up and life happens.

I show effort and a desire to want this to develop into a serious relationship. May not be how you like it but I won't be able to find out the way you want to be courted until we get to know each other better.”

So after that exchange I told him that I didn’t know that he wanted to video chat earlier and I was very busy at work that night. Since then I’ve got one text message from him hoping that my move went well. I told him how my move went and I haven’t heard back. He texted Tuesday night. 

Is he already married? 🙃 I feel like I’ve already put in so much effort. If it’s been a few days I text first to see how he is. Now, I’m not even gonna try anymore until I hear from him if it’s within a reasonable time frame.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7688z/should_i_just_give_up/
98,r76grt,1638448323,"I had to end things with this guy I dated for two months, and I’m scared he won’t ever reach out again even though we had a really strong connection.","I’m an au pair in Austria from the US and I met a guy on Tinder who lives in Vienna. Our first date was amazing and we had immediate chemistry… our senses of humor were similar, he was smart, mysterious, and attractive but in an unconventional way. We kissed on the first night and talked every second of every day afterwards. We couldn’t see each other much because he couldn’t drive, I lived almost an hour away, and we were both busy a lot. We went on about ten dates, but whenever we were together it felt natural and we got along really well and had a lot of fun together (we also had really good sexual chemistry). About a month in we both started being inconsistent with communication with each other, and since both of us are over thinkers, I think it definitely got into both of our heads. He also expressed to me that he was nervous about getting too deep into anything because I was leaving in less than a year. I felt myself becoming too reliant on having his attention even though he wasn’t willing to commit to a relationship, so I decided to cut things off. A couple days later I take a pregnancy test and it comes back positive, so we set up an abortion appointment, went together, and found out it was actually negative. This was after I had cut things off romantically so it was really uncomfortable between us the entire time and neither one of us knew how to act. Also not to mention the entire time he was carelessly snap chatting other girls in front of me, even though a week prior before I broke up with him he was still calling me his “baby” and all of that bullshit. Finally I told him that I was going home to the US early, and he said “well if you’re really leaving I’d like to see you at least one more time before you leave.” I took this whole situation to heart and I was really hurt with how he could be so insensitive so quickly after everything we had done together the past months. I assumed maybe it was just a coping mechanism because it was a pretty big blow to his ego. We planned to stay friends after that situation but the next day I was still so angry and hurt that I finally decided to text him and tell him how much that had hurt me and how insensitive that was. He tried calling the next couple of days but I never picked up or responded to any of his texts. This happened a month ago and I still want him to be in my life, even if we’re just friends. I don’t want that to be the last time we ever speak to each other because I really cared about him and I know he cared about me too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r76grt/i_had_to_end_things_with_this_guy_i_dated_for_two/
99,r76hrb,1638448424,Should I give him a chance when he just got out of a relationship?,"A guy matched with on a dating app 2 years ago has gotten back in touch with me. 
When we first matched, he continued to try organise to meet me but i just came to the conclusion I wasn’t ready to meet anyone due to just getting out of a relationship. Regrettably, I barely gave him the time of day and I feel terrible how I handled it. 

He actually messaged me one last time, that he met someone (the girl that ended up being his GF) and was going to pursue things with her but wanted to see if I was wanting to meet before he focused on getting to know her.
Keep in mind I did/do genuinely like this guy when we talked, I just didn’t want to get involved with someone so soon when I still hadn’t processed my relationship ending. 

A year went by, they broke up, it’s been about 7 months I think since they broke up. Now he’s been quite persistent on finally meeting. Even after I stated that I didn’t want to be a second option or rebound. He’s reassured me that’s definitely not the case. I do feel I need to give him a chance. So now we are finally planning on meeting, he took charge which is what I like, organised the place we will go for drinks and I’m going to meet him this weekend. 


Mix of emotions due to it being a slow burn but now I’m concerned that it will be the opposite situation? We JUST had a conversation about growth from past situations and he said he feels he has grown a lot this year and he’s still learning a lot and is still growing to get to a place where he wants to be??? 

Now I’m like I’m finally in a place where I’m happy with my life and ready to commit to someone. I feel maybe he could still be processing his relationship. Does this seem too soon for someone to want to actually commit again?
